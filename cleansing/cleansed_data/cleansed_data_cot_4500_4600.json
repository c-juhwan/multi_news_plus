        "summary": "Pakistani officials say dr. Shakil afridi was a bad egg who had been accused of sexual assault, harassment, theft, and more long before he was arrested for helping the us find osama bin laden. Officials showed reuters a 2002 document in which afridi was declared too corrupt for government service. \" keeping in view his extreme lust for money, i am ashamed to even call him a doctor, \" it reads. Officials say afridi was known to perform surgeries, even though he wasn't qualified to do so. The us considers afridi a hero, and is incensed that pakistan sentenced him to 33 years in prison for treason; reuters suggests that these new accusations will likely further weaken us-pakistan relations. \" available information showed afridi was a respected \" doctor, one us official says. \" we are aware of efforts … to denigrate his character. \" the row over afridi was one of the reasons the new head of pakistan's isi postponed a visit to washington this week, sources tell the washington post. Yesterday, afridi's family held a press conference, at which they urged the us to intervene on his behalf.",

        "summary": "When a person has a concussion, headaches, memory impairment, and loss of balance usually make the injury obvious. But there are \" many more people who are getting hit and getting hurt \" without much attention, cte researcher lee goldstein tells npr. His latest study puts a spotlight on them, providing what goldstein says is \" solid scientific evidence \" that hits to the head — even one — result in brain changes associated with cte, independent of concussion. Goldstein, together with an international team of researchers, examined the brains of four football players, aged 17 or 18, who died a day to four months after a head injury. Compared to the brains of similarly-aged athletes who didn't experience head trauma, all four showed brain changes \" including leaky blood vessels and abnormal buildups of the protein tau, \" which is associated with cte, reports cnn. The same changes were found in the brains of mice subjected to repeated and single-blast head trauma regardless of whether the mice experienced concussions, which could explain why 20 % of athletes diagnosed with cte had no record of concussion, goldstein tells cbs news. Chris nowinski of the concussion legacy foundation translates the results to the nfl, noting the average hit, after which a player appears to recover, \" probably wasn't fine, and that poor guy can't feel the damage that's happening in his brain. \" indeed, \" cte develops early, soon after injury. It doesn't take years, or decades, \" goldstein explains, adding the brain of one athlete studied already showed early-stage cte. He says the research should be carefully considered by parents before kids are allowed to play football and other sports where hits to the head occur.

The chain is offering a 16-ounce stainless steel tumbler — filled with a month's worth of drinks — for $ 65, consumerist reports. Owners of the tumbler can bring it into a store every day in january for a free grande-sized espresso-based beverage, whether it's a soy latte, skim half-caff cappuccino, or any other drink that suits your fancy. Normally, the tumbler goes for $ 75 by itself, but with the drinks package, it's worth $ 140, according to starbucks ' calculations. Brand eating notes that the chain has offered similar refill deals in the past, but only involving brewed coffee, never handcrafted beverages. So line up early: the deal is available friday only, and while supplies last. For those wanting to drop some serious change at starbucks, check out the priciest drink ever.",

Luxury retailers often sue to stop sales of alleged imitation products they believe cut into their own revenue streams and customer goodwill. \" this is not the kind of behavior people expect from a company like costco, and this case will shed a much needed light on this outrageous behavior, \" said jeffrey mitchell, a lawyer for tiffany. Mitchell also noted in the statement that tiffany maintains an \" aggressive and rigorous intellectual property program, and regularly takes actions against counterfeiters and infringers. \" a spokesman for costco was not immediately available. In november 2012, a person who was shopping at a costco in huntington beach, calif., complained to tiffany that she was disappointed to see costco offering for sale what were promoted on in-store"

In shanksville, pa., for instance, vice president mike pence gave a particularly personal tribute to those aboard flight 93. Here's a sampling of some of the related coverage on the anniversary: awaiting trial: the man called the \" architect \" of the 9/11 attacks, khalid sheikh mohammed, remains in guantanamo bay awaiting trial on terrorism charges. In fact, he's preparing for his 25th pre-trial hearing, reports the guardian, which explores why there's a decent chance he ' ll die in prison before his legal case is finally resolved. No remains: sixteen years later, thousands of people still have no remains of their loved ones lost in the attack, reports time. About 40 % of the 2,753 people killed at the world trade center haven't been able to be id'd, though dna testing of remains collected at the site continues to this day. The 1,641st victim was identified just last month. From the kids: when her father was killed in the world trade center's north tower, delaney colaio was just 3 years old. Today, she's working on a documentary about all those like her who lost parents in the attacks, a group that numbers more than 3,000, reports the new york times. The goal is to interview them all for we go higher. First responders: a memorial was being erected monday on long island that honors not only those killed in the attacks but the first responders and recovery workers who died of illnesses related to the search and rescue mission, reports the los angeles times. The story provides background on the scope of problems faced by those sickened from exposure to toxic smoke and the tricky problem of proving a link. In the classroom: noting that classrooms today are filled with kids born after the attacks took place, npr explores how schools are wrestling with how to teach them what happened on 9/11. Volatile accusation: a lawsuit on behalf of some victims ' families against the government of saudi arabia alleges that the saudis paid for a \" dry run \" of the hijackings two years in advance.

Police arrived at a park in downtown atlanta and evicted protesters just after midnight, making 53 arrests, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. Mayor kasim reed revoked a permit allowing protesters to stay in the park until nov. 7, saying he was upset about an unauthorized hip-hop concert that drew hundreds of people to the park over the weekend. The arrests in atlanta — in contrast to those in oakland — were relatively peaceful. And though organizers had urged occupiers to return to the park at 6am, the journal-constitution notes that it remained vacant at 7: 30am. More evictions seem likely as authorities in cities across the country lose patience with the protest camps, the ap reports. Officials cite noise and sanitation concerns, as well as the cost of policing protests. The mayor of providence is threatening to go to court within days to evict protesters, and philadelphia's managing director complains that occupy philly has failed to respond to a letter about health and safety concerns. \" they just can't ignore us indefinitely, \" he says. \" every day that they haven't addressed these public safety concerns simply increases the risk. \" click for more on the situation in oakland.",

( ap photo/darryl bush ) ( associated press ) without running water or working toilets, the crowded anti-wall street encampments across the country are not the most pleasant-smelling places to live. Nor are they quiet, with drumming and chanting echoing through the air at all hours of the night. That's why police and neighbors in some cities are starting to lose patience with the protesters, who are preparing to settle in for the winter months. In oakland, california, police in riot gear fired tear gas and bean bags before daybreak tuesday to disperse about 170 protesters who had been camping in front of city hall for the past two weeks, and 75 people were arrested. The mayor of providence, rhodes island, is threatening to go to court within days to evict demonstrators from a park. And businesses and residents near new york's zuccotti park, the unofficial headquarters of the movement that began in mid-september, are demanding something be done to discourage the hundreds of protesters from urinating in the street and making noise at all hours. \" a lot of tourists coming down from hotels are so disgusted and disappointed when they see this, \" said stacey tzortzatos, manager of"

Raymond fryberg, father of jaylen fryberg, was found guilty on tuesday on federal charges of illegally possessing six firearms, including the beretta px4 storm pistol his son took to school, nbc news reports. Fryberg is a member of the tulalip tribes, and prosecutors said he bought the guns in violation of a tribal domestic-violence protective order that wasn't entered into federal databases, the seattle times reports. Fryberg's lawyers said he wasn't aware of the order and thought he could buy guns legally, although in a 2012 court case, he admitted violating the order. The illegal guns were discovered after the oct. 24, 2014, shooting at marysville-pilchuck high school, and while the shooting wasn't part of the case against fryberg, his lawyer tells the times that it clouded the proceedings and made it \" difficult to stay on task. \" he accuses the government of \" piling on \" and says he plans to appeal the verdict. The times notes that investigators found unsecured firearms in the home after the shooting — and that relatives of the four teenage victims stayed silent in court when the verdict was announced but could be heard cheering after they left the room. Fryberg will be sentenced in january, the ap reports. ( fryberg's son texted his family moments before opening fire on his friends. )",

Hailey was charged with attempted murder in 2012 when three woman claimed she had stabbed a 4-month old baby during a fistfight, the ap reported in february. Hailey argued she was the victim and said one of the women injured the baby by knocking over its stroller in the fight. Awaiting trial at rikers, she was diagnosed with three personality disorders during \" a chaotic and sometimes violent stay, \" says gawker.

Toni anderson, 20, a student at university of missouri-kansas city, was last seen leaving the kansas city bar where she worked around 4am after telling coworkers she was going to a gas station. She never got there but sent a text to a friend 30 minutes later saying she had been pulled over by police, reports wdaf. Authorities initially said there was no record that anderson had been stopped, which raised fears that she had met someone impersonating an officer. Late tuesday, however, police said anderson had in fact been pulled over by a north kansas city officer, per kshb. Officers have offered no details about the traffic stop but say they are trying to determine where anderson went afterward. Anderson's cell phone hasn't been turned on since her disappearance, reports the kansas city star, and family members fear she may have been abducted. \" let her go. Let her be with us. Let her go have her wonderful life, \" anderson's mom tells wdaf, adding that it's not like her daughter to remain out of touch with family. \" she's social. You pretty much always know where she's at. \" anderson, a music blogger originally from wichita, is described as 5-foot-5 with blond hair and green eyes.

        "summary": "Nasa now has a spacecraft in orbit for a long-awaited look at ceres — and while researchers are learning a lot about the dwarf planet, they're now doubly puzzled by the planet's mysterious bright spots. As the dawn spacecraft closes in, scientists have realized there are multiple bright spots, and infrared imaging has revealed that while some of them are the same temperature as the surrounding area, at least one is much colder, nature reports. One theory is that the cold spot could be a watery \" cryovolcano, \" but a nasa researcher tells the new scientist that before deciding there's \" something strange going on, we have to be prudent and rule out the easy possibilities \" when dawn gets a little closer. Images from dawn have already revealed that ceres \" was not just an inert rock throughout its history, \" the mission's principal investigator says in a nasa press release. \" it was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions. We are beginning to capture that diversity in our color images. \" before ceres, dawn visited a smaller asteroid, vesta, the mission chief says, and for reasons that are unclear, ceres appears to have fewer large craters than vesta. Starting later this month, ceres is expected to yield more of its secrets as dawn zooms in. ( ceres is classed as the smallest dwarf planet and the largest asteroid — and, after water vapor was detected, as a possible host for life. )",

            "Not all of the puzzling bright spots on the dwarf planet ceres are alike. The closest-yet images of the gleams, taken from 45,000 kilometres away, show that at least two of the spots look different from one another when seen in infrared wavelengths. Nasa's hubble space telescope spied many of the bright spots years ago, but the observations from nasa's dawn spacecraft — which began looping around ceres on 6 march — are the first taken at close range. The images were released on 13 april in vienna at a meeting of the european geosciences union. Scientists say that the bright spots might be related to ice exposed at the bottom of impact craters or some type of active geological features. The areas glimmer tantalizingly in a new full-colour map of ceres that was obtained in february, but not released until the conference. The map uses false colours to tease out subtle differences on the otherwise dark surface of ceres. \"this is the first idea of what the surface looks like, \" said martin hoffmann, a dawn scientist from the max planck institute for solar system research in göttingen, germany. The dawn spacecraft's view of the bright regions is sharpening as it gets closer to ceres.

Mission scientists presented the latest results from the spacecraft at the european geosciences union general assembly in vienna, austria, today. Two spots on the surface, labelled feature one and feature five, show up in visible light images as very bright in comparison to the rest of ceres's dull grey, leading to speculation that they could be the sites of watery volcanoes on the dwarf planet, also known as cryovolcanoes. Now federico tosi, who works on dawn's visible and infrared spectrometer, has presented infrared images of the two spots, measuring their thermal properties. \" what we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image, \" he said at a press conference today.

In one such scene, murray basks \" in the glory of being bill murray \" as he \" dances defiantly and exuberantly with stone. \" tom long opens his review with this line: \" where to begin with aloha? begin by not going to the movie. \" the idea to squeeze a mad billionaire's plan for space domination into a romantic romp is not a good one, he writes at the detroit news: \" it's like adding dr. Evil to sleepless in seattle. \" the flick in general is \" mush \" filled with \" a splatter of random quirks, \" he says. \" apparently bill murray is not the cure for everything. \" over the ukuleles, steven rea hears \" the drip-drop of flop sweat. \" more than a few details in aloha are \" hard to swallow, \" including stone's character's supposed one-quarter hawaiian ancestry, he writes at the philadelphia inquirer. Stone also seems too young to be a fighter pilot carrying on a relationship with cooper's defense contractor. More importantly, though, \" for all the screwball patter, smart-aleck similes, and zingy one-liners that crowe has handed his mismatched cast, a kerplunking emptiness runs through aloha. \" but rene rodriguez at the miami herald appears to be a fan. Aloha is crowe's \" strangest movie to date... And in some ways, it is also his worst, \" he writes. But \" there are moments of such emotional honesty... That prove he can still turn cliched situations into moments of clear-eyed insight into the infuriating, heartbreaking vagaries of love. \" the flick may be an \" overstuffed \" mess, \" but messes can be fascinating, \" he continues. \" the doors to the aloha cult fan club are officially open. I ' ll take one ticket, please. \"",

The service dog was crossing the street with his owner, audrey stone, yesterday in brewster, ny, when a mini school bus came toward stone, who's legally blind, reports the journal news. Bigo literally leapt into action, flinging himself toward the vehicle to take the brunt of the impact, leaving fur on the front left wheel as proof of his feat. \" i don't know if [ the driver ] thought [ stone ] was going to move faster, but it looks like the dog tried to take most of the hit for her, \" paul schwartz, a local gas station manager who ran to the scene to help, tells the paper. The bus driver, who had two kindergartners on the bus ( they weren't injured ), told police he didn't see the two in the unpainted crosswalk; he received a summons for not yielding to a pedestrian. Bigo's leg was cut to the bone after he took the hit, says schwartz, but that didn't stop him from tending to the needs of 62-year-old stone — who suffered a fractured elbow, three broken ribs, and a broken ankle, brewster police chief john del gardo tells the journal news. \" there were 15 emts and people all around her and the dog didn't want to leave her side, \" schwartz says. \" she kept screaming, ' where's bigo? ' \" del gardo says stone was admitted to a hospital and her injuries are said to be non-life-threatening, reports the putnam county courier. The paper adds that bigo underwent emergency surgery, and a clinic spokesman says he's \" doing fine. \"",

I had to get involved, \" said grant from jackson memorial hospital. In a two-and-a-half-hour operation, doctors on tuesday implanted the west palm beach woman's kidney inside 28-year-old selina hodge. Hodge, a palm beach gardens resident, posted her request for the life-saving organ on craigslist in july. She received more than 800 responses from around the world, including the one from grant, just miles away. Hodge is recovering and could not be reached for comment. The operation took longer than anticipated because grant's kidney was larger than doctors expected, said grant. \"they had to move some of her organs around to make my kidney fit. The doctors said it was a complicated operation. But there were no complications. ( hodge ) is recovering well, \" said grant, a banquet server at bink's forest golf club in wellington. Grant said she expects to leave the hospital this weekend. Hodge's mother and sister have visited her following the operation. She has not spoken to the recipient of her kidney. \"it just amazes me that somebody would actually lay",
            "28-year-old selina hodge was spending nine hours a day on dialysis while she sat on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. Exhausted with the wait, hodge began to wonder if craigslist might be a quicker way to find a match, according to wptv in miami. Hodge posted her request in july and, after it received media attention, she soon heard from more than 800 people offering to donate. Finally, she met 23-year-old florida resident stephanie grant who agreed to donate her kidney to help hodge live a better life. On tuesday, doctors successfully performed a transplant and, according to wptv, both women are now doing just fine. According to the sun sentinel, the practice of looking for an organ donor on craigslist is perfectly legal and occasionally successful. A spokesperson for the united network for organ sharing told the paper that some doctors encourage patients to try finding their own organ donors, as the small supply of organs from recently deceased donors is given to those deemed most in need. On the other hand, living organ donors can give to whomever they like. After the transplant, hodge told miami tv station wpbf that she was overwhelmed by the response to her craigslist ad. \" i ' m so thankful, you know, letting me know there's still kind-hearted people out there in the world,"

            "By bill dipaolo palm beach post staff writer — resting comfortably after giving up her right kidney to a stranger, 23-year-old stephanie grant has no regrets. \"i had a gut instinct when i saw the request for a donor on television. I had to get involved, \" said grant from jackson memorial hospital. In a two-and-a-half-hour operation, doctors on tuesday implanted the west palm beach woman's kidney inside 28-year-old selina hodge. Hodge, a palm beach gardens resident, posted her request for the life-saving organ on craigslist in july. She received more than 800 responses from around the world, including the one from grant, just miles away. Hodge is recovering and could not be reached for comment. The operation took longer than anticipated because grant's kidney was larger than doctors expected, said grant. \"they had to move some of her organs around to make my kidney fit. The doctors said it was a complicated operation. But there were no complications. ( hodge ) is recovering well, \" said grant, a banquet server at bink's forest golf club in wellington. Grant said she expects to leave the hospital this weekend. Hodge's mother and sister have visited her following the operation. She has not spoken to the recipient of her kidney. \"it just amazes me that somebody would actually lay",
            "28-year-old selina hodge was spending nine hours a day on dialysis while she sat on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. Exhausted with the wait, hodge began to wonder if craigslist might be a quicker way to find a match, according to wptv in miami. Hodge posted her request in july and, after it received media attention, she soon heard from more than 800 people offering to donate. Finally, she met 23-year-old florida resident stephanie grant who agreed to donate her kidney to help hodge live a better life. On tuesday, doctors successfully performed a transplant and, according to wptv, both women are now doing just fine. According to the sun sentinel, the practice of looking for an organ donor on craigslist is perfectly legal and occasionally successful. A spokesperson for the united network for organ sharing told the paper that some doctors encourage patients to try finding their own organ donors, as the small supply of organs from recently deceased donors is given to those deemed most in need. On the other hand, living organ donors can give to whomever they like. After the transplant, hodge told miami tv station wpbf that she was overwhelmed by the response to her craigslist ad. \" i ' m so thankful, you know, letting me know there's still kind-hearted people out there in the world,"

        "summary": "Rep. Michael grimm's headline-grabbing threat to throw an ny1 reporter off a balcony and break him \" in half like a boy, \" is shining a spotlight on the new york republican's past outbursts and his fiery reputation. Perhaps the most talked about example: a 1999 incident in which he allegedly pulled a gun in a nightclub. According to a 2011 new yorker article, grimm, then an fbi agent, came into the club with a woman, only to be confronted by the woman's estranged husband. The three left, only to return later, with grimm holding a gun. An off-duty police officer describes grimm as \" carrying on like a madman \" and screaming \" i ' m gonna f --- ing kill him, \" which grimm denies: \" a guy with a gun who knows how to use it doesn't need to say anything, \" he said. Grimm left without incident, only to return yet again flanked by nypd officers and another fbi agent. The off-duty officer recalls grimm saying, \" everybody get up against the f --- ing wall, \" and then, in an apparent bid to find the husband he'd quarreled with, \" all the white people get out of here. \" other witnesses confirmed some details of the incident. Other confrontations that have come out of the woodwork: ny1 political director bob hardt says grimm erupted off-camera following a december 2012 interview, again due to questions about the campaign finance allegations around him. \" grimm became red-faced and started yelling … alluding to settling the issue by'taking it outside, ' \" hardt writes. Marin cogan at the national journal says grimm called to scream at her after a quote he gave her in march 2011 drew tea party backlash, saying he \" did not serve 10 years in the fbi \" to put up with this. \" at no time did i feel threatened, \" cogan writes, \" although that seemed pretty clearly to me to be what he was trying to accomplish. \"",

The post checks in on the battle for the richest of the rich, and it's a mitt romney vs. Barack obama affair. Thus far, romney is wooing more one-percenters, with at least 42 billionaires contributing to his campaign; obama has racked up 30 so far. Romney's most noteworthy supporters include redskins owner dan snyder and publisher sam zell; in obama's corner stand progressive insurance company chairman peter lewis and google's eric schmidt. Since big-money donors can give unlimited amounts to super pacs, the post predicts that a billionaire will, in this cycle, top the current giving record: the $ 24 million george soros spent in support of kerry in 2004. The post notes that newt gingrich had just four billionaire donors as of september ( his campaign was also $ 1 million in debt then ), and he's no doubt shopping for more. The times reports on the new frontrunner's mad hustle to rake in some dough before primary season kicks off in four weeks. Gingrich courted manhattanites yesterday, with a fundraiser at the union league club before engaging in private meetings with deep-pocket donors. His campaign says he has brought in $ 4 million in q4. Luckily, he ' ll be able to save in one area, notes his rep: \" we don't have to pay for consultants, we don't need speechwriters — the candidate knows what he's going to say. \"",

Mohsen amir aslani was arrested nearly a decade ago and was hanged last wednesday on charges of \" corruption on earth and heresy in religion, \" reports hrana. Iran wire quotes a source as saying amir aslani \" gave classes on reading and interpreting the koran, \" but that the classes \" did not meet the approval of the intelligence ministry, which is why he was arrested so suddenly. \" iran wire describes an erratic timeline: amir aslani was arrested in 2006 and given a four-year sentence, which was reduced to 28 months then changed to death. The death sentence was the result of new charges: amir aslani was originally arrested for his unorthodox take on the koran, \" but later he was accused of insulting prophet jonah and also faced accusations of having sex outside marriage, \" a source tells the international campaign for human rights in iran. Authorities alleged that he had extramarital sex with women who attended sessions, though his wife says no evidence of this was presented, the guardian reports. Iran wire describes the \" physical and mental torture \" he underwent in prison, via a source: he \" was repeatedly moved between the common ward and the quarantine ward to make him believe his execution was imminent.... He said that each time he was tortured by the fear of his own death. \" ( in neighboring iraq, isis blew up a shrine believed to be jonah's tomb earlier this year. )",

Npr's morning edition host addressed those criticisms thursday with red cross vp brad kieserman, but kieserman couldn't say what percentage of donations will go toward harvey relief. \" i don't think i know the answer to that any better than the chief fundraiser knows...

So i think if he [ were ] on this interview and you were asking how many relief vehicles in texas, i don't think he'd know the answer and i don't know the answer to the financial question, i ' m afraid. \" questions on high administrative costs reported on in the past led to a similar answer: \" it's not something i would have any visibility on. I can talk about what it costs to deliver certain relief services. \" he continued to say that, no, he \" really \" doesn't know what portion of donations goes to relief, though he did say that as of wednesday morning the arc had spent $ 50 million on harvey relief. \" we are committed... To using our resources and donor dollars in a way that best helps the people of texas, \" he said. \" the folks i work for are very, very attentive to cost effectiveness and cost efficiencies in making sure that as much as every dollar that we spend on an operation is client-facing. \" the organization's president and ceo, gail mcgovern, was on cbs news thursday defending the arc, and she said that on average, 91 cents of every dollar the red cross spends goes toward its services for victims.",

        "summary": "For more than 30 years, the case of marsha carter's murder has been a cold one, with all leads turning up empty and the bay area case eventually fading out of the papers. That changed last month with the arrest of a placer county man in connection with the death of the 25-year-old mom of four, the richmond standard reports. That man is 54-year-old sherill smothers, an ex-boyfriend who's now a quadriplegic after a drunk driver smashed into his car in 1988 — five years after carter's body was found in sacramento in the trunk of her own car. The daily beast explains how on the morning of dec. 7, 1983, three of carter's sons ( all 11 and under ) went into her bedroom to find nothing but a bloody mattress; they ran out of a house to get a neighbor, and when they all came back, they also found the only witness to what had transpired: their almost toddler-aged brother, frightened but safe under the bed. Carter's body was found 10 days later, but with no compelling evidence and a witness too young to talk about what had happened, the case died out. The standard notes, however, that sgt. Stina johanson wasn't ready to give up on the case, and she reopened it in 2008 and was eventually able to find enough to lead to smothers ' arrest. A rep for the richmond police is keeping mum on motive, noting only that carter and smothers \" were in a dating relationship. \" police believe carter was stabbed to death, per the east bay times. A secret grand jury hearing in august resulted in a decision to file murder charges against smothers. He was arrested sept. 14 but is now out on $ 1 million bail; the daily beast notes that would've been a small part of the $ 6.1 million he won in his suit against gm for the accident that paralyzed him.

            "Richmond — a 54-year-old man has been charged with murdering a mother of four inside her home more than 30 years ago. Sherill smothers was charged in the death of marsha carter, a 25-year-old richmond resident who was killed in december 1983. Five years after carter's death, smothers was struck by a drunk driver, rendering him a quadriplegic, court records show. Carter was likely stabbed to death in her santa clara street home; an oakland tribune article from 1983 says she vanished in the middle of a tuesday night, and that one of her children found a pool of blood in her bed the following morning. Her 1-year-old child was found unharmed but wide-eyed, underneath the bed, the tribune article says. About 10 days later, carter's body was found in the trunk of her 1975 mercury monarch, in the parking lot of a west sacramento hotel. Deputy district attorney chris walpole said new evidence surfaced connecting smothers to the killing, but he would not say what kind. He said richmond police recently started taking a look at old homicide cases and re-opened the investigation into carter's death. \"we don't let murders slip through the cracks if we can, \" walpole said. \"richmond police were diligent, thorough, went back to old cases, and now we're hoping this defendant",
            "The only possible witness to marsha carter's murder couldn't testify. He was too young to speak. On the the morning of dec. 7, 1983, 25-year-old marsha carter's three oldest sons woke without their mother.

            "Richmond — a 54-year-old man has been charged with murdering a mother of four inside her home more than 30 years ago. Sherill smothers was charged in the death of marsha carter, a 25-year-old richmond resident who was killed in december 1983. Five years after carter's death, smothers was struck by a drunk driver, rendering him a quadriplegic, court records show. Carter was likely stabbed to death in her santa clara street home; an oakland tribune article from 1983 says she vanished in the middle of a tuesday night, and that one of her children found a pool of blood in her bed the following morning. Her 1-year-old child was found unharmed but wide-eyed, underneath the bed, the tribune article says. About 10 days later, carter's body was found in the trunk of her 1975 mercury monarch, in the parking lot of a west sacramento hotel. Deputy district attorney chris walpole said new evidence surfaced connecting smothers to the killing, but he would not say what kind. He said richmond police recently started taking a look at old homicide cases and re-opened the investigation into carter's death. \"we don't let murders slip through the cracks if we can, \" walpole said. \"richmond police were diligent, thorough, went back to old cases, and now we're hoping this defendant",
            "The only possible witness to marsha carter's murder couldn't testify. He was too young to speak. On the the morning of dec. 7, 1983, 25-year-old marsha carter's three oldest sons woke without their mother. The boys, ages 10, 9, and 7, entered the single mother's room to find a pool of blood on the mattress and their 10-month-old brother cowering beneath the bed. There would be no sign of the young richmond, california, mother for another 10 days until her body turned up some 70 miles away, in the trunk of her own car in sacramento. Without a witness or even a suspect, the case faded away without a trace, just as marsha carter had that foggy december morning.

Putin famously keeps his family out of the spotlight, but the news agency says someone in the know identified 31-year-old katerina tikhonova as his daughter and as a \" major player \" in a niche sport: acrobatic rock and roll. Over the weekend, an official with the world rock ' n ' roll confederation confirmed the connection. \" yes, i know her, \" said manfred mohab. \" of course. \" asked a second time, he confirmed that she was putin's daughter. However, after reuters published the story on tuesday, mohab quickly backtracked. \" i can't confirm that i know the daughter of mr. Putin, \" he said. \" i have nothing to do with them. \" he blamed a loud venue and his own poor hearing for the purported misunderstanding during the interview. For reuters, who says the name tikhonova comes from the woman's grandmother, it's deja vu: two years ago, it quoted a banking official confirming the rumor of tikhonova's famous family, only to have the official backtrack when the story ran. Putin has another daughter, maria; both were born to lyudmila shkrebneva, whom he divorced in 2013, per us news and world report. So what is \" acrobatic rock and roll \"? the week points to this video, reportedly featuring tikhonova herself.",

According to the chicago tribune, plans for the vista tower, a luxury development that has already broken ground along the chicago river, got a last-minute modification when wind tunnel tests rendered the design of its three slender, inter-connected high-rises flawed. A zoning administrator wrote that the design would \" result in building occupants feeling ill and possibly afraid for their safety \" due to strong winds causing the building to literally sway. The solution? per curbed, an entire empty floor will be dedicated to stabilizing the tower by allowing wind to blow through it. A new design submitted by the developers that includes this blow-through floor was approved by the city. Though it will be chicago's first blow-through floor, this solution has been used in skyscrapers in cities like new york and dubai. But curbed reports that its function will be unique among the utility and design-related uses seen in buildings like new york's 432 park avenue, where five gaps double as mechanical floors that provide striking nighttime lighting. By law, vista's blow-through floor cannot be illuminated and will likely appear as a dark band. Along with relieving the vista tower's future hotel/condo dwellers of motion-sickness, other changes submitted in the building's plans include giving the glass exterior a bluish tone ( it was previously green ) and adding a few feet to the top of the tower, which will be the city's third highest skyscraper.

Because of hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades in the past month, it said, the website — the main channel for people seeking to buy insurance under president obama's health care law — is now working more than 90 percent of the time, up from 40 percent during some weeks in october. Jeffrey d. Zients, the obama adviser leading the website repair effort, said consumers were having a much better experience now than in early october.

That's because the canadian woman not only recently started responding to chemo for the first time — she also just won a $ 1.2 million lottery jackpot, the cbc reports. The mount pearl single mom was diagnosed with cancer in april 2016, but despite treatment, the disease spread to her hip and lungs, per the bbc. Bishop needed the money she made managing a convenience store, so she kept working through the discomfort. Her luck began to change last month, when good samaritans who heard about her plight started giving her money to help pay for experimental treatment. Then she decided to buy a $ 20 lottery ticket — and she and her two adult sons were shocked when she won. Meanwhile, her cancer has suddenly started shrinking, which had never happened with other treatments. She knows she still has a long road ahead, but \" no matter what happens to me, my boys will live financially in a better place … that is my miracle, \" she tells the western star. Bishop, who bought a therapeutic adjustable bed after finding out about her win, is also sharing some of her good luck with others: she's donating to a cancer nonprofit and to another patient with inoperable cancer, and with the extra hours she now has since she quit her job, she ' ll commit more time to lobbying the government on behalf of herself and other cancer patients. \" i ' m going to continue to fight, \" she tells the cbc. \" this money doesn't change anything. \" ( this canadian winner gave away his entire $ 40 million jackpot. )",

He faces up to 30 years in prison on the six counts ( along with $ 1.5 million in fines ) if he loses. The case hinges on two key questions, explains the raleigh news &amp; observer: whether donor payments to mistress rielle hunter and aide andrew young were meant to keep edwards ' 2008 campaign alive, and whether edwards knew about the payments. Business insider provides a look at key allegations in the indictment. The edwards camp argues that the money was used to keep the affair secret from the candidate's late wife, elizabeth, and had no political connections. The funds never went into campaign accounts but instead got funneled to hunter or andrews directly or through third parties.

Well, those shoes were by and large designed for men then \" adapted \" for women, footwear news reports. Or, as quartz quotes the industry term, \" shrink it and pink it. \" not any more. Adidas pureboost x is the result of three years of research on women's feet. According to wired, the company used technology typically employed by nasa and boeing to test the structural integrity of aircraft to see what happens to a woman's foot as she runs. What they found is that women's feet expand more than men's when they hit the ground, in addition to being higher at the arch and narrower at the heel. The shoe that resulted from those years of research seeks to be as flexible as a woman's foot, quartz reports. According to footwear news, the main innovation is a \" floating arch, \" created by detaching part of the body of the shoe from its sole. \" what this does is create a skin-like fit, \" an adidas senior director says. \"it allows your foot to have amazing, natural movement. \" wired reports adidas decided to focus on a shoe specifically for women after noticing more women than men had been signing up for its sponsored races in recent years. One expert thinks it's about time, telling wired \" it's unbelievable \" that it's taken this long for women to figure more prominently in the sportswear development process.

It's an ark, really — \" an ark in a freezer! \" as zach baron writes in a feature article for gq — comprising 10,000 samples that represent roughly 1,000 species and sub-species. It's something to hold onto as our planet loses everything from \" vital little soldiers like bees \" to the \" big charismatic mega-fauna like elephants. \" and what a sweet irony, if a man-made creation like a freezer of vials turns out to restore some of the man-made catastrophes of modern time, from over-hunting to pollution to climate change. Some of the animals in the frozen zoo still roam the earth, while others, like the hawaiian bird po ' ouli, are already extinct, and still more are inching ever closer toward extinction. Baron reports that the \" ark \" is part museum, to catalog the diversity of life on our planet, and part resource for those who need samples for research. But a third reason quietly lives on, too: reanimation, or the possibility therein. The technology already exists, for example, to clone. Technological advances suggest that there is at least the possibility to someday renew lost ecosystems. Some notable scientists call it \" rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic, \" as paul ehrlich told the washington post last year. Saving cells isn't, after all, saving species. Yet.

Diego is a galapagos giant tortoise who was given a very important task — he was chosen as the male dominant to repopulate his species on espanola island, which is part of the galapagos islands.

Diego the tortoise is quite the ladies ' man, and his exploits have helped save his species from extinction. Diego, a galapagos giant tortoise, has fathered an estimated 800 offspring, almost single-handedly rebuilding the species ' population on their native island, espanola, the southernmost in the galapagos archipelago. \" he's a very sexually active male reproducer. He's contributed enormously to repopulating the island, \" said washington tapia, a tortoise preservation specialist at galapagos national park. Diego is a chelonoidis hoodensis, a species found in the wild only on espanola. The island is one of the oldest in the galapagos, the pacific archipelago made famous by charles darwin's studies of its breathtaking biodiversity. Around 50 years ago, there were only two males and 12 females of diego's species alive on espanola, and they were too spread out to reproduce.

        "summary": "It's beginning to look like a concept called trf — or, time-restricted feeding — is going to be around for a while in the arena of diet and nutrition. The washington post has a feature on it, while the wall street journal and others have covered it previously. The idea is surprisingly simple but backed up by a growing body of research: it's not so much what you eat as when you eat. More specifically, trf suggests people should do all their eating in a 12-hour window, though research suggests they ' ll get more benefits if they can shrink that to, say, an eight-hour window. One of the lead researchers on the subject is satchin panda of the salk institute in san diego, who thinks that humans aren't built to handle 24-hour access to food and the constant grazing that often results. \" if you're eating all the time, it messes up that pattern, \" he says of our circadian rhythm. His first studies on mice showed a range of health benefits — weight loss, less diabetes, etc. — and follow-up studies on humans seem to support the concept. Another researcher, courtney peterson of the university of alabama, will report in a soon-to-be-published study that men diagnosed as pre-diabetic saw marked improvement after restricting their eating to between 8am and 2pm. Exactly how trf results in benefits remains a little unclear, but in broad strokes, the body seems to better metabolize calories this way. \" i think that within 10 years we will have some really clear guidelines for meal timing, \" says peterson. \" but we are in the early stages. \" other researchers are more cautious, with one noting that it's \" extraordinarily complex to actually nail this down. \" ( bad news on yo-yo dieting. )",

Not one host but two, 10 best picture nominations instead of five, two tributes to dead film luminaries and even an unexplained homage to the horror film, a genre that is very much alive.

In 3-d ) as with washington, there was some waste and abuse, notably the opening dance number — neil patrick harris and a troupe of las vegas-style dancers — that was meant to suggest opulent old-fashioned showbiz-as-usual, but mostly tested the clock. When the best picture award was announced, for \"the hurt locker, \" it was rushed and practically a postscript.

We are lauded and rewarded to death in popular culture and also everyday life, so much so that by the time it's oscar night, the whole world feels overly lauded, entirely too proud of itself. The show, which clocked in at a longer-than-usual 3 hours and 32 minutes, unfolded almost exactly as predicted awards-wise, so you're probably still trying to decide how to divvy up the cash pool by a high number of correct guessers for \" hurt locker, \" which won best picture.

        "summary": "San francisco's 58-story millennium tower has sunk 17 inches and tilted 14 inches to the northwest since building started in 2006, reports 60 minutes. It's a well-publicized fact thanks to numerous lawsuits from residents, including joe montana. Yet it makes the latest sign of its flaws no less \" breathtaking, \" per the san francisco chronicle. Footage aired sunday on 60 minutes shows numerous cracks in the skyscraper's basement, accompanied by stress gauges that measure their growth. Though curbed notes the tower passed a review of its seismic integrity in july, \" there's enough of them, a spiderweb of cracks, that you have [ to ] be concerned about what's going on underneath, \" says jerry dodson, an engineer and lawyer who owns a condo on the millennium tower's 42nd floor. Since developer millennium partners notified residents of the faults in 2016, some say they've moved out, selling their condos at losses in the millions; others are still waiting for a fix. The most likely one would involve securing the tower, built on a foundation 80 feet deep in sand, into bedrock, per the chronicle. But it's not clear who would hand over up to $ 150 million necessary for the fix. In addition to lawsuits from residents, millennium partners is currently involved in litigation with the nearby transbay terminal, which it blames for causing the land beneath the tower to sink. Transbay officials say the tower — which is sinking 1.5 to 2 inches per year, according to one estimate — had already sunk 10 inches before construction on the terminal began, per 60 minutes.",

Christopher leclair maintained his innocence even as a judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole on tuesday, describing the june 10, 2017, murder of 51-year-old karen leclair as the most calculated and sophisticated he's seen, per yourerie.com. Before finding leclair guilty of first-degree murder after less than two hours of deliberations in october, a jury heard prosecutors describe how the 49-year-old had plotted to kill his wife over a decade, ultimately shooting her in the head and tying her body to an anchor dropped off the couple's commercial fishing boat into lake erie, reports goerie.com. Per the ap, leclair's girlfriend had demanded he choose between the two women. Surveillance video showed the married couple setting out on the boat on june 10, with the husband returning alone. Despite evidence that leclair asked his father ( charged with one count of evidence tampering ) to get rid of a.38 caliber revolver, the defendant — who initially claimed his wife fell overboard — argued at trial that his wife shot herself amid her husband's ongoing affair. \" it's a ridiculous story, another one of his depraved lies, \" a prosecutor said, per yourerie.com. As the judge put it to leclair, \" the depravity and depths that you went to calculate this murder are unlike any this court has ever seen, \" goerie.com notes. Handed up to 17 additional years for abuse of a corpse, evidence tampering, and other crimes, leclair was also ordered to pay $ 705,974 in restitution to the us coast guard for the search for his wife's body, found a month after the murder by a boater near dunkirk, ny.",

Trucilla sentenced christopher leclair, 49, to serve the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole plus three years and nine months to 17 years for first-degree murder and other charges in karen leclair's death. Before issuing the sentence, trucilla contrasted 51-year-old karen leclair, the beloved family member and coworker, with her husband. Karen leclair worked to repair their marriage even while christopher leclair cheated on her and plotted to kill her, trucilla said."

Let us complete the history timeline for you: it was november 29, 1899, making morano — who's still watching the world go by from her home country of italy — the oldest person in the world, and the only one known to have been born in the 19th century, the bbc reports. Morano, who turned 117 on tuesday and lives in a one-room apartment in verbania, took over both of those titles in may, when american susannah mushatt jones died at the age of 116, per cbs news. Morano links her super-centenarian life to three major factors: genetics ( her mom lived to be 91, and at least two of her sisters approached or passed the 100 mark ); a diet that, for most of her life, included two raw eggs and one cooked egg daily; and ending what she says was an abusive marriage right after her infant son died in 1938. She never married again, telling the new york times in 2015 that \" i didn't want to be dominated by anyone. \" how she celebrated her special day tuesday: listening to a happy birthday message sent from italy's president, opening presents, and blowing out the three numbered candles that designated \" 117 \" on her cake, declaring, per cbs: \" i hope i don't have to cut it! \"",

As an hrw rep puts it, \" saudi-led cluster munition airstrikes have been hitting areas near villages, putting local people in danger.

Discovery reports the sun has been \" blasting away \" the planet's once-thick atmosphere for the past few billion years, a new finding scientists announced thursday. When a solar storm hit mars in march, nasa's maven spacecraft was in the perfect spot to watch as oxygen and carbon dioxide ions from the planet's atmosphere were thrown into space. \"we got this extreme event and wham! we knocked a bunch of atmosphere out of mars, \" one scientist tells discovery. According to the new york times, mars loses up to 10 pounds of atmosphere per second during solar storms, which occur a few times per year; the rest of the time, the air leaks away more slowly, at a rate of about half a pound per second, scientists say. Discovery reports the sun isn't the only reason mars ' atmosphere is being destroyed, but it may be the biggest. One member of the maven team tells the times the energy that hit the martian atmosphere in march was pretty much \" one large nuclear weapon per hour. \" according to smithsonian magazine, scientists believe most of mars ' atmosphere was lost in the first billion or so years of its existence when the sun was more active. Now the goal is to figure out if the planet had a life-supporting atmosphere long enough for life to actually form. As for the atmosphere mars still has left, scientists don't see it lasting more than about two billion years before the sun completely strips it away, discovery reports.

        "summary": "Baltimore's national aquarium says it will send its eight dolphins to \" the nation's first seaside dolphin sanctuary \" before the end of 2020 amid increasing pressure from animal activists. The animals will live out their lives in the outdoor facility, which has not been built, but will still be cared for by humans, reports the baltimore sun. The decision comes four years after dolphin shows ended at the aquarium, which draws 1.3 million visitors each year. Though dolphins have been kept at the site for 25 years, \" emerging science and consultation with experts have convinced us that dolphins do indeed thrive when they can form social groups, have opportunities to express natural behaviors, and live in a habitat as similar as possible to that for which nature so superbly designed them, \" ceo john racanelli writes in an op-ed. Racanelli says the move to \" an outdoor, seawater facility in a tropical year-round climate \" — probably in the florida keys or caribbean — is the right thing for the dolphins, who will have a larger living space and access to marine plants and fish. It isn't clear what the project will cost. \" there's no model anywhere, that we're aware of, for this, \" racanelli tells the ap, noting the animals will need to learn to deal with pollution and jellyfish, as only the oldest of the dolphins — aged 7 to 44 — has ever lived in the wild. \" we're pioneering here, and we know it's neither the easiest nor the cheapest option. \" humane society ceo wayne pacelle says the aquarium has \" done something terribly important \" in showing that facilities are making animals the priority, per the ap.

It's been a relatively nascent effort: kdlt quotes assistant us attorney jeff clapper as saying, \" before 2010, we didn't have any of these cases. Since then, we've had a steady diet of prosecution of sex trafficking cases. \" that's partially due to a change in the mindset of local law enforcement, with a sioux falls officer telling keloland.com that instead of going after prostitutes, the focus is on finding women who have been trafficked. By the ap's count, the feds in the last few years have gone after about 50 cases and secured life sentences on three occasions. Prosecutions have involved would-be customers ( a texas air traffic controller got 15 years for responding to an ad for sex with a 12-year-old at the sturgis motorcycle rally ) and the high-profile trafficker mohammed sharif alaboudi. In 2013, alaboudi received four life terms for operating what us attorney brendan johnson described as \" a house of horrors \" — a one-bedroom apartment where homeless or drug-addicted women were forced to have sex with strangers. So what's up in this otherwise sleepy state? \" i think traffickers see this as a trusting place and think,'they're never going to catch me, ' \" says the manager of a nonprofit that helps trafficked girls. \" well, we seem to be catching an awful lot of them. \" traffickers are also said to like the state's poor areas; the ap notes about half of the feds ' cases involved native american women. Now a coalition including police, federal prosecutors, tribal law enforcement, the junior league, and church groups is going after the problem. And a recent $ 750,000 grant has funded a shelter for trafficking victims, keloland.com reports.",

            "After a year in which almost everything went wrong for blackberry ltd., the smartphone maker emerged monday from a failed auction with a new ceo, new cash and, perhaps, a new lease on life. Investors punished the company after its largest shareholder, fairfax financial holdings ltd., abandoned its attempt to take over the business for $ 9 ( u.s. ) a share. The stock fell 16.4 per cent to $ 6.50 in trading on the nasdaq market in the united states.. Instead of proceeding with a buyout deal, fairfax and a group of unnamed investors – which sources say includes a middle eastern sovereign wealth fund – agreed to pump $ 1-billion into the smartphone maker, giving it more money to work with as it tries to arrest a downward spiral in sales and market share. Story continues below advertisement that move ended weeks of speculation that the conditional fairfax takeover, announced sept. 23, was falling apart. A second group, led by blackberry co-founder mike lazaridis and private equity firm cerberus capital management, came forward with a highly conditional takeover offer during a dramatic weekend of negotiations that also resulted in the departure of thorsten heins, who has been blackberry's chief executive officer since early 2012. Blackberry's board appointed technology executive john chen as interim ceo and executive chairman while it looks for a new leader. Mr. Chen rose from modest beginnings as a poor immigrant from china to become one of the most accomplished chinese-american executives, executing a successful turnaround of silicon valley database software firm sybase inc. Sources familiar with the negotiations say fairfax chairman and ceo prem watsa insisted on mr. Chen's appointment as",

Instead, it was a mountain lion at her family's campsite in eastern idaho, reports the rexburg standard journal. The big cat actually grabbed kelsi and tried to drag her away, but her parents and others in the group began yelling and moving toward the animal and scared it away. \" it didn't have a good hold so it put its paws on her to get a better grip, \" kelsi's mother, kera, tells east idaho news. Incredibly, kelsi was largely unharmed, save for scratches and some bite and claw marks. She had to receive antibiotics and rabies shots but is otherwise fine. The attack occurred about 9pm friday as kelsi and other kids were walking toward a stream. \" she thought a bike was coming at her, so she started running, \" says kera. The attack came hours after kera had told the family during dinner that she thought she had just spotted a big cat. A search turned up nothing. Such attacks are rare, but when they do occur, small children are usually the targets, explains a state press release. \" this family showed how vigilance and quick thinking can help avert a tragedy, \" it adds. Wildlife officials later killed a female mountain lion in the vicinity. ( a colorado mother can relate to kera butt's scare. )",

In this comedy about professional magicians and vegas high-rollers, there isn't a male cast member who doesn't have something absurdly tragic happening on top of his head. Star steve carell, as the preening stud illusionist of the title, sports a fetching siegfried-and-roy coif, while jim carrey, as his rival, goes trailer-park heavy-metal. Alan arkin appears to have had a tar pit shellacked to his scalp, and steve buscemi labors under what looks like a small terrier in mid-sneeze. Even james gandolfini, as a cheerfully crass casino magnate, wears a blond toupee that makes him look like the biggest hood ornament in town. The hair is funny, in part, because not much else is. \"burt wonderstone \" is a lazy, underwritten imitation will ferrell movie — an \"anchorman \" rip about a fatuous boob who gets humbled and becomes a sincere, slightly less fatuous boob in time for the end credits.

            "Credit: university of liverpool university of liverpool academics have discovered what may be the remains of a 4,500 year old ramp system to transport the huge alabaster blocks used in the construction of egypt's great pyramids. The ancient ramp was discovered at the site of hatnub by researchers from the university's department of archaeology, classics and egyptology ( ace ) and the french institute for oriental archaeology in cairo. Egyptologist, dr. Roland enmarch said: \" the hatnub quarries were the most prestigious source for egyptian alabaster, the milky white banded stone which was much beloved of egyptian civilisation. \" their importance today lies in the fact that they are archaeologically very well preserved. \" the quarry preserves large numbers of inscriptions left by ancient quarrying expeditions from 4500-4000 years ago. These enable us to better understand the personnel and logistics of organising expeditions to these desert quarry sites. \" equally remarkably",
            "The mystery of how, exactly, the pyramids were built may have come a step closer to being unravelled after a team of archaeologists made a chance discovery in an ancient egyptian quarry. Scientists researching ancient inscriptions happened upon a ramp with stairways and a series of what they believe to be postholes, which suggest that the job of hauling into place the huge blocks of stone used to build the monuments may have been completed more quickly than previously thought. While the theory that the ancient egyptians used ramps to move the stones has already been put forward, the structure found by the anglo-french team, which dated from about the period that the great pyramid of giza was built, is significantly steeper than was previously supposed possible. Archaeologists discover mysterious void deep within great pyramid of giza read more they believe the inclusion of the steps and the postholes either side of a rampway suggests the builders"

Wade prove that fetuses are, in fact, unborn babies and as such have human rights. \" i will not pretend there is nothing we can do to stop this, \" he said. \" all american citizens should be protected, \" and explained that many other presidents have defied supreme court rulings on the basis of their conscience, citing thomas jefferson and abraham lincoln. The issue of abortion is beginning to dominate conversations on the right because of the hoax being perpetrated on it by the center for medical progress. Such a focus should, in theory, help socially conservative candidates like huckabee, but likely republican primary voters are still -- for reasons that can't be fully explained -- overwhelmingly throwing their weight behind donald trump."
