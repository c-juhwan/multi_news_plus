        "summary": "Tom cruise and american made director doug liman are partly to blame for a plane crash that killed two pilots during filming in colombia, according to a lawsuit from the pilots ' families. The families blame cruise and liman for deciding to make a \" high-risk, action-packed motion picture \" and say their \" enthusiasm for multiple takes of lavish flying sequences added hours to every filming day and added days to the schedule, \" according to the lawsuit seen by the blast. American pilot alan purwin and colombian pilot carlos berl died when their twin-engine piper/smith aerostar 600 crashed in the colombian mountains on sept. 11, 2015. The families say that in an email, purwin called the movie \" the most dangerous project \" he had ever encountered. Cruise and liman aren't named as defendants in the lawsuit against the movie's producers, but the families say they were negligent in allowing a \" dangerous flight in a vintage aircraft across an unfamiliar mountain pass in bad weather, \" people reports. They say cruise, \" a well-qualified pilot very familiar with the aerostar and the routing, \" could have flown the plane himself. Berl's family is also suing surviving pilot jimmy lee garland, who was left without feeling in his lower body. American made, which stars cruise as a drug-smuggling former twa pilot, will be in theaters sept. 29.",

In order to regain full motion, patel's son has been told months of therapy will be necessary. The officer involved has been suspended, and police are investigating the use of force; the captain says both audio and video recordings are available, though they have not been made public.

        "summary": "Scientists have created the most comprehensive family tree of snakes to date, and the ancestor at the very top looked different than the snakes we know today in one noticeable way: it \" had tiny hind limbs, with complete ankles and toes, \" says a yale researcher in a post at eureka alert. The legs probably weren't at all useful in terms of getting around, however, he tells the new york times. They were more like \" remnants \" of hind legs. Another key finding: the researchers say this ancestral snake evolved on land, not water. They think it was slithering around the southern hemisphere about 128 million years ago, hunting soft-bodied prey in the forest by night, reports livescience. Unlike modern snakes such as boas or pythons, researchers don't think the first snake had the ability to constrict its prey or to eat anything bigger than its own head. But it swallowed its victims whole after snaring them with sharp little teeth, explains the washington post. The findings in the journal bmc evolutionary biology came from analyzing the bones and dna of 73 species of snakes and lizards. The first snakes were hunting in the age of dinosaurs, but researchers think snakes thrived after the massive dinosaur extinction for a simple reason: they \" were able to take advantage of the relatively empty landscape left behind by the dinosaurs, \" write the researchers in a blog post.

It happened early saturday morning at the west winnie campground on lake winnibigoshish in north central minnesota. The campground is operated by the u.s. Forest service and was temporarily closed following the wolf attack, reports cbs affiliate wcco in minneapolis. The gray wolf, also known as a timber wolf, was captured by trappers with the u.s. Department of agriculture. The wolf was shot and killed to permit testing for rabies at the university of minnesota veterinary diagnostic lab. According to col. Ken soring, enforcement director for the dnr, saturday's attack was freakish and unprecedented. \" our records do not reflect that we've had wolf attacks like this in minnesota, \" col. Soring said. The attack happened shortly after 4: 00 a.m. As noah graham was down by the beach and preparing to fall asleep outside a tent in the campground. He was there with a group of friends from his church on a weekend outing. That's when the 75-pound male grey wolf clamped its jaws onto his skull and wouldn't let go. Scott graham, noah '",

Gokce went viral in january after posting an instagram video of himself in sunglasses erotically preparing a steak and then pulling off his signature move: cocking his hand back and sprinkling salt down his forearm and off his elbow. \" the angle is important, \" gokce explains. \" also, it's important to have muscle. \" since blowing up online and inspiring thousands of tributes, gokce has salted meat for leonardo dicaprio and been featured on a shirt worn by rihanna, refinery 29 reports.

        "summary": "Hurricane florence unleashed torrential rain, dangerous wind gusts, and now a new environmental hazard in north carolina: the overflowing of its hog manure lagoons — and it's \" nasty, \" per the new york times. Many of north carolina's nearly 10 million pigs are located on large-scale farms in duplin and sampson counties, both hit hard by the hurricane. The north carolina pork council is insisting pig producers have learned from previous storms and that only two dozen or so hog lagoons ( some as large as olympic-size swimming pools, per quartz ) were impacted by florence, either via breaches caused by rain-induced erosion, overflow from too much rain, or \" inundation \" by floodwaters. But the state's department of environmental quality said that, as of tuesday at noon, more than 50 others were also close to spewing pig waste into the environment. Per the ncpc, the lagoons are designed to absorb close to two dozen inches of rain, but florence's rainfall was at that level, or close to it, in some places, notes the washington post. Npr notes the hog lagoons — holes in the ground where pig excrement is flushed, along with water and anaerobic bacteria — have long been the subject of \" intense political controversy, \" and research has indeed linked health issues to the farms. The hogs themselves were also affected by the storm, with the ap reporting about 5,500 of them were killed in north carolina after swollen rivers flooded nearby farms, per the state's department of agriculture. About 3.4 million turkeys and chickens also perished, and because dozens of poultry farms are now surrounded by floodwaters, feed deliveries may be stalled and more birds may die, one of the state's major poultry producers says.",

        "summary": "In a bittersweet landmark, european union leaders on sunday approved an agreement on britain's departure next year — the first time a member country will have left the 28-nation bloc. It took leaders a matter of minutes at a summit in brussels to endorse a withdrawal agreement that settles britain's divorce bill, protects the rights of uk and eu citizens hit by brexit, and keeps the irish border open. May insists her deal delivers on the things that matter most to pro-brexit voters — control of budgets, immigration policy, and laws — while retaining close ties to the uk's european neighbors. The agreement paves the way for britain's smooth departure from the bloc from the eu side, though the ap reports a bumpy ride still awaits in the uk, which is due to leave the eu at midnight brussels time on march 29. Dauntingly for may, the deal needs approval from britain's parliament, and she plans to spend the next couple of weeks selling it to politicians and the british public before the december vote. May is under intense pressure from pro-brexit and pro-eu british lawmakers, with large numbers on both sides of the debate threatening to vote the deal down when it comes to the house of commons. Brexiteers think it will leave the uk tied too closely to eu rules, while pro-europeans say it will erect new barriers between britain and the bloc — its neighbor and biggest trading partner. If those opposed succeed in voting it down, the bbc outlines what could happen next: \" no deal, an attempt to renegotiate, or a general election. \" but bloomberg notes eu leaders have already warned that renegotiation absolutely isn't an option.

But a new theory presented this week suggests that the space rock was a speedy comet, not a hulking asteroid as previously believed, reports the bbc. Dartmouth researchers came up with the theory after determining that the amount of sediment — specifically extraterrestrial iridium and osmium — that got thrown into the atmosphere at the time of the collision was less than is commonly believed. Then they factored in the size of the 120-mile-wide crater that the collision created in the yucatan peninsula. A massive, slow-moving asteroid didn't compute. \" so we said, ' how do we get something that has enough energy to generate that size of crater, but has much less rocky material? \" explains one of the dartmouth researchers. It had to have been something relatively small and fast. \" that brings us to comets. \" not all scientists are convinced just yet, however, notes the science recorder.

Many scientists consider a large and relatively slow moving asteroid to have been the likely culprit. Details were outlined at the 44th lunar and planetary science conference.

Using a comparison with another extraterrestrial element deposited in the impact - osmium - they were able to deduce that the collision deposited less debris than has previously been supposed.

So for the second part of their work, the researchers took the new figure and attempted to reconcile it with the known physical properties of the chicxulub impact.

The bad news: the flight back to the big apple could drag on for more than seven hours, making the overall trip longer. That's what researchers with the university of reading predict in a new study that examines the effect of climate change on the jet stream, phys.org reports. The high-altitude wind that blows west to east across the atlantic ocean is closely related to atmospheric temperatures, study lead paul williams says in a video. \" therefore, the winds are changing in response to the temperature changes. \" more specifically, the jet stream will become 15 % faster, according to the study published this month in environmental research letters. It all adds up for aircraft making the trip across the pond and back — some 600 flights daily. The bbc says the average time difference will be only \" a few minutes each way, \" but it's the cumulative effect that researchers are worried about — it amounts to an extra 2,000 hours a year in the air, adding about $ 22 million to fuel costs and increasing co2 emissions by 70 million kilograms. In 2013, williams led a study predicting that transatlantic flights would become bumpier thanks to climate change, making for uncomfortable flights or longer flights as pilots burn fuel trying to avoid turbulence. This new study looks only at transatlantic flights, meaning it's \" possible that flights elsewhere in the world will also suffer from a similar jet stream effect, \" says williams.

The head of libya's transitional national council, mustafa abdul-jalil, spoke to a crowd of thousands in tripoli last night, calling for the creation of a civil, democratic state, ap reports. \" no retribution, no taking matters into your own hands and no oppression. I hope that the revolution will not stumble because of any of these things, \" he said. Abdul-jalil, gadhafi's former justice minister, is one of the most widely respected rebel leaders, and insiders say he is struggling to keep the peace between islamic conservatives and more secular figures competing to form libya's new government.",

The corpus christi mother, who has been in prison since 2007, was released on $ 50,000 bond yesterday, more than two months after a texas appellate court threw out her life sentence for the murder of 4-year-old foster son andrew burd and ordered a new trial, abc news reports. The appellate court said the performance of her original defense team \" fell below a reasonable standard, \" the huffington post reports. Overton was convicted of poisoning andrew in 2006 with seasoning, with prosecutors painting her as an out-of-control mom who \" forced him to have 23 teaspoons of hot pepper and then watched him die in agony. \" overton's defense team contended that andrew may have wandered into the kitchen pantry and accidentally ingested the seasoning himself. Overton had been convicted based on not getting timely help for andrew. But overton and her husband had taken andrew to an urgent-care clinic, and a salt intoxication expert whose testimony wasn't used in the original trial said poisoning symptoms initially are mild and wouldn't have roused suspicion right away, the guardian reports. Several witnesses testified to overton's character at yesterday's hearing, kris tv notes, including a pastor who said overton went on mission trips to help kids in mexico, and a man who said overton had been \" the best caregiver he ever had \" for his disabled son. As overton awaits a new trial, she's just happy to spend time with her family. \" i know we ' ll make up for it, but i don't know what we ' ll be able to catch up for seven years, \" overton tells abc.

Goodwin, 70 — who was on death row until his sentence was changed to life upon appeal in 1981 — was granted parole wednesday and will leave everglades correctional institute in miami on may 2, reports the tallahassee democrat. Especially ecstatic is wanda pate, 82. Pate, whose daughter is married to goodwin's younger brother, began exchanging letters with goodwin several years after his incarceration. She later visited him in prison, where the two fell in love, though she hasn't seen him in six years. On jan. 23, 1977, goodwin was among a group smuggling marijuana onto a bay county beach; it was part of an fbi sting designed to nab a high-profile drug smuggler, and the agency used an informant to staff the operation. Goodwin was one of those recruits and was there when four witnesses came upon the group. One was immediately shot dead, while the three others, including two teen girls, were tied up and executed more than a hundred miles away, per the panama city news herald. Though he didn't pull the trigger, and wasn't near the scene of the later deaths, per wjhg, goodwin handed over the rope used to bind the victims. ( the prosecution alleged he also tied them up. ) goodwin was convicted of first-degree murder for aiding in the killings. Says pate: \" i know he didn't do [ the murders ] and that's the thing that kept me going with him. \" ( a chance rest-stop meeting led to a family's brutal murder. )",

Yet even with a growing base of new releases, low-priced \" singles \" works from up-and-coming authors and a sprawling library of free books out of copyright, the e-volumes are still missing characters such as holden caulfield, paul baumer, atticus finch and every witch and wizard in hogwarts. The association of american publishers and the book industry study group'ssurvey released in august found that e-books have grown from 0.6 % of the market in 2008 to 6.4 % in 2010. That looks like a small sliver, but it's a 1,274.1 % bump in publisher net sales revenue year over year. Overall e-book net revenue for 2010 climbed to $ 878 million as unit sales increased tenfold to 114 million. That growth is particularly present in adult fiction, where e-books are now 13.6 % of revenue.

It's a metaphor-laden tome that's inherently colombian as it grapples with the changing nature of colonial life, the railroad's reshaping of the physical and economic landscape, the thousand days war from 1899 to 1902, the struggle against iron-fisted corporate agriculture, the military massacre of striking workers and the ultimate destruction of the whole fragile enterprise.

            "New york ( mainstreet ) -- e-books may be the publishing medium of the future, but they're already leaving a bit of literary history behind. The announcement ofnew ipad and the continued growth ofkindle products, thenook line of e-readers andandroid-based tablets in general are giving e-books library of congress-sized platforms for expansion. Yet even with a growing base of new releases, low-priced \" singles \" works from up-and-coming authors and a sprawling library of free books out of copyright, the e-volumes are still missing characters such as holden caulfield, paul baumer, atticus finch and every witch and wizard in hogwarts. The association of american publishers and the book industry study group'ssurvey released in august found that e-books have grown from 0.6 % of the market in 2008 to 6.4 % in 2010. That looks like a small sliver, but it's a 1,274.1 % bump in publisher net sales revenue year over year. Overall e-book net revenue for 2010 climbed to $ 878 million as unit sales increased tenfold to 114 million. That growth is particularly present in adult fiction, where e-books are now 13.6 % of revenue. That also doesn't include the 4.4 million public domain e-books -- which include just about everything published before 1923 -- downloaded from project gutenberg within the past 30 days. E-books ' overall unit share was still only 14 % of",
            "Marquez's 1967 story following the lives of seven generations of the buendia family during a period of tremendous upheaval in the town of macondo, colombia, isn't absent from the e-book ranks by any means. It's just only available in the original spanish as it makes sense. It's a metaphor-laden tome that's inherently colombian as it grapples with the changing nature of colonial life, the railroad's reshaping of the physical and economic landscape, the thousand days war from 1899 to 1902, the struggle against iron-fisted corporate agriculture, the military massacre of striking workers and the ultimate destruction of the whole fragile enterprise. That story was told in spanish and is best interpreted in spanish. We're also aware that many americans who came to love marquez through this book, and others did so through english translations of those works. Those translations come at a cost and author and translator are owed for their efforts.

Un authorities have confirmed the news, diplomats tell the bbc. The agreement allows the country to continue enriching uranium to 5 %. As for the other side of the deal, \" the sanctions iceberg against iran is melting, \" says iran's nuclear head. Assuming the eu is satisfied with the enrichment cuts, iran should today be allowed to restart petrochemical exports as well as trade in gold, meaning billions of dollars for its economy, the bbc notes. Under the deal, iran is also required to convert half of its existing 20 % enriched uranium to oxide; the other half must be diluted to 5 % enrichment, cbs news reports. In exchange for the dilution, iran will gain access to some of its frozen foreign assets worth as much as $ 4.2 billion, the new york times reports.",

            "Tehran -- iran halted its most sensitive uranium enrichment work on monday as part of a landmark deal struck with world powers, easing concerns over the country's nuclear program and clearing the way for a partial lifting of sanctions, tehran and the u.n. Said. An iranian state tv broadcast said authorities halted enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, just steps away from bomb-making materials, by disconnecting the cascades of centrifuges enriching uranium in natanz. \" production of 20 percent enriched uranium has been halted by cutting the links feeding cascades in this facility, \" it said. A report by the international atomic energy agency, the u.n. Nuclear agency, confirmed that the centrifuges were disconnected. The broadcast said international inspectors were present monday when iran began implementing its obligations under the historic deal reached in geneva nov. 24. They left to monitor the suspension at fordo, another uranium enrichment site in central iran. The united states will begin easing economic sanctions on iran as a result of latter country's halting of its nuclear work. The white house, which has vowed to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons, hailed iran's actions as \" an important step forward. \" \" these actions represent the first time in nearly a decade that iran has verifiably enacted measures to halt progress on its nuclear program, and roll it back in key",
            "The first orchestrated rollback in western antinuclear economic sanctions against iran took effect on monday under tehran's temporary agreement with world powers, as all sides reported that the steps initially promised had been fulfilled. Under the temporary agreement, iran began suspending most advanced uranium-fuel enrichment and halted other sensitive elements of its nuclear program. In exchange, it received what the united states called \"limited, targeted and reversible sanctions relief for a six-month period. \" the agreement, known in diplomatic language as the joint plan of action, expires on july 20 and was intended to give iran and the so-called p5-plus-1 powers, which are the five permanent members of the united nations security council — britain, china, france, russia and the united states — plus germany, more time to negotiate a permanent accord. The goal is to resolve peacefully the longstanding dispute over iran's nuclear energy program, which iran has called peaceful and legal but the western countries and israel have described as a guise to achieve the ability to produce nuclear weapons. The international atomic energy agency, the nuclear monitor of the united nations, said its inspectors in iran confirmed that iranian officials had complied with their commitments: suspending the production of 20 percent-enriched uranium, which is a few technical steps short of weapons grade; disabling thousands of centrifuges used to make that fuel;"

        "summary": "Against all odds, the story of a dog stuck on the median of a california freeway for weeks got a happy ending last weekend. Buzzfeed reports someone called the galt police department april 10 after seeing a german shepherd fall off the back of a pickup truck on highway 99 south of sacramento. In the coming weeks, the police department received dozens of calls about the dog, but officers were never able to find her, according to kcra. Finally after yet another call saturday morning, police and the california highway patrol shut the highway down and rescued the frightened dog, whom they dubbed freeway frida. \" those big brown eyes were looking up at us like 'please help me, ' \" officer sylvia coelho tells fox 40. Freeway frida was drastically underweight and had a broken leg when she was brought to a local animal hospital. The veterinarian was surprised the dog managed to survive for five weeks while trapped on a freeway median without an obvious source of food or water. Fortunately, freeway frida appears to be recovering from her ordeal. She's lacking a microchip and tags, so police are hoping her owner comes forward. In the meantime, the lucky dog has made an impression on her rescuers. \"i wish i could keep her, \" coelho tells kcra. \"with my line of work, i ' m never home, so she needs a good, loving home that will help her heal. \"",

Deputy christopher newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his fort pierce home. The police said hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door ( which had been opened for the deputies ) was closed again and newman shot at hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of hill's three children.

That may change with a 500-pound slab of sandstone containing 70 letters and punctuation marks from the etruscan language discovered by archaeologists northeast of florence, italy, according to smithsonian magazine. The more-than-2,500-year-old stone, known as a stele, was used to mark a temple before being repurposed into a foundation stone for a much larger temple. In a press release, archaeologist gregory warden stays the stele \" will be remarkable for telling us about the early belief system of a lost culture that is fundamental to western traditions. \" oddly, the etruscan language doesn't appear to be related to other nearby languages, and etruscans mostly wrote on non-lasting materials like cloth and wax. Prior to the discovery of the stele, scholars largely had to rely on the \" rote phrases and praise for the dead \" found on etruscan gravestones to try to decipher their language, ars technica notes. \"long inscriptions are rare, especially one this long, so there will be new words that we have never seen before, since it is not a funerary text, \" warden says. The etruscans were notably religious, and scholars hope the stele could reveal information about one of the gods or goddesses they worshiped. The stele is being cleaned and scanned in florence, italy, and then an etruscan language expert will have a go at it. ( an ancient find solved a centuries-old jewish riddle. )",

Delta, however, said it \" appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting, \" that caused more than 20 complaints, business insider reports. One of the men is \" a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, \" the airline said in a statement. After saleh's complaint, critics noted that his youtube channel is full of stunts and staged incidents, including a recent video where he falsely claimed to have smuggled himself on a plane inside a suitcase. In 2014, he was criticized by the council on american-islamic relations for faking a now-deleted video in which he appeared to be singled out by an nypd officer for stop-and-frisk because he was in traditional arabic clothes. Saleh tells the guardian that wednesday's videos are no joke. He says fellow passengers started to become uncomfortable after he spoke arabic in a brief phone call to his mother. Saleh, who traveled to new york on a different flight after going through another security check, says he plans to talk to his lawyer about the incident.

        "summary": "A team of german bacteriologists says our noses may contain more than boogers; there might also be a cure for the \" hospital superbug \" mrsa hiding up there, the guardian reports. According to the los angeles times, mrsa kills about 11,000 us patients every year and sickens another 80,500. And like other harmful bacteria, it's rapidly building up resistance to all our antibiotics. Enter staphylococcus lugdunensis. The bacteria found living in people's noses produces an mrsa-killing antibody known as lugdunin. Not only does lugdunin appear to be effective against mrsa, it also doesn't appear to cause any sort of resistance buildup in the superbug, according to a new study published in nature. The study's coauthor, andreas peschel, calls the discovery of s. Lugdunensis \" totally unexpected. \" antibiotics traditionally come from bacteria living in soil. But if lugdunin lives up to its promise, the human body could be an entirely new source for scientists. It would also be the first new class of antibiotic in nearly three decades. The idea is to take the lugdunin-producing genes from s. Lugdunensis, which can cause illness, and put them into harmless bacteria. While that's a promising idea, one expert warns the guardian that lugdunin is still \" a million miles away from being a useful drug. \"",

The story may not actually be true; it will be featured on new series urban myths on the arts-oriented channel sky arts, e! reports. The show, whose tagline is \" true... Ish stories, \" will run eight 30-minute episodes telling similarly strange may-or-may-not-have-actually-happened stories, per the british comedy guide. It debuts in the uk jan. 19, but the michael jackson episode isn't slated until april. Needless to say, the casting of fiennes as jackson has caused some controversy: e!'s take on it: \" throughout a lifetime, there will come occasions in which a person has to show restraint. Take the high road. Do absolutely everything in their power not to say what is on their minds.... This is one of those times. \" slate does not take that road. Fiennes has \" been made up with skin the color and texture of uncooked pizza dough and a nose that looks like an unintentional tribute to jackson's character from the wiz, \" writes sam adams. \" in short, it's a nightmare. \" \" people aren't quite sure how to feel, \" notes rebecca hawkes at the telegraph. \" the predominant emotion appears to be horror and dismay. \" she rounds up some of the best tweets on the matter.

Several have come forward detailing disturbing encounters with the pulitzer prize-winning author, as reported in the cut. What we lose author zinzi clemmons tweets that diaz forcibly cornered and kissed her at a workshop. National book award finalist carmen maria machado, author of her body and other parties, described an endless, mortifying harangue at a q&a event. Author monica byrne said on facebook that díaz yelled directly in her face during a 2014 social event. \"i've never experienced such virulent misogyny in my adult life, \" she wrote. In response to the allegations, the 49-year-old diaz says in a statement to the new york times that \" i take responsibility for my past. \" diaz has a complicated history with women, some of which is chronicled in his books. In the brief wondrous life of oscar wao, he appears as yunior, a self-aware womanizer grappling with a legacy of machismo rooted in dominican culture. He recently wrote a gut-wrenching account in the new yorker of his rape at age 8 and described in detail how those events fed cycles of suicidal depression, rage, and serial cheating as an adult. In his statement to the times, diaz says his desire to take responsibility \" is the reason i made the decision to tell the truth of my rape and its damaging aftermath, \" adding that \" we must continue to teach all men about consent and boundaries. \" byrne, however, thinks the essay was a calculated ploy by him to get out ahead of these allegations.",

It's been years since i was there, the time we met. I was hoping that you'd show up again; i even looked for you, but you didn't appear. I remember you proudly repped n.y.c. During the few minutes we spoke, so i suspect you'd moved back or maybe you were busy or you didn't know i was in town. I have a distinct memory of you in the signing line, saying nothing to anyone, intense. I assumed you were going to ask me to read a manuscript or help you find an agent, but instead you asked me about the sexual abuse alluded to in my books. You asked, quietly, if it had happened to me. You caught me completely by surprise. I wish i had told you the truth then, but i was too scared in those days to say anything. Too scared, too committed to my mask. I responded with some evasive bullshit. And that was it. I signed your books. You thought i was going to say something, and when i didn't you looked disappointed. But more than that you looked abandoned. I could have said anything but instead i turned to the next person in line and smiled. Out of the corner of my eye i watched you pick up your backpack, slowly put away your books, and leave. When the signing was over i couldn't get the fuck away from amherst, from you and your question, fast enough. I ran the way i've always run. Like death itself was chasing me. For a couple of days afterward i fretted; i worried that i'd given myself away. But then the old oblivion reflex took over. I pushed it all down. Buried it all. Like always. But i never really did forget. Not our exchange or your disappointment. How you walked out of the auditorium with your shoulders hunched. I know this is years too late, but i ' m sorry i didn't answer you. I ' m sorry i didn't tell you"

Almost 600 of them died. In arizona, the number of cases has more than doubled from 46 in 2011 to 93 in 2015, and now the cdc is reporting in its morbidity and mortality weekly report that two newborns contracted the disease in arizona last year after home water births. Both were hospitalized and given antibiotics, and both survived. The warm water used in water births is in the \" optimum range \" of 77 to 108 degrees fahrenheit for legionella growth, per the cdc, with the washington post noting the bacterium can grow in storage tanks and water pipes. Even so, the infection is extremely rare in water births, with just one other case reported in arizona between 2011 and 2015. In 2014, a newborn in texas died of the disease weeks after being delivered in a heated home birthing tub. In arizona, neither infant who contracted the disease last year appears to have inhaled water during birth. One new recommendation from the cdc is to let hot water run for three minutes before filling a birthing tub \" to clear the hose and pipes of stagnant water and sediment. \" meanwhile, live science reports the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists says there is some evidence that early labor in water can be helpful, but due to insufficient risk data it does not yet recommend delivering babies in water.

Not far from its border with north korea on friday, south korea's military came across a drone — almost eight feet wide with twin engines — carrying a sony camera that had snapped roughly 10 photos of the thaad anti-missile system, a south korean defense official tells yonhap news. \" the pictures don't have high resolution, though, \" the official says. The camera had also taken hundreds of additional photos, but they mostly show \" forest land and residential areas \" from one to two miles away, the official adds. It isn't clear if the drone was able to transmit the photos of thaad before it crashed in inje after apparently running out of fuel, reports the ap. If it did indeed come from north korea, it would've traveled close to 300 miles roundtrip to reach the thaad site in seongju. Some are wondering how the drone was missed earlier, but a rep for south korea's joint chiefs of staff says it will \" come up with measures to deal with north korean drones. \" on monday, defense secretary jim mattis addressed north korea's \" provocative actions \" and nuclear weapons program, noting the country is \" the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security, \" per reuters. In warning of a possible war, he added, it would be \" like nothing we have seen since 1953. \"",

Now there are probably more people in anchorage than elephants in africa, with the pachyderm population down by a third just between 2007 and 2014, according to the biggest-ever study of elephant populations. The great elephant census found 352,271 savanna elephants roaming across 18 countries and estimated that the population had dropped by 144,000 in a seven-year period, with poachers slaughtering tens of thousands every year for ivory to sell to the chinese market, npr reports. The researchers, whose work is published in peerj, warn that the population is dropping by 8 % every year as poaching continues and that localized extinction is on the horizon in several countries. Elephant ecologist mike chase is the founder of elephants without borders and the lead scientist on the elephant census, which spent three years trying to count africa's elephants from the air. \" i don't think anybody in the world has seen the number of dead elephants that i've seen over the last two years, \" chase tells cnn, describing how poachers have been wiping out entire family herds of elephants, and how areas that once supported thousands of elephants are now home to just tens. \" if we can't protect the world's largest land mammal, the prognosis for wildlife conservation is bleak, \" he says, though there is hope that the census will aid the creation of a master plan for protecting elephants.

            "Photo washington — a long-lasting radioactive element has been measured at levels that pose a long-term danger at one spot 25 miles from the crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant, raising questions about whether japan's evacuation zone should be expanded and whether the land might need to be abandoned. The isotope, cesium 137, was measured in one village by the international atomic energy agency at a level exceeding the standard that the soviet union used as a gauge to recommend abandoning land surrounding the chernobyl reactor, and at another location not precisely identified by the agency at more than double the soviet standard. The measurements, reported wednesday, would not be high enough to cause acute radiation illness, but far exceed standards for the general public designed to cut the risks of cancer. While the amount measured would not pose an immediate danger, the annual dose would be too high to allow people to keep living there, according to edwin lyman, a senior scientist at the union of concerned scientists, an american organization that is often critical of nuclear safety rules. Cesium persists in the environment for centuries, losing half its strength every 30 years. The international atomic energy agency stressed that levels of contamination varied considerably from place to place. Experts said the measurement might represent a \"hot spot \" and might not be representative of larger areas, though",

According to police, takahiro shiraishi used twitter to connect with those wanting to commit suicide. He's suspected of killing four teens and five people in their 20s — described as eight females and one male, possibly the boyfriend of a victim — since moving into his apartment outside tokyo in late august, per the bbc and japan times. Police were led to the apartment tuesday after the brother of a 23-year-old missing woman found twitter messages she exchanged with shiraishi after posting that she was seeking someone to die with her, per the japan times. Surveillance footage showed the woman walking with shiraishi near his apartment on oct. 23, police say. A subsequent search of shiraishi's residence — which neighbors described as smelling of sewage — uncovered body parts believed to belong to the woman and eight others, likely killed on the day they met shiraishi, police say. Though it isn't yet clear how the individuals died, police say shiraishi confessed to cutting up the bodies in a bathtub, removing the flesh, hiding body parts in coolers filled with sand or cat litter, and putting other body parts in the trash, per the new york times. Police say shiraishi told them he intended to rape some of his victims but was motivated by money, per the japan times. He admitted taking $ 4,410 from at least one victim, police say.",

The san jose mercury news reports the growth rates over those 40 years are as much as 45 % faster than they've been in the last 200 years. ( it's the girth, not height, that is increasing at a record pace, notes the marin independent journal. ) the league, along with a number of university scientists, studied tree rings and took corings no wider than a pencil from 78 redwoods in order to create their chronology. That allowed them to calculate historic growth rates, which led to the discovery that things have gotten speedier of late. The researchers aren't sure climate change is the culprit, but one explains a few working theories: that increased temps have elongated the growing season, or that a reduction in fog is providing more sunlight. But reductions in air pollution or wildfire damage could also be at the root of it. Two neat side notes: the oldest redwood tree known was found by the researchers. It's at least 2,520 years old and, as the mercury news points out, \" had already been growing for 400 years when julius caesar was born. \" researchers found that many redwoods didn't grow at all in 1580, \" the year sir francis drake reported having ice on his sails as he sailed the coast of california, \" says the league's director.",

        "summary": "A potential scandal involving intelligence reports about the islamic state being manipulated to make us progress sound rosier than reality seems to be getting bigger. And now, national intelligence director james clapper is involved, reports the guardian. The story surfaced last month, when the new york times reported that the pentagon's inspector general was looking into allegations that intelligence reports about isis being presented to policy makers were too positive given the facts on the ground. Defense analysts were complaining that when they turned in their sober assessments to the us military's central command, their superiors were altering them. Yesterday, the daily beast shed more light on the story, reporting that more than 50 such analysts had made the allegations. Now the guardian focuses on clapper's role. The newspaper reports that he had been personally checking in, almost daily, with a centcom intelligence official named army brigadier general steven grove. The latter is reportedly one of the officials under scrutiny in the pentagon's inquiry. Given that clapper is so high-ranking, that interaction is \" highly, highly unusual, \" a former intel official tells the newspaper. The story makes clear that clapper is not accused of ordering altered reports, but his very interaction raises questions. The guardian's take: clapper \" is said to tell grove how the war looks from his vantage point, and question grove about central command's assessments. Such a situation could place inherent pressure on a subordinate, sources said. \" no word on when the pentagon inquiry will conclude.",

In the first case, 41-year-old babak rezapour of california is accused of groping a 21-year-old woman who'd taken prescription anti-anxiety and anti-nausea medication with a glass of wine aboard a jan. 10 norwegian airlines flight from london to seattle. The woman had difficulty staying awake after rezapour gave her a second glass of wine, and awoke repeatedly to find him touching her thigh, rubbing her heel against his genitals, lying with his face in her lap, and with his hand in her shirt and pants, prosecutors say, per the seattle post-intelligencer. The woman was later found crying and shaking on the floor, reports the guardian. Rezapour — whose dna was found in the woman's underwear, according to authorities — is charged with abusive sexual contact aboard an airliner, as is nicholas stevens, 37, of alaska. He's accused of using his position in an aisle seat to force himself on a 22-year-old woman in a window seat on a march 8 alaska airlines flight from anchorage to seattle. The woman said stevens talked about killing animals and joked about killing people before saying he wanted to do \" dirty things \" to her. She was found \" visibly upset and shaking \" after stevens allegedly touched her breast and thigh multiple times, per the post-intelligencer. The fbi notes a 30 % increase in reports of sexual assault aboard planes in the last four years is tied to an increase in reporting. But \" we need the flying public's help, \" hayes says. \" we can make a difference. \"",

But because it leaves behind carcinogenic chemical compounds in dust and on surfaces ranging from carpet to wallpaper and ceiling tiles, he says, \" no level of exposure to tobacco is safe. \" researchers tested the homes of dozens of smokers who'd just quit and found that all residents were still exposed to thirdhand smoke pollutants in dust and on surfaces after six months. While the level of toxins dropped significantly when the smoker quit, they were still detectable at the end of the study, and traces turned up in people's urine. The researchers say more research should follow on how to remove such pollutants more quickly. The study follows a report by reuters that 24 million nonsmoking kids are exposed to secondhand smoke in the us thanks largely to their parents, which works out to four in 10 school-aged children.

        "summary": "A few decades ago, the asian arowana was more likely to be on a dinner plate than in an aquarium. But today, the fish is a highly sought-after specimen that enthusiasts will go to great lengths to obtain, including breaking endangered species laws, paying thousands upon thousands of dollars ( $ 150,000 in one case ), and worse. \"there's been kidnappings and fish-related canings and even murder, \" author emily voigt tells pri. In her newly released book, the dragon behind the glass, voigt explores the circumstances that have transformed the asian arowana — known as the dragon fish for its appearance and temperament — from \" an ordinary food fish \" into one of the \" most coveted. \" her conclusion: it all started with the addition of the fish to the initial appendix i of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ). Plants and animals in appendix i are the \" rarest of the rare and generally banned from international trade, \" voigt says in an article she penned for the daily beast. Even before being added to cites in 1975, the asian arowana, which can grow to be 3 feet long, was becoming scarce due to overharvesting and other factors. \" in the case of the asian arowana, however, the listing seemed to backfire, propelling the species into the spotlight as a limited edition. \" the fish's highlighted scarcity, along with traditional beliefs that the asian arowana brings luck to its owner, made the fish more attractive. To meet the demand, the fish is farmed in southeast asia at facilities that, she tells pri, \" are likened to high-security prisons. \" one solution to the illegal activities inspired by the asian arowana: \" scrub the species of the sheen of rarity, scrapping bans in favor of sustainable trade, \" voigt writes in the daily beast.

In a complaint filed wednesday, 32-year-old aubrey lane says she was flying from phoenix to new york in june 2017 when the man beside her ordered multiple drinks, noisily came on to her, and followed her to the bathroom — where he sexually assaulted her. \" i started hearing him say how pretty she was, how lucky her husband was to have such a ' bangin ' wife ' and how ' what happens on vacation stays on vacation, ' \" another passenger is quoted as saying in the court papers. The man allegedly grabbed lane's face, tried kissing her, told her he loved her, and the two got in an argument about whether he could fall in love that fast. \" this drew a lot of attention, but when i alerted the flight attendant as he walked by, he shrugged and said: ' well they are drinking … ' and walked away, \" says the passenger. Lane tells the dallas morning news that when she informed staff about the assault, they just moved her to another seat. \" i was feeling overwhelmed … all of a sudden, i was thrown in a middle seat, bawling, \" she says. Lane accuses flight staff of failing to protect her by giving the man up to six alcoholic drinks, and claims he simply left when they reached jfk airport. In december, the airline responded by calling lane's allegation a \" nuisance claim \" and offering her $ 5,000. The fbi is apparently investigating. Meanwhile, a 2017 survey says 20 % of flight attendants have had a sexual assault reported during a flight. ( submitting to rape is described as a \" necessity \" in north korea. )",

            "No comprehensive statistics are kept on on-board sexual assaults. But a 2017 survey by the association of flight attendants-cwa of nearly 2,000 members found that 1 in 5 had received a report of passenger-on-passenger sexual assault while working a flight. Most said they had no knowledge of written guidance or training on how to handle such reports, according to the union. Sexual misconduct aboard aircraft — whether crude verbal harassment, unwanted touching, or worse — is a problem that has persisted for years, directed toward both passengers and a predominantly female flight attendant workforce. Known instances of rape aboard aircraft are exceedingly rare, with several industry insiders and attorneys who have been closely tracking the issue for the past few years unaware of other publicly reported cases. Scattered media reports have documented individual cases of sexual misconduct, but there's been little in the way of coordinated action by the industry and regulators to measure or tackle the issue. Victims of sexual abuse on planes speaking out could push the airline industry closer to a reckoning it has long avoided, experts said, as cases of sexual misconduct dominate headlines in hollywood, washington, d.c., new york and elsewhere in the #metoo era.

The rule is part of new energy standards that the state building standards commission gave final approval to on wednesday, per the mercury news, which notes that california is the first state to have such a requirement. The california energy commission first approved the plan in may, cnbc reports. Commissioner kent sasaki called the move \"historic \" and said it will be a \"beacon of light for the rest of the country, \" per the mercury news. Opponents, however, say that the solar requirement will be expensive for homebuyers and make it even more difficult to buy a house in california's already pricey market. Officials estimate that the new energy standards will add $ 10,000 to the cost of building a home. But, they add, the upfront cost will be offset by lower utility bills. The provisions call for all new residential buildings that are up to three stories high, including apartments, in the state to be solar powered. Offsite production, such as contracts with utility-owned solar farms, is allowed. And there are exceptions for shady areas or areas where solar power would be costlier than the prevailing energy rates. Also included in the energy standards are requirements for thicker insulation and more energy-efficient doors and windows, among others. ( this nasa probe got super close to the sun. )",

The bbc reports that, according to foreign minister sergey lavrov, there's \" irrefutable evidence \" that what actually happened was a staged effort as part of a \" russophobic campaign, \" with one country at its helm. And although lavrov didn't mention what country that was at a friday presser, a rep for russia's defense ministry did. \" we have … evidence that proves britain was directly involved in organizing this provocation, \" said gen. Igor konashenkov, though the ap notes he didn't offer up any of that evidence while speaking. What konashenkov did present were statements he said came from medics at douma's hospital after the alleged april 7 attack, with the medics purportedly saying people with video cameras came in with patients who claimed to have been poisoned, but who didn't show any signs of chemical poisoning. Britain's response: \" this is grotesque, \" per karen pierce, the country's ambassador to the un, after hearing the russian remarks. \" it's some of the worst piece of fake news we've yet seen from the russia propaganda machine, \" she added, calling it a \" bizarre \" and \" blatant lie, \" per abc news. Meanwhile, un ambassador nikki haley told a un security council meeting friday syria has used chemical weapons at least 50 times since its civil war began in 2011 — a number far higher than what had been publicly confirmed, per the new york times.",

        "summary": "The iphone x will officially ship on nov. 3, but those vying for apple's latest smartphone were able to try to preorder on friday — and the first available batches sold out in mere minutes. Cnet reports only a few models were left after just 10 minutes of opening the preorder lines at 12: 01am pacific time, with shipping delays of up to three weeks already noted on certain carriers. By the time half an hour had gone by, consumers were hit with a month or more delay on \" all models from all us carriers \"; the wait time in the uk and australia was even longer. Which would seem to indicate that everyone and their tech-savvy mother is clamoring for the new iphone. Apple even issued a statement friday that, based on the preorder sellouts, \" customer demand is off the charts, \" per 9to5mac.com. But fortune says that may not be completely accurate. Notably, a kgi expert said to be \" the best apple analyst on the planet \" tells appleinsider.com there may have been at most 3 million units in the iphone x's first run, which is way below the 10 million iphone 6 models that were initially available. Blame for the supply slowdown is being assigned to production issues, specifically in regard to a key facial-recognition feature that's rumored to not be going as planned. A bloomberg report this week claimed that apple was even advising suppliers to let the accuracy of this technology slide a bit to speed up production, which apple said in a statement was \" completely false. \" in a tuesday interview with buzzfeed news, apple ceo tim cook said, in response to word of a \" constrained \" supply, that \" we ' ll be working as hard as possible to make as many as possible. \"",

He tells the atlanta journal-constitution that the death of 60-year-old fan gregory murrey is the 24th falling death at a baseball stadium since 1969, and one of the biggest factors is the size of modern ballparks. \" it's because the stadiums are so big, you have a longer way to fall, \" he says, adding the problem will be hard to fix without ruining sightlines, because if \" you make the railings too high, the people in the front row won't be able to see. \" a 2013 turner field fall was ruled a suicide, and police say a 2008 falling death at the ballpark involved alcohol. Police don't suspect foul play in the death of murrey, who tumbled as fans rushed to boo alex rodriguez. A doctor who was at the game tells abc news that he saw murrey fall from the upper deck into the lower stands and that he ran over to help. \" it's one of those things that you hope you never see or experience, \" he says. \" and i certainly hope i never see or experience it again. \" the braves — who move to a new stadium in 2017 — had a moment of silence yesterday and lowered flags to half-staff to mourn murrey, though they were criticized on saturday for not stopping the game as paramedics attended to him, reports the washington post.

The afp reports that transportation minister israel katz on tuesday gave the green light to a $ 700 million plan to further extend a not-yet-open high-speed rail line from tel aviv to jerusalem, bringing it into the jewish quarter of the old city and all the way to the western wall. There, a new station will be named \" donald john trump \" in a nod to the president's \" brave and historic decision. \" the ap reports the plan, which needs final approval, would take four years to complete; the tel aviv-to-jerusalem line itself will open in 2018 and trim the travel time between the cities to 30 minutes. A rep for the ministry expects final approval on the extension to come in 2018 \" barring major complications, \" as the ap puts it — and as it explains, major complications are possible. That's because the route will require excavations near a contested holy site, which is likely to trigger palestinian opposition.",

In all, about 170 restaurants have \" gone rogue, \" in the words of the wall street journal. Back in august, mcdonald's canceled its franchise agreement with connaught plaza restaurants, which operates 40 % of mcdonald's outlets in india. But rather than close up shop, the restaurants are operating as usual. Mcdonald's has been pressuring suppliers to cut off deliveries with mixed success, and connaught plaza's managing director, who brought the chain to india in 1996, hopes to keep the food flowing for as long as possible. \"i cannot allow a large organization, this [ multinational ] monster, whatever you want to call it, to truly belittle our contributions, \" says vikram bakshi. Mcdonald's, meanwhile, accuses connaught plaza of various contractual issues, including a failure to pay royalties. Bakshi's legal battles with mcdonald's actually stretch as far back as 2008, and this latest round is expected to drag out in the courts as well. India has a growing middle class, and that theoretically makes the country a great market for mcdonald's, notes the economist. But it adds that this recent trouble \" illustrates multinationals ' worst fears about india, from the instability built into the joint-venture model to the ease of stymieing legal judgments. \" in the meantime, the maharaja macs continue to be served at the non-mcdonald's mcdonald's.",

        "summary": "Truly horrific: a florida prison inmate murdered his cellmate thursday by strangling him, pulling out his eyes, and strolling into the prison chow hall wearing the guy's ear around his neck — a killing that highlights bigger problems at columbia correctional institution, the miami herald reports. Officials have identified the victim as larry mark, a 58-year-old serving life for murder, but the killer's name hasn't been released while the florida department of law enforcement investigates. Two prison sources tell the herald that mark angered his cellmate by pestering him; after the killing, the cellmate dropped mark's eyes in a cup and told fellow prisoners he was planning to drink or eat them later on. The dorm where mark died was manned by just one control-room officer and a sergeant who was busy elsewhere in the compound — just one example of staff shortages that have left the facility rattled. The problem worsened hours later when a gang knife-fight erupted over smuggled contraband elsewhere in the prison and left four hospitalized, per the gainesville sun. According to an officer at the lake city facility, staff shortages contribute to contraband deliveries ( sometimes by drone ) and the proliferation of k2, a powerful synthetic marijuana often used by prisoners. And columbia correctional isn't alone: gangs control many of florida's 50 prisons, says a former prison inspector, while records show that inmate deaths in the state's system are more frequent than ever.",
