        "summary": "Since it first took to the air in 1996, msnbc has been deep in the fray, vying for coveted ratings in the fiercely competitive cable-television arena. Twenty-one years later, it has finally nabbed a big one: the biggest weekday prime-time cable audience, not only against news networks, but all networks on the cable landscape. Per deadline, msnbc posted a weekday prime-time average of 2.34 million viewers during the week of july 17 through 21, besting fox news, which came in that week at 2.25 million. The disney channel came in third, with 1.74 million, per fortune. The hollywood reporter notes that msnbc has come ahead of both fox and cnn before during the 8pm to 11pm weekday slot — once in 2012, then again this may — but it didn't surpass other non-news networks like usa and tnt. Huffpo notes msnbc has often come ahead of cnn in the nielsens, but it lags behind fox, which up until recently boasted a powerhouse prime-time lineup of bill o'reilly, megyn kelly, and sean hannity. But now, with o'reilly and kelly gone from the network, opportunity has arisen for other networks to make inroads. Thewrap notes that overall viewership at msnbc has jumped 78 % since this time last year. Part of what's helped msnbc as a contender is rachel maddow, who in her 9pm slot has been topping cnn's and fox's ratings in that same time period for the past month or so — and whose show was almost the most-watched last week, second only to wwe programming. What may also appeal to viewers: \" msnbc is simply more transparent \" about its strong liberal leanings, joe concha, who reports for the hill, tells thewrap.",

        "summary": "First a lawyer took issue with two women speaking spanish in a new york city eatery. Now two us citizens in the montana town of havre have had the same experience — but this time the person with the issue was a border patrol agent. Ana suda, 37, tells the washington post she and friend mimi hernandez, both mexican-americans, ran out to a gas station convenience store for milk and eggs just after midnight wednesday and started conversing in spanish while waiting to pay. That's when she says a border patrol agent took interest in them and asked for suda's id. In a video she started taping as they moved to the parking lot, she asks the agent — who says his name is \" agent o ' neal \" — why they were detained, and he replies, \" i saw that you guys are speaking spanish, which is very unheard of up here. \" suda said they were held up for about 35 to 40 minutes and that hernandez started crying. Suda posted about the incident on facebook, and it soon started making the rounds on social media, per kvia. Among those who've weighed in: former hud secretary julian castro, who tweeted, \" way to go, border patrol agent. Terrible judgment. \" a customs and border protection rep tells the post it's looking into the incident and that \" although most border patrol work is conducted in the immediate border area, agents have broad law enforcement authorities and are not limited to a specific geography within the united states \" ( havre is 35 miles or so south of the us-canadian border ). For suda, who says she ' ll be taking legal action, perhaps the worst part is how her 7-year-old daughter reacted. \" when she saw the video, she was like, ' mom, we can't speak spanish anymore? ' i said, ' no. You be proud. You are smart. You speak two languages, ' \" suda says.",

The embassy's twitter account shared two overlapping photos monday: one showing a helicopter in the sky with its search light on, the other showing the roof of the embassy building awash in light. \" what was american helicopter searching for at the russian embassy's premises yesterday night? \" the tweet read, per sputnik. \"'strange ' malfunction of navigation equipment in the center of the us capital? or another desperate attempt to find traces of #russianmeddling? \" as if to point out the unbelievability of meddling in the 2016 election, the tweet finished with a ufo emoji. While it might've been simple trolling — a secret service rep said he was unaware of any incident with a helicopter — the washington post reports dc police did dispatch a helicopter after 10pm sunday while investigating a possible armed robbery. According to an officer, the helicopter scanned an area half a mile north of the embassy's entrance for about 20 minutes. Regardless of its complaint, the russian embassy doesn't actually seem that concerned with what a helicopter might've been doing nearby. An earlier tweet monday said all investigations of russian interference in the election would end just like the house probe, and quoted texas rep. Mike conaway, a republican, as saying, \" only tom clancy could take this series of inadvertent contacts, meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a spy thriller that could go out there. \"",

To even further prove that she is one badass bitch ( in the nicest sense of the word, of course ), scout also poses in some flannel duds, combat boots, studded sneakers, vintage silver jewelry and some flowy frocks ã la stevie nicks, all the while rocking some heavy black eyeliner. And not to mention, she also manages to flip off the camera too, while riding bareback on a motorcycleâ€ \"i mean, can you get any more badass than that? looks like maybe someone's been taking a few \" cool points \" pointers from fellow celebrity offspring darling, frances bean cobain. Check out all of the exclusive photos from stylelikeu in the slideshow above, and be sure to head on over to their site tomorrow, thursday, december 8th, to see the full video and photo editorial shoot starring scout willis. Update: the full editorial featuring scout willis is now live on stylelikeu."

        "summary": "Pink slime is perfectly safe to eat, but it has a bit of a pr problem, according to federal authorities and a coalition of at least four governors. Department of agriculture officials say the \" slime \" — leftover beef trimmings sometimes treated with ammonium hydroxide — is actually a low-cost way of making ground beef leaner, and has been unfairly labeled, reports the wall street journal. The additive has been used for nearly 20 years, but supermarkets have started taking it off their shelves under pressure from the public. Texas gov. Rick perry and iowa gov. Terry branstad are among the governors who plan to eat the stuff the meat industry calls \" lean, finely textured beef \" themselves after touring a plant in nebraska today, businessweek reports. \" you effectively need to kill 1.5 million more head of cattle a year to replace the meat that would go off the market from this unwarranted, unmerited food scare, \" branstad says. \" that's why we're pushing back on it. \"",

        "summary": "A russian soyuz space capsule has landed in kazakhstan, reports the ap, bringing three astronauts from the united states, japan, and russia back to earth from a 115-day mission aboard the international space station. The landing took place sunday morning near dzhezkazgan on the treeless central asian steppes. Kate rubins of nasa, japan's takuya onishi and anatoly ivanishin of russia were removed from the capsule and sat on the steppes still in their capsule seats while they readjusted to the forces of gravity after nearly four months in weightless conditions, then were taken to a nearby medical tent for initial examination. Rubins recently gave an appropriately nerdy interview to entertainment weekly, in which she described watching star trek beyond aboard the iss, telling simon pegg, \" your special effects guys get it right. It absolutely feels like a space station. \" meanwhile, andrei borisenko and sergey ryzhykov of russia and nasa astronaut robert shane kimbrough remain aboard the space station. They arrived on oct. 22 after a two-day voyage. The trip back to earth was much quicker for the three returnees on sunday, about 3 1/2 hours from undocking until landing. The capsule landed as scheduled and was closely tracked by helicopters as it wafted through partly cloudy skies under a parachute marked in red and white concentric circles. The craft landed upright, which made the extraction of the astronauts quicker than when capsules land on their sides. ( last week, the iss took a delivery that was two years in the making. )",

        "summary": "Last year 33.5 million people tuned in for president obama's fifth state of the union. That was the smallest sotu audience since bill clinton's 2000 address and quite a drop from obama's 2009 sotu debut to 52.4 million people. Which direction will the numbers go this time? that's up for grabs, but here's one known number: seven. That's the number of things you need to know about what's to come at 9pm tonight: he's ready to go it alone. Obama plans to announce that he ' ll sign new executive orders, with the white house saying he's prepared to do so at a level never seen before. Chief among them: a bump in the minimum wage for federal contract workers from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10. Potentially also on the list: executive actions on job training, retirement security, infrastructure, climate change, and education. He wants to see the general minimum wage go even higher. Last year he called for the floor to be set at $ 9. This year he ' ll make the argument for $ 10.10 across the board, with future increases linked to inflation. Second verse, same as the first. The agenda he's expected to present will sound fairly deja vu-ish: immigration law overhaul, the minimum wage issue, expanded pre-school education. He ' ll tread carefully on immigration. Sources say obama definitely won't go it alone here at this point, and on the hope that this is the year house republican leaders will act, he's \" reportedly holding his fire on shaming the gop on immigration, \" writes jay newton-small for time. Expect to hear him \" applaud bipartisan efforts to come up with a solution, \" agrees carrie budoff brown at politico. He's going to take credit for the economy. Writing for the ap, jim kuhnhenn is very clear on this point. \" obama will also feel compelled to take credit for an economy that by many indicators is gaining strength under his watch. As a result, he will talk positively about a recovery that remains elusive to many americans. \" some democrats are wary of this tack, and possibly rightly so: an nbc news poll out yesterday found 70 % of americans are unhappy with the economy. We ' ll hear about obamacare. And it ' ll likely take up more space than the few sentences it occupied in 2012 and 2013, predicts budoff brown, who writes that \" obama will have to strike a positive tone about the law without sounding as though he's declaring ' mission accomplished",

        "summary": "Turns out bipartisanship is possible in dc after all: former fbi chief robert mueller was named as the justice department's special counsel wednesday evening to oversee the investigation of alleged russian election meddling, and the choice was praised by lawmakers from both parties. The 72-year-old, who was james comey's predecessor in the fbi post, served under both democratic and republican presidents in a tenure that lasted from 2001 to 2013, making him the longest-serving fbi director since j. Edgar hoover. A roundup of coverage: former colleagues have nothing but praise for mueller, who's credited with building the modern fbi, reports the new york times. After overseeing the justice department's criminal division under george hw bush, he worked as a prosecutor in dc, where \" he was legendary, \" says lawyer preston burton. \" he's inexhaustible. He's the embodiment of integrity. \" mueller was appointed by george w. Bush and became fbi director just a week before the 9/11 attacks. In an unusual move, president obama decided to keep mueller on as director for an extra two years after his 10-year term finished in 2011, saying he \" set the gold standard for leading the bureau, \" politico reports in a look at mueller's background. The ap reports on the sweeping powers mueller will have as special counsel. Mueller, who will the power to prosecute any crimes he uncovers, has a mandate to look into \" any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation \" of the trump campaign's alleged russia links, which could include comey's firing. Congressional leaders voiced their approval of mueller while also stressing that their own investigations of the russia issue would continue, the washington post reports. \" having someone like bob mueller head the investigation assures the american people that there's no undue influence, be it here or be it at the other end of pennsylvania avenue, or within the justice department or fbi, \" said sen. Richard burr, the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee. The hill reports that numerous lawmakers issued statements in support of mueller wednesday night.

Sadly for brad gobright and jim reynolds, that record has now been smashed. After scaling the monolith four days a week for three weeks, speed climbers alex honnold and tommy caldwell did the seemingly impossible wednesday, clocking in a time of 1: 58: 07, reports outside. They'd already broken gobright and reynolds'record twice, with times of 2: 10: 15 on may 30 and 2: 01: 50 on monday. But the \" sub-two \" record was their goal, and honnold's former climbing partner explains why: \" it's like breaking the two-hour marathon barrier, but vertically, \" hans florine tells national geographic. Together with the now-retired florine, honnold had held the best time ( 2: 23: 46 ) in the race for the nose since 2012. \" when brad and jim finally broke the record, it was open season again and time to give it a try, \" he says. Beginning training in may, honnold and caldwell carefully evaluated each climb, looking for opportunities to improve. The result was what a gracious-in-defeat gobright calls \" the proudest speed-climbing ascent to have happened in the history of us rock climbing, \" per outside. Honnold predicts the record could last 10 to 15 years but believes it can be broken. As the record-setting run \" didn't go perfectly \" — the pair dropped gear and had to pass four other groups of climbers, he notes to national geo — the route can likely be done in 1.5 hours or less, he says. But \" we're totally over it, \" honnold tells outside. \" not trying again. \" ( two climbers just fell to their deaths from el capitan. )",

It will be a single telescope with a primary mirror 39 metres across. This is almost four times as large as any other telescope yet constructed.

        "summary": "When eugene stoner designed \" america's gun \" ( aka the ar-15 ) in the late 1950s, which was adopted for use by the army as the m16, his goal was to create the \" most efficient and superior \" rifles for military use and give them a leg up over the soviets ' ak-47, members of the late inventor's family tell nbc news. But his surviving children and grown grandkids, who spoke to nbc anonymously via phone and email so they could speak more openly, say stoner, who died in 1997, didn't use the ar-15 for sporting purposes ( even though he enjoyed hunting and skeet shooting ), defense, or for any reason whatsoever: he never owned one at all, as he considered it a war weapon not meant for civilian hands. \" he died long before any mass shootings occurred, \" the family says. \" but we do think he would have been horrified and sickened as anyone, if not more, by these events. \" the new york daily news notes stoner wasn't an engineer by trade and was just fooling around in his garage when he came up with the design for the ar-15, which he then further developed as chief designer for armalite. When stoner died at the age of 74, however, a semi-automatic model of his famous firearm started flying off shelves and into civilian hands, spurring the creation of similar guns for the general public. Ar-15-style rifles have since been used in at least 10 recent mass shootings, including sandy hook, aurora, san bernardino, and sunday's orlando shooting ( that gun was an ar-15-like sig sauer ). Why what stoner's family is saying may prove important: an ongoing lawsuit brought by 10 newtown plaintiffs against ar-15 manufacturer remington, a distributor, and a local retailer asserts the same premise that the rifle is a \" weapon of war \" and never should have been promoted to regular joes, per the new york times. Stoner's family, meanwhile, has one last thought. \" what has happened, good or bad, since his patents have expired is a result of our free market system, \" they tell nbc. \" currently, a more interesting question is: ' who now is benefiting from the manufacturing and sales of ar-15s, and for what uses?

Prospects for sale are dimmed as parents increasingly send kids to charter or private schools, and the number of for-sale buildings will only increase, pew researchers say. Philadelphia, for instance, is set to see 37 school closings next year, the ap reports. And the sun-times reports that the study comes just ahead of tomorrow's release of a preliminary list of schools chicago could close, with reports pegging the number of targets at 50. Detroit has sold or leased 63 school buildings since 2005, but 124 remain for sale. Cleveland has sold 25 but is still trying to sell 27 others. And these figures don't account for all the empty schools — just the ones districts have put up for sale. Others they keep for potential future use. Meanwhile, with some districts desperate to get rid of the buildings, sales are bringing in a lot less than they could. In cincinnati, for example, 11 buildings and a vacant parcel valued at $ 31 million sold for $ 3.5 million. The buildings typically sell for between $ 200,000 and $ 1 million.

Patricia millett: srinivasan's 52-year-old colleague on the d.c. Circuit is popular in both parties and is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate. She argued 32 cases before the supreme court as an advocate. Merrick garland: at 63, garland is older than most nominees, since presidents want their choices to stick around for decades on the bench. He is a moderate who serves as chief judge on the d.c. Circuit court and could be a compromise choice. Kamala harris: california's attorney general, 51, could be another leading candidate.

Over 32 trials they found that all dogs preferred a reward to none, nine responded to both, four preferred the blue toy knight, and just two preferred the pink truck that meant food, reports upi. After identifying the canine brain's reward center, researchers also observed the dogs responding more strongly to the scents of humans they know than those they don't, and they next plan to investigate how dogs process human language. Meanwhile they conclude that dogs who prefer praise could be ideal therapy dogs, while those who want treats could be better suited for search and rescue, reports mother nature network. Either way, they write, praise is \" at least as effective as food — and probably healthier, too. \" ( you may want to rethink hugging dogs. )",

The researchers note in their meta-analysis of nine studies that the scant scientific research doesn't consider potential gender differences, type of sport, or masturbation. Gizmodo reports those nine studies were the most reliable of the hundreds the researchers initially reviewed. Based on the limited existing data, the evidence suggests that at least in the case of marathon runners, sexual activity could actually boost sports performance. \" unless it takes place less than two hours before, the evidence actually suggests sexual activity may have a beneficial effect on sports performance, \" stefani says. So at the end of the day, reports healthday, the researchers are telling athletes who feel guilty having sex the day before the big event that, well, they really shouldn't.

Dmitry gudkov, a liberal member of russia's parliament, spotted the poster, which features a picture of president obama smoking, and posted it to facebook on tuesday. He calls the ad \" disgusting and embarrassing. \" according to newsweek, the ad will be removed, as it wasn't \" legitimate \" and was glued over another ad. But gudkov's photo of it has already gone viral online, upi reports. So far, no one has come forward to take credit for the ad. Gudkov claims obama is close to replacing folk-tale witch baba yaga as the official scarer of russian children. For example, a video posted online last week showed russian students falling down while claiming obama kills 875 people per week. Earlier that same week, russian students created a video telling the un that obama needs to be \" punished for thousands of lost lives. \" and yet another video this month, this one projected onto the sides of buildings in moscow, shows a devil-horned obama eating ukraine, libya, iraq, afghanistan, and syria while blaming him for 56,000 deaths in those countries.

Thad cochran of mississippi has edged out tea party challenger chris mcdaniel in an extremely tight run-off election, according to the ap, which gives the six-term gop veteran 51 % to mcdaniel's 49 % with 99 % of precincts reporting. The heated three-week race saw cochran take the unusual step of reaching out to black democrats, a move that his opponent called a desperate attempt to chase \" ultraliberal \" votes, the new york times reports. Sources tell the hill that mcdaniel plans a legal challenge to the result, focusing on heavily african-american hinds county, where cochran received thousands more votes in the run-off than in the first round of primary voting. In another closely watched race, democratic rep. Charles rangel is leading his challenger adriano espaillat in new york's 13th district, politico reports. Espaillat — who gave the 84-year-old rangel the toughest challenge of his political career — says the race is still too close to call and has refused to concede, although the latest figures put rangel four points ahead with 99 % of precincts counted. In other results: former rep. Bob beauprez has won the republican gubernatorial primary in colorado, defeating rivals including anti-immigration hardliner tom tancredo. He will face democratic incumbent john hickenlooper in the general election. In oklahoma, two-term gop rep. James lankford easily defeated former state house speaker t.w. Shannon, who was backed by ted cruz in the special election to succeed sen. Tom coburn, who is retiring. Lankford \" faces no credible democratic opposition in the fall, \" politico notes.

Deputies said nine students were believed to have lost a total of almost $ 1,000. \" i think it's a pretty disgusting thing, \" new smryna beach resident mari reed said. Unable to put cameras in the locker room, volusia county deputies decided to put decoy money in a student's wallet that was covered with an invisible, ultraviolet powder. The decoy money was taken on monday, authorities said. The same day, deputies said they used an ultraviolet light to check the hands of students and faculty. According to investigators, the 43-year-old barnes had the powder on his hands when authorities checked him. \" i think that's wrong that you'd steal from student, because they trust you. You're their coach. They expect to be able to put things in their locker and not be stolen from their coach, \" said student kylie"

            "Advertisement continue reading the main story washington — the chairman of the federal reserve, in saying that it had no immediate plans to provide additional support to the economy, dashed the hopes of some economists and executives who have been pushing for action to add momentum to the sluggish recovery. The chairman, ben s. Bernanke, said wednesday that the recovery was continuing at a modest pace, though with a \"somewhat weaker outlook. \" he projected that the unemployment rate would remain well above 7 percent through the end of 2012, and the duration of president obama's current term. That, too, was a discouraging note to washington incumbents facing tough re-election fights. Mr. Bernanke's statement that the fed had no imminent plans to go beyond its current strategy of keeping short-term interest rates exceptionally low pushed stock prices down. The dow jones industrial average fell 1.07 percent, or 109.43 points, to close at 10,120.53. In presenting the fed's semiannual monetary policy report to congress, mr.

He also nominated gina haspel to replace pompeo, thus setting her up to be the first woman to run the spy agency. The nomination must be confirmed by the senate, and it's a safe bet that critics will raise the issue of haspel's links to the cia's controversial waterboarding program. Haspel, as was reported last year during her confirmation process to become deputy cia chief, once ran a secret cia prison in thailand where terror suspects such as abu zubaydah and abd al rahim al-nashiri were waterboarded in 2002, reports the ap. In fact, zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times, per npr, which also notes that haspel is accused of destroying videotapes of the interrogations after congress demanded they be preserved. The flip side of her resume is that haspel joined the cia in 1985 and made a name for herself in covert operations, reports usa today. Trump called haspel an \" outstanding person, \" and time notes that president obama's national intelligence director, james clapper, said last year that he was happy she'd been nominated for the no. 2 post and that haspel was \" widely and deeply respected by the workforce. \" still, the waterboarding issue had already surfaced in the first hours after trump's announcement. \" no one who had a hand in torturing individuals deserves to ever hold public office again, let alone lead an agency, \" said human rights first's raha wala, per the ap. No word yet on when the senate confirmation process will begin. ( zubaydah lost his left eye after his capture by the cia, though how is unclear. )",

Moses-el raised money with the help of fellow inmates for dna testing of evidence, including body swabs and the woman's clothing, in 1995, only to discover that police had mistakenly destroyed the evidence after what they described as \" communications problems \" with the da's office, the denver post reports. In tuesday's ruling, the judge said moses-el will probably be acquitted if the case goes to trial again. The victim, who was attacked after a night of drinking, initially named three other men as potential attackers before giving police moses-el's name a day later. The breakthrough in the case came in 2013 when one of the three men, already serving time for other rape convictions, admitted to having consensual sex with the victim and to hitting her, the post reports. \" i waited a long time for this, \" moses-el told reporters after leaving jail arm-in-arm with his wife, saying he was looking forward to eating pizza \" with chopped shrimp and steak. \" he said he was excited to finally meet his 12 grandchildren, one of whom wrapped his arms around his leg and said, \" i ' m glad you're home, \" per the post.

Moses-el was convicted after the victim identified him, saying his face came to her in a dream. When police initially asked her who assaulted her, she named another man, who later confessed to having sex with her at the same time that night. Outside the jail tuesday, moses-el wore a black suit and tie as he stood beside his wife, stephanie burke, moments after hugging three of his 12 grandchildren for the first time.

Clarence moses-el, 60, had just posted a $ 50,000 bond that a judge required for his freedom after she overturned his 1988 conviction on rape and assault charges and found that he would likely be acquitted if his case went to trial again. Moses-el was convicted after the victim identified him, saying his face came to her in a dream. When police initially asked her who assaulted her, she named another man, who later confessed to having sex with her at the same time that night. Outside the jail tuesday, moses-el wore a black suit and tie as he stood beside his wife, stephanie burke, moments after hugging three of his 12 grandchildren for the first time.

        "summary": "Exxon was ahead of the game on climate change. According to lenny bernstein, who spent 20 years there as a climate expert, the company knew about the link between fossil fuels and climate change in 1981 — seven years before the issue truly became public. But for the next 27 years, exxon refused to publicly admit those realities, even as it funded climate deniers, reports the guardian. In an email, posted by the institute for applied and professional ethics at ohio university in october and now included in a report on climate disinformation, bernstein says exxon weighed evidence in support of climate change when considering whether to develop the natuna gas field off indonesia. As it contained 70 % carbon dioxide, exxon projected it would be the \" largest point source of co2 in the world, \" bernstein says. The email shows exxon knew \" climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, \" the director of the ethics institute says. While many compare the case to the tobacco industry denying the dangers of smoking, she argues \" this is an order of magnitude greater moral offense, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilization. \" \" the science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion, \" says an exxon rep, though a harvard professor notes the white house and national academy of sciences issued reports on climate change in the 1970s. Greenpeace says exxon has given $ 30 million to those backing climate denial over the years; exxon says it doesn't do so now.",

It won't be foolproof, but snoops would have to launch trojan spyware on the computer of each person they want to track — impossible on a large scale.

The coroner's office later in the day ruled her death a homicide and said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. No suspects are in custody. The couple moved to indianapolis two years ago to plant a new church. They had lived",
            "Amanda made it her life's calling to love and serve everyone she knew. Even more, she has made it her life's mission to see as many people as possible come to know jesus as their personal savior. I know that in her death and legacy even more people will come to a saving faith in christ. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt her desire for me would be to continue what we've started here in indy. I hold firm to the belief that god is still good, that he takes our tragedy and turns it into triumph, and that the best truly is yet to come. -davey blackburn"

Following the 911 call tuesday, police responded to a home in clinton, mo., around 9: 20pm local time. They were met with gunfire from a suspect, who barricaded himself inside the residence, missouri state highway patrol sgt. Bill lowe tells cnn. Officers entered the home to try to get to the women, and it was inside where the suspect shot and killed clinton police officer christopher ryan morton, 30, and wounded two other officers. The cops retreated, with the wounded taken to a hospital, before a swat team entered the home shortly after midnight. The suspect was then found to have been fatally shot, per kmbc. Police are investigating whether the gunshot came from police or was self-inflicted, reports abc news. Police say the two women heard on the 911 call were uninjured. One woman was taken into custody, per the ap. The two wounded officers — one was shot in the arm, the other in the shoulder — are in stable condition and expected to survive. That doesn't ease the pain of morton's sacrifice. \" it's hard to put it in words what you go through when you have an officer killed in the line of duty. And then to have it happen to a department after a short period of time, that's hard to wrap your head around, \" lowe says. As kmbc reports, tuesday's shooting came seven months to the day after clinton police officer gary michael, 37, was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop in august. Morton's death brings the total number of us officers killed in the line of duty this year to at least 20, per fox news.",

The study published thursday in the journal chronobiology instead cites \" circadian misalignment, \" per live science. \" we think the problem is really when the night owl tries to live in a morning-lark world, \" study author kristen knutson of northwestern university tells the los angeles times. \" they want to be up late but they have to be up early for work and so the time that they're doing things, like waking up or eating, is not at the correct time for them. \" after compiling data on 433,268 people aged 38 to 73, researchers divided them into four groups: definite morning types ( early risers ), moderate morning types, moderate evening types, and definite evening types ( night owls ). They found night owls were 10 % more likely to have died during the study period than early risers, even though participants in the two groups reported getting roughly the same amount of sleep. Night owls were also more prone to diabetes, psychological disorders, and neurological disorders, per a release. \" this is a public health issue that can no longer be ignored, \" says study co-author malcolm von schantz of the university of surrey. He suggests employers be encouraged to allow night owls to start later, when possible. ( more sleep could mean more nightmares. )",

More than 20 members of an american reconnaissance platoon and afghan troops accompanying them jogged out through the swirling dust, moving into a forest smelling of sage and pine. Three more helicopters followed, and soon roughly 100 troops were on the floor of this high-elevation valley in paktika province, near the border with pakistan. They were beginning their portion of a brigade-size operation to disrupt the haqqani network, the insurgent group that collaborates with the taliban and al qaeda and that has become a primary focus of american counterterrorism efforts since osama bin laden was killed. The group, based in pakistan's northwestern frontier, flows fighters into afghanistan and has orchestrated a long campaign of guerrilla and terrorist attacks against the afghan government and its american sponsors. Its close ties to pakistan's intelligence service, and pakistan's unwillingness to act against the haqqani headquarters in miram shah, a city not far from the afghan border, have drawn condemnation from washington and escalated tensions between two nations that officially have been counterterrorism partners. Against this backdrop, the helicopter assault into charbaran this past week highlighted both the false starts and the latest set of urgent goals guiding the american military involvement in afghanistan.

Ryan, who was elected speaker on thursday, signaled an antagonism toward the white house that both echoed his predecessor, john a. Boehner, and is likely to appeal to the party conservatives who forced mr. Boehner's resignation. Mr. Ryan taped five sunday morning news shows, in which he laid out his agenda for unifying his party and his approach to relationships with congressional colleagues, mr. Obama and republican presidential candidates. When asked to comment on the statements about immigration, a white house spokesman referred to a news briefing friday by josh earnest, the press secretary, who described the speaker's stance as \"a source of deep disappointment. \" mr. Ryan said that if the republicans were to be a successful opposition party between now and the presidential election, they would need to become an aggressive \"proposition party, \" laying out a clear"

That misconception persists no longer. As nbc 7 reports, david was abducted as a child by his father, who took him to mexico where he was raised by his grandparents. David, who speaks no english, knew all his life he was born in america, but wasn't aware of the truth of how he came to leave the country. As kathy explains to weau, \" one day my ex-husband came to my sister, she was watching him, and picked him up and never returned him. When i didn't hear from him i knew he took him to mexico. \" that truth surfaced after david tried to cross into the us on october 30. He had no papers and was detained in san diego for two days, all the while insisting he was an american — which his birth certificate, issued in chicago in 1976, ultimately proved. That led to a phone call to kathy, who was told that someone named david amaya — who she was told decades ago she couldn't report missing since he was in mexico — had been stopped by border patrol. Soon after, she confirmed it was her son. A san diego ministry is raising money to facilitate a trip for david to chippewa falls, wis., to see his mother, hopefully by thanksgiving. Though the two speak no common language, they have communicated by phone. ( in similar news, nine years later a missing wis. Girl has been found in mexico. )",

According to the ap, bob evans, under a different name, died in a california prison in 2010 after killing and dismembering his wife eight years earlier. But before that, the \" hard-drinking drifter \" was denise beaudin's boyfriend in new hampshire. Evans, beaudin, and beaudin's baby disappeared in 1981, the new hampshire union leader reports. Police believe evans murdered beaudin somewhere between new hampshire and california, ditching her daughter at an rv park in california. The girl was later adopted and is \" alive and well, \" but beaudin's body was never found. In 1985, a hunter in new hampshire found two female bodies stuffed in an oil drum. Two more were found in a second oil drum in 2000. Police now believe evans killed these victims — ranging in age from 3 to mid-20s, one of whom was his own daughter — sometime between 1980 and 1984. The bodies in the drums have never been identified. On thursday, new hampshire's assistant attorney general said evans \" certainly fits the profile of a serial killer, \" and officials are looking for more victims. During a dui arrest in 1980, evans mentioned a wife, but officials only ever found a single piece of mail as evidence of her existence. They also have no record of evan's activities in california for 12 years. ( he was an nfl draft pick, and a brazen serial killer. )",

            "Breaking news emails get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. A \" chameleon \" who died in prison while serving time for murdering his wife has now been tied to the 1981 disappearance of a new hampshire woman and the bodies of a woman and three children — one of them his own daughter — who were found in barrels in the woods. Denise beaudin disappeared with her infant daughter and boyfriend, robert evans, seen here, in 1981. Via nbc boston \" we believe we have our killer, \" said new hampshire assistant attorney general jeffrey strelzin. \" now we need to identify and try to find all of his victims. \" he said the suspect, known as bob evans and a slew of other aliases, \" certainly fits the profile of a serial killer \" and that investigators are concerned he may have murdered others they don't know about. Investigators said they followed a convoluted forensic trail to tie the cases to evans, a hard-drinking drifter who allegedly beat his victims to death and dismembered some of them: they believe he murdered girlfriend denise beaudin, a 23-year-old manchester, new hampshire, woman last seen in 1981. They suspect he killed her somewhere between new hampshire and california and kept her infant daughter, named dawn at birth, for several years",

        "summary": "You've heard of secondhand smoke, but thirdhand smoke needs to be on your radar, too. \" just because you're in a nonsmoking environment, it doesn't mean you aren't exposed to tobacco, \" says peter decarlo of drexel university, whose study was published wednesday in science advances, per the washington post. It found 29 % of air particles in a vacant college classroom in a non-smoking building could be traced to residue from cigarette smoke. Researchers say it likely originated from a nearby balcony known for \" illicit smoking activity \" and from an office occupied by smokers, both connected to the classroom via air ducts, reports the los angeles times. And drexel warns \" that uber car you jump into \" or \" the hotel room you stay in \" could be just as problematic. \" i don't think we have a clue how big the problem is, \" the president of the campaign for tobacco-free kids tells the post. Effects on humans aren't well understood, but thirdhand smoke has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer, liver damage, and diabetes in mice. And unlike secondhand smoke — which lingers only a short while but causes 7,300 lung cancer deaths a year — residual tobacco chemicals cling to walls, upholstery, and other surfaces for years, and can repeatedly become airborne, researchers say. In an experiment, air flowing through a pyrex container that had residual cigarette smoke on its glass sides carried the chemicals, reports nbc news. Researchers note they're easily spread through ventilation systems, even those with filters. ( see how thirdhand smoke touches homes. )",

Monroe lived in the valley village house a few miles north of hollywood six decades ago, when she was 17-year-old norma jean dougherty. A group of residents were trying to get historical designation for the house, but it was demolished just days before a scheduled hearing in june. According to the los angeles times, city staffers didn't want the house considered for historical protection, and it was removed to make way for a condo project. One valley village resident, donna gooley, says the demolition of monroe's old home is the major reason for an effort to recall los angeles city council member paul krekorian, a petition for which got official approval last week. Some residents blame krekorian for not supporting the effort to protect monroe's house specifically and the community he represents in general. One constituent tells the times that krekorian is \" destroying the neighborhoods \" with \" horrendous high rises. \" the petition to recall krekorian accuses him of favoring business interests in development over those of the community, my news la reports. The petition needs more than 18,500 signatures from registered voters in krekorian's district for the recall effort to move forward. It could be an uphill battle: krekorian was reelected in 2015 with 75 % of the vote.",

The report concluded that it was reasonable for wilson to be afraid of brown in their encounter last summer, and thus the officer cannot be prosecuted for killing the unarmed 18-year-old. A st.

The decisions by state and federal authorities not to charge wilson have no legal bearing on a civil case, said steve ryals, a local civil rights attorney.

            "Washington ( ap ) — the justice department won't prosecute former a ferguson, missouri, police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old, but in a scathing report released wednesday faulted the city and its law enforcement for racial bias.

( associated press ) federal officials concluded there was no evidence to disprove former officer darren wilson's testimony that he feared for his safety, nor was there reliable evidence that michael brown had his hands up when he was shot. The decision in the august 9 shooting had been expected, in part because of the high legal standard needed for a federal civil rights prosecution. Wilson, who has said brown struck him in the face and reached for his gun during a tussle, also had been cleared by a missouri grand jury in november and later resigned from the department.

            "The parents of michael brown plan to file a wrongful-death lawsuit in the near future, their attorneys announced thursday. They will sue the city of ferguson and darren wilson, the former ferguson police officer who fatally shot their son. That news followed wednesday's release of the u.s. Justice department report on its investigation into the shooting on aug. 9. The report concluded that it was reasonable for wilson to be afraid of brown in their encounter last summer, and thus the officer cannot be prosecuted for killing the unarmed 18-year-old. A st. Louis county grand jury already declined to indict wilson on any criminal charges. The decisions by state and federal authorities not to charge wilson have no legal bearing on a civil case, said steve ryals, a local civil rights attorney. But, as a practical matter, the lack of charges could influence a jury. \"it's going to be virtually impossible to find a panel that has not heard of this, \" ryals said. \"in the mind of many people, the decision of federal government is the end. \" brown's parents — lesley mcspadden and michael brown sr. — said nothing as they stood behind their attorneys at a news conference thursday at greater st. Mark family church near ferguson. Brown family attorney anthony gray said the civil suit would \"outline pretty much the same evidence \""

Sure, as ezra klein has observed, the 3-year-old consumer financial protection bureau was able to create the much-lauded consumerfinance.gov. But while that may be a model for government tech, we can't expect the same from the aged hhs. \" every organization calcifies over time, \" mcardle writes. This applies to the corporate world as well as the government: look at companies like ibm and xerox, \" which were once radical disruptors \" but \" now seem like slow-moving supertankers: hard to capsize but not exactly nimble. \" as klein has noted, \" the it department is thick with 20-year veterans \" at the centers for medicare and medicaid. And as in any comparable organization, these workers are likely to prefer things as they've always been. \" they are averse to any sort of big change, and they will fight you with every tool at their disposal, \" mcardle notes.

        "summary": "A massive cyberattack has hit computer systems around the world, the bbc reports. The ransomware attack, which is believed to be a well-known strain called petya ( the updated version is called petrwrap ), was first reported in ukraine but has quickly spread to spain, france, russia, and other countries. Coverage of the malware attack: some of the affected companies and organizations include british advertising agency wpp, ukraine's state power distributor, kiev's main airport, the ukrainian central bank, aircraft manufacturer antonov, two postal services, russian oil producer rosneft, danish shipping company maersk, multinational companies including mondelez and legal firm dla piper, and french construction materials company saint-gobain, per the bbc. Motherboard says that while it's not clear all the attacks are connected, so far the situation is looking similar to the beginning of the recent massive ransomware attack known as wannacry. Ransomware works by encrypting files, then demanding money for the encryption key. Motherboard has images of the attack text, which demands $ 300 worth of bitcoin to get files back. The week says some experts are concerned this could ultimately be bigger than wannacry; wired explains why this attack is particularly scary. For more on how petya works, slashdot recommends this video explainer. Infosecurity rounds up information from computer security firms that have researched the attack. The guardian has a tidbit from a memo wpp reportedly sent to employees asking everyone with computers using windows to turn them off and disconnect them. The verge says the chernobyl nuclear power plant has switched to manual radiation monitoring because of the attack. The telegraph is offering live updates on the attack, including the dispiriting news that there appears to be no \" kill switch \" that can offer a quick fix. Reuters notes that petya last disrupted systems in 2016. Valuewalk says no us targets have yet been reported in this attack.

        "summary": "A federal jury in milwaukee has awarded $ 6.7 million to a former inmate who charged she was repeatedly raped by a jail guard while she was pregnant, the milwaukee sentinel-journal reports. The woman filed a civil lawsuit alleging the guard, xavier thicklen, began assaulting her shortly after she was locked up in early 2013. Then 19, the woman identified only as \" jane doe \" was in the early stages of pregnancy when she said thicklen raped her at various spots in the jail. \" he used his keys, his power, his authority to get in these places and rape me, \" she testified earlier in the trial, per the sentinel-journal. Officials in milwaukee county plan to appeal the verdict. The county is liable for the payout since thicklen was a public employee on the clock at the time of the assaults. The jury declined to award the woman compensation for being shackled during labor — she gave birth to a healthy baby girl — which her legal team claimed violated her constitutional rights. A midwife testified the restraints could slow labor and endanger the child. Prosecutors dropped four sexual assault charges against thicklen, now 28, after he agreed to plead guilty to felony misconduct in november 2014, per fox6. Sentenced to three days in jail, he was given credit for time served. The victim testified the assaults still bring on nightmares. \" she sought justice and she is glad the system delivered that justice, \" her lawyer tells the sentinel-journal. \" she hopes to prevent other women from being sexually assaulted in the milwaukee county jail. \" ( a judge called a rapist ex-bishop a \" good man. \" )",
