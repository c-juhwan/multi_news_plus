When one was caught off the coast of sweden last year, a museum expert told the local that while it \" normally eats nuts, fruit, and small fish...

        "summary": "Two infants are back in the hands of their parents four months after authorities say they were switched at birth. Richard cushworth and mercedes casanella of dallas, texas, visited el salvador to give birth to their child in casanella's home country in may. But cushworth says the happy occasion turned into \" a horrible situation \" when his wife suspected she was handed the wrong child to take home. The boy had different features and darker skin than the child she saw immediately after birth, she tells the guardian. When the couple returned to the us, however, relatives noticed the child didn't look like his parents and the clip on his umbilical cord was a different color than in an early photo. A dna test eventually confirmed their worst fears: the baby boy belonged to someone else. Though the couple feared their child was sold to child traffickers, dna tests on the male children of other new mothers soon led them to their baby. The family who had been caring for the child never noticed anything amiss. The two boys were exchanged in the office of the prosecutor general in san salvador yesterday. Though cushworth tells the bbc \" this is a life-long injury that's very, very deep, \" he adds the couple is \" absolutely thrilled \" to hold their own child. Authorities are now pursuing a case against casanella's doctor, alejandro guidos, who denies any wrongdoing. His lawyers have requested a new dna test, while a doctor's association notes a baby is immediately handed to the neonatologist or pediatric nurse after birth. \" so if there is any swapping of the baby it is impossible for the obstetrician to do this, \" the group says. ( these girls were switched at birth in 1994. )",

But as of sept. 9, ice had made 43 % more arrests year-over-year, reports the washington post. Why hasn't that translated into more deportations? according to ice agents, policy experts, and immigration lawyers, illegal border crossings are down, reducing the number of would-be immigrants who can be more rapidly deported. There has also been a boost in financial support for advocacy groups offering free legal help for those facing deportation. Of those arrested between jan. 22 and sept. 2, 28,000 are \" non-criminal \" violators, triple what it was for the same period in 2016. An atlanta immigration attorney says the increase, and the overall increase in ice arrests, shows ice agents are targeting \" low-hanging fruit \": relatives of alleged violators and immigrants who've agreed to regular meetings with ice. Arrests are ongoing. In a four-day span ending wednesday, 498 people — 64 % with criminal convictions — were arrested in a crackdown on so-called \" sanctuary cities \" like los angeles and denver, reports the new york times.

The tour includes the residence for elderly nuns, the house for new sisters and their prized garden. \"it's not safe, first of all, \" daltoe said. \"secondly, it can be noisy, at times. \" right on the other side of the fence surrounding their vegetable garden, just over the border in stone park, a strip club is being built next to a convent. \"they tell us it's a restaurant, \" daltoe said. \"but officially we receive the news it's a gentlemen's cabaret. \" \"we are religious. We espouse certain beliefs, \" daltoe continued. \"as catholic religious we take vows, and we have something like this totally opposite going on. \" club owner bob itzkow describes the $ 3 million, 18,000 square foot facility he's building as a cabaret with nudity, like lido in paris, featuring hi-tech 3d",

Sometime around midnight, police say ramos entered his mother's room and strangled her, he thought to death; as he moved her with a wheelbarrow, he discovered she was still alive. Per sheriff mike chitwood: \" so he went back to strangle her again.

Wednesday's appearance offered obama a chance to regain the upper political hand that he has lost in recent weeks as gasoline prices rise, employment numbers continue to disappoint and a deficit-reduction deal with the gop that would raise the country's debt limit remains elusive. He accused republicans — no less than six times — of favoring corporate-jet owners over average folks in the party's refusal to consider tax increases as part of a deficit deal. And, showing a combative side that americans rarely see, he said that republicans \"need to do their job. \" \"they're in one week, they're out one week, \" the president said. \"and then they're saying, 'obama has got to step in.

Using the grand backdrop of an east room news conference, obama clearly had a mission wednesday: to reassert a commanding presence on the economic and foreign policy issues that are defining his presidency — and could determine whether he wins reelection. Wednesday's appearance offered obama a chance to regain the upper political hand that he has lost in recent weeks as gasoline prices rise, employment numbers continue to disappoint and a deficit-reduction deal with the gop that would raise the country's debt limit remains elusive. He accused republicans — no less than six times — of favoring corporate-jet owners over average folks in the party's refusal to consider tax increases as part of a deficit deal. And, showing a combative side that americans rarely see, he said that republicans \"need to do their job. \" \"they're in one week, they're out one week, \" the president said. \"and then they're saying, 'obama has got to step in.

Two recent examples of the trump-tillerson distance, per usa today: on monday, tillerson blamed russia for a london assassination, something the white house had stopped short of doing. Tillerson also seemed caught off guard by trump's announcement of a summit with kim jong un of north korea.the post cites statements from both trump and pompeo on the news: trump: \" i want to thank rex tillerson for his service. A great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months, and i wish him and his family well. \" pompeo: \" i am deeply grateful to president trump for permitting me to serve as director of the central intelligence agency and for this opportunity to serve as secretary of state, \" he said. \" his leadership has made america safer and i look forward to representing him and the american people to the rest of the world to further america's prosperity. \"",

Rose 2.9 % in premarket trade tuesday after the company announced positive results from a safety and efficacy study looking at a treatment for patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder. Patients with this disorder are unable to properly break down fatty acids into energy, leading to serious liver, muscle and heart issues. Researchers looked at how ultragenyx's drug, ux007, affected 75 patients, including 29 from a previous ux007 phase 2 trial showing that ux007-treated patients had fewer illness-related visits to the hospital and fewer days in the hospital per year. The safety and efficacy study reaffirmed those results, also showing a reduction in the median number of hospital visits and days in the hospital per year among those treated with the drug. Ultragenyx said it is still on track to submit a new drug application for ux007 in mid-2019.

Before the debate began, trump announced he was switching to fox because cnn's \" panel is a joke, biased and very dumb. \" the huffington post reports that during the debate, trump kept his own tweets to a minimum and mainly retweeted comments from other supporters, including some attacking tim kaine's appearance, like \" kaine looks like an evil crook out of the batman movies. \" trump also retweeted comments calling kaine a liar. As the debate progressed, trump tweeted attacks on the records of both kaine and hillary clinton, including \" icymi: pence: i ran a state that worked; kaine ran a state that failed, \" with links to campaign press releases. He accused moderator elaine quijano of interrupting pence a lot more often than kaine before concluding that pence had won the debate, usa today reports. \" mike pence won big. We should all be proud of mike! \" trump said in his final tweet of the evening.",

The security breach comes on the heels of a july report finding weaknesses in noaa's security that cyberattackers could exploit, reports nbc news.

Bradley manning's trial -- convictions on most of the charges against him, an acquittal on the most serious charge of \" aiding \" the enemy -- will do little to change the way people view him today.

Manning gave a treasure trove of classified intelligence to wikileaks which has gravely damaged our national security by releasing the names of intelligence assets, disclosed u.s. Tactics and operations, and revealed secret diplomatic negotiations.

Manning should have been convicted of aiding the enemy just as should someone who leaked weapon plans during wartime.

Matthew rader was in his mom's kitchen wednesday when he got on top of the stove, found a container of ground cinnamon, and decided to have a taste. \" he started choking. It was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed, \" brianna rader tells wlex. He was pronounced dead of asphyxiation at a hospital 90 minutes later. A coroner, who says cinnamon asphyxiation is surprisingly common, adds some of the powder made its way into matthew's lungs. His funeral will be today, per an obituary. But it \" helps ease my breaking heart just a little to think that just maybe my baby's story can save even just one child's life, \" rader writes on facebook. Though this was no cinnamon challenge, rader says her son's death should be a caution to those attempting to swallow a dry spoonful of cinnamon powder. \" cinnamon can kill, \" rader says. \" all these kids, they don't think about the fact it can hurt them. \" a doctor agrees, noting too much cinnamon dries out the mouth. \" once that happens you are more prone to vomit, \" and the bile \" can actually go back down into the lungs, \" he tells wbrc. Pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and death can result. \" i would urge everyone to pass the word that it is very dangerous, \" he says. A gofundme page to cover funeral costs has been closed after enough contributions were made by family. ( researchers say too much cinnamon can also scar a person's lungs. )",

Her support seems to be cratering even as support for the other two \" outsider \" candidates, donald trump and ben carson, is rising. What's going on? for one thing, the gop hasn't had a debate in weeks, and that's where fiorina has shined, writes david graham at the atlantic. She's also struggled to get what graham calls \" earned media, \" or consistent attention in the press. \" it's also possible, though, that fiorina's support was never really there, that she was a paper tiger erected by the press, \" writes graham. \" she doesn't seem to have a natural constituency, doesn't have much establishment support, and doesn't have the same mix of charisma and outlandish comments that has boosted trump. \" at the christian science monitor, peter grier writes that fiorina has gone through a classic cycle of an underdog candidate — \" discovery, scrutiny, and decline. \" her performance in the debates got her discovered, but then negative headlines followed about her tenure as ceo at hewlett-packard and then over allegations that she exaggerated the content of planned parenthood videos. But here's the upside for fiorina backers: \" the'decline ' part of the new candidate cycle does not have to be permanent, \" writes grier. \" some hopefuls survive the scrutiny phase, take some lumps, and then rise again. \" considering that fiorina got a big fundraising bump during her rise in the polls and has $ 5.5 million on hand, she has a chance to do just that.

        "summary": "Yes, your puppy is making those absolutely adorable faces just for you. At least that's the takeaway from a study published thursday in scientific reports. Researchers from the university of portsmouth's dog cognition centre studied 24 dogs of various breeds and came away with the first evidence that dogs move their faces more when they know humans are looking, according to a press release. Scientists have long believed the facial expressions of mammals are involuntary responses to emotions. This study shows that, at least for domesticated dogs, that may not be the case. \" the findings appear to support evidence dogs are sensitive to humans ' attention and that expressions are potentially active attempts to communicate, not simple emotional displays. \" researcher dr. Juliane kaminksi says. Researchers also found that presenting dogs with food didn't cause an increase in facial expressions — more evidence facial expressions are about communication and not emotion and also a sign dogs aren't using facial expressions to, as researcher bridget waller puts it, \" intentionally manipulate the human in order to get food, \" the guardian reports. However, the most common facial expression seen by researchers was a raising of the brow to create \" puppy dog eyes. \" that a dog's most common facial expression is one that humans find cute could be important. \"[ that ] tells us something about how domestication has shaped [ dogs ], and that it has changed them in order to be more communicative with humans, in a sense, \" waller says.",

            "Most mammalian species produce facial expressions, which form meaningful and adaptive components of the animal's behavioural repertoire. The facial architecture underlying such facial expressions is highly conserved among mammals1, suggesting that human facial expression is based on evolutionarily ancient systems. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to debate the extent to which such facial expressions are underpinned by sophisticated cognitive processes. Historically, animal facial expressions ( including human, to an extent ) have been considered inflexible and involuntary displays e.g.2,3, reflecting an individual's emotional state rather than active attempts to communicate with others. There is some evidence that non-human primate facial expressions can be mediated by the presence of an audience, suggesting that the sender has some understanding of whether the expressions can be seen by others4,5,6,7,8.

        "summary": "So is there is a deal between president trump and democrats to protect \" dreamers \" or not? based on thursday's confusion, the answer apparently boils down to semantics, observes politico. But this much is clear: trump and democrats are close enough that the president's right-wing base is furious. The details: background: democrats including nancy pelosi and chuck schumer had dinner with trump wednesday and emerged to say they'd reached an agreement to \" enshrine the protections of daca into law \" in exchange for border security improvements, excluding trump's border wall. Trump followed that up with early morning tweets saying that no final deal had been reached. ( the washington post parses his tweets and sees some \" non-denial denials \" at play, while pelosi and schumer said trump's tweets \" are not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night. \" ) trump elaborates: after his tweets, trump spoke to reporters and said he was \" fairly close \" to a deal on daca with lawmakers tied to \" massive border security. \" he added that the \" wall will come later, \" adding that gop leaders paul ryan and mitch mcconnell were \" on board. \" more elaboration: \" we're not looking at citizenship, \" trump said during a trip to florida, per the hill. \" we're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here. \" he added that \" we have to have an understanding that, whether it's in the budget or some other vehicle, in a fairly short period of time, the wall will be funded. Otherwise, we're not doing anything, \" per the ap. Coulter, et al.: the president's later comments appeared to be an attempt to soothe anger on the right that emerged upon news of his talks with democrats. One slam getting much attention is from ann coulter, formerly a huge supporter of trump, who tweeted, \" at this point, who doesn't want trump impeached? \" and at one point, breitbart news ran an \" amnesty don \" banner over its coverage. The hill rounds up criticism from others, including steve king. Ryan caution: the house speaker didn't sound quite as \" on board \" as trump suggested, saying at a news conference that any deal must be approved by the gop-controlled congress, reports the washington post: \" i think the president understands he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution. \" silver lining for gop? the wall street journal digs into how trump's",

Curtis collman iii died june 21 in crothersville, ind., with 180 times the lethal dose of methamphetamine in his system, reports buzzfeed. Court documents show curtis had awoken his father earlier that morning asking for food. Curtis collman iii reportedly said there was no food and went back to sleep. When he awoke later, he found his son bouncing his face off the floor and scratching at himself, police say. Without working lights in the home, the boy might have ingested his father's meth, left on a plate in the kitchen, thinking it was cereal, says a detective with the jackson county sheriff's department. He adds the boy suffered for hours as his father prevented friends and family from calling 911, even threatening one person with a gun. A friend said 41-year-old collman declared he wasn't going back to prison, ripped a phone out of her hand, aimed a gun at her, and threatened to kill all three of them, an affidavit reads, reports the washington post. Police say collman's parents were also prevented from seeking help, though a 911 call was eventually placed from their home, reports usa today. Four hours after curtis ' bizarre behavior was spotted, the boy was having seizures as his lips turned blue. He died later of acute methamphetamine intoxication at a hospital. Collman allegedly told police he panicked but believed his son had ingested bleach or pine-sol, per fox 59. He's charged with neglect of a dependent resulting in death, intimidation by pointing a firearm at a person, meth possession, theft, and failure to register as a sex offender. His bond is set at $ 50,000.",

No one seems entirely sure what he ' ll say, though usa today believes he ' ll use the chance to define himself in his own words — in contrast to the \" fictional barack obama \" he says republicans are running against. The ap wonders if he ' ll give any second-term policy specifics, and whether he ' ll join the democratic pile-on on mitt romney. Here's what else to watch for: joe biden is on tonight, and while it's unlikely he ' ll venture off-script into gaffe-town on a stage this big, it's perhaps telling that he ' ll speak before many tv networks tune in ( nbc will carry the speech, but cbs and abc won't ). But for all his foot-in-mouth moments, the new york times says biden is a vital part of obama's campaign. \" he always looks out for the average joe, \" says the rep prepping for debates with him. \" he connects well with hard-working americans. \" john kerry is expected to lavish praise on obama's foreign policy record, in what usa today speculates might be an audition for secretary of state if hillary clinton steps down in obama's second term as advertised. Gop turncoat charlie crist gets his turn at the podium as well, in a speech that could help obama in florida. Analysts tell watchdog.org that crist is likely laying the groundwork to run for governor again — this time as a democrat. What you won't see tonight is the open sky.

And they aren't just being used to phone home. An nbc news investigation finds cellphones, penetrating prison walls thanks to drones and even guards, have \" facilitated violence and criminal enterprise. \" in one example, three people were charged with account fraud after a man claiming to be a sheriff's officer called 78-year-old addis thompson last year demanding he pay a $ 734 fine for missing jury duty. Thompson loaded the money on two \" green dot \" cash cards and gave the man the account numbers. \" all of a sudden, the phone went dead, \" thompson says. It turns out the call came from georgia's autry state prison. Thompson says it's \" unbelievable that prisoners have the access to phones to do something of that nature. \" a corrections expert says inmates, visitors, contractors, and staff members sneak phones into prisons; they've been found in boxes of food, toilet paper, and in nerf footballs that soar inside, where inmates pay up to $ 1,000 per phone. A correctional officer at a private prison in alamo, ga., was even implicated in a \" jury duty \" scam when she was found moving money from a green dot to a prepaid visa card in her name. She said she was moving the money for her inmate boyfriend. Family members also say they've been sent photos of beaten inmates via cellphone along with requests for money to stop the violence. One inmate died after his girlfriend couldn't afford to pay up. \" i feel like it's my fault, \" she told the chattanooga free times in 2013. An attorney says \" we are at a point where we're talking about basic security measures that are not being followed. \" the georgia department of corrections says it takes the accusations seriously and is investigating extortion cases.",

The protesters remained in place for the rest of the game, though eight rows of seats 100 feet below them were cleared by police, the minneapolis star tribune reports. The star tribune describes the protesters as two men, while other sources report that they were a man and a woman. The protest did not interrupt the game in minneapolis, which the vikings won 38-10, and cbs reports that players and coaches seemed unaware of the drama above. At the end of the game, the protesters climbed back onto the roof truss, leaving the banner in place, as the stadium's sound system played the counting crows song \" hanging around. \" police and firefighters were waiting for them.

        "summary": "Is former national security adviser michael flynn now cooperating with robert mueller's special investigation? sources tell the ap and the new york times that flynn's legal team has informed trump's lawyers that they can no longer discuss the investigation with them, a move that suggests flynn is now either working with prosecutors or trying to negotiate a deal. Information-sharing deals like the one between the flynn and trump legal teams usually need to be terminated if one party begins negotiating with prosecutors or a similar conflict of interest develops, the washington post notes. Flynn has been a major figure in mueller's investigation of alleged russian election interference. Flynn's ties to russia go back to before he joined the trump campaign. He was forced out of the administration after 24 days over his talks with russian ambassador sergey kislyak during the transition period. The times'sources say flynn has recently expressed concern that his son and former chief of staff, michael flynn jr., might be charged as part of the investigation. Per the hill, mueller is already believed to have enough evidence to indict both flynns. Trump lawyer jay sekulow said thursday that the development between the legal teams was \" not entirely unexpected. \" he added: \" no one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about general flynn cooperating against the president. \" ( mueller is believed to be probing an alleged flynn plot to abduct a turkish cleric. )",

            "( eole water ) for the nearly 20 percent of the world's population who live in areas without access to fresh drinking water, getting access is a matter of life or death. Inspired by the mechanics of a dripping air conditioner, french inventor marc parent was inspired to create a solution that could bring fresh water to the most remote, driest parts of the world. Parent created a company, eole water, that produces wind turbines that literally pull fresh water out of thin air. His solution, dubbed the wms1000 uses the electricity generated from a windmill to collect and treat water without tapping into a water source such as a river, lake or well. Eole water is testing the invention in france and abu dhabi. The invention, if the company can get the economics to work, looks to be a promising solution to the water crisis. I recently interviewed thibault janin, marketing and communication director of eole water on the wms 1000 turbine to find out what's in store for this new technology. How was the idea of a wind turbine that produces water developed? thibault janin: the idea came from marc parent, founder of eole water, when he lived in the caribbean, and was subjected to water shortages. He began to work on a system that could recover moisture from the air and transform it into water. Soon after, he returned to france. He patented the process and founded eole water. Millions of people worldwide live in remote areas without any access to safe drinking water. What is the potential for the eole system to",

            "( eole water ) for the nearly 20 percent of the world's population who live in areas without access to fresh drinking water, getting access is a matter of life or death. Inspired by the mechanics of a dripping air conditioner, french inventor marc parent was inspired to create a solution that could bring fresh water to the most remote, driest parts of the world. Parent created a company, eole water, that produces wind turbines that literally pull fresh water out of thin air. His solution, dubbed the wms1000 uses the electricity generated from a windmill to collect and treat water without tapping into a water source such as a river, lake or well. Eole water is testing the invention in france and abu dhabi. The invention, if the company can get the economics to work, looks to be a promising solution to the water crisis. I recently interviewed thibault janin, marketing and communication director of eole water on the wms 1000 turbine to find out what's in store for this new technology. How was the idea of a wind turbine that produces water developed? thibault janin: the idea came from marc parent, founder of eole water, when he lived in the caribbean, and was subjected to water shortages. He began to work on a system that could recover moisture from the air and transform it into water. Soon after, he returned to france. He patented the process and founded eole water. Millions of people worldwide live in remote areas without any access to safe drinking water. What is the potential for the eole system to",
            "Marc parent, member of the official french delegation with françois hollande in qatar on june 22nd and 23rd, 2013 eole water was awarded with a special jury mention of \" enterprises and environment prize 2013 \", in the category \" innovation in technology \", organized by the french ministry of ecology, sustainable development and energy. September 2014. A new nerios.s3 is born! even more efficient and refined. Eole water at eurosatory 2016 eole water will be exhibiting at the defence and security international exhibition from 13 to 17 june 2016. Paris nord villepinte exhibition center. Booth gf598 hall 6 ( french \"eden \" pavilion ). Drinking water has never been so close to you! eole water is the pioneer in the field of water making systems using air as a source of water. The company has invented in particular the first wind turbine able to create drinking water from condensed air. Today, 150 million of people worldwide live in remote areas without any access to safe drinking water. The eole water's mission is to provide these isolated communities with drinking water.

            "Early in the morning on november 27, 2009, tiger woods allegedly had an altercation with his wife, elin nordegren, that culminated in a career-derailing car crash outside the couple's florida home. Details of what transpired are vague — the principals aren't talking, and no cameras were present. Millions of people who followed the breaking story on cnn, fox, espn, and tmz had to satisfy themselves with watching file footage of the golfer and his wife. The incident captured the world's attention, but no one could actually see it — until an animated reenactment was uploaded to the web site of an asian tabloid just hours after it happened. The 96-second videoclip featured sims-like doppelgängers of the couple and depicted the moments that everyone was clamoring to see: the vehicle colliding with a tree, an unconscious woods lying in the street as the police arrived, even nordegren chasing her husband's suv down the driveway with a golf club. Most of next media animation's videos are about scandals and crimes in hong kong and taiwan. But some of their more ambitious ( and surreal ) animations are about public figures from america. Here's a sampling from their videos about tiger woods, steve jobs, al gore, and sarah palin. Someone reposted the clip to youtube, and the crude, somewhat surreal animation quickly scored 2.5 million views. It was picked up and replayed by many western news organizations and generated an enormous amount of attention, amusement, and controversy. Mission accomplished for the man behind the video, hong kong tabloid tycoon jimmy lai. He had launched the cg production house next media animation just a month earlier with the goal of animating the news of the day. \"there's no better sensation than image. It's so in-your-face! \" the 62-year-old founder of next media says. Lai is sitting in the fourth-story office",

Brahe's body was exhumed in 2010, and it's since been established that he was neither murdered nor died of mercury poisoning ( there aren't even traces of mercury ), both of which had been rumored, reports the smithsonian. In addition to gold, the analysis also found higher levels than are common today of cobalt, arsenic, and silver. Experts say he was likely exposed to them in his laboratory, and note that while their toxicity hadn't yet been established and heavy metals killed many alchemists who worked with them, brahe's levels weren't high enough to suggest toxicity. The latest hair analysis also rules out metabolic diseases, so while researchers can now tick off a growing list of what did not kill brahe, what did remains a mystery.

The mala, a marsupial that looks a bit like a cross between a rabbit and a rat, is one of australia's most endangered mammals, with about 4,000 animals in existence on the mainland, reports the independent. Eleven different endangered species, including the mala, western quoll, golden bandicoot, bilby, and numbat, will be reintroduced as part of a \" rewilding \" campaign after the area has been cleared of cats and other predators, starting in 2019. Atticus fleming, chief executive of the australian wildlife conservancy, which now manages the sanctuary, tells the bbc that the 50 or 60 cats near the refuge \"would eat over 70,000 native animals a year. \" the fence, which is ultimately planned to be extended another 84 miles, \"is one of the most important conservation infrastructure pieces in australia, \" he says. The refuge is the largest feline-free area in australia, which has feral cats in virtually all parts of the country; the non-native animals are estimated to have pushed 20 native marsupial species to extinction. Cats also kill quite a few birds in the country: researchers estimate that feral and pet cats kill more than a million birds in australia every day, according to a 2017 guardian article.

The world's longest cat-proof fence has been built in central australia to help bring endangered species back to the area. The 44km ( 27 mile ) electric fence borders a wildlife sanctuary, and will keep out feral cats, foxes and rabbits. It is part of broader \" rewilding \" efforts to boost native populations. Animals like the mala, a type of small wallaby, will be reintroduced to a 9,400 hectare cat-free zone at newhaven wildlife sanctuary, 350km north-west of alice springs.

Kvue reports kaitlyn oliver was swimming in belton lake at temple lake park around 6: 45pm when jason stuart bernal backed up his boat, catching kaitlyn in its propeller in the process. Patrick oliver attempted to save his daughter but he too got caught in the propeller. Kaitlyn was pronounced dead an hour later, and her father has had to undergo two surgeries to amputate his legs. Kxan reported sunday that doctors didn't yet know if they saved enough of his legs to allow for prosthetic limbs. Bernal was on sunday charged with criminally negligent homicide following his arrest on saturday. The charge is punishable by up to two years in state jail. Temple police say they are still investigating the case and that other charges could be forthcoming. Kxan cites an arrest affidavit that says witnesses alerted bernal to the presence of children in the water and implored him to stop driving; bernal allegedly told police he didn't see anyone near the boat. The family of the victims has set up a gofundme page to help with medical and funeral expenses, with the fundraiser noting that patrick oliver was between jobs at the time of the accident and currently does not have health insurance. At the time of this writing, $ 36,000 had been raised.",

Fragmentation mortar bombs have been fired into densely populated neighborhoods, and the orders for \" gross human rights violations \" have come from \" the highest levels of armed forces and the government, \" the report states. The report found that the insurgent free syrian army has also committed abuses, but they were \" not comparable in scale and organization to those carried out by the state, \" the new york times notes. The un investigators provided a list of regime officials implicated in abuses, believed to include president bashar al-assad. But it will remain sealed until an international human rights court can investigate, a move russia and china have blocked. The us, along with european and arab nations, is preparing to demand that syria call a cease fire in order to allow humanitarian aid to reach the worst-hit areas, reports ap.",

A study of 72 women aged 18 to 39 linked their heart rate variability ( hrv ) — the variation in the time that lapses between one heartbeat and the next — to their overall sexual health, possibly offering a way for doctors to determine which women will benefit from libido-increasing drugs, livescience reports. Published in applied psychophysiology and biofeedback, the study found that women with a low hrv ( or steady heart rate ) more often reported sexual issues than women with an average or better hrv ( a heart rate that changes depending on the moment ). \" low hrv is likely a risk factor for sexual dysfunction in women, \" says study co-author amelia stanton. Researchers at the university of texas at austin conducted the study by measuring participants ' heartbeats while they watched film about \" a neutral subject, \" livescience reports. The participants then answered the 19-question female sexual function index, which the study explains touches on subjects like arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and sexual pain. The finding echoes other research about low hrv, which is already associated with heavy drinking, anxiety, and depression, and erectile dysfunction in men, according to a press release. Perhaps a healthier heart pumps more blood to the genitals, says stanton, who sees emotions playing a role: \" low hrv has been associated with blunted emotional responses, \" she says. \" so both blood flow and emotional responding play large roles in female sexual function. \" ( another study says that more sex might make you less happy. )",

        "summary": "The libyan regime has presented what appears to be the first credible case of a civilian killed by coalition air strikes. Reporters were escorted to a village in western libya where a family mourned their 18-month-old son, who authorities say was killed when a rocket pierced the home following a nato strike on a nearby ammunition dump. Moammar gadhafi's regime has claimed other civilians have been killed by western strikes, but has offered little solid evidence, ap notes. Unlike in other places where libyan authorities have taken reporters, the village where the boy died was free of green flags and of residents loudly demonstrating their support for gadhafi, the los angeles times notes. A reporter from the new york times was approached by villagers — including some of the boy's relatives — who said they hated gadhafi and didn't blame nato for the death. \" for 42 years, it has been dark, \" one man said. \" anyone who speaks, he kills. Everyone here wants gadhafi to go. \"",

        "summary": "Vernon hugh bowman, a 75-year-old indiana farmer, is taking on agribusiness heavyweight monsanto in a case hitting the supreme court tomorrow. Monsanto says bowman, who has been using monsanto's soybean seeds happily for years, is infringing its patents when he plants a second crop of soybeans each year. The breakdown, courtesy of npr: bowman has to sign a standard agreement when he buys monsanto seeds for his spring crop, stating he won't save any of his harvest to replant the following year. But since his second crop is riskier, he decided to use cheaper seeds for that crop. Starting in 1999, he bought soybeans from a grain elevator. Local farmers drop off their harvest there, and it's sold as \" outbound grain, \" not seed. But since most farmers use monsanto's roundup ready soybean seeds ( they're resistant to widely-used weed killer roundup ) nowadays, the beans he bought still included the roundup ready gene. Bowman didn't believe monsanto still had control over these beans; plus, he was getting a variety of different beans, not just monsanto's, so \" i couldn't imagine that they'd give a rat's behind, \" he explains. But monsanto sued, and bowman was ordered to pay the company $ 84,000 for patent infringement. \" he wanted to use our technology without paying for it, \" says a monsanto lawyer. Bowman appealed, and the supreme court agreed to hear the case. His lawyers say patent law dictates that once you buy something covered by a patent, you own it and can use it for \" ordinary pursuits of life. \" but monsanto says this \" patent exhaustion \" principle doesn't mean bowman can, effectively, make copies of monsanto's product. Time puts it this way: does a patent on a living thing extend to that thing's progeny? the biotechnology and computer software industries are on monsanto's side, because \" patent exhaustion \" could hurt them in a similar way. Twenty years ago it was easy to find cheap \" public \" seeds, but nowadays almost all seeds are patented and thus more expensive, even at small seed companies — and bowman's case could really shake things up.",
