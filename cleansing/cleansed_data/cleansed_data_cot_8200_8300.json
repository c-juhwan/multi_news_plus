The malformations are rare, according to the mayo clinic, but they can occur anywhere in the body and disrupt the vital process of allowing arteries to pump oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body, and veins to carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart and lungs. It most often occurs in the brain and spine. Lewis first baffled doctors three years ago, when tumors began to grow in his chest, reports the manchester evening news. His parents have since left the house as early as 5am to make the 160-mile round trip to birmingham children's hospital dozens of times as the boy had 15 surgeries in just two years. \" it turned my life upside down, \" says his mother, who just had a baby. \" i would just crumble if it was me but lewis is really good. \" her son made a speedy recovery after spending five days in the hospital following his april 2014 mastectomy, moving his arm normally within a month.

The arteries are responsible for taking oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. Veins carry the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. A brain avm disrupts this vital process. An arteriovenous malformation can develop anywhere in your body but occurs most often in the brain or spine. Even so, brain avms are rare and affect less than 1 percent of the population. The cause of avms is not clear. Most people are born with them, but they can occasionally form later in life. They are rarely passed down among families genetically. Some people with brain avms experience signs and symptoms, such as headache or seizures. Avms are commonly found after a brain scan for another",

And that one goal in moscow got hometown fans so riled up 6,600 miles away in mexico city that it may have created an \" artificial \" earthquake, per the new york times. In a blog post and tweet, the institute of geologic and atmospheric investigations reported two of its sensors in mexico city picked up seismic activity right around the time hirving lozano scored his goal — activity caused \" possibly because of massive jumping. \" not everyone believes the world cup event could set off a seismic shake-up, however. An expert from the national autonomous university of mexico tells the times a quake can't be caused by the \" scattered activity of fans, \" while cnn notes neither the us geological survey nor the national seismological service in mexico picked up any signs of a quake. The institute of geologic and atmospheric investigations, however, clarifies the quake wouldn't have been felt by anyone and wouldn't be classified as a geological event. Other types of \" induced \" temblors include those caused by fracking and nuclear tests, and usa today notes the \" beast quake \" caused by fans after a touchdown by the seattle seahawks ' marshawn lynch during a 2011 nfl playoff game.

Sister mary margaret kreuper, the k-8 school's former principal, and sister lana chang, were identified last monday as the two involved. Long beach press-telegram reports a forensic auditor discovered kreuper would collect the tuition checks and then turn them over to the school's bookkeepers, allegedly withholding some and depositing them in the other account. In last monday's meeting with parents and alumni, archdiocese lawyer marge graf explained where those funds next went: \" we do know that they had a pattern of going on trips, we do know they had a pattern of going to casinos \"; the nuns reportedly told others a wealthy relative funded the getaways. Where the women won't be going is jail: though kreuper has reportedly admitted taking all the money and the school notified police of its findings, it and the archdiocese are declining to press charges. That's apparently because the sisters of st. Joseph of carondelet will make full restitution on behalf of its sisters and slap them with \" severe sanctions \"; it's unclear if the order's arrangement stipulated no charges be filed.

Kreuper was the school's principal, and chang taught there.

Researchers say bones found at the ancient amphipolis site are from at least five people — including a newborn and a 60-year-old woman, the country's culture ministry said in a statement today. According to the ap and reuters, the remains of the woman and baby were found with bones from two men ages 35 to 45, as well as those of a fifth person who had been cremated. Although initial reports speculated that alexander the great may have been among the occupants of the tomb ( dating between 325bc and 300bc, with alexander's death in 323bc ), some scientists wonder if the bones belong to alexander cronies — perhaps one of his generals, his wife roxana, or even his mom, olympias ( though afp reports the ministry last month pooh-poohed the olympias theory. ) the culture ministry said 157 human bone fragments out of the 550 found so far have been matched with specific bodies; animal bones were also found. Scientists also discovered evidence of looting: \" the condition in which the bones were found indicates that they had been disturbed, \" the ministry stated, though the scavenging could have happened as far back as the second century bc.

        "summary": "Want to exercise longer without feeling wiped out? a new study suggests adding beet juice to your diet. The research, published in the american journal of physiology: regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology, zeros in on nitrate, which is found in beet juice and converted to nitric oxide in the body; the molecule has the ability to more easily dilate our blood vessels and increase blood flow. A press release on the study explains exercisers who consumed beet juice experienced this effect both while doing a progressive cycling exercise and while at rest. Blood pressure was lowered and the heart needed less oxygen during the workout, which led researchers to conclude that beet juice is \" capable of enhancing o2 delivery and reducing work of the heart \" so exercise can be \" performed at a given workload for a longer period of time before the onset of fatigue. \" better still, this bump can apparently be achieved in short order: the study's 14 male participants drank beet juice for just 15 days. The findings contrast those in a penn state study from january; researchers found the juice \" had no effect on the dilation of the brachial artery \" among volunteers tasked with doing handgrip exercises, though they did find an \" artery de-stiffening effect. \" researchers did note some potential contributing factors: participants were very young and healthy, for instance, so their \" vascular endothelial function \" was in great shape to begin with. Second, they completed \" a relatively small range of forearm exercise intensities \"; it's possible dilation would occur during a higher-intensity workout. ( want to test it out? here's how much beet juice you should try drinking. )",

            "University park, pa. -- athletes who down beet juice before exercising to increase blood flow and improve performance may be surprised at the results of a recent study conducted at penn state's noll laboratory. While beetroot juice rich in nitrates did not enhance muscle blood flow or vascular dilation during exercise, researchers found that it did \" de-stiffen \" blood vessels under resting conditions, potentially easing the workload of the heart. Endurance athletes have been known to consume the crimson supplement based on the belief that it may improve blood and oxygen flow in their muscles during training and competition. Some strength and power athletes consume it in hopes that it can improve their ability to withstand muscle fatigue during repeated bouts of high intensity exercise. Now, some patients are asking their doctors if they should drink the juice to lower their high blood pressure. Those potential benefits are what prompted david proctor, professor of kinesiology and physiology at penn state, to test the ability of the juice to enhance blood flow to exercising muscles. Proctor, with other researchers, found that the widely held belief regarding improved muscle blood flow did not hold up to their test. They report their results in the journal applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism. Proctor and his colleagues gave subjects either a placebo drink containing beetroot juice minus the nitrate or a relatively high dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. They found that the latter did not enhance the natural rise in blood flow to the forearm muscles during graded handgrip exercise. \" beetroot juice also had no effect on the dilation ( widening ) of the brachial artery in these volunteers, \" said lead author and penn state physiology graduate student",

Researchers found that the first generation of male babies conceived via a technique called intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection had lower sperm counts when they reached adulthood. Icsi injects sperm directly into an egg to fertilize it, as opposed to traditional ivf in which sperm are mixed with an egg. Icsi is used in cases where men have low sperm count or abnormalities in sperm quality or slow movement. The research confirms what scientists have long suspected: that icsi can pass along sperm abnormalities to the next generation. \" prospective parents were informed that it may well be that their sons may have impaired sperm and semen like their fathers, \" says lead researcher andre van steirteghem of vrije universiteit brussel in belgium, per the guardian. The men in the study, aged 18 to 22, were nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below normal levels as set by the world health organization. They were born between 1992 and 1996 in the early years of the now-common treatment. Although their sperm count was lower than average, \" they may still be able to father children without treatment, \" says adam balen of the british fertility society, per new scientist. Steirteghem says the findings were no reason for parents to decline icsi since the treatment could be a solution for their sons if they in turn suffer low fertility. Nick macklon of the university of southampton agreed. \" it justifies our cautious approach, \" he tells the guardian. \" it isn't any cause for alarm. \" ( it's true older men really do have worse sperm. )",

He wasn't just any grade-schooler, though: gedhun choekyi nyima had just been declared the 11th panchen lama ( second only to the dalai lama in the buddhist spiritual hierarchy ) three days before he vanished, and now tibet is demanding china give him back, npr reports. China, however, seems to have no intention of relinquishing any info on the now-26-year-old's whereabouts, let alone sending him back, claiming that it has to keep gedhun — whom chinese authorities say lives a perfectly normal life with a normal family in china — under wraps so he won't be abducted by \" separatists, \" the bbc reports. The dalai lama has often accused china of interfering in the reincarnation process used to select the dalai and panchen lamas, the news agency notes. There's another panchen lama floating around, though most exiled tibetans don't recognize him: gyaincain norbu, appointed by beijing shortly after gedhun disappeared, whom many exiles call a \" stooge of the atheist chinese communist party government, \" per the bbc. The tibetan parliament speaker says it's clear why china is holding gedhun. \" the efforts of the chinese government in keeping the panchen lama in a secret location is to deprive him of all the religious trainings that he [ needs ] to undertake so that he can teach to the future generations of tibetans, \" he says, per phayul.com. \" and … also to deny [ him ] to learn tibetan language so that he [ can't ] communicate directly with the tibetan people in the future. \" tibet may have cause to worry about gedhun's fate: the 10th panchen lama, his predecessor, died suddenly just days after he gave a speech criticizing the chinese government, the website notes.

Six sources tell the atlantic romney, former massachusetts governor and us presidential candidate, is \" actively discussing \" a senate run in utah. Republican leaders and donors, sources say, want 83-year-old incumbent sen. Orrin hatch to decline to seek re-election in 2018 and romney to take his place. The sources say romney would not move forward with the plan unless hatch approves. It seems like he might: hatch, who has served in the senate for more than 40 years, said in a recent interview that he would consider retiring if he \" could get a really outstanding person to run \" for his position, adding, \" mitt romney would be perfect. \" but hatch has since said he hasn't yet decided whether to run again, calling the buzz that surrounded his comment about romney \" premature speculation \" and \" overhyped intrigue. \" sources say romney has discussed the idea with hatch and other party leaders both in utah and washington dc. Breitbart notes that romney has \" strong links \" to utah, including a vacation home there. The atlantic says that should he decide to run, winning the seat \" would likely be a cakewalk. \" the opinion editor of the deseret news agrees, saying it would be \" the easiest senate bid in the history of the united states of america. \" even the ceo of utah's world trade center, who is considering his own run, says he'd opt out if romney ran. As for why romney might get back into politics now, his longstanding opposition to president trump is one reason; the washington post thinks trump should worry if he runs, because \" romney would come in to the senate with almost unimpeachable power to say whatever he wanted about trump, should he choose to do so. \" another reason, per a friend: romney is \" bored \" in retirement.",

Law enforcement sources tell tmz the driver of a prius may ultimately be to blame. The prius was followed by the lexus that howe was driving, which was followed by jenner's suv. The sources say the prius driver told deputies a suspicious story — that she was stopped at a red light, when she was actually 300 feet away from the light — and that deputies think she may have come to a sudden stop to make an illegal u-turn. The potential series of event: the lexus then rear-ended the prius; jenner hit the brakes and swerved but still rear-ended the lexus, pushing it into oncoming traffic, where it collided with a hummer and howe was killed. Jenner's publicist says cellphone records will confirm he was not texting; he also passed a field sobriety test and voluntarily submitted a blood sample to rule out intoxication.

It's just that diabetics ' risk of heart disease won't change much, either, maybe because any medication they're taking trumps the effects of diet and exercise. \" i think the patients in the intensive weight-loss group are very disappointed, \" adds the researcher. \" they'd worked hard to make these changes. \"",

Ronald kahn, chief academic officer at the joslin diabetes center in boston. Advertisement continue reading the main story it seemed logical that diet and exercise would help reduce that risk. An earlier federal study found that an intense diet and exercise program helped prevent overweight or obese people with elevated blood sugar levels from crossing the line into diabetes. The hope was that a similar program could also protect people from heart disease. The study randomly assigned 5,145 overweight or obese people with type 2 diabetes to either a rigorous diet and exercise regimen or to sessions in which they got general health information.

The feds touted the program as pro-green because americans were turning in low-mpg vehicles for fuel-efficient ones that would pollute less. But here's the problem: old engines had to be destroyed rather than recycled so they could never end up on the road again, reports emagazine. With the engine and drive train destroyed, these 690,000 vehicles — many of them suvs and trucks — were sent to parts dealers to be stripped by professionals or picked at by parts-buyers. Then they had to be shredded or crushed within 180 days, regardless of how many parts were left over. In the end, americans who took part in the program did buy vehicles averaging 25.4mpg rather than 15.8mpg — but \" that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions, \" reports emagazine.

You tell me. \" it was a reiteration of a point he made late friday in an interview with the new york times. It was also a bridge too far, according to ezra klein at vox.

The bible says the star of bethlehem — or \" christmas star \" — was followed by magi bearing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the birthplace of jesus. But one notre dame professor says the famous star wasn't a star at all, but a once-in-humanity alignment of planets, according to a press release. Scientists and historians have been trying for years to figure out exactly what the star of bethlehem was, offering explanations from comets to supernovas, upi reports. But grant matthews disagrees. \"it was some subtle alignment in the sky, \" he tells the national post. \" not a bright comet with a tail and so forth. \" if it was \" something really bright, spectacular, \" someone besides the magi would have noticed, he says. Matthews came up with his planetary alignment theory by looking at astronomical, biblical, and historical records. He determined that just before dawn in april of 6bc, jupiter, saturn, and the moon would all line up in the constellation aries, which was also the location of the vernal equinox; venus would be nearby in pisces; and mercury and mars would be opposite them in taurus. The magi, believed to be priests who observed the heavens, would have read meaning into these various positionings \" and recognized that it symbolized a regal birth in judea, \" matthews says. He says this exact alignment, including the vernal equinox, won't happen again for at least 500,000 years. Of course, this is assuming the authors of the bible didn't just make the whole star of bethlehem thing up. ( and now... A hipster nativity scene. )",

        "summary": "There were no mentions of liu xiaobo to be found across chinese social media sites following the nobel laureate's death on thursday, a result of government censors. But that doesn't mean liu's chinese admirers weren't paying tribute. Though \" rip \" and even the burning candle emoji were barred from site weibo, subtle references to liu could still be found, reports the new york times. Referencing a thunderstorm in beijing, one user noted, \" it must be to mark the exit of a hero. The heavens are also moved. \" others shared lui's birth and death dates and a photo of an empty chair, mimicking how the nobel prize committee acknowledged liu in 2010 while he was serving an 11-year sentence in china for inciting subversion. More coverage on the dissident's death: wife's fate: the committee that awards the nobel peace prize says it is \" deeply worried about liu xia's situation \" and has demanded chinese authorities \" lift all restrictions they have put upon her, \" reports the bbc. She has been under house arrest since 2010 amid growing concern over her mental health. The government has refused to say whether it will allow her to leave china, though secretary of state rex tillerson called on beijing to do just that, notes reuters. Last words: the hospital said liu's last words were directed to his wife: \" live on well, \" per the south china morning post. He had also written fragmentary poems to her in his final days, and the new york times has excerpts. His life: quartz has a timeline of his life. He left his studies in the us in 1989 to return to china when the tiananmen square protests broke out, and he's credited with saving the lives of many students by negotiating their departure before the tanks rolled in. His last conviction, in 2009, was for \" inciting subversion of state power \" over a manifesto he wrote on human rights. Butt out: china responded to international criticism over liu's death by telling critics to mind their own business. \"foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks, \" said a foreign ministry spokesman, per the guardian. Liu was the first nobel laureate to die in custody since german pacifist carl von ossietzky in 1938. Blackout: though the state-run global times ran an editorial calling liu \" a victim led astray by [ the ] west, \" per cnn, many in china were left in the dark about his death, which was ignored by media outlets on the mainland.",

It's just the latest sign that us-cuba relations have been transformed in the last 18 months, but a secret pregnancy could have derailed it all. The new york times shares the detail in a much longer piece on the \" secretive path \" that got us to today, reporting on a clandestine plan that allowed a member of the so-called cuban five, gerardo hernández, to artificially inseminate his wife. He was held in california; adriana pérez lived in havana, and, after the successful insemination, was now quite obviously pregnant. But she was also famous in cuba, meaning her appearance in public would've raised suspicions. White house officials moved quickly and urged the cuban government to keep her hidden from public view. It was a shock to cubans when hernández greeted a nine-months-pregnant wife, age 44, upon release. The pregnancy was hardly the only difficulty that came up during talks. As the times puts it, \" the path to a diplomatic opening was very nearly a dead end. \" cubans brought up historical disagreements, stretching back to the spanish-american war in 1898, and initially avoided mentioning human rights or us fugitives in cuba, reports mother jones. But securing the release of american alan gross, held in havana, as well as how to frame that release, was particularly thorny. The times has a detailed rundown.",

Leahy's hands, tears in her eyes, and begged them to make it possible for her to become pregnant by her husband. Mr. Leahy won approval for mr. Hernández to try artificial insemination, and cuban officials transported his sperm to a fertility clinic in panama. Change begins \"i didn't ask for any quid pro quo, but i was asking for medical treatment and better accommodations for alan gross, and as they worked out the impregnation of this woman, suddenly his situation improved considerably, \" mr. Leahy said. Unknown to the senator, more significant change was in the works. In december 2012, just weeks after winning re-election, mr. Obama directed advisers to determine whether he could do \"something big on cuba \" during his second term. Mr. Rhodes and mr. Zuniga, a honduran-born cuba expert, were charged with establishing a confidential channel with havana. In april 2013, the pair sent a message, bypassing diplomatic channels to avoid leaks. The cubans agreed to talk. Starting that june, the two white house aides began sneaking out of washington and flying to ottawa for secret talks with the cubans in a canadian government office"

The tiny bird easily steals the record for longest continuous flight by spending 10 months in the air without landing once, reports npr, by way of a study in current biology. In 2013, researchers at sweden's lund university strapped adult swifts with accelerometers that recorded when the birds flapped their wings and discovered that they spent all but two months of the year aloft, even as they migrated across the equator and back. Some touched down briefly, probably during bad weather, but, overall, more than 99 % of the 10-month nonbreeding period was spent in the sky. That means the fittingly-named birds — their species name, apus, translates to \" footless, \" reports discover — ate moths and other insects to sustain themselves while in the air. It's clear they saved energy gliding on rising air, but researchers say it's possible they slept, too. Except to lay their eggs and raise their young, which swifts do for the other two months of the year, \" there is no need for them to [ land ] unless … they encounter very bad weather, \" study author anders hedenström says, per the los angeles times. Actually, swifts are rather clumsy on the ground and their wings and feet not well suited to taking off from a flat surface, reports national geographic, so it's safer for them up in the air.

            "Photo by tsafrir abayov/flash90. With almost one in eight americans developing alzheimer's disease in older years, a vaccine is of extraordinary interest to pharmaceutical companies. Researchers from tel aviv university are working on a nasal two-in-one vaccine that could protect against both alzheimer's disease and stroke. The proposed vaccine appears to repair vascular damage in the brain by rounding up \" troops \" from the body's own immune system. According to an article soon to appear in the journal neurobiology of aging, the vaccine not only has a preventative function but could also help fight alzheimer's symptoms that are already present.

            "Photo by tsafrir abayov/flash90. With almost one in eight americans developing alzheimer's disease in older years, a vaccine is of extraordinary interest to pharmaceutical companies. Researchers from tel aviv university are working on a nasal two-in-one vaccine that could protect against both alzheimer's disease and stroke. The proposed vaccine appears to repair vascular damage in the brain by rounding up \" troops \" from the body's own immune system. According to an article soon to appear in the journal neurobiology of aging, the vaccine not only has a preventative function but could also help fight alzheimer's symptoms that are already present.

            "In june 1969, the stretch of the cuyahoga river that runs through cleveland was so polluted that it caught fire. Time magazine described the cuyahoga this way: \" chocolate-brown, oily, bubbling with subsurface gases, it oozes rather than flows. \" the spectacle of a river in flames helped galvanize the environmental movement, and the following year, with richard nixon as president, the environmental protection agency was established. In 1972, congress passed the landmark clean water act. Today, the cuyahoga is clean enough to support more than 40 species of fish. We still don't know the full extent of the environmental disaster unfolding in the gulf of mexico -- the impact on avian and aquatic life, on fisheries, on tourism, on the delicate ecology of coastal marshes and barrier islands. We do know, though, that it is the worst oil spill in our nation's history, far surpassing the exxon valdez incident. And maybe the shocking images from the gulf of dead fish, oiled pelicans and shores lapped by viscous \" brown mousse \" will refocus attention on the need to preserve the environment, not just exploit it. \" drill, baby, drill \" isn't just the bizarrely inappropriate chant that we remember from the republican national convention two years ago.

One psychotherapist tells the post that shaming kids simply \" distracts \" them, while a clinical social worker says this kind of discipline tears down self-esteem and causes resentment. Although fredrick admits he's heard these allegations of \" emotional abuse \" about his approach, he tells the post that, \" on average, everyone is applauding the mother that brought the child in — and applauding me as well. \" he also thinks that domestic-violence stories such as the ones that have recently appeared in the nfl have forced many parents to reassess older discipline techniques and seek out creative new ways to set their kids on the straight and narrow. \" you gotta reach these kids somehow, \" he tells the post.

        "summary": "The trial of alleged silk road drug market mastermind ross ulbricht begins soon, and it's expected to shine a spotlight on some of the darkest corners of the internet. Jury selection begins tomorrow for the new york city trial of the 30-year-old, who prosecutors say was the shadowy \" dread pirate roberts \" that made millions running the underground website, the ap reports. The trial is expected to last at least four weeks, and ulbricht could face life in prison if convicted. More: ulbricht is charged with conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, conspiring to commit computer hacking, and conspiring to commit money laundering, but the most damaging allegation may be that he tried to have six people who threatened his business killed. He isn't being tried for attempted murder, but prosecutors say the attempted \" hits \" help show ulbricht was the site's boss. A federal judge has overruled defense objections to allow evidence of the murder-for-hire plots to be introduced, saying the \" prejudicial effect is reduced by the government's stipulation that no actual murders were carried out. \" the same judge has also rejected ulbricht's request to exclude electronic evidence seized by government agents from his gmail and facebook accounts and a server in iceland, saying he couldn't show his rights were violated, bloomberg reports. The trial is expected to reveal more not just about the \" darknet \" where silk road operated, but about how the government is trying to crack down on it, ars technica reports, which notes that it isn't entirely clear how the government found the silk road servers before taking the site down in 2013, although ulbricht's lawyer has pointed the finger at the nsa. The judge has rejected a government request to bar mention of ulbricht's libertarian politics. In a forbes interview from 2013, the \" dread pirate roberts \" defended selling drugs. \" people own themselves, they own their bodies, and it is their right to put into their bodies whatever they choose. It is not my place, or the government's, or anyone else's to say what a person does with their own body, \" he said. He also praised the possibilities of peer-to-peer networking. \" the people now can control the flow and distribution on information, and the flow of money, \" he said. \" sector by sector the state is being cut out of the equation, and power is being returned to the individual. \" ulbricht — described in some reports as an \" ordinary nerd \" — denies being the dread pirate roberts, though their politics certainly seem similar. \" i want to",

        "summary": "The expected fda crackdown on a youth vaping \" epidemic \" is on the horizon, with the new york times and washington post reporting that most flavoured e-cigarettes will be banned from convenience stores and gas stations across the country as early as next week. Menthol and mint flavors will be exempt, but all other prepackaged flavor pods will be confined to tobacco and vape shops, which are viewed as more stringent on verifying age requirements. The new measures will include age verifications on online sales. The post predicts a \" significant impact \" on an industry considered vital for major tobacco companies now that us smoking rates are at an all-time low. The move is likely to be seen as too harsh among those who believe flavored e-cigarettes help adults quit traditional cigarettes. But while \" we don't want to foreclose the opportunity for adults to get these products … we now have evidence that a new generation is being addicted to nicotine, and we can't tolerate that, \" fda commissioner scott gottlieb told the post before the plan was settled. E-cigarette use, which rose 77 % among high schoolers and 50 % among middle schoolers in 2018, has been linked to a switch to regular cigarettes, while other long-term health effects aren't yet known. The fda previously gave major e-cigarette makers 60 days to prove they could keep their products out of youth hands. That period ends this weekend.

That find? the first evidence in downtown plymouth of a \" built environment \" predating 1700. The team found ceramics, musket balls, and more. One of the most important discoveries was evidence that a wooden post had once stood there. \" it's about much more than the artifacts, \" the head of the archaeology team says. It's about trying to pin down soil color and trying to understand constructed features that are no longer there. \" even better: the team found the remains of a cow, which they named constance, buried at the site. Native americans didn't keep domestic cattle. Kathryn ness at the plimoth plantation history museum tells fox news it's \" an incredibly exciting discovery that can fundamentally change our understanding of the 17th-century atlantic world. \" the team plans to do more digging next summer and hopes to figure out why constance was buried instead of eaten.",

        "summary": "The famous human ancestor known as lucy walked the earth some 3 million years ago, but it was her tree climbing that might have led to her demise, a new study suggests. An analysis of her partial skeleton reveals breaks in her right arm, left shoulder, right ankle, and left knee — injuries that researchers say resulted from falling from a high perch such as a tree. Lucy likely died quickly, said john kappelman, an anthropologist at the university of texas at austin, who published the findings monday in the journal nature. But several other researchers, including lucy's discoverer, disagree. They contend most of the cracks in lucy's bones are well documented and came after her death from the fossilization process and natural forces such as erosion, reports the ap. The split highlights the difficulty of pinpointing a cause of death from fossilized remains. Scientists rarely know how early humans died because skeletons are incomplete ( lucy's is 40 % complete ) and bones tend to get crushed under sand and rocks. The texas team examined lucy's bones and used high-tech imaging. Kappelman said the scans revealed multiple broken bones and no signs of healing, suggesting the injuries occurred around the time of death. He reconstructed her final moments: the 3-foot-6-inch lucy fell from at least 40 feet and hit the ground at 35mph. She landed on her feet before twisting and falling. Such an impact would have caused internal organ damage. Fractures on her upper arms suggest she tried to break her fall. Read more about the study's detractors here.",

Lucy has been at the centre of a vigorous debate about the role, if any, of arboreal locomotion in early human evolution.

Republicans, who had largely supported the tpp, nominated trump, who called it a \" disaster \" and \" rape of our country. \" even hillary clinton, who had supported the tpp while secretary of state, disowned it during the campaign, according to npr. The wall street journal reports the obama administration had hoped to get it approved by congress with the help of a democratic senate and incoming president clinton. Neither of those things happened, dealing obama a \" bitter defeat. \" leaders of both parties in congress now say they won't bring the tpp forward for a vote before obama leaves office. It will be up to trump to decide what to do with it, and the president elect has already stated his preference for renegotiating nafta and limiting imports. The tpp was set to be the biggest trade agreement in more than a decade. It got rid of many tariffs, set standards for intellectual property rights, and more. By excluding china, it was supposed to balance that country's growing power in the region. China is likely to now pursue its own trade agreements in the region, possibly to the detriment of us influence.",

Cuba's foreign ministry says the country's un delegation has \" voiced a strong protest \" against trump's \" disrespectful, unacceptable, and meddling statements, \" reuters reports. In his address, trump slammed the cuban regime as \" corrupt \" and \" destabilizing \" and said there was no chance of the us trade embargo being lifted until havana brings in \" fundamental reforms. \" other reactions: \" trump's ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times-not the 21st century un, \" tweeted iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif. \" fake empathy for iranians fools no one. \" venezuelan president nicolas maduro, who was not present for the speech, called trump \" the new hitler, \" the independent reports. Earlier, venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza responded to trump's call for democracy to be restored in the country by saying: \" no leader can come and question our democracy, can come and question our sovereignty. \" israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu gave the speech a better review. \" in over 30 years in my experience with the un, i never heard a bolder or more courageous speech, \" he said. Trump, who warned that the us would \" totally destroy \" north korea if necessary, was also applauded by south korea, the ap reports. Trump set out a \" firm and specific stance regarding the important issue of maintaining peace and security now facing the international community and the united nations, \" said a spokesman for the country's presidential office. Swedish foreign minister margot wallstrom tells the bbc: \" it was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience. \" \" this was a bombastic, nationalist speech, \" she says. \" it must have been decades since one last heard a speech like that in the un general assembly. \" senior russian lawmaker konstantin kosachev said trump painted syria, cuba, and venezuela as \" almost the worst dictatorships in the history of the humankind. \" he said that in the \" contradictory \" speech, trump expressed support for nations'sovereign rights but mixed it with a \" barefaced us pretense to determine who has such rights and who does not, \" the ap reports.

        "summary": "It was a rare form of eye cancer seen only a few times in the us in the past two decades. So when 10 new yorkers developed vitreoretinal lymphoma within four years of each other, researchers hunted for a common link. That search led them across the world to the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster: it turned out that six of the patients lived near the chernobyl plant in ukraine at the time of the catastrophic 1986 meltdown that spewed massive amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. Four patients lived in ukraine, one in poland, and one in moldova. Now they were living in new york city, and all were diagnosed with eye cancer between 2010 and 2013 — more than two decades after the disaster. Vitreoretinal lymphoma attacks white blood cells in the retina, the optic nerve, or the vitreous humor. Since its cause is unknown, \" any clues that you get as to possible causes make you very excited, \" genetic epidemiologist roxana moslehi of suny albany tells live science. Moslehi, whose research has not yet been published, eventually figured out that radiation, blamed for other lymphomas linked to chernobyl, could be the cause of the eye cancers. More research is needed to prove that radiation was to blame, but moslehi has unearthed another interesting lead: she found an israeli cluster of myeloproliferative disorders, which cause blood cells to proliferate. As with eight of the nyc cases, the israeli patients were of ashkenazi jewish origin and lived near chernobyl in 1986. ( the chernobyl zone has one thing going for it. )",

Tens of thousands of migrants this year have risked the dangerous crossing of the mediterranean, often on rickety boats and with fatal consequences. Last month, a vessel capsized off italy, killing as many as 900 people. The proposal for redistributing migrants would be based on a quota system that would take into account factors like the size of a country's population, the state of its economy and its level of joblessness, european union officials said. The plan, which has not been finalized and must be approved by national governments to take effect, is being supported by germany.

More than 200,000 migrants fleeing conflict or poverty from countries such as syria, eritrea, nigeria and somalia are estimated to have crossed the mediterranean last year, with thousands dying making the journey. Quotas would be determined using a number of factors, including a country's population, economic indicators and the number of asylum seekers previously accepted. Germany keenly supports the idea of quotas, having received 200,000 asylum applications last year. Countries such as italy and malta, where large numbers of migrants arrive by boat, have also called for eu members to share responsibility for migrants more evenly. Austrian",
            "London — as europe struggles to address a worsening migration crisis, the executive arm of the european union is expected this week to submit a proposal to distribute migrants across the 28-member bloc, officials said on monday, a plan that would encounter fierce resistance from some national governments. Tens of thousands of migrants this year have risked the dangerous crossing of the mediterranean, often on rickety boats and with fatal consequences. Last month, a vessel capsized off italy, killing as many as 900 people. The proposal for redistributing migrants would be based on a quota system that would take into account factors like the size of a country's population, the state of its economy and its level of joblessness, european union officials said. The plan, which has not been finalized and must be approved by national governments to take effect, is being supported by germany. Last year, the germans fielded one-third of the 570,800 asylum claims registered in the european union, according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees, and they are pressing for other countries to take their share."

        "summary": "That an inmate escaped from an iceland prison and fled the country on a plane that iceland's prime minister happened to be aboard turns out to not be the wildest part of sindri stefansson's story. The 31-year-old is suspected of being one of a group of thieves who stole $ 2 million worth of computer servers used to mine bitcoin; he was arrested in early february, escaped to sweden in mid-april, and spent five days on the lam in various countries. He's due to be extradited to iceland friday, and in his first interview since he was apprehended in amsterdam, he tells the new york times how easy it was to escape: prisoners at sogn can have phones, and he simply used his to look up flights the night before he fled. And here's the twist: the times reports it's not illegal to bust out of prison in iceland. As a former icelandic supreme court judge explains: \" our system supposes that a person who has been deprived of his freedom will try to regain it. It's the responsibility of prison authorities to keep him there. \" and whether stefansson should have even been in custody is up for debate: his custody order expired right before he escaped. He says police convinced him to sign a document that voluntarily extended his stay while a judge weighed whether to legally extend it. After giving his signature, he changed his mind. He says he didn't think police would look for him because of the looseness of the situation. The reykjavik grapeview reports police will now decide whether to keep him in custody in iceland or just impose a travel ban. Another weird factoid from the times: authorities haven't been able to find the stolen computers, though they've even followed a psychic's advice in their hunt for them.",

A breakthrough in the case seemed imminent in early february when the authorities detained sindri stefansson, a 31-year-old man with a rap sheet that includes drug possession and burglary. Even though he hadn't been charged, let alone convicted, the media tagged him the \"mastermind \" of the crime, largely because he was held in prison longer than any of the 11 suspects who were questioned. Then, like the computers, mr. Stefansson disappeared. For the next five days he was an international fugitive. After escaping from the prison — a feat that took surprisingly little effort, given the institution's bare-minimum approach to security — he hopped a taxi to the country's largest airport, where he boarded an early-morning flight to stockholm. In a twist that seems borrowed from a cheesy caper film, the plane also carried katrin jakobsdottir, the prime minister of iceland. \"we did not chat, \" mr.

As reported, it has come to light that the police had no legal authority to hold sindri – who was not convicted of a crime, but was only being held as a suspect in a computer heist case – in the first place. The crux of the matter rests on iceland's laws about holding suspects in custody. Sindri's period of custody at sogn prison actually expired april 16. Earlier that day, sindri appeared in court where the judge had said they would take 24 hours to decide whether or not to extend the period of sindri's custody.

The complaint filed by logan blythe's father, chad blythe, alleges the bsa nixed a project logan needed to complete to become an eagle scout because the organization decided logan couldn't fulfill this requirement with previously approved modifications put in place to accommodate logan's down syndrome. According to the family's lawyer, the merit badges logan had earned were also stripped away. \" this is the very definition of discrimination, \" blythe says in a youtube video posted last week. But per usa today, the bsa says logan's badges weren't revoked, and that he can still become an eagle scout with whatever modifications are needed and with the help of its disabilities awareness arm. \" the process of achieving the eagle scout rank is rigorous for any scout, but it is designed so that accommodations can be made for scouts with disabilities or special needs, \" a bsa statement says, per the washington post. Blythe points out the statement contradicts what the group says on its own site about alternatives not being available for the eagle scout rank, with \" no exceptions … with or without a disability. \" blythe says logan has the mental capacity of a 4-year-old, with developmental and verbal issues that make it difficult for him to follow directions, speak, or write, and impossible for him to memorize things. Blythe says his suit, which asks for damages of at least $ 1 and for the bsa to work with logan, isn't just for his son. \" if we can make a change … then the next kid … won't have to do what we're doing now, \" he notes.

        "summary": "A witness described by some media outlets as white has given his account of the michael brown shooting. One of two construction workers who gave accounts to the fbi, he says that ferguson, mo., police officer darren wilson chased brown, shot at him from behind, and when brown turned around with his hands up, shot him several more times, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports via the daily mail. But a key question remains: whether brown was moving menacingly at wilson when the officer fired. When wilson first shot at brown from behind, the worker says, brown stumbled, stopped, and said, \" ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. \" then brown moved toward wilson, who was standing 10 feet away with gun drawn: \" he's kind of walking back toward the cop, \" the worker tells the post-dispatch. At that point wilson apparently opened fire while backing up, and kept shooting when brown's hands began falling after the third shot. But it wasn't clear whether brown's movement was \" a stumble to the ground \" or \" ok, i ' m going to get you, you're already shooting me, \" says the worker. Global grind reports both witnesses as white, and the atlanta black star notes that \" interestingly, \" the post-dispatch \" never mentions that the two new witnesses are white, as if the paper thought that information wasn't relevant or important. \" ( the worker's account echoes that of brown's friend dorian johnson. )",

The pipeline off oahu's north shore delivers breakers that can force a surfer underwater until he drowns, and for several moments, there was no sign of geiselman on the surface, reports the washington post. Then a video shot from shore catches two surfboards bobbing in foam. A man suddenly appears, followed by the head of another. \" that's andre saving him, \" says a witness. South african body-boarder andre botha tells the ap he paddled toward geiselman as he fell off the wave and found him trapped underwater by ensuing waves, unconscious. He pulled him to the surface. \" the first thing that went through my mind at that point was that he was dead, \" botha tells cbs news. \" his face was a dark blue, almost purple. \" the video shows botha trying to resuscitate geiselman as he fights to reach shore. Others, including champion surfer mick fanning, eventually come to his aid, per the inertia. \" with all oncoming waves crashing he was just able to hold onto the surfer's body and help until we got there, \" a lifeguard says. \" it was amazing. \" geiselman was taken to a hospital in critical condition but has since been released. \" everyone who was there and saw the whole thing knows that botha is a hero and the only reason geiselman is alive, \" a witness says, per independent online. \" andre, he was truly evan's guardian angel, \" adds geiselman's brother. Says botha: \" i did what i had to do... It is a code of honor between those who risk their lives in the ocean. \" ( these surfers just broke a world record. )",

        "summary": "A mediterranean diet doesn't just add years to your life, it may also help you remember those years more clearly. A small study suggests a diet high in vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, plus olive oil or nuts, can improve memory and brain power, reuters reports. Researchers in barcelona performed cognitive tests on 447 adults, aged 55 to 80, then asked them to follow a low-fat diet, a mediterranean diet with five tablespoons of olive oil per day, or a mediterranean diet with 30 grams of walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds daily, the wall street journal reports. After four years, 334 took another test. The low-fat dieters showed a notable decline in memory and cognitive function. But those on a mediterranean diet with olive oil showed less decline in cognitive function related to working memory, reasoning, and attention, while those who chowed down on extra nuts showed stronger memory function than others, reports livescience. \" this was the first clinical, randomized study using a dietary pattern for good health, \" as opposed to an observational study, author emilio ros says. \" our results suggest that in an older population, a mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil or nuts may counteract age-related cognitive decline, \" the researchers explain. They say the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in nuts and olive oil may fight chemical processes in the brain that power neurodegeneration. \" if you can delay your age-related cognitive decline, you can process tasks with higher speed, \" ros says. However, a mediterranean diet had no effect on the risk of participants developing mild cognitive impairment. An expert not involved in the study says omega fats do improve brain function, but an abundance of saturated fat could hurt cell membranes, so balance is key. ( feeling forgetful? take a nap. )",

        "summary": "Upon leaving the us army, some seek a quiet life. That wasn't the case for joseph hunter, or two veterans he recruited for \" ninja work, \" including hit jobs earning them $ 35,000 each, assistant us attorney patrick egan said tuesday in opening statements at the men's trial in new york. Prosecutors say 52-year-old hunter, a former sergeant with special forces training, was head of security for south african crime boss paul le roux before recruiting adam samia, 43, and carl david stillwell, 50, per the ap. Samia, a former sniper, and stillwell, an ex-weapons trainer, then traveled to the philippines, where they allegedly set their sights on a real estate agent on le roux's \" kill list. \" pretending to be potential clients, the men drove catherine lee to the countryside outside manila in 2012 before samia shot her twice in the face, egan says. The murder is just one element of a bizarre case covering drug trafficking, the sinking of a smuggling ship, and other events in the philippines, africa, mexico, and the seychelles, the new york times reports. Le roux, arrested by dea agents in liberia in 2012, is expected to testify against the alleged henchmen, all three of whom deny the murder charges. Le roux previously helped the government set up a sting operation that saw hunter admit to planning to kill a dea agent and an informant on le roux's orders. Hunter was sentenced to 20 years in prison but will see his sentence grow if convicted of the latest charges. Defense attorneys say le roux isn't to be believed, per the ap. The trial, held in federal court in manhattan as the investigation stemmed from alleged drug trafficking in new york, is expected to last a few weeks.",
