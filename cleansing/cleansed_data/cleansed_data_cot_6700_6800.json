But at the washington post, columnist david ignatius thinks israelis, as well as moderate palestinians, are justified in their criticism because kerry \" has made a significant mistake \" — in his mission to get a cease-fire in place as quickly as possible, he gave too much ground to hamas and thus \" solidified \" the islamist group's role in gaza for the near future. \" a wiser course, which kerry rejected in his hunt for a quick diplomatic solution, would have been to negotiate the cease-fire through the palestinian authority, as part of its future role as the government of gaza, \" writes ignatius. Kerry's blunder came after hamas rejected a cease-fire proposed by egypt. In his desperation to stop the bombs, the secretary of state immediately turned to the group's \" hard-line islamist \" backers, qatar and turkey. \" any deal that reinforces hamas's stranglehold — rather than building a path toward change of government, elections, and eventual disarmament — is misconceived, \" writes ignatius. Kerry's diplomacy was meant to stop bloodshed; instead, \" it all but guarantees it in the future. \" click for his full column.",

Unlike thursday night, the more recent shootings took place in scattered locations around the city rather than in one spot. And while that is typically the case in the city's shootings — they involve one or two victims at a time — a separate tribune article notes that sprayed gunfire that hits multiple victims isn't that uncommon: it counts 89 shootings involving three victims since the start of 2012, another 31 shootings with four victims, and nine more with five victims.

The first case is from rhode island, where three 10- and 11-year-old girls ended up drunk and in the hospital, reports ap. They were hanging out at the home of one of the girls under the supervision of parent christina white, who admits to nbc 10 that she was \" quite drunk \" herself. White swears she didn't give the girls booze, but they tell a different story, and she has been charged with multiple counts of procuring alcohol for a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The night came to an end when the older sister of one of the girls drove over to pick her up about 9: 30pm and discovered that all three were stumbling and slurring. The parents of one say she had a blood-alcohol level of 0.084. The second case involving the tattoo is from pennsylvania. As the titusville herald reports, a 12-year-old girl spent the night at a friend's under the watch of randall charlton, 33, and melissa becker, 30. The girl looked on as charlton gave becker a tattoo with a kit, and asked for a small one of own. She said her mom would be fine with it, and thus ended up with a smiley face on her arm, adorned with the word \" bitch. \" as it turns out, mom wasn't fine with it, and charlton and becker face a slew of charges including endangering the welfare of a child.

Per live science, even though scott and mark kelly once boasted the same dna makeup, scott's nearly yearlong trip on the international space station in 2015 and early 2016 changed all of that — leaving him with a lower body mass, altered gut bacteria, and a seeming growth spurt of 2 inches, among other shifts. Although some of scott's changes could be tied to his body acclimating to the low-gravity environment with little oxygen, a nasa statement notes that scott's journey into the cosmos may have triggered chemical changes in his rna and dna that resulted in \" space genes, \" which affected his immune system, eyesight, bone formation, and other bodily functions. \" oftentimes when the body encounters something foreign, an immune response is activated. The body thinks there's a reason to defend itself, \" christopher mason, one of the study's lead investigators, tells business insider. Nasa calls its \" twins study, \" in which more than 200 researchers from 30 states took part, the \" perfect nature versus nurture \" experiment, with mark used as the control subject back on earth. The study was broken down into what nasa calls three \" acts \": a \" peek \" into preliminary findings, released in january 2017; the corroboration of those findings now being offered, plus some additions; and a more comprehensive report due later this year. Although most of scott's genetic alterations reverted back ( he even lost the extra 2 inches to his height ) within hours, days, and months after his return to earth, about 7 % haven't, and it's possible they may never do so.

When scott kelly returned to earth after a 340-day voyage aboard the international space station ( iss ) two years ago, he was 2 inches taller than he'd been when he left. His body mass had decreased, his gut bacteria were completely different, and — according to preliminary findings from nasa researchers — his gene expression had changed significantly. ( interestingly, scott kelly has since shrunk back down to his initial prespaceflight height. ) a new nasa statement suggests the physical and mental stresses of scott kelly's year in orbit may have activated hundreds of \" space genes \" that altered the astronaut's immune system, bone formation, eyesight and other bodily processes. While most of these genetic changes reverted to normal following scott kelly's return to earth, about 7 percent of the astronaut's gene expression remained altered — and it may stay that way permanently.

The engineer and veteran of four space flights is part of a long-term nasa study that aims to figure out how being in space changes our bodies and brains. Scott kelly is uniquely positioned to give nasa key insight into these changes because he is both an astronaut and a twin.

            "( editor's note: this story was updated on march 15 at 1: 15 pm e.t. Here is an updated article about live science's errors in reporting this study. ) scott and mark kelly are identical twin brothers — at least, they were until scott spent a year living in space. When scott kelly returned to earth after a 340-day voyage aboard the international space station ( iss ) two years ago, he was 2 inches taller than he'd been when he left. His body mass had decreased, his gut bacteria were completely different, and — according to preliminary findings from nasa researchers — his gene expression had changed significantly. ( interestingly, scott kelly has since shrunk back down to his initial prespaceflight height. ) a new nasa statement suggests the physical and mental stresses of scott kelly's year in orbit may have activated hundreds of \" space genes \" that altered the astronaut's immune system, bone formation, eyesight and other bodily processes. While most of these genetic changes reverted to normal following scott kelly's return to earth, about 7 percent of the astronaut's gene expression remained altered — and it may stay that way permanently.

The family of renisha mcbride, 19, says she was seeking help after the crash when she was killed by a man in the suburb of dearborn heights. The homeowner's lawyer says the shooting was justified after the man heard what sounded like \" a person or persons \" trying to get into his home, the detroit news reports. Her client, however, apparently told police the shooting — which the autopsy shows was not at close range — was accidental. Mcbride, a ford employee, hit a parked car more than two hours before the shooting. A lawyer for the family tells the detroit free press he has been told mcbride was confused and bleeding after the crash, told witnesses she wanted to go home, and wandered down the street. A neighbor tried to find her but was not successful. The shooting, which the teenager's family say was the result of racial profiling, has attracted nationwide attention from civil rights leaders.",

        "summary": "The parthenon once housed a massive statue of athena made of ivory and gold; researchers now say it was far from the only thing of value kept in the ancient temple. Though the attic of the parthenon has long been destroyed, researchers believe it once held millions of silver coins that have long since been spent, livescience reports. Ancient writers gave only the vaguest of clues about where athens stored its coins — in 433bc it was written that \" 3,000 talents \" had been moved to the acropolis, and that the city's reserves could get as high as 10,000 talents. One talent is equal to 1,500 silver tetradrachms — then the highest-denomination coin made in athens — meaning up to 15 million tetradrachms. So what led researchers to believe all those coins were kept in the attic? the remains of a non-ceremonial staircase leading to the attic, for one. Further, \" the attic of the parthenon is the only suitable space large enough to hold all of the coins in the treasury, \" researcher spencer pope tells livescience in an email: he estimates it was a roughly 10,168-square-foot space, meaning it had enough space to properly distribute the coins ' weight: 15 million tetradrachms could have weighed as much as 287 tons. Plus, \" while we cannot rule out the possibility that coins were distributed across numerous buildings, we should recall that the attic is the most secure space, \" says pope. That statue of athena may have helped: ancient origins runs down a list of the woes athena could inflict upon those who crossed her; fears of being turned blind or mad by the goddess may have kept thieves at bay.

Clinton won, they believe, emails stolen from the democratic committee and from senior members of her campaign could have been used to undercut her legitimacy.

In briefings to the white house and congress, intelligence officials, including those from the c.i.a. And the national security agency, have identified individual russian officials they believe were responsible. But none have been publicly penalized. It is possible that in hacking into the republican committee, russian agents were simply hedging their bets.

After analyzing 250 sediment samples at a bottle recycling plant in osaka, researchers stumbled upon a species of bacteria that consumes pet, reports the christian science monitor.

The guardian notes, however, that plastic bottles are made of highly crystallized pet, which the bacteria were slower to eat. Perhaps most interesting is that scientists believe i.

Health minister maggie de block announced thursday that iodine pills — which counteract radiation buildup in the thyroid gland, the part of the body most sensitive to iodine-131 — will be rationed out to the country's entire population of 11 million people, the telegraph reports. This expands on belgium's previous program, which only covered allotments for those who lived within 14 miles of two major nuclear plants. The augmented rations were proposed after experts recommended expanding affected areas to those within 62 miles of the plants — basically the entire nation ( nbc news notes belgium is about maryland's size ); the new rules have yet to be finalized. Rations will be sent to pharmacies, with pregnant women, breastfeeding moms, and kids getting first dibs. \" given the population density and the risk of a nuclear disaster, this was absolutely necessary, \" a belgian politician told local paper la libre, per rt.com. There are a couple of reasons for concern being cited, including a 10-hour surveillance video that shows the home of a senior belgian nuclear official that was found in the possession of a man arrested after the paris terror attacks. And there's also the dilapidated state of the four-decade-old doel and tihange nuclear plants, with reports of metal degradation and fires, but de block says the new pill mandate has nothing to do with facility safety concerns. Rt.com calls iodine-131 \" one of the most harmful radioactive elements that can be released, \" and notes it was linked to 5,000 thyroid-cancer deaths in the wake of chernobyl.",

On twitter, trump asked, \" jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the middle east by attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? bad info? \" bush, meanwhile, is defending his brother while twisting himself in knots trying to answer questions like this one from cnn's jake tapper regarding 9/11: \" if your brother and his administration bear no responsibility at all, how do you then make the jump that president obama and secretary clinton are responsible for what happened at benghazi? \" trump is reminding republicans that if they choose jeb bush, they ' ll have to answer questions like that one — and answer for george bush's polices — all through the general election, writes klein.

Bush president on 9/11/2001? trump insists that bush was president both prior to and during the 9/11 attacks, and he was therefore at least partly responsible for the security failures that permitted the tragedy. And to trump's credit, there is considerable evidence that george w. Bush was president on 9/11/2001. Jeb bush's position is harder to parse: he argues that his brother was only responsible for what happened after 9/11, suggesting, perhaps, that someone else bore the responsibilities of the presidency on 9/11/2001. Or, to be a bit kinder to his position, he argues that the measure of responsibility as president isn't whether something like 9/11 happens, but whether it happens again.

Trump has a bully's instinct for finding someone else's true weaknesses. His continued crack that bush is a \" low-energy \" candidate is devastating precisely because it identifies a weakness not just in bush's campaign style, but in the nature of his campaign. Now trump has pulled bush into an even more dangerous quagmire: his brother's presidency.

Various media outlets got their hands on the court documents, with cnn noting they mandate that jolie tell their kids, who range in age from 9 to 16, that they ' ll be \" safe with their father \" and that it's \" critical \" they have a healthy relationship with both parents. The blast lays out the order's details, which include a summer schedule on how much time pitt gets with five of the children ( 16-year-old maddox is allowed to decide this on his own due to his age ); how often jolie can contact the kids when they're with pitt; and pitt's access to the kids when they're with jolie, including giving him the numbers to each child's cellphone, which jolie isn't permitted to monitor. The kids will be traveling back and forth between los angeles and london, where jolie rents a home, and they ' ll have to keep seeing their therapist while with pitt, which family law attorney david glass ( not involved with the couple's divorce case ) tells people is a positive sign. Glass explains that the judge's order suggests the case has evolved from estrangement ( in which children have a strained relationship with one parent mainly due to that parent's actions ) to alienation, in which one parent is actively turning the kids against the other. The daily beast notes jolie's team has previously said pitt has substance abuse problems and anger management issues. Jolie, 43, filed for divorce from pitt, 54, in september 2016 after an allegedly drunken pitt was reported to have been verbally and physically abusive with at least one of their children on a flight.",

The cdc's weekly flu tracker notes a wider geographic spread of the illness across the us compared with this time of year in years past. Popular science also reports, based on baseline numbers, flu season kicked off during thanksgiving week, a few weeks ahead of the past two flu seasons. Per today, the cdc's numbers also indicate four states are reporting widespread influenza activity ( no states reported such in 2016 at this time ). And news from australia, which is hit with its flu season months before ours ( serving as a gauge of sorts for what we may expect ), isn't promising, with a record number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. As it can take weeks for the flu shot to kick in, this all underscores the importance of people getting their shots asap, experts say. Adding to the unpredictability of how we ' ll fare with the flu is that vaccines \" are usually only about 40 % to 60 % effective in the best of years, \" martin hirsch, eic of the journal of infectious diseases, tells usa today. That's what makes the australia news worrisome, as the main flu strain there was h3n2, the vaccine there was only about 10 % effective against that strain, and the h3n2 portion of that vaccine is the same one we ' ll use. But experts say it's still impossible to tell where we ' ll end up: the us may be mainly hit by strains other than h3n2, for example. Either way, hirsch and others still recommend getting the shot, as it could still mitigate symptoms and keep you out of the hospital if you do get the flu. The vaccine could also offer protection against other strains, and, thanks to herd immunity, could help protect more vulnerable people like the elderly.",

        "summary": "In his big policy speech today, president obama did indeed promise to rein in drone strikes — a higher threshold for targets will be required, along with a \" near certainty \" that no civilians will be killed — and to push once again for gitmo's closure. The full text is here. Some highlights: on gitmo: \"history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism, and those of us who fail to end it. \" terror threat: \" now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From benghazi to boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize, however, that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. \" ' crossroads ': \" america is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of james madison's warning that ' no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. ' \" when it's ok to kill an american: \" when a us citizen goes abroad to wage war against america — and is actively plotting to kill us citizens; and when neither the united states, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot — his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a swat team. \" journalists: they should not be \"at legal risk for doing their jobs, \" and obama said he has raised concerns with the attorney general about \" overreaching. \" those who should be punished are government officials who \" break the law \" by leaking classified information. Some quick assessments: new york times: \" taken together, the president's words and deeds added up to an effort to move the country away from the perpetual war on terrorism envisioned by his predecessor, george w. Bush, toward a more limited campaign against particular groups that would eventually be curtailed even if the threat of terrorism could never be eliminated, \" writes peter baker. Guardian: \" barack obama has come close to declaring the long war — the war on terror — is over, \" writes ewen macaskill. \" it is an important declaration. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, military and foreign affairs analysts were predicting the war would last for decades. \" washington post: he \" sought to more clearly define the american enemy, make lethal government actions more accountable to congress and signal that the nation's long war against al-qaeda will one day end. \"",

While democrats want a ban on gun purchases for anyone on terror watch lists, the nra and most republicans only want 72-hour delay on such purchases. It's unclear trump understands the distinction. The anti-nra position isn't a new one for trump, who was endorsed by the nra last month, cbs news reports. He called for a ban on gun purchases by people on terror watch lists back in december. In 2012, he praised president obama's call for stricter gun laws. In a 2000 book, he backed both a ban on assault weapons and tougher waiting periods. He's walked back many of those statements, but his earlier positions put him in line with the majority of americans. A poll after the massacre in orlando found more than half of americans support stricter gun laws and a ban on assault weapons. Nearly 90 % support universal background checks.

        "summary": "\" until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of amelia earhart, the most convincing argument is that they are hers. \" that's the bold conclusion of a new study published in forensic anthropology that seeks to end the mystery surrounding the fate of the famous aviator once and for all. A working party found bones on the pacific island of nikumaroro in 1940 — three years after earhart disappeared, usa today reports. Along with the bones were a woman's shoe, a box for a sextant of the type navigator fred noonan used, and a bottle of a type earhart was known to carry, according to a press release. Time reports that at the time the bones were found many people thought it was likely they were earhart's remains, then a physician in fiji named dw hoodless concluded the bones belonged to a man. The new study states hoodless was wrong. \" forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century, \" the study states. So university of tennessee professor emeritus richard jantz used modern quantitative techniques, including a computer program that estimates sex, ancestry, and stature from bone measurements, to analyze the bones. Well, technically he only analyzed the measurements of the bones, as the actual bones were lost sometime after 1940. He also compared the measurements to a photo of earhart and some of her surviving clothing. Jantz found the bones are closer to earhart than they are to 99 % of people included in a sample. \" if the bones do not belong to amelia earhart, then they are from someone very similar to her, \" the study states. Jantz concludes earhart likely died as a castaway on nikumaroro. ( one man is adamant the aviator was executed at a prison on saipan. )",

        "summary": "The cdc statistic is a harsh one: ninety-one americans die from opioid overdoses — that number includes heroin and prescription opioids — every day. A university of virginia researcher claims we're undercounting. A new study published in the american journal of preventive medicine estimates that opioid- and heroin-related mortality rates were 24 % and 22 % greater than reported between 2008 and 2014. Dr. Christopher ruhm arrived at those figures after reviewing thousands of death certificates for those who suffered a fatal overdose during that period, reports nbc news. This issue involves the death certificates themselves. States like vermont, virginia, and south dakota identified the specific drug more than 95 % of the time. But in states like pennsylvania, indiana, and mississippi, that figure didn't quite hit 50 %. Overall, in 2008, no drug was identified 25.4 % of the time; in 2014, it was 19.5 %. And so ruhm used statistical analysis to estimate how many of those deaths would have been from heroin and opioids; the university of virginia explains ruhm compared high- and low-reporting certificates from areas with similar demographics to do so. One big takeaway, per ruhm, is that some states have more severe problems than thought. He points to pennsylvania, which the cdc lists as 32nd among the 50 states for opioid deaths in 2014; ruhm's study puts it at no. 7. His study didn't knock west virginia from the no. 1 slot, but it did up its opioid death rate by about 1.3 %. ( nashville's mayor was frank about her son's overdose death as she returned to work. )",

        "summary": "Anthony shannon says he knows it was \" wrong \" to steal an aquarium's shark, carted off in a baby stroller over the weekend, but the 38-year-old insists it was \" an emergency. \" in an interview with kens-tv, the self-described marine activist who keeps five sharks and dozens of fish in three saltwater tanks at his residence says he only took the juvenile horn shark from a petting tank at the san antonio aquarium because it \" needed help \" after a visitor squeezed it. \" i knew it would gain a lot of strength being in a proper environment, \" he says, referring to a large tank in his garage. That's where police eventually found the 16-inch-long shark, resulting in a felony theft charge. But shannon's deception — which he says was unknown to his wife and friend, also present — actually began much earlier. A month ago, shannon says he inspected the aquarium while posing as a salt distributor after a friend told him about frequent deaths of marine life housed there. The general manager says shannon \" stated that we may have been sold a bad batch of salts and he needed to do water quality testing to make sure we were not putting our animals in danger, \" adding that employees \" had no reason to doubt his story until he was recognized \" on surveillance video from saturday. Ksat reports shannon has eight prior arrests including vehicle theft. Still, \" i ' m an activist, not a criminal, \" he says, claiming he was shown dead animals while on his incognito mission. The manager describes animal deaths as an \" unfortunate part of being in this business, \" however. \" we take the best possible care of our animals throughout their lives, which unfortunately do end eventually. \"",

Obama won by a huge margin, with 16 % of respondents naming him their most admired person, well ahead of pope francis and george w. Bush, who tied for second with 4 %. But that's nearly half the 30 % he had last year. Clinton, meanwhile, retained her title with 15 %, over oprah winfrey ( 6 % ), michelle obama ( 5 % ) and sarah palin ( 5 % ). That wasn't as drastic a dip as obama, but it was still a dip — clinton had 21 % last year. Obama and clinton have long had a stranglehold on the annual poll, with both winning comfortably every single year since they faced off in 2008, and clinton's streak extending long before even that.",

Both won by comfortable margins. Sixteen percent named obama, compared with 4 % each for former president george w. Bush and pope francis; clinton ( 15 % ) finished ahead of television personality oprah winfrey ( 6 % ), first lady michelle obama ( 5 % ), and former alaska gov. Sarah palin ( 5 % ). Each year, gallup asks americans to name, in an open-ended format, the man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most. This year's poll was conducted dec. 5-8. Obama has won gallup's most admired man designation each year since 2008, the year he was elected president. However, similar to his declining job approval rating this year, the percentage naming him fell to 16 % from 30 % in 2012. The remainder of the top 10 most admired men includes three former presidents ( bush, bill clinton, and jimmy carter ) and two religious leaders ( the rev. Billy graham and pope francis ). The sitting pope has finished in the top 10 each year since 1977. In addition to pope francis, actor, director, and political activist clint eastwood and texas sen. Ted cruz finished in the top 10 for the first time. This year's poll was conducted at the time of south african human rights leader nelson mandela's death. The widespread news coverage of his death helped make him top of mind for many americans, and 7 % named him as most admired man. However, because the question wording specifically asks for the name of a living man or woman, gallup does not rank deceased figures who are mentioned. Hillary clinton has been named most admired woman a total of 18 times, more than any other woman in gallup's history, including each of the last 12 years. Clinton first won the distinction in 1993, when she was first lady, and has continued to rank at or near the top of the list while serving in a variety of public roles including as u.s.

The oldest girl kept a satchel around her neck, and in it was her calendar and a photograph of singer enrique iglesias, villaseñor said. He said she kept track of changes in routine, such as when new food was served. Police said the girls were held captive for up to two years in their bedrooms, where they slept, ate and at times went to the bathroom. Surveillance cameras were pointed at their beds, and the girls were subjected to the incessant blare of music focused on their beds 24 hours a day, police said. Villaseñor said monday"

Today, republicans darrell issa and jason chaffetz laid out about a dozen incidents they say occurred prior to the sept. 11 attack that killed ambassador chris stevens. In their letter to hillary clinton, they assert \" the us mission in libya made repeated requests for increased security in benghazi, \" but all were denied by officials in washington. Asked about it today, white house spokesman jay carney said, \" i ' m not going to get into a situation under review by the state department and the fbi, \" reports abc news. Eli lake of the daily beast first reported the letter, which includes allegations that: two former consulate security guards threw explosive devices over the facility's fence in april, an event previously unreported, says politico. The letter also notes that an explosive device detonated in june. Militants posted stevens ' morning jogging route in tripoli on facebook, along with a photo of him. The ambassador reportedly stopped his runs for a week, then resumed them. ( this might explain why stevens suspected he was on an al-qaeda hit list, though he was also an \" old-school diplomat \" who bristled at the notion of too much security, a state department official tells the daily beast. ) \"was state department headquarters in washington aware of all the above incidents? \" ask issa and chaffetz of the house oversight committee. \"if not, why not? \" ( the nation's intelligence chief has defended the shifting us explanations of the benghazi assault, from spontaneous violence to planned attack, and republicans are pouncing on reports of weak security. )",

Now an entrepreneur in holland wants to help people take it to the next level — a level that's incredibly personal and somewhat macabre. Peter van der helm last year established walls and skin, a foundation that removes deceased customers'tattoos and preserves them for all eternity, npr reports. The process sounds relatively straightforward, if a little bizarre: a pathologist here in the us will slice off the erstwhile owner's body art, then freeze or store it in formaldehyde for its journey to an unnamed european lab. There, pathologists will transform the skin strip into what's basically a piece of plastic by taking out the water and fat and injecting it with a liquid polymer like silicone. Customers can then either choose to let their tattoos be displayed by walls and skin or \" loaned \" to family members ( just make sure you put in your will who gets which tat so there's no fighting ). Van der helm, a tattoo artist himself, says he was partly inspired by hearing his own customers say, \" when i die, i want to be in a museum \"; he says he already has close to 60 people who've signed up for the service, though everyone who has expressed interest is still among the living. The cost to preserve a piece of your inked body? about $ 400 per 4-inch tat. \" [ it ] makes you kind of immortal, and i think many people like that, \" the foundation's chair tells npr. \" [ tattoos are ] an art form that shouldn't just get lost when people die. \"",

        "summary": "Does this mean we now have to say a suspect was \" axoned \"? in a rebranding move meant to put some distance between the taser international company and its famous stun gun, the firm is changing its name, reuters reports. Although ceo rick smith says his team is \" proud \" of the taser brand — which will still grace products from its lucrative weapons unit, worth about 75 % of the company's $ 268.2 million in revenue in 2016 — he says the name can be \" polarizing \" and a detriment when they're trying to hawk their other products, including those under the axon umbrella, which includes body cameras for cops, as well as cameras for police vehicles and the software needed to run them. \" we don't want to be having the taser debate every time we talk about something else, \" he notes. And so what gizmodo calls the company's new \" orwellian \" name will be axon, with a special deal added into the mix, per the ap: police departments can try axon body cams for free for a year, including its management software. The departments will pay full price if they decide to hang onto the equipment after the trial is up, or if there's damage. One high-profile department has already rejected the offer: the new york daily news reports the nypd won't be accepting axon's invite, with an nypd official noting it would be \" inappropriate \" per the department's procurement rules. Instead, the nypd has chosen to purchase body cams from vievu, which said in a statement that axon's offering is \" at best unethical and at worst illegal, \" as it could leave police departments with unusable raw camera data at the end of the trial if they don't purchase the software.

Kim yo jong and the north korean delegation departed for pyongyang on her brother's private jet, reports the ap, a day after they delivered his hopes for a summit with south korean president moon jae-in. They capped their final day in south korea by joining moon at a seoul concert given by a north korean art troupe led by the head of the immensely popular moranbong band.

I have always been impressed by the fact that your mission is broad – \"to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens \" – and you have interpreted it broadly over the decades.

That is why i was stunned at your decision to publicly side with those urging the relocation of the planned islamic center in lower manhattan. You are choosing to use your immense prestige to take a side that is utterly opposed to the animating purpose of your organization.

            "Ever since 9/11, liberals and conservatives have agreed that the lasting solution to the problem of islamic terror is to prevail in the battle of ideas and to discredit radical islam, the ideology that motivates young men to kill and be killed. Victory in the war on terror will be won when a moderate, mainstream version of islam — one that is compatible with modernity — fully triumphs over the world view of osama bin laden. As the conservative middle eastern expert daniel pipes put it, \"the u.s. Role [ in this struggle ] is less to offer its own views than to help those muslims with compatible views, especially on such issues as relations with non-muslims, modernization, and the rights of women and minorities. \" to that end, early in its tenure the bush administration began a serious effort to seek out and support moderate islam. Since then, washington has funded mosques, schools, institutes, and community centers that are trying to modernize islam around the world. Except, apparently, in new york city. The debate over whether an islamic center should be built a few blocks from the world trade center has ignored a fundamental point. If there is going to be a reformist movement in islam, it is going to emerge from places like the proposed institute. We should be encouraging groups like the one behind this",
            "Dear mr. Foxman, five years ago, the adl honored me with its hubert humphrey first amendment freedoms prize. I was delighted and moved to have been chosen for it in good measure because of the high esteem in which i hold the adl. I have always been impressed by the fact that your mission is broad – \"to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens \" – and you have interpreted it broadly over the decades. You have fought discrimination against all religions, races, and creeds and have built a well-deserved reputation. That is why i was stunned at your decision to publicly side with those urging the relocation of the planned islamic center in lower manhattan. You are choosing to use your immense prestige to take a side that is utterly opposed to the animating purpose of your organization.

But the 30-year-old woman's screams ensured help arrived, reports cincinnati.com. Authorities say they responded to a call about cries coming from a shed in blanchester, ohio, around 4am wednesday and discovered the woman, who lives in the home next door, hidden in a pit within, per wlwt. The woman, whose mother had reported her missing two hours earlier, was taken to a hospital in unknown condition while officers surrounded the home on the property. Four hours later, police say a man walked out the front door \" like he was going for a stroll. \" authorities have since charged dennis dunn, 45, with kidnapping and say he also faces recent charges of disorderly conduct and drug possession. The wilmington news journal reports dunn made multiple calls to police this month complaining that people were trying to break into his house and that he could hear voices. Authorities found no evidence of an intruder. Dunn was eventually taken to a hospital for psychiatric treatment after he was seen with a pistol in his yard, but he was released 24 hours later and exhibited no change in his behavior, says blanchester's police chief. Prior to wednesday's incident, he said the closure of mental health facilities in ohio \" has left individuals like mr. Dunn without the care and treatment they need and deserve. \"",

        "summary": "A team of archaeologists has taken a big step toward confirming a tantalizing theory about king tut's tomb — one that might reveal the long-sought burial place of queen nefertiti. National geographic reports that infrared scans of the tomb suggest the existence of a hidden chamber. \" the preliminary analysis indicates the presence of an area different in its temperature than the other parts of the northern wall, \" announced egypt's antiquities minister. The difference in temperature might mean there's an open space behind that section of wall, according to discovery. If there is indeed a secret room — further tests are planned to be sure — then it could prove the theory of british archaeologist nicholas reeves, who earlier this year claimed the tomb of king tutankhamun contained two doorways that had been plastered and painted over. Reeves came up with his theory by studying high-resolution scans of the tomb. The scans were actually made to produce a fake version of king tut's tomb for tourists, but reeves says they revealed fissures in the wall that are likely doorways. He believes the larger doorway leads to a chamber where nefertiti — the wife of tutankhamun's father — is buried. Reeves theorizes that tut's tomb wasn't ready when he died unexpectedly at 19, and so he was buried in nefertiti's tomb instead. However other archaeologists claims nefertiti's mummy was already found elsewhere in 1898, though her identity was never confirmed, notes discovery. No word yet on when the next tests will be conducted. ( it seems nefertiti had an ancient facelift. )",

Among the collection, 365 were responsible for carrying out day-to-day duties, 36 ushabtis served as overseers for groups of 10 workers each, and 12 acted as monthly supervisors the dead king in the underworld was akin to the sun at night and, in the new kingdom, this was identified with the god of death, osiris. The heads of lions corresponded to the time the sun god spent in the body of the god of heaven in feline form. The facial details of the lion head – - the rims of the eyes, tip of the nose and tear ducts -- are given almost life-like properties through the use of glass. The famous gold throne found in the tomb was ordered when tutankhamen became king at the age of nine. Two tiny mummified female fetuses were found in the tomb with the king. But they were not the only companions placed in the tomb for king tut's journey to the afterlife. The boy king was buried with more than 5,000 priceless objects, including this treasure chest.

        "summary": "A new study adds to evidence that high doses of common painkillers such as ibuprofen increase the risk of heart attack. Researchers report in the british medical journal that patients prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were at greater risk for heart trouble in the first 30 days, reports the bbc. The greater risk applied to ibuprofen as well as the nsaids naproxen, diclofenac, and celecox. The first two are available over the counter in the us, while the latter two require prescriptions, notes cbs news. Researchers say those taking high doses, such as 1,200mg a day of ibuprofen, saw the greatest risk. The bright side is that the absolute risk of a heart attack among people taking nsaids is low, somewhere around 1 %, reports the independent. But because the drugs are so common, even a slight risk is meaningful from a public health perspective, says the lead researcher. \" if an individual's risk of heart attack is 1 % and it increases to 1.25 %, they don't care, \" says michele bally of the university of montreal hospital research centre. \" but at a population level, it's important, and if people want to contribute to public health, they might wish to make more informed choices. \" her team says the takeaway from the study is that doctors need to carefully weigh each patient's risks before writing these prescriptions. And another doctor says people picking them up over the counter shouldn't be lulled into thinking that makes them safe. \" if someone has to use an nsaid for pain relief, the best advice is to use the lowest possible dose and for shortest amount of time possible, \" says deepak bhatt of brigham and women's hospital.

        "summary": "Violence in egypt continued today as protesters upset about an anti-islam film clashed with police around the us embassy in cairo, reuters reports. At least 13 people have been injured; cnn reports that six of those are police officers. At the european union today for his first western visit, president mohamed morsi denounced the cairo attacks and also condemned the related attacks on the us consulate in libya, the ap reports. But it took him nearly a full day to do so, and his declaration came after a phone call with president obama that the atlantic wire describes as \" tense. \" during the call, morsi denounced the film that sparked the violence and asked obama \" to put an end to such behavior. \" the white house is now more concerned about its relationship with egypt than libya, where us ambassador chris stevens was killed, the new york times reports; the us was already concerned about the direction of morsi's islamist government before his response to the attacks — which the times describes as \" tepid. \" more from egypt and libya: two us warships are en route to libya after stevens and three other americans were killed in the violence there, the ap reports. They will be stationed off the libya coast. A fleet of marines and military aircraft had already reportedly been sent. Not everyone in libya is chanting against america: the atlantic wire has a touching photo gallery showing pro-american rallies, with signs like, \" chris stevens was a friend to all libyans \" and \" thugs and killers don't represent benghazi nor islam. \" the obama administration is looking into the possibility that the libya attack was a terrorist strike specifically planned for the september 11 anniversary, the ap reports. The white house definitely suspects the attack was planned, rather than the spontaneous actions of an angry mob. Meanwhile, wikileaks has a different idea on what spurred the attacks. \" by the us accepting the uk siege on the ecuadorian embassy in london [ where julian assange is currently holed up ] it gave tacit approval for attacks on embassies around the world, \" read a post on its official twitter feed, the guardian reports. After an uproar, the tweet was deleted and amended twice. First: \" by the us accepting the uk threat to storm the ecuadorian embassy in london it helped to normalize attacks on embassies. \" then: \" by the uk threatening to breach the ecuadorian embassy in london it helped to normalize attacks on embassies, in general. It must retract. \" protests have also broken out in yemen, and of course, the backlash over mitt romney's response continues.",

They let out a noise too high-pitched for the human ear to detect and keep coming back for more. Now, adding to the idea that rats have their own version of a giggle, researchers at the university of bern in switzerland report in the journal plos one that they've also found the rat equivalent of a smile: lowered ears that get quite rosy. They call these \" facial indicators of positive emotions \" because, though it remains unclear whether rats are actually feeling happiness — the pink ears, for instance, could merely result from increased blood flow due to physical exertion — they do seem to exhibit a positive reaction in their return for more. \" while it's likely that animals do feel emotions, it is unknown if they feel them the same way we do, \" one researcher tells national geographic, which reports that rats can be \" literally tickled pink, \" and that their ears droop because their ear muscles relax. The researcher calls himself a \" rat-tickling master, \" and says he found that rats react to tickling differently; the shy and anxious ones, for instance, prefer less rigorous tickling. Researchers have already investigated negative emotions in rats ( a \" grimace \" scale to measure pain exists ) in an attempt to inflict less suffering whenever possible, but this is one of the first studies that attempts to sort out a lab rat's positive emotions.

In video posted on youtube, the two 18-year-olds from wisconsin climb suspension cables before doing backflips and somersaults on a walkway, the san francisco chronicle reports. They also dangled above traffic on the 746-foot-high bridge. Bridge manager denis mulligan says the teens could have killed themselves — or motorists — and they could face trespassing charges. \" the golden gate bridge is not an amusement park ride, \" he says. One of the youths, peter teatime, tells the los angeles times that he and a friend decided to climb the bridge \" on a whim \" at 3am one morning while visiting san francisco last month on spring break. \" we weren't doing anything wrong, \" he says, adding that he can offer bridge officials tips on improving security. Mulligan says bridge security was set up to stop terrorists, not \" reckless behavior, \" ktvu reports. He says authorities have known about the stunt for a while, but didn't address it until tuesday to avoid inspiring copycats before new measures were in place. Climbing the bridge is a misdemeanor that can carry punishment of a year in jail or a $ 10,000 fine.",

        "summary": "People have been railing against student loans for a while now, but a new study gives you another reason to complain: loans, it suggests, can also hurt students ' mental health. The study looked at survey responses from nearly 5,000 americans born between 1980 and 1984, and found that the higher a person's student loans were, the worse off his or her mental health was. Researchers measured psychological health via the oft-used mental health inventory questionnaire, livescience reports. They found problems with both \" occupational trajectories \" ( think: a decision to stray from what you actually want to do with your life ) and \" health inequities \" ( including increased depression and stress ) related to debt, cbs atlanta notes. And in coming to their conclusions, researchers controlled for other differences between respondents, such as their income and occupation. That means student debt had an impact on mental health even if the person went on to make a lot of money in his or her future career. That's possibly because \" you cannot defer them, they follow you for the rest of your life until you pay them off, \" the lead researcher says in a press release. This, of course, is bad news considering researchers also found that the average amount of student loan debt has gone up recently. The only exception: students from low-income families saw their mental health improve with higher student loan amounts, perhaps because, researchers theorize, those loans helped boost the person's social standing and thus happiness. \" we speculate that the american middle class is suffering the most from post-graduation debt, since they do not qualify for governmental assistance, nor is their family able to take on the bulk of the costs associated with college, \" the lead author says, according to business insider.",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — sometimes all you can do is surrender to twitter. Florida sen. Marco rubio probably started out his day tuesday thinking about paid family leave, child care tax credits and other deep issues. But when twitter went wild over an awkward photo of him leaning in for a hug with ivanka trump when she arrived for a capitol hill meeting, rubio was smart enough to play along. The photo, taken by an associated press congressional reporter with an iphone, appears to show trump declining to hug rubio back as the two greet one another just outside the capitol. Twitter users dissected the seemingly awkward moment endlessly. They compared rubio to ralph wiggum from \" the simpsons \" when he doesn't get a valentine's day card, and to dr. Evil from \" austin powers \" asking his son for a hug. Rubio responded in a series of joking tweets late tuesday, announcing that he would be investigating what he termed the \" alleged failed hug. \" \" we believe we have our own unclassified photographic evidence that will shed greater details on this incident, \" the republican senator said, adding, \" we are also attempting to acquire multi-angle video which we believe will provide greater insight into this important matter. \" rubio then posted a blurry photo, taken at a different moment, showing trump's hand on rubio's shoulder as he smiles. \" new photo emerges providing more insight into alleged failed hug.

Usa today reports that industry accounts for 15 % of the country's gdp, and tourists are fleeing the country. The ap reports the nationalities of 10 of the dead have been revealed: eight britons, a belgian, and a german. Now, tourists are being evacuated from the country by the travel companies that helped send them there. The ap spoke to two that say thousands of tourists are today boarding planes home; one estimate puts the number of brits currently vacationing in tunisia at 20,000. More is coming into focus about the attack itself. Prime minister habib essid has named the gunman as seifeddine rezgui, who essid said was not previously known to law enforcement and had never left the country. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, per the us-based site intelligence group, and claimed rezgui was radicalized at mosques roughly 40 miles from sousse, where the massacre occurred. Isis previously claimed credit for the march attack on tunis ' bardo museum, in which 18 tourists also died. \" when the number of tourists drops, the government isn't collecting the money it needs to manage the sites, \" a cultural-heritage consultant tells nbc news.",

Specifically, the panel recommends that people 55 to 79 who have smoked a pack a day for 30 years should get the tests, even if they've long since quit the habit, reports livescience. The ct scans would replace the current recommendation of yearly chest x-rays, reports the boston globe.

Ritchie, a republican, says the bill could help fight obesity by \" help[ ing ] low-income consumers make wise and healthy food choices. \" democrats have voiced opposition to bills like this, and the journal news predicts it \" likely doesn't have much of a future in the democrat-controlled assembly, where it hasn't yet been introduced. \" the co-executive director of a group advocating for low-income new yorkers calls the bill \" ridiculous, \" adding, \" this is a republican attempt to make it appear that poor people use tax dollars to buy steak and lobster. \" but, as the washington post reports, a similar proposal was actually signed into law in kansas in april.

About 50 doctors and other medical staff at lucile packard children's hospital stanford in palo alto were in attendance during the 17-hour separation and reconstruction procedure on sisters eva and erika sandoval. They were conjoined from the chest down, meaning they shared a bladder, liver, and digestive system, as well as a third leg, which was used for skin grafts during the procedure. They each kept part of the shared organs, and because they now each have one leg only, they ' ll likely both be getting a prosthetic limb, surgeons have indicated. \" the twins did very well, \" dr.

Conjoined twins happen once out of every 200,000 live births, per the university of maryland medical center. Although the twins, born in august 2014 to parents who already had three grown children, learned how to crawl, jump, and dance and were described by the bee as being \" talkative \" and vivacious, \" their shared bladder resulted in dozens of urinary tract infections, and eva seemed to be growing much more than erika — a worrisome development that spurred doctors to recommend separation. A youcaring page set up for the family has so far raised nearly $ 25,000 to help them pay for medical expenses and housing. \" they look amazing. They're amazing, \" mom aida tells the bee.

Obama said he was \" heartbroken \" over the terror attack that took place earlier in the week in manchester. While cnn notes obama didn't specifically name president trump, who will meet with merkel later thursday in brussels, he did address xenophobia and nationalism, telling his audience to \" push back against those trends that would violate human rights or suppress democracy or restrict individual freedoms. \" he also noted \" some regrets \" at not being able to achieve a 100 % success rate with obamacare, but said he worries that \" progress \" is now endangered by the gop's proposed health care act.

For now, the market is reacting to butter being in short supply when compared with prior years. A u.s. Department of agriculture report issued friday showed that butter in cold storage as of the end of july was 42 % below where it was last year.

That would be the second-highest ever in data going back to 1965. Shipments in the first six months of the year were up 42 percent from 2013.

Consumers have increased purchases for five straight years, while margarine sales dropped, according to researcher nielsen nv. The gains left u.s. Stockpiles in july 42 percent lower than a year earlier, usda data show. Tight butter supplies are contributing to higher costs for buyers including panera bread co. \"ultimately, there's good demand for cream-based products that's tightening up the market, \" dave kurzawski, a chicago-based senior broker at intl fcstone inc., said in a telephone interview. \"we haven't had a tremendous amount of milk to deal with either, and the quality of fat in milk has gone down. \" butter futures for october settlement climbed 1.1 percent to $ 2.55 a pound at 11: 12 a.m. On the chicago mercantile exchange,"

Beck, who rose to prominence much like bannon did — as a fiery, fear-mongering voice in conservative circles — minced no words monday, calling bannon \" a terrifying man \" and \" a nightmare \" in a video you can see here. Beck claims bannon has a \" clear tie to white nationalists \" through his website, breitbart news. Bannon served as campaign ceo for the later stages of trump's tumultuous campaign. Although he lost out on the chief of staff job to rnc chairman reince priebus, pundits expect that as chief strategist, bannon will still wield considerable influence within trump's administration. In case you missed it, beck has toned down his views of late, and some conservatives regard his newfound moderate views as treasonous. When he recently sat for an interview with the new yorker, he was accompanied by two bodyguards due to numerous death threats he'd received. \" these people scare the hell out of me, \" he said, referring to the alt-right movement often associated with bannon's breitbart news. As for trump himself? beck told the new yorker that a meeting with the then-candidate at his mar-a-lago estate left beck with the impression that \" this guy is dangerously unhinged.

            "One recent morning, after the release of donald trump's tic tac tape and his subsequent mansplanation about locker-room talk, glenn beck clicked on a video of michelle obama campaigning for hillary clinton in a new hampshire gymnasium. The first lady ripped into trump's comments, calling them \"disgraceful \" and \"intolerable, \" and adding, \"it doesn't matter what party you belong to — democrat, republican, independent — no woman deserves to be treated this way. \" beck was mesmerized. On his radio program that day, he heralded obama's remarks as \"the most effective political speech i have heard since ronald reagan. \" \"those words hit me where i live, \" beck said the other day. He was speedwalking up eighth avenue with his wife, son, and daughter, all in from toronto. \"if you're a decent human being, those words were dead on. \" decency is a fresh palette for beck, who, at fox, used to scribble on a chalkboard while launching into conspiratorial rants about looming weimar-esque hyperinflation, barack obama's ties to radicals with population-cleansing schemes, and a marxist-islamist cabal itching to take over america. He once described clinton as \"a stereotypical bitch \" and accused obama of being a racist with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people. \" that was the old beck, he insists: \"i did a lot of freaking out about barack obama. \" but, he said, \"obama made me a better man. \" he regrets calling the president a racist and counts himself a black lives matter supporter. \"there are things unique",

        "summary": "President obama is apparently going to have to learn how to schmooze. Both the washington post and the los angeles times weigh in today on that similar theme given the new realities in washington. Post: obama arguably has a \" schmooze deficit, \" writes anne kornblut, who sees signs that he's trying to overcome his natural aversion to the practice. ( a golf date with john boehner has even been floated. ) he ' ll never be on par with the master, bill clinton, but unless he's pushed to open up — \" he just doesn't like being with people who he doesn't necessarily know, \" says one adviser — his agenda could suffer. Full story here. La times: it notes his penchant for relying almost exclusively on longtime friends and aides — it lists the \" big four \" as valerie jarrett, david axelrod, robert gibbs, and pete rouse — and says, like the post, that this strategy is a \" reflection of the obama temperament. \" he likes familiarity, but \" democratic allies and even some white house officials are hoping he doesn't lean too far in this direction, creating an insular presidency. \" full story here.",

They did so on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about the president's personality.
