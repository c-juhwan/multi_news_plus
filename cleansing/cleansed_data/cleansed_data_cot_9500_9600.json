        "summary": "Giant sinkholes like the one that swallowed a florida man this week aren't so rare as you might think — and are sometimes caused by human behavior, the christian science monitor reports. About 15,000 exist throughout florida, most of them appearing slowly over a period of years while groundwater erodes the limestone bedrock above an underground cavern. Occasionally a catastrophic sinkhole suddenly appears and takes someone with it; the state has three sinkhole fatalities on record. Damage from sinkholes has grown so costly for florida insurance companies that they successfully lobbied for a new law, making it more difficult to claim sinkhole damages. The scary part: people sometimes create their own sinkholes with construction work ( like well-drilling ) and agricultural irrigation. How to spot one coming? geologist anthony randazzo tells npr that there are tell-tale signs, like \" you begin to develop cracks in masonry structures. \" but with catastrophic sinkholes, look for \" cracking and ground-tilting or floor-tilting, doors won't open or will get stuck, windows will not be able to open properly. \" click for more on the latest sinkhole.",

Yet the tragic series of events that began thursday as a 30-foot hole swallowed jeff bush as he slept and continues saturday as rescue crews tiptoe around an \" extremely unstable \" house also highlights just how geologically hazardous the sunshine state is, and how human activities have likely increased the number of sinkholes – essentially geological plumbing breaks as the ceilings of carved-out limestone caverns buckle. Within a mile of mr. Bush's home, which apparently sits atop a 100-foot-wide cavern, are 16 verified sinkholes, compared to over 15,000 known sinkholes throughout the state. Known as a \" karst \" landscape, florida, which was once part of the seafloor, sits on a vast limestone bed cratered with caverns dug out over eons of tidal and chemical weathering. About 10 percent of the earth's landmass is karst, meaning land shaped by eroding bedrock. \" what feels capricious to those above is the toll of an active planet, one of those improbable collisions of a human timescale and a geological one, \" writes the atlantic's rebecca rosen on friday",

        "summary": "One of the more unusual details to emerge about las vegas gunman stephen paddock is that his father was a bank robber who spent about a decade on the fbi's most wanted list. In fact, benjamin paddock also had a history with vegas: in 1960 fbi agents arrested him there for three bank heists in phoenix. The agents say paddock tried to run one of them down in his car and stopped only when one of them fired through his windshield, according to newspaper accounts of the time culled by the washington post. Paddock ended up in a federal prison in texas but escaped in 1968 or 1969 ( accounts differ ). The resulting fbi poster says he is \" diagnosed as psychopathic, \" has suicidal tendencies, and should be considered armed and \" very dangerous. \" it also notes that he's an \" avid bridge player \" and a con artist. Upon his escape, paddock robbed one more bank and made his way to oregon, where he assumed the identity of bruce werner ericksen. There, \" bingo bruce \" opened the first permanent bingo parlor in the state and lived as ericksen until the feds finally caught up with him in 1978, reports the new york times. He went back to prison but was released on parole the following year. He eventually moved to texas, avoided jail on racketeering charges in the 1980s, and died in 1998. Paddock apparently played no role in the raising of his four children. Eric paddock, brother of stephen, says he grew up thinking his father was dead. Stephen would have been about 7 when his father was first sent to prison. Authorities still don't have a motive for sunday night's massacre, but stephen paddock had a hotel room full of guns.",

Although much of the hullabaloo in the 1990s originally focused on glass ' work for the new republic — a majority of which he completely made up, per the washington post — it's harper's to whom he's now making amends. In october, glass sent back $ 10,000 the magazine had paid him to write a 1998 article on his stint as a phone psychic, writing that he \" did not deserve the money. \" now it's clear why he thought that. In a letter appearing in harper's january issue, glass outlines all the discrepancies in the piece, and harper's responds with an astonishing announcement of its own: it has retracted glass ' article, the first time it's ever done so in its 165-year history. Glass documents, paragraph by paragraph, where he \" exaggerated \" and \" fabricated. \" \" this story should not be relied upon in any way, \" he writes. \" i would like to publish a retraction... That said, you may prefer that my misdeeds not be referred to in your pages again. \" but harper's was happy to do so. \" [ the ] letter makes clear that at least 5,647 of the 7,902 words of ' prophets and losses ' were based on fabrications, \" the editors write. \" a deception of that scale requires more than a simple enumerating of errors and falsehoods; we must retract the entire article. \" ( subscribers can view the article, now marked \" retracted. \" ) but while the editors lament this step, they give a shoutout to their fact-checkers, noting they've only had to do this once. \" we remain committed to getting the story straight … and to making sure no one like stephen glass is ever allowed to fool us again. \" ( check out this 1998 vanity fair piece on glass'deceptions. )",

On the second friday in may in the lobby of the hyatt hotel in the maryland suburb of bethesda, near washington, nothing less than the most sustained fraud in the history of modern journalism was unraveling. No one in lane's experience, no one, had affected him in the eerie manner of stephen glass, a 25-year-old associate editor at the new republic and a white-hot rising star in washington journalism. It wasn't just the relentlessness of the young reporter. Or the utter conviction with which glass had presented work that lane now feared was completely fabricated. It was the ingenuity of the con, the daring with which glass had concocted his attention-getting creations, the subtle ease with which even now, as he attempted to clear himself, the strangely gifted kid created an impromptu illusion using makeshift details he had spied in the lobby just seconds earlier — a chair, a cocktail table, smoke from a cigarette.

            "Omaha, neb ( reuters ) - nebraska reversed course on monday on its decision to refuse a request for a personalized license plate that refers to an unofficial holiday known as national pot smoking day, saying it would allow the plate. An attorney who supports marijuana legalization had requested a plate reading \"ne 420 \", letters and numerals that refer to nebraska and april 20, the date of the unofficial holiday. But the state's motor vehicle department had initially refused, prompting a lawsuit by the american civil liberties union. Beverly neth, director of the dmv had said the \"420 \" numerals were used to promote marijuana use, an illegal drug in the state, and had other negative associations. But the nebraska attorney general's office said on monday that frank shoemaker, who had requested the plates, would be allowed to have them.

            "Omaha, neb ( reuters ) - nebraska reversed course on monday on its decision to refuse a request for a personalized license plate that refers to an unofficial holiday known as national pot smoking day, saying it would allow the plate. An attorney who supports marijuana legalization had requested a plate reading \"ne 420 \", letters and numerals that refer to nebraska and april 20, the date of the unofficial holiday. But the state's motor vehicle department had initially refused, prompting a lawsuit by the american civil liberties union. Beverly neth, director of the dmv had said the \"420 \" numerals were used to promote marijuana use, an illegal drug in the state, and had other negative associations. But the nebraska attorney general's office said on monday that frank shoemaker, who had requested the plates, would be allowed to have them.

He's just finished a dead show in washington, d.c. And gets a pop quiz from the huffington post. Where does 420 come from? he pauses and thinks, hands on his side. \" i don't know the real origin. I know myths and rumors, \" he says. \" i ' m really confused about the first time i heard it. It was like a police code for smoking in progress or something. What's the real story? \" depending on who you ask, or their state of inebriation, there are as many varieties of answers as strains of medical bud in california. It's the number of active chemicals in marijuana. It's teatime in holland. It has something to do with hitler's birthday. It's those numbers in that bob dylan song multiplied. The origin of the term 420, celebrated around the world by pot smokers every april 20th, has long been obscured by the clouded memories of the folks who made it a phenomenon. The huffington post chased the term back to its roots and was able to find it in a lost patch of cannabis in a point reyes, california"

Tonight's episode of itv's period soap opera appears to tackle a problem that has been getting harder to ignore. Lord grantham's dog is called isis. This is awkward because it shares a name with the terrorist movement sweeping the middle east. With the jihadists showing little sign of giving up, one of them had to go, so – spoiler alert – julian fellowes and his script-writers have given the dog the heave-ho. Or so it would seem. About 20 minutes into tonight's episode, lord and lady grantham interrupt discussions on some building work to observe that isis is looking \"terribly listless \". The golden labrador does, indeed, look a little peaky, splayed out on the ground like a spatchcock chicken. \"i wonder if she's picked up a germ, \" observes lady mary, in doubtful 1920s speak. \"maybe she's eaten a squirrel. \" other moriarty-style observations include her looking \"quite fat \", and \"perhaps she's pregnant? \".

But is he a criminal? nope, at least under new york state's current laws, says the manhattan judge. As the daily news reports, the 29-year-old brooklyn resident got charged with aggravated harassment, dissemination of unlawful surveillance, and public display of offensive sexual material after he shared the photos, even tweeting them to his ex's boss and sister. Essentially, he got accused of revenge porn, and it's believed to be the first such case in new york. And while judge steven statsinger sympathized with the the victim, he knocked down the charges one by one: harassment doesn't apply because barber didn't communicate directly with his ex; the surveillance charge doesn't work because the images weren't obtained illegally; and the \" public display \" charge doesn't fly in part because twitter is a subscription service — and you're more likely to see photos of those you follow — and in part because the law focuses on physical displays such as billboards. As joe coscarelli at daily intelligencer puts it, \" the law has just not caught up with technology. \" adds richard horgan at mediabistro, \" women everywhere will likely shudder at the news that a man who shared naked pictures of a girlfriend on twitter has been exonerated. \" so far, new jersey and california are the only states with statutes on the books about revenge porn.",

        "summary": "There's been plenty written about the koch brothers, but a new book offers a fresh take on the controversial family. Prominent among the pages of jane mayer's dark money is the claim the koch clan was among a group of rich families that brought to fruition, through their fortunes and activism, today's conservative movement, all while keeping their own interests safe, the new york times reports. Also in the book: that david and charles ' father, fred c. Koch, partnered up with a us nazi sympathizer to help build a third reich oil refinery in germany that was approved by hitler himself. The koch family, along with other wealthy donors, including an heir to the mellon fortune and the \" ultra-rich, ultra-conservative devos family, \" \" were among a small, rarefied group of hugely wealthy, archconservative families that for decades poured money, often with little public disclosure, into influencing how the americans thought and voted, \" a segment reads, per the times. The book asserts that the koch family would hide behind nonprofits to fund anti-government/anti-tax movements in dc and at a statewide level — \" often leaving no fingerprints \" and \" all under the guise of promoting the public interest \" — with recent fights including a push against climate change initiatives. Mayer also claims to have some family dirt, too: during a prolonged \" brutal battle \", david's twin, william, tried to wrest the family business away from david and charles, and in a 1982 deposition, william says he helped his brothers try to blackmail their oldest brother, frederick, by threatening to expose he was gay. A koch industries rep tells the times that company bigwigs haven't read the book, but if the content \" is reflective of ms. Mayer's previous reporting of the koch family, koch industries or charles ' and david's political involvement, then we expect to have deep disagreements and strong objections to her interpretation of the facts and their sourcing. \"",

Though smokers can generally expect to live 10 years less than non-smokers, this is by no means a hard and fast rule. Jeanne calment, for example, smoked every day from the age of 21, yet was the oldest person in the world when she died at age 122 in 1997, reports the washington post. To understand such cases, scientists at ucla carried out a study on long-lived smokers, comparing 90 smokers who lived past 80 with 730 who died before 70. They identified genetic markers that allows some to endure damage from stressors such as cigarette smoke better than the rest of us. In fact, the markers \" seem to promote longevity, \" study author morgan levine says in a release. \" many of these markers are in pathways that were discovered to be important for aging and lifespan in animal models, \" says levine, noting the genes \" may facilitate lifespan extension by increasing cellular maintenance and repair. \" when researchers compared those with the gene variants to 6,447 non-smokers, they found the former group was 22 % more likely to survive into their 90s, and three times more likely to reach 100, reports upi. They also had a lesser risk of cancer. Genetic tests might someday allow people to easily learn whether they are among this \" biologically distinct \" group. Just don't bet on good news: levine notes it's \" extremely small, \" and \" even among those who are genetically predisposed to longevity, smoking cessation is likely still one of the best things they can do for their health. \" ( want to live longer? you might try chili peppers. )",

What you need to know: senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker put it like so: \" if the crown prince went in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. \" npr points out that when senators were briefed by defense secretary jim mattis and secretary of state mike pompeo last week, mattis said there was no \" smoking gun \" that showed the crown prince's hand in the murder. Sen. Lindsey graham picked up that thread tuesday, saying there may not be a smoking gun, but there is a \" smoking saw, \" a reference to the bone saw allegedly used to dismember the journalist in saudi arabia's consulate in istanbul. He added there is \" zero chance \" the crown prince, whom he described as a \" wrecking ball, \" didn't play a part, reports the ap. And the new york times has this from sen.

        "summary": "It's illegal to grow marijuana in georgia, meaning things didn't look good for javonnie mccoy when police busted him with nearly a pound of home-grown pot in his residence. Things surely looked worse for him when he got in front of a jury in dublin, georgia, and flat-out admitted that the pot was his and, yes, he did grow it. The jury's decision was seemingly a no-brainer because the law is crystal clear — and yet jurors found him not guilty last week. As bill torpy of the atlanta journal-constitution explains, it may have been because of an unusual legal strategy used by mccoy's attorney called jury nullification. Essentially, attorney catherine bernard told the panel that a jury has the power to \" nullify a law it disagrees with — at least as it pertains to the specific case under consideration, \" per a post at fitsnews. In this case, she argued that it made no sense to send an otherwise law-abiding citizen to prison over some pot plants. As marijuana moment notes, the judge would have had no choice but to impose a mandatory one-year sentence if a guilty verdict had come back. Mccoy had told the court that he was beaten into a coma in 2003 and that marijuana is about the only thing that helps with the lingering pain and trauma. \" the jury appreciated his honesty throughout the case... And recognized that a good, hard working man living a quiet life and not bothering anyone didn't deserve a felony conviction for his actions, \" writes bernard in a facebook post. For the record, she dislikes the term jury nullification. \" it's simply part of being a jury, \" she says. \" the jury judges the law and the facts. \" mccoy tells torpy it helped that the jury was made up of working-class people like himself. \" they saw i wasn't bothering nobody. \"",

Proponents and opponents of decriminalization have argued in excruciating detail over exactly how the palmetto state's pot laws should be written – with the specific language of competing proposals drawing plenty of heat and light in numerous hearings before the s.c. General assembly. As of this writing, no concrete action has been taken on the matter by south carolina lawmakers … across the border in georgia, though, the letter of the law is clear: while several legal allowances have been made for medical marijuana ( which was first legalized there in 2015 ), it remains illegal to grow marijuana and possess \"drug-related \" objects.",

Bryton mellott posted pictures on facebook sunday showing him burning the american flag ( only one image appears to still be posted ), along with a now-deleted post that proclaimed \" i am not proud to be an american \" and criticized the \" atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis. \" he ended his note with #arrestme. And that's exactly what police did after receiving calls from people concerned about their own safety: mellott also started receiving menacing online messages, as well as threats against walmart, where he works, the news-gazette reports. \" the volume of responses and specificity of threat against his place of employment ( a location where an act of violence would likely cause harm to others ), prompted police involvement in this case, \" an urbana pd statement said. Cops say they asked mellott to take down the facebook posts, explaining they understood his right to free speech but that his actions were \" causing others to be put at risk of harm, \" an urbana police sergeant tells forbes, but mellott refused. Mellott was not only charged with flag desecration ( a class 4 felony ), but also for disorderly conduct — and he was also listed as a victim of disorderly conduct due to the threats against him. What makes mellott's case extra-confusing: mellott's lawyer and others say flag desecration laws have been found unconstitutional, based on a 1990 supreme court case that said burning the flag was protected speech, time reported last year.

Further, \" there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of african descent. \" the researchers came to their conclusions after visiting the us in january, making stops in new york city, chicago, baltimore, dc, and the jackson, miss., area, per a press release.

In a study called \" paradigm-shifting \" by one of its authors, researchers at australia's deakin university say the birds sing a song to their eggs that keeps chicks from growing too big — but only when the weather is warm, with scientists suspecting that smaller birds are able to get rid of excess body heat more easily. Think of it as \" an early weather advisory, \" per smithsonian. After placing microphones in 125 zebra finch nests in an outdoor aviary, researchers heard finches singing a specific song in a certain scenario: when they were alone with eggs, the eggs were days away from hatching, and the temperature was above 78 degrees, reports new scientist. The researchers then incubated 170 finch eggs in a lab, playing a recording of the song to only half before putting them back in nests. The chicks that heard the song and grew up in warmer nests weighed less than chicks in cooler nests, produced up to six fledglings in their first breeding season ( compared to one or two ), and chose warmer nests in later life. \" hearing that call before you even hatch affects your development, affects your growth rate, \" says the university's kate buchanan.

A new study shows that the songs zebra finches sing to their eggs late in development may give the young a head start in dealing with warm weather once they hatch. Researchers have long known that birds like chickens or quails, which hatch fully capable of fending for themselves, can hear through their eggs — allowing them to imprint things like who their mother is. But or around 50 years, nobody believed anything happened inside the egg with birds that hatch dependent on their parents. A new study published today in science upends that wisdom, showing that certain zebra finch calls can change their young's growth and behavior in adulthood. \"this acoustic signal is potentially being used to program the development of offspring, \" says kate buchanan, an associate professor of animal ecology at deakin university in australia and the senior author of the new paper. \"hearing the call affects your rate of growth relative to the temperature that you experience. \"animals have very subtle ways of inferring how the environment is likely to"

            "Birds feeling the heat from warming weather may be able give their offspring an early weather advisory right through the eggshell — which could in turn help baby birds prepare for the forecast. A new study shows that the songs zebra finches sing to their eggs late in development may give the young a head start in dealing with warm weather once they hatch. Researchers have long known that birds like chickens or quails, which hatch fully capable of fending for themselves, can hear through their eggs — allowing them to imprint things like who their mother is. But or around 50 years, nobody believed anything happened inside the egg with birds that hatch dependent on their parents. A new study published today in science upends that wisdom, showing that certain zebra finch calls can change their young's growth and behavior in adulthood. \"this acoustic signal is potentially being used to program the development of offspring, \" says kate buchanan, an associate professor of animal ecology at deakin university in australia and the senior author of the new paper. \"hearing the call affects your rate of growth relative to the temperature that you experience. \"animals have very subtle ways of inferring how the environment is likely to"

But he's also got issues abroad, says a washington post editorial. He ' ll have to \" ensure that gains in afghanistan and iraq are not erased in the aftermath of us troop withdrawals, \" and now's his chance to make amends with syria. Holman w. Jenkins says what obama will do in the next four years is \" an almost comic mystery. \" the economy has a good chance of rebounding, he writes in the wall street journal, but that would have happened no matter who took office. \" he can still be a consequential president, \" he writes, but not if \" the bond market loses confidence \" in his ability to crack down on spending. Obama won't have much time to sip champagne before he has to make decisions that could \" define priorities that will shape the rest of his presidency, \" writes peter baker in the new york times. For one, the looming financial cliff and automatic tax increases will have to be dealt with, and iran's nuclear program demands prompt attention. That approaching fiscal cliff ( t-minus 54 days ) isn't going to be easy to deal with. A still-deadlocked congress means the beginning of a long \" stare-down \" on financial issues, write jake sherman and manu raju for politico. By february, congress has to raise the borrowing limit and update government reimbursement for docs who care for medicare patients. Obama's also got some jobs to fill, with both hillary clinton and tim geithner saying they ' ll be stepping down this term, reports mercurynews.com. There may also be spots opening up on the graying supreme court. Though it rarely came up during his reelection campaign, climate change is harder for obama to ignore in the wake of sandy. He briefly brought it up in his victory speech this morning, but environmentalists are hungry for more, reports the huffington post. Not everyone's holding out hope, though.

Her son will be home from school soon. He ' ll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a bb gun that looks realistic enough.

I have to lose my phone now. \" police have identified david michael kalac, 33, as a suspect. He lived with coplin, and neighbors reported hearing a loud fight the night before her death.

Her driver's license was found beside her head, with the word \" dead \" written on it.",

Experts at duke university analyzed over 1,400 modern and ancient skulls for a difference at the 50,000-year mark, and found that brows got lighter, faces rounder, and the upper area of the face became shorter at this crucial time, duke today reports. Such a \" feminized \" look, they say, corresponded with less testosterone affecting the skeleton. This would have made humans less aggressive and more cooperative at a time when art, cultural exchange, and technological innovation was on the rise. It may have also heightened male attractiveness, signaling what the study calls \" a greater propensity to invest in parenting effort. \" while the study doesn't really pertain to modern people, the researchers say, \" it's important to note that the potently biggest leap forward in human technology was likely accomplished through advances in cooperation, not intelligence. \" ( read about a supposed \" hobbit skull \" found in a cave. )",

There's speculation that the coins, valued at between $ 2.5 million and $ 4 million, might be held in the trust in the central american country. The coins were struck from gold bars recovered from the 1857 ss central america shipwreck. Thompson, who turned 65 this month, has been in jail since dec. 15, 2015 on a civil contempt charge for refusing to reveal the location of the gold to investors who put up at least $ 12.7 million for the 1988 recovery. \" mr. Thompson is ordered to sign a power of attorney that gives the government the power to probe the belizean trust, \" u.s. District judge algenon l. Marbley ruled friday. That would give ira kane, the receiver in the case, the ability to examine whether the trust holds the whereabouts of the gold coins. \" i ' m directing you to cooperate with the government, \" marbley told thompson, who wore a delaware county jail jumpsuit and again appeared in court in a wheelchair. Only by doing that could thompson \" purge himself \" of the civil contempt that, technically, has no definite end. A criminal-contempt charge had not yet been imposed for the time he fled to florida instead of showing up at a court hearing. Marbley has presided over status conferences in thompson's case practically every six months. He's given thompson time to go over documents and be examined by doctors, and allowed him to fire and hire lawyers. On friday, thompson mentioned there was a fortune at stake and he told marbley that he was \" as interested"

        "summary": "If 22 years in prison seems harsh for stealing a tv remote control, eric bramwell probably agrees — but, based on his past criminal history, authorities in illinois say it's a well-deserved sentence. Per the chicago tribune, the 35-year-old melrose park man was handed his fate on wednesday by dupage county judge robert miller after being found guilty in november for stealing a remote from a wheaton apartment complex's common area. But prosecutors say other burglaries of other remotes — and actual tv sets — he committed in six suburbs dating back to 2014 were what allowed for the extended sentence, the chicago sun-times reports. \" mr. Bramwell's illegal activity and his history have finally caught up with him, \" said state's attorney robert berlin. What finally did bramwell in: a glove was dropped during the august 1, 2015, remote disappearance, and the dna from the glove matched with bramwell's, whose records were in a database for convicted felons. At 17, bramwell was nabbed by franklin park cops and admitted to being the \" ringleader \" in a series of home break-ins that netted him and his accomplices jewelry, power tools, and other items they could pawn. Bramwell — who received an additional six months in jail from judge miller in november for uttering profanities in court — will need to put in 11 years behind bars before he's up for parole. \" regardless of what was stolen, mr. Bramwell repeatedly thumbed his nose at the law, \" said berlin. ( a minnesota burglar forgot to log out of facebook before he left the scene of the crime. )",

        "summary": "What would make the discovery of a secret passageway under teotihuacan's pyramid of the moon even more intriguing? a theory that the tunnel was used to emulate the underworld, to start. Ct scans performed by archaeologists from mexico's national institute of anthropology and history in june indicate that a tunnel about 30 feet underground spans from the pre-aztec pyramid to the middle of its outer central square, reports live science. They say it's possible the tunnel was used for ritualistic purposes, such as ceremonies marking the different agricultural cycles. \" the function of the tunnel may have been to reproduce the underworld, a world where life, animals, and plants originated, \" says archaeologist verónica ortega, per the international business times. Construction began on the pyramid of the moon in 100 bc; it was initially a small platform that grew in stages over roughly 500 years to a height of 150 feet. The pyramid is believed to have been the site of human sacrifices and other grisly rituals, indicated by its tombs holding human and animal remains. Researchers believe the tunnel below it may contain artifacts that reveal more about the ancient civilization, but further investigation is needed to confirm the tunnel's existence before it can be explored. A passageway below the temple of the sun, teotihuacan's largest pyramid, was discovered in the ' 70s but had been looted several centuries prior. An interesting side note from the ap: in contrast to other ancient mexican sites, no remains believed to belong to teotihuacan's rulers have ever been uncovered. ( meanwhile, a 3,000-year-old prosthetic toe was found in egypt ).",

            "When audiences flock to beauty and the beast this month, they will be presented with disney's first out gay character in the form of gaston's lovestruck manservant lefou. But disney, and particularly beauty and the beast, has technically already had its first gay hero – a pioneering spirit whose work resulted in some of the mouse house's most beloved songs, and whose personal tragedy left a mark on numerous disney classics. His name was howard ashman. For many disney fans, their first awareness of ashman's name was a sad one – a tribute to his legacy that appears on screen at the very end of the original beauty and the beast. \" to our friend, howard, who gave a mermaid her voice, and a beast his soul, \" it reads.

            "Los angeles — sorry, elsa is not a lesbian. But what about a gay lefou? keeping pace with fast-changing cultural and societal mores — particularly regarding sexuality — has been challenging for walt disney studios. More than most of its hollywood rivals, disney aims films at a broader audience, from preschoolers to grandparents. Disney also specializes in that most archetypical of storytelling genres: fairy tales. Disney executives blanched last year, when a movement materialized online to demand that elsa, the independent, prince-free princess from \"frozen, \" be given a girlfriend in the coming sequel. But disney does not want to be stuck in the past, either. And so it seems to have tiptoed toward open homosexuality in its new live-action version of \"beauty and the beast. \" bill condon, who directed the film, and is openly gay, told the british",

        "summary": "The anthem protests in the nfl have made steven seagal hopping mad — even though he is now a russian citizen. Speaking from moscow, the actor defended president trump and said the protests were \" outrageous \" and \" disgusting, \" variety reports. \" everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but i don't agree that they should hold the united states of america or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and imposing their political view, \" seagal said in an interview that went viral in part due to the actor's appearance, which commenters likened to a bond villain or \" a badly rendered computer game character from 1996. \" in other developments: new york giants guard justin pugh says he has had a change of heart about the nfl protests after initially condemning colin kaepernick for taking a knee during the anthem last year, the new york daily news reports. \" i posted about it and talked about it but now realizing he's not trying to disrespect the military, he's not trying to disrespect the flag or the united states, he's trying to raise questions to start a conversation, and that's definitely something i can get on board with, \" pugh says. Eric reid, who was one of the first to join kaepernick's protest last year, says the former 49er feels the original message about racial inequality has been lost, espn reports. \" he wishes that this many people were involved last year. I don't think the narrative would have went in as many directions as it went if we had more solidarity, \" reid says. Directtv has been offering refunds to nfl sunday ticket subscribers. Analysts say this is a risky move that could cost the company if it is seen to be siding with trump. \" politically this could be interpreted as directv agreeing with trump that the issue will ultimately be determined by the fans and their wallets, \" diffusion group analyst michael greeson tells usa today. Every steeler apart from former army ranger alejandro villanueva stayed in the tunnel during the anthem last sunday, but center maurkice pouncey says 100 % of players will be standing on the field before the game against baltimore on sunday, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. \" as far i know it's 100 %, \" he says. \" we're going to go out there as the pittsburgh steelers.

The judge declared a mistrial in the case of brandon mcinerney after the jury said it couldn't come to a unanimous decision on whether the slaying was murder or manslaughter. Seven jurors wanted to convict him of voluntary manslaughter, while five were set on first- or second-degree murder, the ap reports. Prosecutors must now decide whether to re-file charges. According to prosecutors, mcinerney, then 14, and his victim, 15-year-old larry king, were in computer lab when mcinerney took out a gun and shot him in the back of the head. Mcinerney then stood up and, in front of all his classmates, shot king in the head again. Prosecutors labeled it a premeditated hate crime — nazi-inspired drawings were found in mcinerney's home, and he had threatened king before. The defense had argued that king provoked mcinerney into a \"heat-of-the-moment \" killing by flirting with him, according to ktla.

Steven mnuchin tells the financial times that having a tax reform bill ready for president trump's signature by august is \" not realistic at this point. \" two months ago, the treasury secretary said the administration hoped to have tax reform done by the time congress goes on recess in august, cbs news reports. The los angeles times notes it's a known fact that lawmakers get more done when they have a vacation coming up. But mnuchin says the failure to repeal and replace the affordable care act pretty much blew up that timetable. While mnuchin says he still expects tax reform to happen sometime in 2017, there's no guarantee that's realistic either. The last major tax reform effort — back in the 1980s — took more than two years. The setback means us companies will have a harder time planning their budgets, as it's uncertain they ' ll get that trump-promised lower tax rate. Trump's tax reform plan calls for lowering taxes for both businesses and individuals. Mnuchin, a former goldman sachs banker, says that won't increase the us deficit because the money lost from lower taxes will be offset by economic growth.",

            "Throughout the war in afghanistan, american-led forces struggled with how to handle the issue when the sexual abuse became apparent. Service members encountered it at police posts, at afghan army bases and, at times, even on shared bases. Even high-level american officials sometimes found themselves dealing with powerful afghans who were widely accused of pederasty, such as gul agha shirzai, a former provincial governor and an important power broker in afghanistan who once enjoyed close ties with the united states. The problem was so common that an american military report in 2011 listed the rape of boys as an issue that could cause tension between american and afghan troops. Most often, the immediate solution was to ignore allegations of child rape, according to soldiers and marines who served in afghanistan.

With the ink barely dry on yet another big news moment ( he racked up the no. 2 most-attended papal address on record yesterday ), pope francis boarded the papal plane and gave his first news conference during his overnight flight back to the vatican. This is the line getting a good bit of attention: \" who am i to judge a gay person of goodwill who seeks the lord? you can't marginalize these people. \" the answer came in response to question about a vatican monsignor who is close to the pope and was said to have had gay sexual relationships years ago; francis notes that an inquiry into these claims \" found nothing. \" the wall street journal and cbs news stack his comments on gay priests next to previous ones to come from the vatican ( which called homosexuality a \" disorder \" ) and pope benedict ( who in 2005 signed a document stating that men with \" deep-seated \" homosexuality should not enter the priesthood ). One other talking point: on the question of women as priests, francis gave a firm no, saying the topic was \" definitely \" settled by pope john paul ii.

The pontiff was traveling aboard a turbulent overnight flight to rome from his first overseas trip — a journey marked by his plain-spoken appeals to catholics to reground the church in grass-roots ministry — when he broached the delicate issue of how the catholic hierarchy should respond to clerics who are gay, though not sexually active. In doing so, he departed from the posture that has...",
            "Updated 1: 53 p.m. Et aboard the papal aircraft pope francis reached out to gays, saying he won't judge priests for their sexual orientation in a remarkably open and wide-ranging news conference monday as he returned from his first foreign trip. \" if someone is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will, who am i to judge? \" francis asked. \" we shouldn't marginalize people for this. They must be integrated into society. \" francis ' predecessor, pope benedict xvi, signed a document in 2005 that said men who had deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests. Francis was much more conciliatory in his first news conference as pope, saying gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins forgotten. The comments did not signal any change in church policy. Catholic teaching still holds that homosexual acts are \" intrinsically disordered. \" but they indicated a shift in tone under francis ' young papacy and an emphasis on a church that is more inclusive and merciful rather than critical and disciplinary. Asked for comment, vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told cbs news that the pope was \" for sure \" not just referring to gay priests, but to all gays. Lombardi said this did not represent a change in church teachings. As pope francis pointed out himself in his answer, the church's catechism teaches that gays are to be accepted and welcomed, not discriminated against. Lombardi pointed out that during the press conference the pope specifically confirmed church teachings on abortion and female ordination. The thing that was different here, lombardi said, was the pope's attitude, which puts mercy, forgiveness and understanding \" in the forefront. \" francis also said he wanted a greater role for women in the church, though he insisted that they cannot become priests. He was funny and candid during the 82 minutes he spent with journalists on board the plane returning from brazil.

            "Article excerpt rome — when pope francis said he wouldn't judge gay priests, he opened the door to a new era of reconciliation within the roman catholic church, which has struggled for decades to confront the presence of homosexuality in its ministry. The pontiff was traveling aboard a turbulent overnight flight to rome from his first overseas trip — a journey marked by his plain-spoken appeals to catholics to reground the church in grass-roots ministry — when he broached the delicate issue of how the catholic hierarchy should respond to clerics who are gay, though not sexually active. In doing so, he departed from the posture that has...",
            "Updated 1: 53 p.m. Et aboard the papal aircraft pope francis reached out to gays, saying he won't judge priests for their sexual orientation in a remarkably open and wide-ranging news conference monday as he returned from his first foreign trip. \" if someone is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will, who am i to judge? \" francis asked. \" we shouldn't marginalize people for this. They must be integrated into society. \" francis ' predecessor, pope benedict xvi, signed a document in 2005 that said men who had deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests. Francis was much more conciliatory in his first news conference as pope, saying gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins forgotten. The comments did not signal any change in church policy. Catholic teaching still holds that homosexual acts are \" intrinsically disordered. \" but they indicated a shift in tone under francis ' young papacy and an emphasis on a church that is more inclusive and merciful rather than critical and disciplinary. Asked for comment, vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told cbs news that the pope was \" for sure \" not just referring to gay priests, but to all gays. Lombardi said this did not represent a change in church teachings. As pope francis pointed out himself in his answer, the church's catechism teaches that gays are to be accepted and welcomed, not discriminated against. Lombardi pointed out that during the press conference the pope specifically confirmed church teachings on abortion and female ordination. The thing that was different here, lombardi said, was the pope's attitude, which puts mercy, forgiveness and understanding \" in the forefront. \" francis also said he wanted a greater role for women in the church, though he insisted that they cannot become priests. He was funny and candid during the 82 minutes he spent with journalists on board the plane returning from brazil. He didn't dodge a single question, and even thanked the journalist who raised allegations contained in an italian news"

The release was announced saturday by the pentagon. All nine prisoners were yemeni men captured during the war in afghanistan, according the new york times. They had been held at guantanamo for approximately 14 years. The guardian reports none of the men had ever been charged with a crime, and eight of the nine had been cleared for release from the prison since at least 2010. An attorney for one of the released men says his client is \" ecstatic. \" \"he is anxious to get on with living a peaceful life, \" the attorney tells the times. The release was the largest since obama announced in february his most recent plans to close guantanamo. The holdup in releasing the nine \" low-level \" inmates was partly due to saudi arabia's unwillingness to accept yemenis. The us government didn't want to send the men to yemen due to unrest and al qaeda activity there. A deal with saudi arabia, which has a semi-successful program for rehabilitating former islamic militants, was secured in february. One of the released prisoners is tariq ba odah, who the military has been force-feeding every day since he started a hunger strike in 2007. Most of the 80 prisoners remaining at guantanamo, which has been condemned by the un and once boasted an inmate population of nearly 700, have been there for a decade without charges.",

Why? often, students who borrow more attend graduate school and end up earning more money, making it easier for them to repay their loans, writes economics and education expert susan dynarski at the new york times. Just 7 % of graduate school students default, compared to 22 % of those who borrow only for their undergraduate studies. More specifically, one key group is driving up default rates: dropouts. \" students who attended a two- or four-year college without earning a degree are struggling to find well-paying work to pay off the debt they accumulated, \" writes dynarski.

Steve campion was with a camera crew in the heights neighborhood when a man drove into the flood waters and opened his door, calling to the group for help, moments before his car became completely submerged. Campion waded over to the man and helped pull him to safety, all while live on video. The chronicle notes that the man appeared \" disoriented, \" and told campion he didn't realize how deep the water was when he drove in. On the video, campion can be heard wondering what the driver is doing and then urging him to get out of the car and swim away from it once the man opened the door. Campion had been tweeting from the scene and urging drivers to stay away, noting before the incident, \" just saw man climb out of his sunroof. \"",

Radar can only reach so far. Passengers ' cell phones can't necessarily connect to networks in the air. And malaysia airlines doesn't seem to carry wifi. As for the maps passengers see on the backs of seats, those track planes ' activity via ground stations and would probably lack any information we don't already have. What about the black box? businessweek wonders. Why is that data kept inside a plane where we can't get to it, rather than transmitted from the plane? mainly because of cost, the site explains. It would cost an airline $ 300 million per year to send out all that data. And airlines aren't likely to spend that money as disasters become rarer. But how did the plane fall mid-flight, anyway? npr notes a few factors that can affect a jet while it's in the air. One is mechanical stress from the cabin's pressurization and depressurization. But maintenance usually addresses that, and the boeing 777 in question had recently been inspected. Technical failure is unlikely in today's aircraft, which are protected with back-up systems. Human error remains a possibility, but the most common issue while in flight is sabotage, an expert says.",

A thousand miles and one week ago, this storm was a meandering blob of moisture. It soon spun into a tropical wave, then a depression, then a storm with a name: isaac. When most of tampa bay went to bed saturday, the storm's cone of uncertainty was still quite uncertain. Isaac, skipping along the north coast of cuba at 20 mph, had become a disorganized mess and forecasters were far from confident on its ultimate destination. By today, though, they expected it to find open water, form into a hurricane and finally pick a path. Only a few models predicted isaac would cross over the florida peninsula and",

Today, in the airy kitchen of her home near palo alto, california, with its view of the santa cruz mountains and a painting of a nude woman above the fireplace, baez winces at the memory. \" i felt so awful and said, ' i ' m sorry – of course i ' ll sign it. ' \" baez, 76, loves to play against her image as the serene, hyperserious matriarch of folk music. Resting her chin on her hand, she flashes her recent metal-chick tattoo: a series of circles and arrows that rings her right wrist, from a visit to new zealand with her son, gabe. \" most mothers would say, ' oh, honey, really? ' \" she says proudly. \" but i said, ' ooh, can i get one too? ' \" in 2010, when she was invited to perform at a white house celebration of music from the civil-rights era, baez refused a request, from michelle obama, to sing \" if i had a hammer. \" \" that is the most annoying song, \" baez says. \" i told them, ' if i had a hammer – i'd hit myself on the head. Ain't gonna do it. ' \" \" joan has that rock &amp; roll attitude toward life and freedom and love, \" says singer-songwriter bob neuwirth, who has known baez since her folk-club days in cambridge, massachusetts, in the sixties. \" she has a kind of bravery that could just kick down the doors. \" baez was a fixture at marches and protests, especially in the sixties, preaching a philosophy of nonviolence. \" it took a lot of courage to be nonviolent, \" says neuwirth, \" especially when people had clubs, dogs, handcuffs and all that shit. \" on friday, baez will be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. The timing couldn't be more fitting. With donald trump in the white house, rock is entering a new protest era, and baez is helping lead the way.

Dutch police say five romanian suspects, aged 33 to 43, were arrested over the weekend after a july 24 theft that the guardian reports would've looked at home in a fast and furious movie. Police say a modified van got close enough to the truck carrying iphones in horst to allow a passenger to climb aboard. Once he'd broken into the moving truck's back doors, the suspect passed looted iphones into his own van through a hole in its roof, police say. \" the truck was taking its freight from a to b and did not stop, \" a dutch police rep says. \" even so, [ the phones ] were gone. So it must have happened that way. And now we finally have the evidence, with the van and the loot. \" the five romanians were arrested over the weekend in otterlo, roughly 60 miles from the scene near the german border, reports the bbc. Police say $ 590,000 in iphones and the van used in the robbery were recovered. The men are to appear before a judge in the netherlands on tuesday. However, they might also face extradition.

What is believed to be the oldest human poop ever discovered has yielded important information about the neanderthal diet, discovery reports. The leavings show that the neanderthals weren't exclusively carnivorous, but also consumed a lot of plant-based food including roots, tubers, berries, and nuts, researchers say. Other studies found plant matter in neanderthal teeth, but researchers say findings from the other end are more conclusive. The poop is far older than the previous oldest find, 14,000-year-old droppings in oregon, but researchers say ancient deposits are probably fairly common. They weren't on the lookout for prehistoric poop, but found it while looking for evidence of food preparation at the site. \" no one has been looking for it, \" one researcher tells usa today. \" it's not because it's not there. \" the team says the study will help scientists \" understand all aspects of why humanity has come to dominate the planet the way it does, \" although other researchers say bears, which are also omnivorous, may be the real source of the ancient poop.

Researchers have stumbled across what may be the world's oldest human poop, deposited by neanderthals about 50,000 years ago atop an ancient campfire in spain.

            "Bones can only tell us so much. Experts often assume or make educated guesses to fill in the gaps in mankind's family tree, and to develop a sense what our ancestors may have looked like. Judging from skull and mandible fragments found in a cave in israel in 1969, this young female homo sapien lived between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago. Her bones indicate she was about 20 years old. Her shattered skull was found among the remains of 20 others in a shallow grave. The skull and jaw of this female \" hobbit \" was found in liang bua, flores, indonesia, in 2003. She was about 1 meter tall ( about 3 ' 3 \" ) and lived about 18,000 years ago. The discovery of her species, homo floresiensis, brought into question the belief that homo sapiens was the only form of mankind for the past 30,000 years. Scientists are still debating whether homo floresiensis was its own species, or merely a group of diseased modern humans. Evidence is mounting that these small beings were, in fact, a distinct human species. The \" old man of la chapelle \" was recreated from the skull and jaw of a homo neanderthalensis male found near la chapelle-aux-saints, in france in 1908. He lived 56,000 years ago. His relatively old age, thought to be between 40 to 50"

        "summary": "The libyan government maintains that it is still in control after a weekend that saw its own parliament building stormed — though whether that is the case remains unclear, reports reuters. What happened, and what's happening, in the tumultuous country: yesterday's attack on parliament: loyalists of retired general khalifa haftar stormed the building in tripoli, with local media reporting that roads in the capital were made impassable by men who commanded truck-mounted heavy weapons. How it's being reported: the washington post describes yesterday's events, which killed two, as \" some of the worst fighting the capital has seen since the 2011 revolution. \" what they want: haftar's allies say the goal of the attack was to eliminate islamist hardliners from libya, the bbc reports. The ap reports that the haftar-aligned troops yesterday declared they had suspended the islamist-dominated house, blaming it for empowering islamic extremists, and was replacing it with a 60-member constituent assembly that was elected earlier this year to create a new constitution for the country; libya's interim government brushed the announcement off. Background on the breakdown: as per the los angeles times, \" lawmakers are divided among islamist and non-islamist elements, and the swearing in of a new cabinet led by an islamist-leaning prime minister, ahmed matiq, has been repeatedly delayed by political infighting. \" who is haftar? he's described in us media reports as a \" rogue, \" \" mysterious, \" and a \" renegade, \" with the lat describing him as having a prominent role in the 2011 uprising against moammar gadhafi, who he helped bring to power in 1969 and severed ties with in 1988. Prior to that he lived in... Falls church, va., having sought exile in the us in the ' 80s. His immediate whereabouts are unclear. The trouble didn't start yesterday: forces loyal to haftar attacked bases in benghazi controlled by islamist groups friday, and 70 reportedly died. Commandeered military aircraft were reportedly used, and officials implemented a \" no-fly \" zone over the city in an attempt to ground such planes. The lat notes that some of the country's military units appear to have defected to haftar's side; reuters says it's unclear how much support his side has \" within libya's nascent regular armed forces. \" what's happening today: islamist-led militias have been deployed to tripoli on orders of the country's army chief.
