        "summary": "A photo agency that usually sells paparazzi shots is trying to sell photos of the severed head found near the hollywood sign earlier this week. One of the dogwalkers who found the head posed for photos with it and is smiling in at least one of them, reports gawker, which declined to pay the agency $ 5,000 for the pictures and, after calling around, found that radaronline, the smoking gun, and the new york post weren't interested either. The photo agency says the photos came from the cell phone of \" a guy on the trail who had a phone — the lady didn't have a phone so she asked him to borrow his. \" police say selling the photos isn't a crime, although they may speak to the phone's owner, the los angeles times reports. Two hands and two feet were found by officers searching the area and police are investigating whether the grisly hollywood finds are a match for a torso found near tucson last week.",

A negotiator who identifies himself as andy deals calmly and professionally with mateen, though during one attempt to call him back, andy tells fellow officers that he's not convinced the man he's dealing with is really inside the nightclub, the orlando sentinel reports. Mateen becomes impatient as the negotiator tries to obtain information, telling him it's \" none of his business \" whether he has an accomplice. At one point, he claims to have vehicles full of bombs outside the nightclub. \" your people are going to get it and i ' m going to ignite it if they try to do anything stupid, \" says mateen, who was shot dead by police at the end of an attack that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The ap reports that audio of the calls was released by order of circuit judge margaret schreiber, who is still considering whether to release another 232 calls to 911 made during the incident. The city of orlando's lawyers say they shouldn't be made public because they involve suffering and killing.",

Foreign dignitaries hoping to travel to pyongyang for kim's funeral next week and perhaps witness some wondrous events for themselves are out of luck, however. Pyongyang has banned foreigners from visiting the country to pay their respects, with only a handful of exceptions, the wall street journal reports.

But for an international team of scientists who toiled deep underneath the mountains in guanxi, china, in 2013, new figures obtained via laser mapping have confirmed that the miao room chamber — a gigantic cavern that's part of the gebihe cave network — is the world's biggest. How excited are scientists who study this sort of thing? \" to me this is like discovering that k2 is larger than everest! \" one of the miao room expedition's leaders says in an email to national geographic. The miao room's total volume of 380.7 million cubic feet is roughly 10 % greater than that of the former heavyweight cave champion: malaysia's sarawak chamber; sarawak does still retain the title for most surface area at 1.66 million square feet. The miao room cave can only be accessed by an underground stream: \" you either have to swim or use a small boat to get in the first couple of hundred of meters, \" caving expert andy eavis tells npr. Eavis also explains the sheer size of a space whose almost 1,000-foot-high ceiling makes it as tall as the eiffel tower: \" the only thing you see is the floor that you're standing on. Unless you have a particularly powerful light... You don't see the walls, and you don't see the ceiling. \" the curious can take a tour of the 3d model of miao room at national geographic.

Npr's ari shapiro talks to long-time caver, andy eavis, who has explored the ethereally beautiful underground cave. Ari shapiro, host: deep beneath the mountains of guangxi, china lies the largest cave chamber in the world. The miao room was discovered in 1989 but laser mapping technology has only just determined how really big it is. The ceiling rises nearly a thousand feet high, the height of the eiffel tower. Andy eavis has been exploring caves for more than 50 years and helped map the miao room. He says you can't just walk right in. Andy eavis: at the entrance, there's actually a canal, a lake.

Reports differ on what angered them: a kuala lumpur-based website, malaysian digest, says they lost it when told that debris washed up on an australian shore was not from flight 370. According to australia's news network, they grew heated when a malaysian official didn't attend the briefing. Either way, airline officials were kept at the hotel while dozens of family members went to the malaysian embassy and protested. The hostages went free just before 2am, and the only damage was a kick to the knee received by malaysian airlines'security supervisor. Chinese families have been complaining bitterly for weeks about the airline's handling of the search, which they call incompetent and secretive. In an odd development, malaysian prime minister najib razak told cnn yesterday that he just learned about a plane picked up by his country's radar on the night flight 370 disappeared.

        "summary": "There is no difference in the survival rate for men with early prostate cancer who opt for treatment, such as surgery or radiation, and those who simply monitor their cancer, a new study found. In fact, the 10-year survival rate was so high — 99 % — that researchers are calling into question whether any treatment is needed for early stage prostate cancer, the ap reports, or even whether early screening is worthwhile. \" there's been no hard evidence that treating early disease makes a difference, \" dr. Freddie hamdy, lead author of the study in the new england journal of medicine. Psa ( prostate specific antigen ) blood tests have already been criticized by doctors who warn they have led to over-treatment of early prostate cancer with debilitating side effects such as sexual dysfunction and urinary problems, reports time. In europe, psa testing is far less common, notes the ap. High levels can indicate cancer but also a natural prostate enlargement that comes with age. Prostate cancer is one of the slowest-moving cancers, yet hamdy noted that men often choose aggressive treatment at the outset because it is not known which cases will develop rapidly. \"i hope this helps patients to be better informed and to not rush into treatment decisions, \" hamdy said, per time. The study looked at more than 82,000 british men, aged 50 to 69. Of those whose psa test showed they were in the early stages, 1,643 agreed to be assigned surgery, radiation, or active monitoring every three to six months. Although more men in the monitoring group saw their cancers worsen after 10 years, those assigned treatment experienced unpleasant side effects. Death rates among all the men were equal. But dr. Otis brawley, chief medical officer for the american cancer society, said it will be difficult to convince men to choose monitoring. \" our aggressive approach to screening and treating has resulted in more than 1 million american men getting needless treatment, \" he told the ap.

In a statement on isis radio saturday, the group praised the san bernardino shootings, saying they had been carried out by \" two supporters of the islamic state, \" reports the bbc, which notes that there has been no sign that isis orchestrated the attack or that it had any more warning of it than authorities did. Malik reportedly pledged allegiance to isis just before the massacre on wednesday, but authorities believe the suspects may have been \" self-radicalized \" without help from a wider terrorist network, the los angeles times reports. The washington post reports that authorities fear the attack has exposed a \" threat matrix \" involving legal weapons and online radicalization that makes such plots very difficult to detect in advance. In other developments: in his weekly address, president obama vowed that the us \" will not be terrorized, \" the bbc reports. He renewed his call for tighter gun control and asked americans to help combat extremism. Isis and \" other terrorist groups are actively encouraging people — around the world and in our country — to commit terrible acts of violence, oftentimes as lone wolf actors, \" he said. \" all of us — government, law enforcement, communities, faith leaders — need to work together to prevent people from falling victim to these hateful ideologies. \" one focus of the investigation — which is now officially a terror probe — is the visa process for malik, who came to the us from pakistan as the fiancé of farook, an american citizen, and later obtained a green card.

Background checks at the time didn't turn up anything suspicious but authorities are now taking a second look at her application and examining whether the process should involve tighter vetting, new york times reports.

It's true that sharks are impressive hunters and predators, yet the sad fact remains that these magnificent creatures are more threatened by people than we are by sharks. The worldwide demand for shark-fin soup, shark-tooth medallions, and a false sense of security on beaches everywhere, all combine to leave sharks persecuted and endangered, with millions of them being killed each year. Like top predators in any ecosystem, sharks play an essential role in keeping the seas healthy and productive.

Playing golf with the 45th president of the united states offers a revealing character study of the man. Donald trump's private clubs are where he feels most comfortable, and holding court with members and guests and employees is an important part of the ritual — in the pro shop, at the driving range and especially on the 1st tee, where trump traditionally announces the teams for a friendly wager and will typically take the best player available for his partner. Some earnest person in the group will typically keep score, though the terms of the match are usually unstated and trump's interest in the ebb and flow of the match is modest at best. Yet he somehow knows when his putt is meaningful, and he",

Jake, who was 4 at the time the photo was taken last year, lives in a small village in eastern ghana. The photo came about because cameraman carlos cortes of chicago had traveled to ghana with solomon adufah, a self-taught artist who was returning to his homeland to teach art and creative studies to children. \" i just caught jake in the moment of his teaching, \" cortes says, after much-needed basic supplies such as pencils had been handed out to the kids. The image was one of hundreds cortes took as part of an ongoing project to develop a documentary about adufah, and a trailer is on vimeo. Adufah shared the image of jake on instagram; it went viral and, as eyewitness news reports, \" broke the internet. \" adufah worried jake was becoming a meme when the image had actually captured a heartfelt moment of learning, but he realized all the likes could turn into money for basic school supplies, and his gofundme page raised a few thousand dollars in its first day. Neither jake nor cortes was aware of the boy's fame until this week.

        "summary": "The conflict brewing in the middle east between qatar and neighboring countries has had an odd consequence: a sudden drop in global helium availability. The atlantic reports qatar manufactures 25 % of the world's helium supply, making it the second largest producer after the us. But a shipping issue has arisen: qatar typically sends its supplies of helium by land through saudi arabia to a port in united arab emirates. When the conflict began heating up, a blockade brought shipping to a standstill. And with nowhere for its helium supply to go, qatar ceased production of the gas on june 13. Qatar picked up production again in early july, but the political crisis continues, and an industry expert tells the atlantic the shipping route will now, with more difficultly, likely pass through oman. \" the thing this really highlights is that the helium supply chain, even though there's ample supply when everything is running, is inflexible and fragile, \" says industry consultant phil kornbluth. Helium's unique properties make it essential in science, medical, and engineering fields. Along with enabling birthday party balloons to float, the gas is needed in the production of medical equipment like mri machines and, per ifl science, for technologies like supersonic wind tunnels, telescopes, and the large hadron collider. While the atlantic reports that past shortages have taught labs to conserve helium, recycling the gas may be a stronger future solution. In a cnn op-ed, physicist dr. Don lincoln writes that further developing \"helium recapture technologies \" is essential to averting a supply crisis in the future. ( a giant helium field was found in 2016. )",

            "Qatar, the arabian country currently in conflict with its neighbors, is mostly known as a producer of vast quantities of natural gas, the richest ( by some measures ) nation in the world, and the dubious choice for the 2022 fifa world cup. However, it has a lesser known feature, one that makes it of vital importance to science – it produces a quarter of the world's helium, which many scientific and medical instruments depend on. The universe has plenty of helium – a lot was formed in the big bang, and the sun makes 544 million tonnes ( 600 million tons ) every second. However, it is so light that all of the original helium from the birth of the solar system has long since escaped earth. Fortunately, new helium is being made all the time, since it is a by-product of many radioactive decay processes. Large quantities have been trapped in underground reservoirs, often the same places that host a lot of natural gas. Some gas drillers separate out the helium and sell or store it. Others, particularly those with low helium to methane ratios, have decided that the cost of extraction and export is not worth the money they can make. Qatar produces less than 3 percent of the world's methane, so the crisis poses little threat to natural gas",
            "( cnn ) the recent diplomatic dustup between qatar and many other gulf nations caused some nervousness for some of the world's most cutting edge scientists. Among recalled ambassadors, closed borders and massive disruptions on travel and shipping, the diplomatic crisis highlighted the world's vulnerability to cutoffs in the supply of helium, since qatar is the world's second-biggest producer of the vital substance, after the united states. Although the helium aspect of this diplomatic imbroglio has been resolved, it highlights the way in which international diplomacy can impact scientific research. While most people might think of helium as simply being the gas that is used for balloons at children's birthday parties, it is actually a critical ingredient for some of the highest technologies on earth. It is used in cryogenic environments, like the operation of medical mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) and nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) spectrometers. It is used to purge and pressurize containers made of materials that cannot withstand chemical interactions. It is used to provide controlled environments for the manufacture of solid-state computer chips. And it is used in tungsten gas welding for such metals as aluminum and copper, which would experience much weaker welds if they were contaminated by exposure to oxygen.

Among recalled ambassadors, closed borders and massive disruptions on travel and shipping, the diplomatic crisis highlighted the world's vulnerability to cutoffs in the supply of helium, since qatar is the world's second-biggest producer of the vital substance, after the united states. Although the helium aspect of this diplomatic imbroglio has been resolved, it highlights the way in which international diplomacy can impact scientific research. While most people might think of helium as simply being the gas that is used for balloons at children's birthday parties, it is actually a critical ingredient for some of the highest technologies on earth. It is used in cryogenic environments, like the operation of medical mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) and nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) spectrometers. It is used to purge and pressurize containers made of materials that cannot withstand chemical interactions. It is used to provide controlled environments for the manufacture of solid-state computer chips. And it is used in tungsten gas welding for such metals as aluminum and copper, which would experience much weaker welds if they were contaminated by exposure to oxygen. Helium is chemically inert and unique in its ability to remain liquid at temperatures below -450 f"

The wall street journal reports on the unlikely sounding \" health drink, \" which has qualified as a \" foods for specified health uses \" ( foshu ) product, meaning it includes an ingredient that's been determined by the government to bestow a health benefit. In this case, that ingredient is indigestible dextrin — 5 grams of it per 16-ounce sugar- and calorie-free bottle. It's a source of dietary fiber, and as the company explained in a february 2017 press release touting the product's impending launch, \" drinking one coca-cola plus per day with food will help suppress fat absorption and help moderate the levels of triglycerides in the blood after eating \" — so long as you don't drink too much, which could cause \" loose bowels, \" per a marketing vp for the company. He says it took researchers a decade to come up with a formulation that would fall under the foshu umbrella but still taste good; the journal talks to drinkers who both love it ( one line of praise: \" i like the feeling of the burps you get from drinking this \" ) and drinkers who poured it out after taking a sip.

All eyes on jeb: all the previews point out that he can't afford yet another bad to mediocre debate performance and thus faces perhaps the biggest pressure of any candidate tuesday night. Will he be aggressive or statesmanlike? he may have hinted at a new strategy: \" it's not a debate. It's a chance to be able to say what you think. I ' ll take advantage of that. \" debate alliance? politico floats the possibility of bush and ted cruz forming an unlikely alliance against marco rubio. The theory is that rubio represents a big obstacle to both, bush with the establishment vote and cruz with the conservative base. Rubio's personal finances in particular could be a target. Christie stands out? he's been relegated to the undercard debate, but maybe that has a silver lining? it could give him a chance to clearly stand out for once as he goes up against bobby jindal, mike huckabee, and rick santorum, notes cnn. Actual policy: moderators at the last debate took lots of flak, at least from the candidates, for veering off the supposed topic of the economy. Given that this one is sponsored by the fox business network and the wall street journal, it could be a chance for the candidates to challenge each other on topics such as tax policy, jobs, and entitlement programs, notes usa today.

It was part of james nifong's study on whether american alligators on the atlantic and gulf coasts eat sharks, and the answer might surprise you: yes. The small variety, that is, but a press release calls it the \" first scientific documentation of a widespread interaction between the two predators. \" in fact, the kansas state university researcher tells national geographic that when he first broached with alligator experts the question of whether alligators eat sharks, some of them thought he was kidding. Nifong wasn't, and he found that in addition to the expected prey — crustaceans, fish, and wading birds, per his study in southeastern naturalist — he documented alligators eating a lemon shark, a nurse shark, and a bonnethead shark, along with an atlantic stingray. This though they're freshwater creatures; nifong explains it's not uncommon for sharks to enter freshwater, where \" opportunistic alligators \" then pounce. Gps trackers also found the gators wade into estuaries where the two types of water mix, and where shark nurseries can be found. But it may be a two-way street. Says nifong, it's \" really about size dynamic. If a small shark swims by an alligator and the alligator feels like it can take the shark down, it will, but we also reviewed some old stories about larger sharks eating smaller alligators. \" ( an alligator was involved in this strange animal skirmish. )",

        "summary": "Baltimore's public water system will remain just that, public. Voters there overwhelmingly supported an amendment to the city's charter declaring the \"inalienability \" of its water and sewer systems, reuters reports, effectively banning privatization — the first large city to do so. Calling it, \"a historic victory for local control of water, \" rianna eckel of advocacy group food and water watch writes, \"no corporation can take the water and sewer system away from the city. \" about 77 % of voters supported the measure. Baltimore has one of the country's oldest water systems, and rates have quadrupled in the past 18 years after decades of deferred maintenance. Proponents of the amendment were concerned that privatization of the system would result in even more rate increases, over which the city would have no control. According to eckel, private water utilities charge nearly 60 % more than public ones. A baltimore official says that private water companies have shown interest in taking over parts of the system, telling reuters, \"there was a lot of chatter that we needed to close the door on. \" other cities have shown interest in what baltimore is doing. Pittsburgh council members, for instance, recently had a discussion with some of their baltimore counterparts, with one of the former telling reuters that pittsburgh council members \"appear resistant to privatizing our water system. \" ( the pope says safe drinking water is a human right. )",

He can still play an important role in the national discussion and will certainly be able to help steer some significant fundraising operations, but i think he should keep his hat out of the ring this time. \" jamelle bouie, slate: he is among the few who think romney could make a strong candidate. Bouie argues that romney wasn't a \" bad \" candidate in 2012, but he was up against an incumbent and an improving economy, and that kind of political math rarely works. \" there won't be an incumbent in 2016, and there's a good chance americans will want a different party at the helm, \" writes bouie. \" if romney were the nominee, there's no doubt that he could win the presidency. \"",

        "summary": "If you've ever wondered how much time you'd have were a vampire to find your carotid artery and begin to guzzle, students at the university of leicester have worked up an analysis. Using fluid dynamics and a few interesting assumptions, they arrived at an average time of 6.4 minutes. Reporting in the journal of physics special topics, the school's peer-reviewed student journal, the students say that's how long it would take for an average vampire to drain an average human of 15 % of his or her blood — any more and your heart rate changes, making blood drinking a \" process of diminishing returns, \" as gizmodo points out. The students are assuming that vampires aren't out to kill but rather drink what they can and run ( hence draining just 15 % of the average human's 5 liters of blood ); that each of the five arteries carrying blood away from the aorta are of equal size and smoothness ( to establish blood flow velocity ); that vampires aren't actually sucking out the blood ( thus allowing the students to rely simply on the rate at which blood exits a puncture wound in one's neck ); and that vampire fangs leave puncture holes roughly 0.5mm each. So there you have it — on the 85th anniversary of dracula, we now know that two tiny punctures in a neck will drain 15 % of a person's blood in six minutes, 24 seconds. You can now go and write a super-realistic script. ( see why an archaeologist calls this a \" vampire grave. \" )",

On thursday, a jury awarded the new jersey banker and his wife a total of $ 37 million in compensatory damages in his suit — $ 30 million for him, $ 7 million for his wife, kendra — making j&j assume 70 % of the liability for lanzo's illness, per cnn.

Reuters notes it's j&j's first loss at trial regarding complaints about its talc products containing asbestos. There are thousands of other cases tying its talc products to ovarian cancer. In lanzo's situation, he said he got deadly mesothelioma from inhaling baby powder dust during regular use since his 1972 birth. A seven-woman jury in middlesex county found both j&j and imerys concealed the asbestos in their products, which files from lanzo's legal team indicate they may have worried about as early as 1969, per bloomberg. J&j insists it has long tested its products for contamination, and imerys claims any asbestos exposure lanzo may have had came from somewhere other than its talc. \" the evidence was clear that his asbestos exposure came from a different source such as the asbestos found in his childhood home or schools, \" a spokeswoman says, adding the firm will appeal. The lanzos may still have punitive damages coming as well; that phase of the trial begins tuesday.",

It purchased cases of gingrich's books and bought up copies of dvds produced by another of the former house speaker's entities, gingrich productions. \" the spirit of operating a non-profit organization is to work for the public good regardless of the politics that are involved, \" said daniel borochoff, president of the american institute of philanthropy, in an interview with abc news. \" i believe it violates that spirit. \" asked about the allegations this morning prior to a speech in new hampshire, gingrich urged an abc news reporter to focus on his speech. \" i ' m not concerned about that. The american people aren't concerned about that. Try covering the speech, \" gingrich said as he left a campaign event. When the reporter tried to follow",

The ethics case and its resolution leave gingrich with little leeway for future personal controversies, house republicans said. Exactly one month before yesterday's vote, gingrich admitted that he brought discredit to the house and broke its rules by failing to ensure that financing for two projects would not violate federal tax law and by giving the house ethics committee false information. \" newt has done some things that have embarrassed house republicans and embarrassed the house, \" said rep. Peter hoekstra ( r-mich. ). \" if [ the voters ] see more of that, they will question our judgment. \" house democrats are likely to continue to press other ethics charges against gingrich and the internal revenue service is looking into matters related to the case that came to an end yesterday.

        "summary": "The washington post reported thursday on rumors about google's gmail revamp, and techcrunch and the verge got their hands on supposed screenshots of the updated design and new features. Among the more intriguing-sounding innovations: a \" confidential mode \" that keeps email protected by not allowing the recipient to forward it, cut and paste from it, print from it, or download it, per techcrunch — though more than one source points out there's nothing stopping someone from simply taking a picture of the email, either via a computer screenshot or with a camera. There also appears to be a self-destruct button of sorts, via a customizable expiration date that allows the user to send the email into the ether after a time period of the user's choosing — whether that's a week, month, or even a few years. In a statement cited by the post, google acknowledged a \" major \" gmail redo is in the works, but the company says it's only in \" draft phase. \" \" we need a bit more time to compose ourselves, so can't share anything yet — archive this for now, and we ' ll let you know when it's time to hit send, \" the company teased. Other features said to be on the cusp of debuting include a \" snooze \" option that lets users temporarily send emails back out of their inbox until they're ready to deal with them, as well as a \" smart reply \" feature for the web version of gmail that automatically suggests boilerplate email responses; this option is already available for mobile.",

In what politico is calling a \" preemptive strike, \" a number of groups — many aligned with bernie sanders — are trying to render the potential \" major asset \" ( he's young, latino, was san antonio's mayor ) unusable. It's the 41-year-old's current gig, as housing and urban development secretary, that's at the root of the attack, which targets mortgage sales. The allegations, per the groups'dontsellourhomestowallstreet.org site: \" hud promised to help homeowners avoid foreclosure by selling more overdue mortgage loans to nonprofit community organizations rather than wall street banks. \" \" but, \" they continue, \" in reality hud's two most recent sales have sent 98 % of the mortgages straight to wall street — and at a huge discount, almost half off! \" hud disputes the figure. Politico explains that the distressed asset stabilization program has since 2010 let mortgages that are barreling toward foreclosure be sold to \" qualified bidders \" whose goal is supposed to be to get the loans back in good standing. Under castro, progressives feel it's basically been \" a fire sale for wall street firms, \" in politico's words. They'd rather nonprofits and others more invested in the local communities purchase the mortgages. Since that's seemingly not what's happening, they argue castro isn't a true progressive and is helping wall street over minority communities.",

This part is screwy: bagley herself is that same driver. As the salt lake tribune explains, bagley is playing dual roles here in the bizarre lawsuit — as the representative of her husband's estate, she is going after the person responsible for his death, which just happens to be herself. Utah's court of appeals allowed the suit to proceed earlier this month. The case stems from a one-vehicle accident in 2011 in which bagley lost control of her vehicle while driving in the desert. Her husband was fatally injured when it flipped, and barbara bagley is now accusing barbara bagley of \" failing to maintain a proper lookout while driving, \" reports cbs news. The attorneys for bagley the driver ( \" whose interests in the case are represented by her insurance carrier, \" the trib notes ) argued unsuccessfully that the case should be dismissed. \" the jury would be asked to determine how much money will fairly compensate barbara bagley for the harm she caused herself, \" they wrote. \" the jury will be highly confused — it cannot order a person to compensate herself. \" the story has one bright spot: the couple's dog also was in the car, and it ran into the desert after the accident — only to be reunited with barbara bagley nearly two months later.",

The couple's shetland sheepdog, which was in the vehicle and ran after the crash, survived 53 days in the desert before being found.

Erik roner made his name as a ski base jumper, but his final stunt was a skydive at a golf course at the squaw valley resort in lake tahoe, calif., reports the dallas morning news. Witnesses say the 39-year-old member of mtv's nitro circus team hit a tree while trying to land during a performance with three other skydivers monday. His friend roy tuscany says he watched in horror as roner slammed into the tree about 30 feet above the ground. He says people tried to stand on each other's shoulders to rescue him. \" there's no protocol for this kind of rescue, \" tuscany tells the morning news. \" there's no manual. It was just horrible. \" roner was pronounced dead at the scene. Nitro circus star travis pastrana tells kcra that he's stunned by the accident, especially since roner, who joined the crew after helping them base jump dirt bikes into the grand canyon, was known as the \" safety guy \" on set. Roner is survived by his wife and two young children. \" erik was an amazing person who made everyone and everything around him better, \" pastrana said in a statement. \" his smile, laughter, and personality will be missed by everyone at nitro circus. Most importantly he has a beautiful wife and amazing kids that will miss him dearly. He is gone... But will never be forgotten. \" ( in may, base jumping legend dean potter and another man died while attempting a wingsuit flight in yosemite national park. )",

It's not clear how the little boy became infected last december, though researchers believe the culprit could have been contaminated fruit, a dirty needle, or contact with fruit bats, which carry the disease but do not die from it, reports the new york times. Researchers say the case fits the subsequent pattern of transmission, though there may have been even earlier, unknown cases. In other developments: sierra leone and liberia have both declared states of emergency, deployed troops to combat the outbreak, and warned against public gatherings, but sunday services in both countries were packed yesterday, reuters reports. Preachers branded the disease the work of satan and urged worshippers to obey the instructions of health workers. Missionaries who worked with ebola patients in liberia are to be quarantined on their return to the us, nbc reports. North carolina – based aid agency sim usa says its workers will be quarantined for 21 days — the longest known ebola incubation period. Health officials say the missionaries will be allowed to go home, but they will be asked to limit their contact with other people. The measure is being taken \" out of an abundance of caution, and it is important to remember that there are no confirmed or suspected cases of ebola in north carolina, \" the medical director of mecklenburg county said in a statement. In spain, health officials say they have obtained experimental ebola drug zmapp to treat a 75-year-old priest who caught the virus in liberia and has been brought to a madrid hospital, the ap reports.

Rawls has not been charged with a crime, according to authorities. On july 29, federal investigators obtained a search warrant for \" certain electronic media \" belonging to rawls. The files were stored on rawls ' apple mac pro computer, his iphone, and four external hard drives, according to court filings. The machines previously had been seized in delaware co. And philadelphia. On aug. 27, rawls was ordered to unlock the files on the machines. Rawls, who has an apartment in chester, appeared at the delaware co. District attorney's office on sept. 4 where he decrypted \" some of the media, \" according to rueter's order, but did not unlock the hard drives. After the philadelphia police found rawls ' actions to be \"conduct unbecoming, \" commissioner charles h. Ramsey suspended rawls for 30 days with intent to dismiss. Contact sam wood",
            "Sgt francis rawls image: philadelphia police department former philadelphia police sergeant francis rawls has spent the past seven months in solitary confinement without charges because passwords he entered for investigators failed to decrypt hard drives seized in connection with a child porn investigation. For failure to cooperate with the investigation, rawls has been locked up. He spends 22 and a half hours a day in his cell. If he gets a visitor, there must always be a barrier between them. He gets just one fifteen minute phone call a month. According to a person familiar with the case, rawls is being held in solitary confinement due to his status as a former police sergeant and fears for his safety. Advertisement rawls is suspected of possessing child pornography but, in an appeal filed in federal court yesterday, his defense outlines why he should be released. Referred to as john doe in the court documents, rawls has a clean record and doesn't know the passwords prosecutors are looking for, the defense argues. He also doesn't have to unlock his computer because of his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself. The case began over a year ago in early 2015, when a team of investigators working out of the office of the district attorney for delaware county, pennsylvania, were conducting surveillance on the \"freenet. \" similar to tor"

        "summary": "Similarly to how superbugs are evolving so that they can survive our best efforts to drug them out of existence, it's possible that fish could evolve to swim faster and thus escape our masterfully constructed nets. So report university of glasgow researchers in the journal proceedings of the royal society b. They conducted experiments that found the fastest swimmers are indeed the most successful at evading our nets; over time this \" selective \" harvesting could \" lead to genetic change within wild populations for specific traits, \" says lead author shaun killen in a press release. As of 2010, commercial fishing generated $ 63 billion in annual household income, reports the christian science monitor, so as \" intense fishing pressure \" continues, fish will have to either get out of our way or succumb to our appetites. To study this, the researchers employed commercial trawling practices, where the speed of a trawling net is determined by the maximum swim speed of a specific species. This means that while many fish can keep a steady pace ahead of the mouth of the net, most eventually tire out, fall back, and are captured. The researchers tried this on 43 wild minnows in a lab while studying several traits, including metabolic rate and aerobic and anaerobic fitness. It turns out that anaerobic capacity, or the ability of a fish to swim fast for a brief period of time using more oxygen than is available through breathing, had the greatest impact on a fish's ability to evade capture. This trait could presumably become more present in future generations of fish that are the descendents of those who got away. ( meet the world's new horrifying fish. )",

But this is not your typical case of this variety: alstory simon is actually the second person to be freed after a murder conviction for the crime, which is why the chicago sun-times is using phrases like \" a stunning reversal, \" while the chicago tribune says the move is \" rewriting a key chapter in illinois'death penalty history. \" the case goes back to 1982, when somebody shot to death marilyn green and fiance jerry hillard. Prosecutors first convicted anthony porter, who ended up on death row. But 48 hours before he was to die, his conviction got thrown out, thanks to the work of northwestern university's medill innocence project. One of the project's investigators got simon to confess to the crime, but both simon and the investigator later said the confession was coerced. ( simon, now 64, was promised a short sentence, followed by riches from book and movie deals. ) the reversal of porter's conviction led first to a moratorium on the death penalty in illinois less than a year after porter was pardoned in 1999, and eventually to its abolishment in the state in 2011. The double-murder case is now once again unofficially unsolved. Multiple witnesses put porter at the crime scene, and at least one says he saw porter pull the trigger. Cook county prosecutors, however, aren't saying whether they think he's guilty. It's a moot point: porter cannot be tried again thanks to double jeopardy.",

And for the guys: lorenzo, rhett, romeo, mateo, dimitri, dane, marcelo, dante, and rémy. If you're bummed your name did not make either list, it might still have some sexy characteristics: the survey found that latin and french names scored particularly well, as did male names ending in \" o \" and female names ending in \" a. \" and names featuring double letters scored better than their single-letter counterparts ( adriana vs. Adrianna ), the website's founder tells livescience. On the other end of the spectrum, the least sexy names for girls: gertrude, bertha, agnes, ethel, and mildred. ( notice a pattern? these names, considered as a group, peaked in popularity in the 1890s; the founder notes that their abundance of consonants also makes them feel heavy. ) and for boys: bob, ernest, norman, dick, and howard.

In their study in nature, the scientists from the university of tokyo say they detected telltale traces of material left behind by decomposing organisms 3.95 billion years ago, reports the cbc. If the findings from northern labrador hold up, it means that life was kicking around on the planet a mere 500 million years or so after the earth formed, and perhaps earlier. For perspective, the atlantic points out that if you thought about earth's history in a single calendar year, life popped up around the third week of february. Perhaps more remarkable, the study suggests that life formed while the earth was still being bombarded by asteroids. \" the emerging picture from the ancient-rock record is that life was everywhere, \" says vickie bennett of australian national university, who wasn't involved in the study. \" as far back as the rock record extends — that is, as far back as we can look for direct evidence of early life, we are finding it. \" there's room for skepticism of the new study, and the guardian explains the scientific particulars involving carbon isotopes. The upshot is that fellow scientists want more evidence that the graphite detected didn't show up on the rocks much later in the process. Earlier this year, other researchers found what may be even older evidence of life from rocks in the same region, with a range from 3.7 billion to 4.2 billion years ago.

The bill that raised such passion sounds innocuous enough — it would require textbooks to mention that the sea of japan is also known as the east sea. But it's become the focal point of an unlikely political fight, international incident, and major headache for terry mcauliffe. The governor promised the bill while campaigning, to please korean-americans who see the name as a reminder of japanese imperialism. Northern virginia has a fairly large korean population, so the bill quickly gathered support. But then japan, virginia's second-largest foreign investor, sent mcauliffe a letter warning that \" economic ties... May be damaged \" by the move, and hired lobbyists to press the case. Korea responded by dispatching its own ambassador. Mcauliffe's advisers are privately asking lawmakers to kill the bill, the washington post reports, but republicans intend to push it through, essentially just to make mcauliffe, a democrat, sweat over whether or not to sign it. \" it's time for them to learn you can't please everybody all the time, \" one republican said.",

            "All you would-be porn entrepreneurs can put away your pocketbooks — the pricey and nefarious domain name, sex.com, is reportedly slated to be sold for $ 13 million. Just over six months ago, sex.com made headlines when people for the ethical treatment of animals ( peta ) published a letter requesting that the now-bankrupt escom, llc ( the current and soon-to-be-previous ) owner donate the domain ( then valued at $ 18 million ) so the organization could use it as a tool in its recent \"vegetarians are sexy \" ad campaign. Obviously, escom did not give up the goods that easily. Now the register is reporting that a company called clover holdings ltd. Has sealed the deal, beating out 12 bidders with the \" highest and best offer. \" back in 2006, escom bought sex.com for between $ 12 million and $ 14 million, making it one of the priciest domains ever. Looks like the value hasn't really gone up that much in the last four years, though. We ' ll have to wait and see what clover chooses to do with the domain — aside from the obvious.

        "summary": "It turns out artist damien hirst's famous displays of dead animals preserved in formaldehyde may have been dangerous to more than just artistic sensibilities. A study published this month in analytical methods found hirst's pieces were leaking formaldehyde gas at levels 10 times higher than the legal limit during a show at london's tate modern in 2012. They were also found to be releasing gas at a more recent show in beijing. Both the us and eu classify formaldehyde as a carcinogen, the new york times reports. The short-term effects of exposure include nosebleeds and coughing. The study's author, pier giorgio righetti, says visitors were unlikely to have been affected by the gas, but gallery staff who spent more time around the tanks may have been. Hirst created the works, which feature everything from zebras to sharks to cows suspended in thousands of liters of formaldehyde, in the early 1990s, the guardian reports. In the past, he said he likes working with formaldehyde because \" it is dangerous and it burns your skin; if you breathe it in, it chokes you, \" according to gq. In a statement, the tate says it took all \" necessary precautions \" and that the formaldehyde was contained within the tanks. Hirst denies the claims made by the study. \" experts tell us that at the levels reported by this journal, your eyes would be streaming and you would be in serious physical discomfort, \" a statement on his website reads. \" no such complaints were made. \" believe it or not the study wasn't even about hirst's works; it was looking into the effectiveness of a new formaldehyde sensor that can be worn as a bracelet.

The signal response has been assessed over low ( 20 to 120 ppb ) as well as higher ( 1-15 ppm range ) levels. The sensor has been applied to monitor potential fa fumes of some artwork in two locations: the tate's gallery in london, during the display of several pieces of damien hirst, as well as in the summer palace in beijing. In the first case, one of hirst's main subjects is the setting-up of giant fish tanks filled by thousands of liters of fa, in which intact biological specimens are immersed, such as zebras, cows, calves, even sharks. The parallelepiped-shaped basins are then covered with a lid and fully sealed with silicon gums. It has been found that the tanks are surrounded by fa fumes, constantly exuded in the atmosphere ( likely via the sealant ), reaching levels of 5 ppm, one order of magnitude higher than the 0.5 ppm limit set up by legislation.

        "summary": "The search for a missing florida woman who was scheduled to pick up her 2-year-old daughter from her ex-husband's house is now approaching a full week. Tricia todd, 30, was supposed to collect the girl wednesday morning, but ex steven williams says she never showed up; he then brought the child to a babysitter and left for military duty at an air force base in north carolina, reports tcpalm. The babysitter later took the girl to one of todd's brother's, and her family called police when she failed to turn up. Officers found her car — keys in the ignition, purse inside — near the home of her brother in hobe sound, where she was staying. Police say todd had gone to williams ' house tuesday night to drop off medicine for their daughter. Authorities say williams has been cooperative by phone, and detectives plan to travel to north carolina to interview him in person. \" the goal is to eliminate people from suspicion, \" says the martin county sheriff. Todd, who hasn't showed up to her job as a hospice nurse, was known to take early morning walks, per nbc news. While her purse was found in her car, her cellphone and wallet were gone. In addition to the police effort, volunteers have been searching for her, and a facebook page has been set up for sharing information. On sunday, church members gathered for a vigil, wpbf reports. \" i know god is good. I trust him completely, \" says todd's mother, rebecca hasselbach. \" i would really like to have her back and hopefully alive. \"",

        "summary": "Binge eating disorder, which gained american psychiatric association recognition in 2013, isn't particularly well-known. That's not good for a pharmaceutical company like shire, maker of an adhd drug called vyvanse, which was recently approved by the fda for marketing in the treatment of binge eating. Lately, shire has been working hard to spread awareness of the disorder, prompting concern from experts, the new york times reports. Vyvanse is an amphetamine; such drugs are associated with strong potential for abuse. An eating disorder expert warns that \" once a pharmaceutical company gets permission to advertise for ( a drug ), it can often become quite widely prescribed, and even tend to be overprescribed, and that's a worry. \" recently, former tennis star monica seles has been talking to the media about her own binge-eating experiences — and she's being paid by shire. Meanwhile, the shire website bingeeatingdisorder.com tells possible sufferers how to discuss their concerns with a doctor, prompting worry from some who study prescription-drug abuse, the times notes; the disease isn't common, yet the site could be read as an effort to guide people toward a diagnosis. At slate, lv anderson firmly agrees that the marketing practices are worrying. But she also has some qualms with the times piece itself, writing that the disease is very real, even if the times headline — which notes that shire \" first marketed the disease \" — might seem to imply otherwise.

David michael hartley, 30, and his wife tiffany hartley, 29, were attacked on falcon lake, near the southern tip of texas, police said. Tiffany hartley told police her husband was shot in the back of the head as the couple fled to u.s. Waters.

Hartley fell off his watercraft after he was shot, according to his wife, who told rescuers and police she attempted to circle back to save him, but the gunmen were still firing shots so she had to abandon the rescue attempt. Texas department of public safety officials said friday they believed that david hartley was dead, but his body has yet to be found. U.s.

Fortunately for everybody in the jetblue meltdown, osbon — who has been charged with interfering with a flight — was locked out of the cockpit and restrained by passengers. But deranged airline pilots are believed to have intentionally caused at least three crashes since 1982, businessweek finds. A japan airlines pilot crashed his plane in 1982, killing 24 people; a silkair flight in indonesia crashed in 1997, killing 104 people in what investigators decided was an intentional crash; and 217 people were killed in 1999 when an egyptair co-pilot shut off the plane's engines and sent the plane diving into the atlantic ocean off massachusetts.",

James mitchell and bruce jessen are former u.s. Air force trainers whose expertise was in teaching military members how to resist interrogations if captured. The cia paid their company, mitchell jessen &amp; associates, $ 81 million to act as contractors to help run the interrogation program, according to a senate intelligence committee report issued last year the lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court in washington state is on behalf of the family of gul rahman, an afghan man who died while in cia custody; suleiman abdullah salim, a tanzanian man who was held in u.s. Custody in afghanistan for five years before being released; and mohamed ahmed ben soud, a libyan man who was held by the u.s. In afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 before the cia sent him to libya, where moammar gadhafi's regime imprisoned him until 2011. The three men are among the prisoners whose detentions were discussed in the senate report last year. The lawsuit accuses mitchell and jessen of human rights violations by committing torture, cruel and inhuman treatment, and war crimes.

But that was what horrified nasa personnel heard on jan. 27, 1967, as three astronauts prepping for a flight to the moon perished in a fire in the apollo 1 command module. The washington post and npr remember virgil \" gus \" grissom, ed white, and roger chaffee on the 50th anniversary of their deaths, which happened in the span of five minutes and put the space agency's apollo program on hold as officials tried to figure out what went wrong. A history of the incident on nasa's website documents the timeline that day, which started around 1pm with complaints of communications issues and a weird odor. \" how are we going to get to the moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings? \" one of the astronauts complained. But it was around 6: 30pm when things took a turn from annoying to awful. Seconds after the cry for help, the module \" ruptured, \" and flames and gas poured out. The astronauts were said to have died almost immediately by suffocation from toxic gas and burns, with nearly everything inside the module incinerated. The cause: a cabin filled with pure oxygen and lots of combustible material, as well as \" vulnerable \" plumbing and wiring. Changes that nasa made after the tragedy included filling the cabin with both oxygen and nitrogen, making astronaut suits nonflammable, and setting up a new safety program. Apollo 7 was in the air less than two years later, and on july 20, 1969, apollo 11, manned by neil armstrong and buzz aldrin, made it to the moon. Chaffee and grissom are buried at arlington, while white is interred at west point. ( the post talks to their children. )",

Initially, cinema owners were informed verbally that the film had been banned, media reports had said. \"i deplore this censorship, \" distributor mounia layadi benkirane said in a statement. Egypt, the arab world's most populous country, has also banned the movie, citing \"historical inaccuracies \". Moroccan media on thursday reported that cinema managers had been told not to screen the film, despite its release already having been approved by the state-run moroccan cinema centre ( mcc ). Hassan belkady, who runs cinema rif in casablanca, said he had been threatened with the closure of his business if he ignored the ban. \"they phoned and threatened they would shut down the theatre if i did not take the film off the schedule, \" belkady said. Distributor benkirane, who also runs the colisseum cinema in marrakesh, said exodus has now been pulled from the schedules. \"the last screening was on friday night at 21.30. I respect the decision of the mcc board, \" she said,",
            "A day after morocco bans film, egypt says it's rife with mistakes, including an apparent claim that 'moses and the jews built the pyramids ' egypt has banned the hollywood biblical epic exodus: gods and kings, citing historical inaccuracies, the culture minister said on friday. The decision comes a day after a similar move by morocco. The film, directed by ridley scott and starring christian bale, relates how moses helped israelite slaves flee persecution in egypt under the pharaoh ramses by parting the red sea to let them cross safely. The egyptian culture minister, gaber asfour, said the film was rife with mistakes, including an apparent claim that \"moses and the jews built the pyramids \". \"this totally contradicts proven historical facts, \" asfour said. \"it is a zionist film, \" he said. \"it gives a zionist view of history and contains historical inaccuracies and that's why we have decided to ban it. \" the ban was decided by a committee comprising the head of the supreme council for culture, mohammed afifi, the head of the censorship committee and two history professors, asfour said. Afifi said he took issue with the scene showing the parting of the red sea in which moses – a prophet revered by jews, christians and muslims alike – is seen holding a \"sword \" like a warrior,"

It also states he forced two girls to watch him abuse the scouts at his home. Goff says dennis molested one of the plaintiffs more than 1,000 times. The 19 plaintiffs are suing the boy scouts of america, as well as two local chapters, the courant reports. According to the press, dennis died at 84 two years ago, and the plaintiffs aren't seeking any damages from his estate. The lawsuit claims the organization's leaders knew — or at least should have known — dennis was a danger to the children, the ap reports. It states they didn't do anything to protect the scouts, including having other adults present or doing background checks, according to the courant. \" there was never any supervision on the camping trips, \" goff says. \" they just left this guy alone with all of these kids and he would go from tent to tent molesting boys. \"",

Agriculture and agro-based industry minister ahmad shabery cheek told parliament on thursday that \" a friend \" told him about studies showing durians \" have aphrodisiac value and are said to be good for men, \" the straits times reports. He said he would be asking for further research into the durian as an aphrodisiac. The los angeles times explains that the durian is a spike-covered and \" notoriously fragrant \" fruit that is described as smelling like \" rotting meat or hot garbage. \" its smell is so foul that it's actually illegal to carry it on public transportation in some parts of asia. While answering questions in front of malaysia's parliament on thursday, ahmad shabery cited studies from thailand, china, and elsewhere that found durian is high in antioxidants, reduces cholesterol, has antibiotic properties, can lower high blood pressure, and has anti-aging properties. \" according to these experts, it is really true that the durian is the key to our happiness, \" he said. As for its supposed romantic properties, the daily meal included the durian on a list of bizarre aphrodisiacs after an indian scientist claimed mice who ate the fruit showed an increased libido and sperm count. A world of stinky-fruit-loving lovers awaits further confirmation out of malaysia. ( and, for no particular reason, here's a video of 100 people trying durian. )",

        "summary": "Canada rolled out its big marijuana announcement a week before 4/20: the federal government has brought in legislation to make recreational marijuana legal across the country, ending a 94-year ban on the drug that the government described as an \" abject failure, \" the globe and mail reports. But the government stresses that fulfilling prime minister justin trudeau's campaign promise isn't going to start a pot free-for-all: they say the main aim of legalization is to put criminals out of business and keep the drug out of the hands of young people. A roundup of coverage: the law increases penalties for selling marijuana to young people and makes it easier to prosecute stoned drivers, who will face penalties of up to 10 years in jail, the bbc reports. The minimum age for buying or using marijuana will be 18, but provinces, which will have a lot of control over how the law is implemented, are free to raise the age limit. Adults will be allowed to grow up to four marijuana plants. Details on pricing and taxation have yet to be worked out. Public safety minister ralph goodale says there will be an \" orderly transition \" while new regulations are drafted, and police will continue to enforce existing marijuana laws until legalization is introduced next summer. The cannabis act is expected to start a wave of mergers among the 40 companies already licensed to produce medical marijuana, the financial post reports. The firms are expected to lobby for advertising regulations closer to those for beer than the very strict ones canada has in place for tobacco. The act prohibits using celebrity endorsements in pot advertising. In ontario, canada's most populous province, premier kathleen wynne says it makes a \" lot of sense \" to use the liquor control board of ontario, which controls liquor sales and operates around 600 stores in the province, to control marijuana sales as well. She says the government-operated board already has the law's \" social responsibility \" aspects covered. Bill blair, a former police chief who's now an mp for the ruling liberal party, says while there's \" no guarantee \" that the law will keep pot out of the hands of young people, licensing producers through health canada and having provincial governments control sales is a step in the right direction, the globe and mail reports. Today, the decision to sell or not to sell to that child is often being made by a gangster in a stairwell, \" he said thursday. \" that is completely unacceptable to us and that will be subject to serious criminal sanction. \" canadian authorities say they worked closely with their american counterparts when they drafted the",

The assessments of the hearing, which was occasionally tense and blumenthal-centric, will soon start rolling in, but the washington post offers up an instant one in its headline: \" gop lands no clear punches while sparring with clinton over benghazi. \" as for new ground, the new york times says the hearing \" served largely as a replay of highly contested arguments from previous congressional hearings, press examinations, and sunday-morning talk shows. \" the los angeles times has a similar take: \" no new information, but ample partisan argument. \" asked on cnn immediately afterward what he'd learned that was new from clinton, panel chief trey gowdy said he didn't think she provided anything the panel didn't already know. Other first drafts: fox news: \" [ a ] central gop allegation was that clinton paid more attention to emails from friend sidney blumenthal than pleas from murdered diplomat chris stevens to increase security in the face of growing threats. But, even as clinton said she'took responsibility,'she accepted little blame for the denial of security requests before the attack, or for the faulty narrative about an anti-islam video that formed after. \" wall street journal: \" clinton endured a daylong congressional grilling over the 2012 terrorist attack in libya, largely avoiding the sorts of pitfalls that republicans could exploit in the 2016 election. \" politico: \" in a contentious hearing that veered between partisan fisticuffs and technical discussions of the state department's chain of command, republicans pressed clinton with questions about why she wasn't aware of numerous pleas for additional security at the benghazi compound before the attacks. That wasn't her job, she argued — but should [ ambassador chris ] stevens have asked her for help, he would have gotten it, she added. \"",

It's the first aerial bombing of the conflict, the washington post says, speculating that the regime is trying to intimidate rebels with its yet-untapped firepower. Aleppo is syria's most populous city, and had been considered a bastion of regime support. Now it's being shelled, strafed by attack helicopters, and activists tell reuters an armored column is advancing on it. Elsewhere in syrian developments: video has surfaced of men calling themselves free syrian army fighters standing before al-qaeda flags and promising to form \" suicide cells to make jihad in the name of god, \" the new york times reports. Al-qaeda's presence has long been rumored, and al-qaeda in iraq has lately issued statements explicitly linking the syrian insurgency to its own. But one former assad official has alleged that the regime is also working with the terrorist network. Turkey has announced that it is blocking all truck traffic through its border, in an effort to block supply routes, but will still allow refugees to pass. Refugees have also begun pouring into iraq, viewing even that troubled state as safer than syria, reuters reports. \" the war is between the two sides. They are shooting at each other and the people are just the victims, \" one refugee said. Hillary clinton, meanwhile, struck an optimistic tone, saying that increasing military gains by the rebels would create \" safe havens \" inside the country. \" we have to work closely with the opposition, \" she said.",

A post at mit technology review explains that the company has applied for a patent on a technique that could make it dramatically easier to sell and ship flowers — by preventing them from wilting. The general idea is to interfere with the flowers ' ability to make the odorless gas ethylene, which plays a role in the blooming and ripening process. Monsanto scientists think they can manipulate this by feeding the plants genetic molecules, thus raising the possibility of creating flowers that \" bloom on command, or do other tricks, \" in the words of mit. The implications are huge, given the huge global market for fresh flowers and the pricey logistics of getting them to market or into the hands of funeral homes, loved ones, etc. By some estimates, up to 90 % of cut flowers currently sold in the us are imported, notes cnbc, with most coming from colombia and ecuador. If mit's idea works — and consumers don't object to the rna manipulation — it could reduce waste and \" meet a real need in the flower industry, \" says a plant researcher at the uk's cardiff university.

Advertisement as this video from the reactions youtube channel explains, a little basic chemistry can keep that bouquet looking like it's straight out of the garden day after day. Here's what you need to do: clean your vase: some soap and water will remove any bacteria or fungi that might ruin your flowers. Use warm water: it's best to use water that is around 110 degrees fahrenheit and has been degassed. Fill the clean vase with the warm water and let it sit for a few minutes so all the air bubbles can escape. Feed your flowers: add the packet of flower food that came with the flowers. It has bleach to fight off microbes, citric acid to promote water uptake, and sugar to keep your flowers looking fresh. Cut the stems: hold the stems under running water and cut them at a 45 degree angle. This creates a wide opening to the xylem ( where the flowers drink up water ) and keeps air bubbles to a minimum so they don't block the water pathways. Keep fruit away: fruit produces ethylene, which tells a plant to ripen, and that will shorten the life span of your flowers. Keep your flowers cool: try to store your flowers somewhere that isn't too warm. If you're leaving the",

Holmes and theranos have already agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the fraud allegations. Holmes will pay a $ 500,000 penalty, lose control of theranos, give up 18.9 million shares, and be barred from being a director or officer for any public company for a decade. The fraud case was filed in civil court; the sec won't say if a criminal investigation is underway. The sec charged ramesh balwani, former theranos president and holmes ' ex-boyfriend, with participating in the fraud. It alleges he helped lie about the defense department using theranos'technology on the battlefield. \" the theranos story is an important lesson for silicon valley, \" an sec director says. \" innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday. \"",

            "It�s easy to imagine over the next few weeks there will be spirited arguments in comic book stores, on internet sites and wherever geeks gather as to whether �x-men: days of future past� makes sense. Let�s put that to rest right now. This is a movie about time travel. It features one guy covered in blue fur, another who sprouts long talons on command and a hot babe who can change her appearance at will. There�s another woman who can command the weather, a guy who can bend metal with his mind and a human popsicle. Needless to say, �days of future past� does not read like a documentary. Sense is not an overriding concern. What it does read like, however, is a special-effects-saturated, good-humored, action-stuffed summer movie spectacle filled with colorful fantasy characters doing on-screen magic tricks in the service of escapist entertainment. Whether the internal logic of the x-men franchise is strictly adhered to in this decades-spanning saga, only the most devout fan will be able to say. The rest will probably stick with, �wow, that was cool.� cool but a bit confusing.
