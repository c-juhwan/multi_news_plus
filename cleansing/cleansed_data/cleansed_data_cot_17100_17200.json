        "summary": "If rep. Dan flynn gets his way, texas will be on central standard time year-round. With his hb 150, the republican is trying to terminate daylight saving time effective sept. 1, the houston chronicle reports. The bill will be debated this morning by the texas government transparency and operation committee; should it ultimately pass, texas would join arizona and hawaii in opting out of the time shift. The daily texan recounts flynn's inspiration: \" it was … last year when we did the fall back, and i ' m sitting there changing all of the clocks in my house and in my cars, and i ' m … thinking, ' why in the world do we do this? ' \" among those who would benefit from dst's death: \" mothers who do not want to put their kids on the bus stop when it is dark and put them to bed when it is light, \" flynn notes on his website. It's not the first time the lone star state has tried to break from the clock finagling. Rep. William smith unsuccessfully tried in 1967 to get his state out of dst and instead adhere to \" texas exceptional time, \" per the texas monthly. The dot cites practical reasons for observing dst, including conserving energy, preventing traffic injuries, and reducing crime. But critics from rachel feltman of the dallas morning news to comedian john oliver say the benefits are minimal or misleading, and flynn says his constituents aren't happy about complying. \" it seems that every time we have to change the time, we get lots of complaints in our office, \" flynn told wfaa in november upon filing the bill. Dst was actually established under a texan — lyndon b. Johnson — in 1966, and a second texan, george w. Bush, altered its dates in 2005.",

This all contradicts pyongyang's official story that jang was executed for plotting a coup, the new york times notes. In a closed-door meeting today, south korea's director of intelligence said jang and his allies had started a struggle among north korea's elite by taking over profitable business deals — like the sale of coal to china. Friction then built up between government agencies over jang's perceived abuse of power. At least eight people connected to jang were executed and hundreds of his relatives were taken to prison camps in the purge.",

Kim and those supporting the man who was supposed to be his regent, according to accounts that are being pieced together by south korean and american officials. The clash was over who would profit from north korea's most lucrative exports: coal, clams and crabs. North korean military forces were deployed to retake control of one of the sources of those exports, the rich crab and clam fishing grounds that jang song-thaek, the uncle of the country's untested, 30-year-old leader, had seized from the military. In the battle for control of the fishing grounds, the emaciated, poorly trained north korean forces \"were beaten — very badly — by uncle jang's loyalists, \" according to one official."

Williams, the saints ' 21-year-old rookie safety, had likely been told not to commit pass interference and risk a flag, a source tells nbc sports, and so williams dived to try to keep diggs inside the line and keep the clock running. But it looks like williams went too early and missed his mark, taking out one of his own teammates and giving diggs a free lane to the end zone — effectively ending the saints'season. The times-picayune noted a \" red-eyed \" williams faced reporters afterward, his teammates by his side to say their loss could've happened in one of many ways. Nbc notes the whole fiasco may have been the fault of the saints'defensive coordinator for a bad play setup, and the new orleans advocate points out williams had a game-altering interception earlier on. But what's impressing most is williams'resiliency and determination. He noted at the presser he'd \" do all that i can to never let that happen again, \" and tweeted on monday that, \" no the season didn't end as planned but one thing for sure i won't let one play define the type of man or player that i am or will be! \" ( this 20-year-old navy player suffered a similar loss — and was similarly inspirational. )",

They challenged his conservative credentials, his ability to create jobs, his flip-flops — and called on him to release his tax returns, notes the new york times. A plain-spoken newt gingrich scored points with the audience, but romney remained largely unflustered, and kept his eyes on the big race. \" i ' m the guy who can best post up against barack obama, \" he boasted. In other parrying: romney defends his changing views from a voter posing a twitter question, focusing on his shift to an anti-abortion stance. But he again switches to the big picture against obama. \" everything i do will be aimed at strengthening the economy, strengthening the family, and making certain our military is second to none, \" he declares. Gingrich is asked if he sees his comment that \" poor kids lack a strong work ethic \" as \" insulting. \" he responds simply, to loud applause: \" no, i don't, \" and adds: \" only the elites despise earning money. \" a feisty gingrich also scores points with the crowd when he urges that unemployment benefits be tied to enrollment in a job-training program. \"the fact is 99 weeks is an associate degree, \" he adds to loud applause, referring to extending jobless payments. \" we actually think work is good. Being willing to help yourself is good. \" he also lashed obama as the \" best food-stamp president in american history. \" what's the highest tax rate the candidates support? romney says 25 %, gingrich a flat 15 %, and ron paul... 0 %. Gingrich outlines his foreign policy: \" andrew jackson had a pretty good idea about america's enemies: ' kill them, ' \" which romney apparently agrees with. \"the right thing for osama bin laden was the bullet in the head that he received, \" says romney. Paul's idea, which draws raucous boos: \" maybe we ought to consider a golden rule: don't do to other nations what we don't want them to do to us. \" romney calls the pro-gingrich super pac ad on bain capital the \" biggest hoax since big foot \" and calls for an end to all super pacs.

With five days remaining before the south carolina primary, the four other remaining republican candidates sought once again to raise questions about mr.

Yet they failed to goad him into losing his composure or making any major mistakes, and he devoted nearly as much attention to president obama as he did to the candidates on stage with him. A spirited crowd of nearly 3,000 republicans inside the myrtle beach convention center loudly cheered — and occasionally jeered — throughout the two-hour debate.

With five days remaining before the south carolina primary, the four other remaining republican candidates sought once again to raise questions about mr. Romney's credentials as an economic manager and his consistency as a conservative. Yet they failed to goad him into losing his composure or making any major mistakes, and he devoted nearly as much attention to president obama as he did to the candidates on stage with him. A spirited crowd of nearly 3,000 republicans inside the myrtle beach convention center loudly cheered — and occasionally jeered — throughout the two-hour debate. It was one of the most rollicking presidential debates of the season, with the candidates absorbing instant feedback from voters who will help decide their fate on saturday. Photo \"my record is out there — proud of it, \" mr. Romney said. \"i think that if people want to have someone who understands how the economy works, having worked in the real economy, then i ' m the guy that can best post up against barack obama. \" but"

The only ant species of the same size that's still around today lives only in central africa. New species titanomyrma lubei is closely related to ants that lived in europe at around the same time.

He got up, went to the gym, played volleyball, and answered emails from his office. By 2: 40pm, he was sitting in a dentist's chair for a root canal. And that's essentially where he's been ever since — at least in his mind, reports the bbc. Diagnosed with anterograde amnesia — a condition that keeps him from forming new memories and learning procedural skills — the father of two can't remember anything for longer than 90 minutes and begins every day believing it's march 14, 2005. Now when he wakes, he reads a detailed note on his phone, titled \" first thing — read this, \" and attempts to grasp all that has happened over the last decade. Unlike patients who've suffered similar fates after surgery, william's brain is undamaged. \" we do not know what to make of it, \" a researcher tells medical daily. Doctors don't think his case is linked to psychological stress either. Though the gulf war vet had just lost his grandfather, he had no history of mental illness. Plus, psychogenic memory loss usually keeps patients from recollecting painful memories, not from creating new ones. In william's case, \" it's as if the memories are being written in sand. Every hour and a half the tide comes up and washes them away, \" reports the washington post. The best explanation has to do with the consolidation of memories, the process of shipping events to long-term storage. It requires restructuring synapses, and the change takes about 90 minutes. Doctors say this might explain five other cases of anterograde amnesia found in patients who had a medical emergency. They may even carry a genetic predisposition. But why did a root canal perhaps trigger it? \" that's the million-pound question, \" says a researcher, \" and i don't have an answer. \" ( read about another medical mystery involving one family ' four kids. )",

Indeed, the foundation initially predicted that the g.o.p. Plan would bring the unemployment rate down to 2.8 percent — a number we haven't achieved since the korean war. After widespread jeering, the unemployment projection vanished from the heritage foundation's web site, but voodoo still permeates the rest of the analysis.

The heritage foundation projection has large tax cuts actually increasing revenue by almost $ 600 billion over the next 10 years. A more sober assessment from the nonpartisan congressional budget office tells a different story. It finds that a large part of the supposed savings from spending cuts would go, not to reduce the deficit, but to pay for tax cuts. In fact, the budget office finds that over the next decade the plan would lead to bigger deficits and more debt than current law.

        "summary": "Experts are inferring what they can from the reports and videos leaking out of syria in the wake of a possible chemical weapons attack, and what they're saying isn't good. The washington post explains that there are seven types of chemical weapons, the deadliest of which are nerve agents — and that's the type that may have been used, per a senior fellow with the federation of american scientists. He describes their effects: \" there's muscle twitching. Then, as the muscle twitching gets more and more spasmodic, mucus comes out of the nose and mouth and you basically go into convulsions on the ground. People don't survive this. \" speaking to der spiegel, two experts point to those very symptoms. One says visible \" nasal secretions \" are in line with what one would expect from exposure to \" potent organophosphates. \" another cited \" the way their muscles cramp up, first in various parts of the body, then eventually the entire body starts twitching, \" saying it would be a tough symptom to convincingly fake. Another thing that would be tough to convincingly fake: child victims. Meanwhile, the international community is taking these reports seriously, with 37 countries — including the us, uk, france, and turkey — calling for the un team that's already on the ground to be dispatched to the site in question ( their hotel is reportedly just a 15-minute drive away ). But the bbc isn't holding its breath: the un team had been authorized to investigate just three locations in the country, and security correspondent frank gardner describes the chance that they ' ll be granted access — in time — as \" slim. \" the \" in time \" part matters, because, as gardner explains, the traces of the gas will within days likely dissipate to the point where the un team wouldn't be able to make a conclusive determination. France has been quite outspoken on the subject, and foreign minister laurent fabius today asserted \" there would have to be reaction with force in syria from the international community \" if chemical weapons were indeed used. However, he specifically said ground troops wouldn't be used, and didn't offer any further thoughts, reports the new york times.",

Some highlights: president obama, aware that america was weary after two wars, failed to assert american leadership when crises erupted and hoped \" others in the world could step up to the plate, \" so there was \" kind of a mixed message that went out with regard to the role of the united states, \" panetta says. Obama \" vacillated \" over striking the syrian regime and arming rebels, and \" by failing to respond, it sent the wrong message to the world, \" panetta writes in the memoir, which is published today. The president's failure to take steps to prevent the sequester's budget cuts displayed \" what i regard as his most conspicuous weakness, a frustrating reticence to engage his opponents and rally support for his cause, \" panetta writes. The president, he notes, isn't short on ideas or intellect, but he does \" sometimes lack fire. \" obama's failure to forge a deal to keep us troops in iraq after 2011 \" created a vacuum in terms of the ability of that country to better protect itself, and it's out of that vacuum that isis began to breed, \" panetta says. On obama's legacy, panetta says, \" for the first four years, and the time i spent there, i thought he was a strong leader on security issues.... But these last two years i think he kind of lost his way. \" but the president \" may have found himself again with regards to this isis crisis, \" panetta says, and he could still leave a strong legacy \" if he's willing to roll up his sleeves and engage with congress. \" panetta, at 76, has no intention — and, after what dana milbank at the washington post calls his \" stunning disloyalty, \" probably no chance — of returning to public office, and he says he's now concentrating on his walnut farm. \" i ' m dealing with a different set of nuts, \" he quips.",

Bowers, for example, wrote about the approaching \" invaders \" of the caravan and also that \" jews are waging a propaganda war against western civilization. \" sayoc posted about soros repeatedly. Caravan funding: open society unequivocally denies funding the caravan, but the rumor won't die.

William ziegler, initially convicted of the 2000 murder of russell allen baker in mobile county, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting murder in a plea deal with prosecutors yesterday. He was sentenced to time served and allowed to leave a free man, al.com reports. Just five months ago prosecutors had indicated they would again seek the death penalty for ziegler, 39, who won a new trial in 2012 in a post-appeal challenge. In her ruling on that challenge, circuit judge sarah stewart highlighted three issues: a juror who lied about his views on the death penalty during jury selection; evidence that was withheld by the state regarding a witness who eventually retracted her testimony; and a poor job done by ziegler's lawyers. The assistant attorney general wouldn't discuss what spawned the plea deal, which required ziegler to admit that his actions led to baker's stabbing death. Ziegler and three accomplices were convicted after baker's body was found in a wooded area near ziegler's home and police discovered the pair had fought at a party, the new york daily news reports. Ziegler is \" a menace to our society, \" says the victim's aunt. \" this is not justice for our nephew. \" though happy her son is free, ziegler's mother says her son \" was put in a position again \" and \" had no choice but to go ahead and plead to a murder he did not commit. \" al.com notes it likely would have been at least a year before his case went to trial, and ziegler himself tells wkrg, \" i took that deal for one reason and one reason only and that was to go home...

The ap reports that rooney, who signed his last will just weeks before his death, left a \" modest estate \" of just $ 18,000 to stepson mark rooney, who had been acting as rooney's caretaker. Rooney said he lost most of his fortune thanks to another stepson, chris aber, whom rooney accused of abuse in 2011. Rooney also accused aber of mismanaging his financial affairs, and though he was supposed to repay millions to rooney, rooney's attorney says it's unlikely the estate will actually be able to collect on the judgment. Another problem: apparently as \" a product of the industry's old studio system, \" rooney was not entitled to large royalty payments. He also owed back taxes when he died, the los angeles times notes. Rooney disinherited his eight surviving children, all of whom are reportedly better off financially than he was, as well as his estranged wife, though she will receive his social security benefits and some of his pension earnings. And the family feud goes beyond money: rooney's wife and her son, aber, are now engaged in a court battle with mark rooney and his wife over where rooney should be laid to rest.",

Cbs news, for example, reports that bannon could be gone by the end of the week, though the story ( based on anonymous sources ) also points out that bannon has survived similar apparent low points with the president. Now, however, it seems that his friction with chief of staff john kelly and national security adviser hr mcmaster, in addition to his ties to the alt-right movement, are taking a toll. Coverage: limbo: the most in-depth take comes from the new york times, which says bannon is in a \" kind of internal exile \" in the west wing and hasn't met in person with trump in more than a week. The story is jammed with nuggets, including that bannon has long told associates he figured he'd last maybe eight months to a year, as well as that trump didn't push back much when rupert murdoch told him during a recent dinner that bannon must go.

        "summary": "Want to fend off illness? try hugging more often. It may sound too warm and fuzzy to be true, but researchers at carnegie mellon university found that more frequent hugs can help protect people from getting sick. Being stressed can cause greater vulnerability to infections, but hugs can apparently act as a form of social support that shields people somewhat from this increased susceptibility. Researchers first used a questionnaire and telephone interviews to assess the level of perceived social support, frequency of interpersonal conflicts, and frequency of hugs in 404 healthy subjects. They then exposed those subjects to a common cold virus and monitored them. As carnegie mellon news puts it, \" perceived social support reduced the risk of infection associated with experiencing conflicts, \" and hugs can claim one-third of that positive effect. Those with higher levels of perceived social support and more frequent hugs also experienced less severe illness symptoms if they were infected. \" this suggests that being hugged by a trusted person may act as an effective means of conveying support and that increasing the frequency of hugs might be an effective means of reducing the deleterious effects of stress, \" says the lead researcher. It's not clear whether it's the actual physical contact that conveys benefits or the fact that hugs are seen as a sign of support and intimacy, but, he explains to the washington post, \" the study suggests that people who have relationships that are intimate enough that they're getting hugged are protected, and that hugging is one indicator of that. \" as the huffington post points out, hugging has also been found to have other positive effects, including lowering blood pressure and improving heart health.

Yet doctors say the critically injured congresswoman has been making steady progress each day since an attempted assassination saturday. Giffords is moving both legs and both arms, has opened both eyes and is responding to friends and family, doctors said thursday. They've helped her sit up and dangle her legs from the bed, and she is able to lift her legs on command. With her closest friends from congress holding her hand wednesday evening, giffords opened her left eye and tried to focus on loved ones for the first time. \" it was raw courage. It was raw strength. It was so beautiful and so moving, \" said sen. Kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y. \" she wanted us to know that she was with us a hundred percent and understood everything we were saying. \" giffords ' neurosurgeon, dr. Michael lemole, called it \" a major milestone, \" and said the congresswoman was clearly responding to the gathering of friends and family. After five days of pushing for caution, lemole acknowledged: \" we're wise to acknowledge miracles. \" the next milestone will be removing her breathing tube, and perhaps have her sit in a chair"

She is simply educating herself on other people's beliefs. \" though lindsay didn't say anything about officially converting in the interview, the article of course led to headlines like \" is lindsay lohan becoming a muslim? \" and \" lindsay lohan might convert to islam. \" ( lilo also reportedly wants a baby. )",

The sanchi was carrying 136,000 tons, or more than 1 million barrels, of natural gas condensate when it collided with a freighter in the east china sea on jan. 6. While some of the highly toxic oil burned off in a fire before the iranian ship sank, \" it is virtually certain that much of the condensate went into the sea in solution, and that toxic underwater hydrocarbon plume will injure marine life exposed to it, \" an expert tells bloomberg. \" even the burned fraction will leave a toxic residue on the water. \" as chinese authorities evaluate the environmental impact, water samples are already showing \" a dangerously high petroleum concentration around the spill, \" reports cnn. But the effects are also spreading. According to china's state oceanic administration, two oil slicks resulting from the accident had grown in combined size from 4 square miles on monday to 52 square miles on tuesday, when they were in an area 330 miles from shanghai and roughly 200 miles from naha, japan, report the times and ap. According to greenpeace, the leaked condensate — likely to be mixed with the fuel that powered the tanker — could \" disperse and break down quite quickly, significantly complicating cleanup operations. \" the group notes the east china sea is \" on the migratory pathway of many marine mammals, such as humpback whale, right whale, and gray whale, \" and is also \" an important spawning ground \" for hairtail, chub mackerel, yellow croaker, and blue crab.",

        "summary": "A 28-year-old man in baltimore has been charged with murder from a shooting back in january, and the arrest is making headlines in the city for reasons that go beyond the actual slaying. One is that when authorities spotted keeco stern on thursday and tried to arrest him, they say he fled, kicked in the rear door of a nearby residence in an apparent attempt to hide, and assaulted a woman inside, reports wbal. Cops found him, however, and added charges of assault and destruction of property to those he faces. Another reason is that this is the third time in 10 years that stern has been charged with murder, reports the baltimore sun. He beat the first two charges, however. In 2007, stern and his brother were acquitted of murdering a 48-year-old man, and in 2012, he was acquitted of fatally shooting a 35-year-old man. In the more recent case, police say witnesses and tips led them to identify stern as the gunman in the fatal shooting of a 27-year-old man who was sitting in his car in january. No word yet on when the case might go to trial.",

        "summary": "The charges against adult film star stormy daniels have been dropped following her arrest at an ohio strip club wednesday night. Daniels, whose real name is stephanie clifford, was booked following an appearance at the sirens club in columbus during which she was accused of touching three undercover police officers in violation of a law that prohibits nude performers from coming into contact with patrons. According to cnn, the so-called community defense act, passed in 2007, specifically addresses employees who regularly appear nude in a sexually oriented business. Because daniels does not regularly appear at sirens, the columbus city attorney determined that the crime was not technically committed. Daniels was out on bond after posting $ 6,000. She had been scheduled to be arraigned friday. Per the ap, daniels ' attorney, michael avenatti, said that some patrons touched daniels in a \" non-sexual way \" during her appearance at the club. Avenatti has characterized the arrest as \" an absurd use of law enforcement resources, \" in part because he says female undercover officers asked daniels if they could place their faces in her breasts. The ap also reports that avenatti has said his client is \" traumatized and rattled \" following her brush with the law. He said she has left the state of ohio and will not appear for her scheduled performance thursday. Daniels became a household name after claiming she had an affair with donald trump in 2006 while melania trump was pregnant with their son, barron.",

Kyle smith of the new york post has one teensy little complaint: \"until the finale, it has no car chases to speak of, \" just a lot of dull caper-plotting. It's only two hours long \"because it takes that long to read every item in the cliché dictionary. \"",

It's thought to have resulted in at least 1,000 deaths since 1934, according to gasp stats cited in the post, and was documented in medical journals at least as far back as 1951. Many of these deaths are thought to be suicides by parents and cops who may never have heard of the game, per the post. And it's a type of \" recreation \" that's alluring to certain teens, the post adds: it's known as the \" good kids ' high, \" per salon, appealing to children who wouldn't normally drink or do drugs, and a slew of youtube videos showing other kids taking part makes it seem innocuous. \" this is the age where kids are engaging in high-risk behaviors, \" an ontario pediatrician who co-authored a study on youtube and asphyxiation games tells the post. \" that's just what they do. \" it's an activity that memphis ' parents wish he had never heard of. \" i [ feel ] robbed, \" his mom, annette, tells kktv. \" he brought joy to everyone he met. \" she adds that her son had a cognitive delay that may have prevented him from realizing the possible consequences, and that she hopes parents broach the subject with their kids so \" no other parent has to go through what we're going through right now. \" ( chicago police once issued an alert about the dangerous game. )",

Williams allegedly pretended she was a nurse taking baby mobley for tests, news4jax reports. Williams reportedly told manigo she had had the baby while he was away, and for nearly two decades, the two co-parented mobley, even after they ended their relationship in 2003. \" the person she called dad for 18 years isn't her dad, \" manigo tells abc, adding that she told him, \" dad, i love you, \" at williams ' bond hearing friday in south carolina. On the other side of the feelings spectrum is craig aiken, mobley's birth father, who, along with her birth mom, reunited with his long-lost daughter saturday at a south carolina police station and called the meeting \" beautiful, \" per the new york daily news. \" i told her i was glad to see her and that i loved her, \" he told reporters. As for manigo, he's still trying to take all of these new developments in, calling the attention \" overwhelming, \" per abc. \" she was the love of my life, \" he says, adding that while he recognizes the situation, \" she's still my child. \" probably struggling the most with her emotions in this case is mobley herself, who's said to have posted on her facebook page, \" my mother is no felon.

        "summary": "A doctor in her final month of pregnancy with her third child was unwittingly suffering from a rare complication of pregnancy called peripartum cardiomyopathy, or ppcm. It's a form of heart failure that weakens the heart chambers and, in the most serious cases, can be fatal, explains the houston chronicle. So when alexander hicks heard a thump from upstairs while his 33-year-old wife, marlene dominguez-hicks, was napping with their 5-year-old daughter and baby girl, he ran up to see if the older child had jumped out of bed. Instead, he found was his wife unconscious on the floor. Despite swift action from paramedics and an emergency c-section to try to save the unborn child, both died, and mother and son were buried together. That was in early september. Now, hicks says, he's planning to visit with dominguez-hicks ' obstetrician to try to better understand what happened to his wife, though much about the disease — including whether there might be a genetic component — remains unclear. An american heart association fact sheet says only about 1,000 women suffer from ppcm each year, generally in the last month of pregnancy or in the first five months after giving birth. Symptoms include a racing heart and swelling ankles. Friends have started a gofundme page to help the family cover long-term expenses, and it's pulled in about $ 84,000 so far. \" this has been an unbearable time for our family and we will not get through this without your strength and love, \" hicks wrote to supporters.

This makes the october full moon a supermoon. The term supermoon has entered popular consciousness in recent years. Originally a term from modern astrology for a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is within 90 % of its closest approach to earth in a given orbit, supermoon now refers more broadly to a full moon that is closer to earth than average. But why is the moon closer to earth at some times but not others? since the moon's orbit is elliptical, one side ( perigee ) is about 30,000 miles ( 50,000 km ) closer to earth than the other ( apogee ). The word syzygy, in addition to being useful in word games, is the scientific name for when the earth, sun, and moon line up as the moon orbits earth. When perigee-syzygy of the earth-moon-sun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, we get a perigee moon or more commonly, a supermoon! this coincidence happens three times in 2016.

Sitting in the clarendon laboratory at oxford university, it makes a little metal ball move swiftly back and forth between two bells. How its early electric battery ( or \" dry pile \" ) works remains unknown — and nobody's sure what it's made of. \" but it is clear that the outer coating is of sulphur, and this seals in the cells and the electrolyte, \" writes a former researcher in the european journal of physics. It also resembles piles by the 19th-century physicist and priest giuseppe zamboni, who made batteries by gluing together alternate layers of tin foil and paper covered with zinc sulphate and manganese dioxide. However it's made, the guinness book of world records calls it the \" world's most durable battery. \" we know it was built by a london instrument-manufacturing firm and acquired by an oxford physics professor in the 1800s. His attached note, \" set up in 1840, \" dates the device, but the oxford physics department says a second note may date it to 1825. We also know it inspired a physicist to create a similar battery for british infrared telescopes during world war ii. But the device now pulls a mere 1 nanoamp for each oscillation of the ball, which is barely a current at all — so \" at this point, we're probably not going to build a better battery thanks to this experiment, \" says motherboard. One bright spot: the bell, which has rung about 10 billion times, creates such a tiny sound that the human ear can't even hear it, meaning it won't drive anyone crazy.

The same issue and an accompanying recall occurred in april with almost a million trek bikes that also used the vendor-supplied lever, outside reported at the time, with gizmodo adding that \" this seemingly simple problem — where a generic-brand lever interacts with a newer brake design — illustrates how sticky it can be to integrate old and new technology into a single product. \" a dedicated website from the bpsa, which is helping organize the recall, offers a video and detailed instructions to help consumers determine if their bikes are affected.

According to legend, a woman collected the blood of saint januarius, or san gennaro — the once pious bishop of naples who was beheaded as christianity was under attack around ad 305 — and preserved it in a glass vial, reports seeker. Then a \" blood miracle \" in 1389: the congealed blood liquefied. The archbishop of naples now performs this \" blood miracle, \" shaking the vial in front of thousands until the blood liquefies, on three significant days each year, the most recent of which should have been dec. 16. ( mount vesuvius erupted on that day in 1631, and naples was said to have been protected by the saint. ) and yet last week, it didn't. One website claims that when the blood miracle — which is \" not quite sanctioned by the catholic church, \" per the week — has failed to work, 22 epidemics, 19 earthquakes, four wars, and various other tragedies have followed. When the blood last failed to liquefy in 1980, an earthquake struck 30 miles from naples, killing 2,400 people. The blood also remained congealed in 1939, the year world war ii began. But \" we must not think of calamities, \" says the local abbot, per the catholic news agency. \" we are men of faith and we must pray. \" as for what men of science think, the new york times in 1991 reported on a study that suggested medieval chemists could have created artificial blood that would liquefy upon shaking.

            "The preserved, clotted blood of early saints of the roman catholic church liquefies on certain ceremonial occasions, drawing crowds of faithful pilgrims eager to witness the miraculous phenomenon. But a team of italian scientists has conducted experiments showing that medieval chemists could easily have created imitation blood that would do the same thing. In a report published by the british journal nature, a group headed by dr. Luigi garlaschelli, a chemist at the university of pavia, says that blood liquefaction can be explained in terms of a phenomenon called thixatropy. Certain substances, including some types of mayonnaise, are normally thick gels, but can be liquefied instantly by shaking or stirring. Part of the ritual of checking the miraculous blood of saint januarius, observed every few months in naples, for example, involves inverting the blood's reliquary container. This simple act is enough to liquefy certain thixotropic gels, the authors note. Left to stand, such liquids soon revert to gels. The italian team prepared one type of imitation blood using a solution of ferric chloride and calcium carbonate. Another successful experiment involved extraction of material from animal gut, and subsequent treatment with iron oxide and sodium chloride. In these and other experiments, the scientists said, they produced a brownish material that clotted when left",

There have been at least 40 large-scale thefts of avocados since january, with thieves stealing onto farms in the middle of the night, raking trees, and loading vehicles with the fruit to be sold at road-side stalls and grocery stores, reports the guardian. Why all the fuss over a few hundred avocados? well, they're selling for $ 3 to $ 5 each thanks to a poor growing season, increased demand at home, and the fact that many new zealand growers focus on the export market, per the telegraph.

It isn't clear how tinder chooses members, but there's speculation it involves one's elo score, which tinder ceo sean rad previously told fast company was a measure of \" desirability \" based on a \" very complicated \" algorithm. A reddit user reported getting a select invitation five months ago, which suggests it's been around for at least that long with no official mention from tinder. It's possible the company realized ordinary users wouldn't be pleased; one such user complains in a tweet that tinder is stripping women of a pretty woman fantasy.
