        "summary": "A marine credited with throwing himself on a grenade to save a buddy, suffering devastating injuries in so doing will become the third us marine of the afghanistan and iraq wars to receive the medal of honor, the marine corps times reports. William kyle carpenter, now a 24-year-old medically retired corporal, dove on a grenade as the pair stood guard on a rooftop in afghanistan in november 2010. The explosion shattered his jaw, broke his arm in several places, cost him his right eye and most of his teeth, and forced him to undergo more than 30 surgeries, while his friend, nicholas eufrazio, also suffered a brain injury so bad that he wasn't able to speak until recently. \" our feeling has always been that kyle shielded nick from that blast, \" carpenter's platoon sergeant says, though the marine corps times notes no one actually witnessed the explosion. Carpenter himself can't remember what happened — though last year he recalled \" warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out of consciousness with my the final thought of ' i ' m going to die ' in my head, \" per stars and stripes. A triage worker who initially treated the pair, however, says the grenade's point of detonation was beneath carpenter's torso and his injuries indeed indicated he covered it. \" if he hadn't done it, what we found would have looked completely different. \"",

Carpenter, 24, would be the 10th u.s. Servicemember — and the second marine — to receive the medal of honor from the war in afghanistan.

The marine corps investigation of the incident to determine whether carpenter deserved the award was complicated by several factors: there were no other witnesses, carpenter couldn't remember what happened because of trauma and eufrazio was unable to speak until late 2012.

President obama is on the receiving end of criticism and coffee-themed jokes for stepping off the marine one helicopter in new york yesterday while holding a coffee cup in his right hand, then casually saluting the marines surrounding the aircraft with cup still in hand, usa today reports. The white house posted the video to its instagram account, and the comments quickly started piling up. In addition to the somewhat obvious puns and clever headlines and labels — including the washington times ' \" semper latte \" and abc news ' \" latte salute \" — the president's seemingly casual gesture is also inciting outrage and eye-rolling. Some think the hubbub is overblown, especially since a civilian president isn't actually required to return a military member's salute and the issue itself is somewhat controversial, notes reuters. One twitter user posts, \" [ w ] ho cares. I ' m a vet with multiple tours over seas. He was trying. I ' m sure it wasn't his intention to be disrespectful. \" but a manual for marine corps officers cited by the times says the salute is \" the most important of all military courtesies \" and that if you're going to do it, \" do not salute when … carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical. \" ( this wounded soldier's touching salute became known as the \" salute seen around the world. \" )",

        "summary": "Still reeling from a double data breach and accusations of insider trading, the new york times now reports that equifax's latest problem comes via a software engineer who created a phony copy of its website about the data intrusion — which the company then included in a series of tweets. Nick sweeting says he worked up securityequifax2017.com ( a flip of the company's equifaxsecurity2017.com ) to expose how easy it would be for phishers to make a copycat site. \" their site is dangerously easy to impersonate, \" he says. Sweeting took pics of some of the now-deleted equifax tweets, which started around sept. 9 and went through at least sept. 19, per gizmodo. The company's critical error, per cybersecurity experts who spoke to the times: it created an entirely new site instead of a subdomain of equifax.com, making the company's site more vulnerable to phishing. Sweeting, who explains he was able to easily download the contents of equifax's site using a linux command, says his site got about 2,000 hits before getting the twitter push, though he adds he built the site to not store consumer info, per cnn. He also made sure there was a large headline on the site alerting everyone it was fake. He says it cost him just $ 10 and 20 minutes of his time to create it. As for the person named \" tim \" who tweeted out the wrong url ( who sweeting thinks probably just googled for the site address and picked up the wrong one ), sweeting doesn't think he should be harshly disciplined: \" the real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly. \" equifax has apologized for the erroneous tweets, but hasn't yet commented on the domain's setup. ( meanwhile, it was revealed the company's ex-security chief has a degree in … music composition. )",

        "summary": "In an outcome that few analysts predicted, donald trump is not only a loser in iowa, coming in second to ted cruz, he came within a whisker of being knocked into third place by marco rubio. Here's what pundits say this means for the gop nomination race: \" the loss raises the possibility that mr. Trump's strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks, \" writes nate cohn at the new york times. A long, three-way fight probably lies ahead, and cruz now appears to have \" a narrow but real path \" to the nomination, involving success in southern states after next week's new hampshire primary, he writes. Rubio's third-place finish is great news for the gop establishment seeking a clear alternative to both cruz and trump, eli stokols writes at politico. Going into new hampshire, rubio is on the \" sharpest upward trajectory while his two rivals, despite finishing ahead of him, are seeing their support tick down in recent weeks as the result of unrelenting attacks between them, \" he writes. For the \" trump blimp, \" we will soon find out whether this is \" a small leak that he can patch over in plenty of time for new hampshire or whether it's a catastrophic hole that will bring the whole enterprise down, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post, noting that it's bad news for trump that the latter scenario is even being discussed. More bad news for trump: analysts had predicted that he would win if there was a high turnout in iowa, but his loss came amid a record-breaking turnout of around 180,000 gop caucus-goers, up 60,000 people from the record set in 2012, the des moines register reports. Trump congratulated cruz in what cnn describes as a \" short but gracious \" speech. \" we will go on to get the republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat hillary or bernie, \" he told supporters. \" we finished second, and i have to say i am just honored. \" cruz, meanwhile, was still on the offensive, saying the result \" sent notice that the republican nominee and the next president of the united states will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the washington establishment. \" cruz and his campaign \" invested considerable time and money to grind out a victory in this key state, and they were ultimately rewarded for their efforts, \" notes anthony zurcher at the bbc, who predicts that while trump will no doubt remain a factor, the next big showdown will be between cruz",

He said he had written to the families of those killed in niger and the letters would be sent out that night, reports the washington post reports. In a tweet, alyssa mastromonaco, obama's former deputy chief of staff, called trump a liar and a \" deranged animal. \" freddy ford, a spokesman for george w. Bush, tells the ap that the former president \" wrote all the families of the fallen, \" even at the height of the wars in iraq and afghanistan, when more than 800 were dying each year. He says bush also called or met with \" hundreds, if not thousands \" of their relatives.

        "summary": "Six years ago, the state of ohio tried to execute romell broom for raping and killing a 14-year-old girl. That execution was unsuccessful — making broom the country's only survivor of a botched lethal injection, the ap notes. Now his lawyers are trying to prevent him from having to go through another. Broom's attorneys argued before the ohio supreme court yesterday that making a second attempt to take broom's life would amount to cruel and unusual punishment, as well as double jeopardy. But prosecutors refute those claims, saying the double jeopardy claims don't stick because lethal drugs never made their way into broom's bloodstream ( the execution team couldn't find a vein they could use in two hours of trying ) and that just because the previous process failed, it doesn't nullify broom's death sentence. Broom says he was stuck with needles at least 18 times, which a defense attorney told the court was akin to \" being stabbed \" for two hours, per cleveland.com. She also began to liken the situation to that of a soldier suffering from trauma from being under fire, the ap notes. Chief justice maureen o ' connor interrupted: \" counsel, i don't think i'd equate your client to a united states soldier. \" a precedent of sorts exists for this case: the us supreme court allowed willie francis, 18, to be executed in 1947 by electric chair, even though an attempt the previous year had failed. That court's ruling said a death sentence could be carried out even if \" an accident, with no suggestion of malevolence, prevents the consummation of a sentence. \" an opinion on the case could be weeks or months away, notes cleveland.com.",

The latest one, from the ap, asserts that manafort \" secretly worked for a russian billionaire to advance the interests of russian president vladimir putin a decade ago, \" and it's drawing attention given the fbi's confirmation of an investigation into possible collusion between trump campaign officials and moscow. A look at coverage: the ap says it obtained a memo in which manafort promised aluminum tycoon oleg deripaska that he could influence news stories and politics in the us and around the world to \" greatly benefit the putin government. \" this, says the ap, \" appears to contradict assertions by the trump administration and manafort himself that he never worked for russian interests. \" read the story in full.

According to researchers at queensland's bond university, some 84 % of victims of unprovoked shark attacks are men, as are 89 % of fatalities, the telegraph reports. The lead researcher says this may be because men \" spend more time in the water, and are more risk-prone. \" over the 30-year period studied, australia had 32 fatal shark attacks, more than any other country.

        "summary": "Huge news in the sweet-smelling world of perfume: researchers at queen's university belfast say they're developed a perfume that makes you smell better the more you sweat. Basically, the perfume — a raw scent combined with an odorless ionic liquid — uses a special \" delivery system \" that releases more of the perfume's fragrance when it encounters moisture. When skin is dry, the fragrance acts like \" a lead weight \" so the aroma \" can't fly away, \" researcher nimal gunaratne tells the bbc. \" water is like the scissors \" that then release the scent. Remarkably, the fragrance doesn't just overpower the less-pleasing smell of sweat. Stinky \" thiol \" compounds in sweat are drawn to the ionic liquid, which effectively eliminates their odor. In a press release, gunaratne says experts are already brainstorming new products that could take advantage of the technology. \" not only does it have great commercial potential, and could be used in perfumes and cosmetic creams, but it could also be used in others area of science, such as the slow release of certain substances of interest, \" gunaratne says, calling the fragrance \" an exciting breakthrough. \" in what can only be described as less-exciting perfume news, burger king japan yesterday released a \" flame-grilled \" fragrance, which is apparently supposed to smell like a whopper. Instead, it smells \" something like the burnt-rubber skidmarks left by a box-fresh-macbook-carrying courier scooter after it crashed into a bacon salt factory, \" writes sam byford at the verge, who paid $ 42 to try it out. In other words, it's \" unspeakably terrible. \" ( you ' ll soon be able to buy a perfume recreated from a bottle found in a 150-year-old shipwreck. )",

        "summary": "Concerns about hillary clinton's health have gone from conspiracy theory to what analysts are calling a major campaign issue. After she abruptly left a 9/11 memorial event early sunday, her doctor disclosed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on friday and was advised to rest. The campaign now says that clinton has canceled a monday and tuesday trip to california that would have involved several fundraising appearances as well as a major economic speech and an appearance on ellen, the washington post reports. In other coverage: clinton's physician, dr. Lisa r. Bardack, said clinton was \" overheated and dehydrated \" at the 9/11 event but is now \" rehydrated and recovering nicely, \" the new york times reports. Bardack didn't say what kind of pneumonia clinton has or whether she had a fever sunday. Politico reports that political journalists strongly criticized the campaign's handling of clinton's illness, while clinton allies downplayed the issue — and even praised her stamina. \" ' powering through ' illness is what women do: stoically, every. Single. Day, \" tweeted former michigan gov. Jennifer granholm. Cnn spoke to a doctor about clinton's stumble and the subsequent news of pneumonia. Ford vox says neither is at all unusual in somebody clinton's age, though there's certainly a chance of other underlying health issues. The los angeles times reports that the incident has renewed calls for the release of detailed health records from clinton, who is 68, and her 70-year-old rival. \" this is the kind of thing that voters have a right to understand before they cast a vote, \" says gop strategist katie packer, who doesn't support either candidate. \" both trump and hillary are elderly. They are obligated to release full medical records and full tax returns to the american people. And the media, party leaders, and american people should settle for nothing less. \" the washington post looks at the \" intense privacy \" that has long surrounded clinton's health after incidents like a 1998 blood clot in her leg that she later described as her \" scariest moment. \" the telegraph looks at what might happen if health issues force clinton to quit the race. Politico reports that some trump supporters gleefully celebrated her illness on social media, though trump himself has declined to comment. A lobbyist who raises money for trump says he hopes the candidate will be able to remain \" very careful and sensitive, and not reinforce the worse things people think about him. \"",

Denise williams, 48, was arrested tuesday on first-degree murder charges, reports the tallahassee democrat. It was a dramatic turn in a cold case broken wide open by the discovery of mike williams ' body in december. It turned out the 31-year-old hadn't fallen from a boat while duck hunting on lake seminole in 2000 and been eaten by alligators, as was long speculated. He was instead murdered, his body dumped near a boat landing in tallahassee, reports fox news. The announcement of its discovery came a day after mike's best friend, brian winchester, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the armed kidnapping of denise, whom he married in 2005. In june 2001, mike had been declared dead by \" accidental drowning \" at denise's request, per the democrat. She collected more than $ 2 million from life insurance policies, including a $ 1 million policy sold to mike by winchester. Though denise and winchester would later marry, the pair divorced in 2015, and in 2016, winchester kidnapped denise at gunpoint. Documents from his sentencing show he was fearful of what denise might tell police about mike's disappearance. An indictment now says denise conspired with winchester to shoot and kill her husband, per wctv. Says winchester's lawyer, \" we don't anticipate him being charged, \" and \" if he's subpoenaed or granted immunity, he will cooperate and testify truthfully. \" denise's lawyer says she ' ll fight the charges. \" there's been a drum beat against her for years, but she has nothing to do with mike williams'death, \" he says.",

Rescuer michael chase: \"i ' m never going to get rid of those images on that street, boylston. Events like the bombings … allow our differences to divide us more.

It is a \" high-propulsion \" cloud of mucus and saliva that spreads across entire rooms, even reaching ceilings and the ventilation ducts found there, in a matter of minutes. Mit researchers first gained attention last year with these findings, reports cbs boston, and they're about to release their latest findings in the journal experiments in fluids. This time they used two cameras to capture high-speed videos of two healthy people sneezing roughly 50 times over the course of several days. They were looking to gain an understanding of the first stage of the sneeze, \" the part that is still a big unknown.... I wanted to... Go upstream and look at the mouth, at what is coming out, \" says lead researcher lydia bourouiba. What bourouiba and her team found was that the droplets don't exit the mouth \" already formed and neatly distributed in size, \" as had long been assumed, she says in a press release. Instead, a \" complex cascading breakup \" occurs, with the mucus and saliva beginning as a sheet then moving in \" bursts, bags, and beaded strings during this progression, \" as the bbc puts it. Bourouiba calls it a \" high-propulsion sneeze cloud. \" next the researchers plan to use nine high-speed cameras to map out sneezes in 3d. \" we realized that there were very rich three-dimensional dynamics that we really needed to capture, \" she says, adding that only then will they understand sneezes \" in their full glory. \" ( check out what a sneeze dislodged from this man's nose after 44 years. )",

The tint has been noticed by several reviewers, and users are complaining about the screens in apple's support forum. The iphone 4 and ipad 2 both had problems with yellow tints showing up on their displays, which turned out to be caused by adhesive that hadn't cured yet.

In an interview, rick ledgett, head of the task force investigating snowden's impact, didn't rule out the possibility of amnesty, per cnet: it's \" worth having a conversation about, \" though opinion is \" not unanimous, \" he says. \" i would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high, \" ledgett says. It would be more than just an assertion on his part. \" but nsa head gen. Keith alexander says offering amnesty would be like giving a hostage-taker a break after several killings. In other news surrounding the segment: fearing snowden could have left a computer virus behind, the agency has spent tens of millions of dollars getting rid of devices to which he had access, ledgett says. While working at home, ledgett adds, snowden used \" a hood that covered the computer screen and covered his head and shoulders, so that he could work and his girlfriend couldn't see what he was doing. \" the agency is worried that further leaks from snowden could offer enemies \" a roadmap of what we know and what we don't know \" and \" a way to protect their information from the us intelligence community's view, \" ledgett said in the segment, via politico. \" it is the keys to the kingdom. \" meanwhile, both the segment and alexander himself are taking some heat from critics. At the verge, tc sottek calls the 60 minutes piece \" a routine look at the agency's propaganda with no critical voices. \" alexander says in the clip that \" we're not collecting everybody's email, we're not collecting everybody's phone things, we're not listening to that \" — but that's not what the agency has been accused of, sottek notes: it's the collection of reams of metadata that's the problem. Per rt, journalist shane harris tweeted that the report had \" gone from one-sided to misleading. No critics? \" journalist glenn greenwald, key to the publishing of snowden leaks, tweeted that the segment was \" way over the self-parody line. \" and alexander's early claims that the agency has total power to audit its workers appears more and more misleading, writes conor friedersdorf at the atlantic.

Census forms reveal that a larger proportion of americans of hispanic origin are declaring themselves to be white, for a net shift of 1.2 million between 2000 and 2010, the new york times finds. Some 2.5 million people who identified themselves as of \" hispanic, latino, or spanish origin \" in 2000 listed their race as \" some other race \" that year and \" white \" a decade later, while 1.3 million changed their race in the other direction. A total of 10 million more americans checked different race or hispanic-origin boxes in the 2010 census than they had in the 2000 count, according to the pew research center, which notes that people too young to have filled out the form themselves in 2000 account for much of the change. But \" becoming white \" is nothing new in american history: irish and italian immigrants were originally considered non-white, and benjamin franklin once declared swedes, russians, and even non-saxon germans to have a too \" swarthy complexion \" to be considered white. As happened with earlier groups of immigrants, \" assimilation, intermarriage, and upward mobility \" appear to be driving the shift among hispanics, writes jamelle bouie at slate.",

        "summary": "\" they are simply a stranger to the land, \" an anthropologist says of southeast asia's bajau people, and a new study shows their bodies have changed to account for that. The bajau, who live in indonesia, malaysia, and the philippines, sustain themselves by diving for fish, and have a noticeable ability to dive long and deep, even compared to other local divers. The new york times reports they can dive more than 200 feet down with no equipment other than wooden goggles. The feats led melissa ilardo to wonder if evolution played a role, and an ultrasound machine confirmed there was a biological difference: it turns out the bajau have larger spleens. When researching in sulawesi, indonesia, she compared the size of bajau locals'spleens with those of the saluan, a people who lived 15 miles inland. The difference was stark: the bajau's spleens were about 50 % bigger. \" it was like ' oh my god, ' \" says a co-author of the study, published thursday in cell. As for why the spleen, the guardian reports the researchers found a \" clue \" in research that had been done on seals: it turns out those seals that can dive for longer periods of time have bigger spleens. During the \" diving reflex, \" which is triggered when one submerges the head in water, the spleen contracts, pumping oxygen-rich red blood cells into the circulatory system. The team measured the spleens of bajau who weren't divers and found they were large, too, suggesting evolution is at play. They zeroed in on a gene variant called pde10a as influencing the spleen's size. What's unknown: when the change began. ( a new human organ was recently discovered. )",

A few of the girls seized in april have escaped, but nearly 300 are still missing.

        "summary": "The explorers club annual dinner in new york — now going on its 112th year — has long treated its guests to exotic food items, including in more recent years deep-fried tarantulas, goat eyeball martinis, and the barbecued sex organs of bulls, reports the atlantic. But the most famous meal of all was back in 1951, when host wendell phillips dodge was said to have thrown the \" dinner party of the century, \" as npr puts it. He was always a bit hazy about what the protein portion actually was, and accounts vary, but the debate has focused on either woolly mammoth or the extinct giant ground sloth megatherium. Now two grad students at yale reported wednesday in the journal plos one that either claim amounts to a grand hoax, because the guests were in fact eating green sea turtle. They know this because they sequenced the tiny amount of usable dna found in a nearly forgotten specimen housed since 2001 at the yale peabody museum of natural history. That specimen was preserved only because one of the guests, taxidermist paul howes, was unable to attend the much-anticipated meal and requested that a portion be set aside in a bottle of preservative for his own posterity. In hindsight, the hoax is not so surprising. Dodge was a notorious showman, not a paleontologist, reports npr, and he'd set the stage for the dinner with stories of two famous explorers discovering the ancient specimen in alaska. While some found the meat tough and flavorless, others likened it to veal; all surely enjoyed letting their imaginations run wild. ( this woman was arrested for harassing a sea turtle. )",

In addition to his international fame, zeus was well known throughout the kalamazoo area due to frequent trips to area schools and hospitals, where he served as a therapy dog. Doorlag said seeing the joy zeus brought to others will be another one of the things he misses most about his late pet. \" those are some of the things i ' ll never forget about him, \" doorlag said. \" he was definitely a great dog. \" alex mitchell covers county"

So should you get one? in some individual circumstances, maybe, but for the vast majority of consumers, you might be better off using plain, old, boring wifi. Here's why. T-mobile's cellspot doesn't provide an internet connection all by itself. It has to be plugged into an existing wired broadband connection, the kind of service you might buy from comcast or verizon. That requirement ultimately makes the cellspot impractical for many consumers. Think about your current home internet provider. Chances are, the company included a wifi router with your installation, and if it didn't, you likely went out and bought your own. Not only does the cellspot effectively duplicate an internet access technology already present in many people's homes — it comes with other drawbacks."

            "The 4g lte cellspot is a like a mini-tower for your house or office. ( photo: t-mobile ) new york — your cellphone coverage is pretty good in the neighborhoods where you live and work, but securing a decent signal inside your house has proved to be a challenge. On monday, t-mobile announced t-mobile 4g lte cellspot, an 8.5-inch tall and 8.5-inch wide box which plugs into your internet router and which the company claims can provide an average of 3,000 square feet of full-bar lte coverage indoors. Based on \" femtocell \" or \" small cell \" technology, t-mobile says this is the first-ever 4g lte mini-tower available from a u.s. Wireless provider. Lte ( long term evolution ) is the prevailing 4th generation of speedy wireless. T-mobile's solution is like putting a tiny cell phone tower in the home to improve coverage in the basement or other areas where network coverage might be shaky. T-mobile is giving cellspot to its post-paid customers for free, though you ' ll have to leave a refundable $ 25 deposit, and remain a t-mobile customer. Post-paid refers to the lucrative segment of customers who pay their wireless bills each month. The low-power box becomes available on wednesday. If you're a qualifying customer, you can request cellspot in a t-mobile store but the company won't have them in stock and",

Chemical analysis revealed that they were of both the red and white variety, and the new york times ticks off ingredients including honey, mint, cinnamon bark, and juniper berries. The jars would have held enough for about 3,000 bottles. \" it's a wine cellar that, to our knowledge, is largely unmatched in its age and size, \" says a lead researcher from george washington university. It was discovered in the long-gone city of tel kabri, which was destroyed in some calamitous event — perhaps an earthquake — about 3,600 years ago. \"the wine cellar was located near a hall where banquets took place, a place where the kabri elite and possibly foreign guests consumed goat meat and wine, \" says an israeli researcher on the project.

        "summary": "New england really wants to get ahead — by one hour. The new york times reports on the movement that's afoot in that region for some states to transition permanently to the atlantic standard time zone, ignoring the changing of the clocks that takes place at the start and end of daylight saving time. By sticking to the same time within that zone each year instead of following eastern standard time rules and \" falling back \" an hour in november, then resetting the clocks ahead an hour in march to begin daylight saving time, massachusetts — and possibly rhode island, new hampshire, and maine — would remain an hour ahead of new york and other east coast cities for the entire winter. The boston globe reported last summer that a task force had been set up in the bay state to see if this change, which would keep more daylight coming in at day's end during winter, made sense. Besides the benefit of extra daylight on the back end, supporters say the change would prevent messing with our sleep cycles, as well as remedy the accompanying rise in accidents that happen around time-change days. Plus, in terms of geography, most of new england lines up more closely with ast areas in canada than its us east coast neighbors. But critics say it ' ll be a hard sell with state legislatures, with cons including chaos for commuters crossing time zones, confusion regarding business operating hours and tv broadcasting schedules, and kids having to wait at dark bus stops in the winter. To that last point, tom emswiler, the author of the massachusetts measure, says schools could adjust start times so kids could sleep later. He tells the globe that \" just about everyone \" he asked near boston has said: \" why can't we just say yes and flip the switch? ' \" ( beware the \" microsleeps \" that follow when we lose our hour of snoozing. )",

He was helicoptered to a lille hospital, but \" all medical assistance was to no avail. \" goolaerts was 23. Npr reports the 160-mile, one-day race has been dubbed \" the hell of the north \" for its difficulty. Goolaerts hadn't raced it before and crashed in the second of the course's 29 cobblestone sections, which make up about 20 % of the course, while making a right-hand turn. Two belgians died in other races in 2016; american chad young died last year in a new mexico race, and a french racer died months later. The ap explains the paris-roubaix race's difficulty by noting that nearly half the riders didn't even finish in 2017. At the guardian, richard williams reports the race has been held since 1896, seven years longer than the tour de france, and he explains why cycling fans so fiercely \" revere \" it. \" these are all hard men, \" he writes of the riders, \" mostly belgian and dutch, brought up to race in harsh conditions. There is little room in this race for the slender spaniards or tiny colombians who fly up the great climbs of the alps and pyrenees.

An internal audit and other records handed to the paper by snowden \" earlier this summer \" show that when it comes to snooping, the nsa hasn't always been playing by government rules. In the 12 months leading to may 2012, the agency breached privacy regulations some 2,776 times — and each previous year saw thousands of similar incidents, right back to when the agency's powers were expanded in 2008. The post describes the bulk of the breaches as being related to surveillance that occurred within the us, either of americans or foreign targets. \" inadequate or insufficient research \" related to wiretap targets was often to blame, the new york times notes. The newspapers offer a few examples: in 2008, the nsa accidentally intercepted a \" large number \" of calls from washington, dc, because of a programming error; its 202 area code was mistaken for that of egypt's international dialing code — 20. To wit, 10 % of breaches were traced back to a typographical error. The foreign intelligence surveillance court didn't know about one information-gathering technique for months; after the court discovered the procedure, it was deemed unconstitutional. One of the biggest problems — the source of 1,904 of the 2,776 incidents — centered on \" roamers, \" the times notes. The term refers to foreigners whose phones were being tapped without a warrant overseas; once they entered the us, officials were supposed to get a warrant to keep tracking the numbers. Such mistakes, according to the audit, are \" largely unpreventable \" because of the unpredictability of targets ' movements. Click through for the post's full story; the times piece is here.",

            "Google maps recently added a new round of panoramic street view images from antarctica including such points of interest as explorer ernest shackleton's hut from the nimrod expedition and the ceremonial south pole. Google first added antarctic imagery to street view in 2010, but photos of the ice-encased continent were fairly limited. In fact, they still are. You can't easily get around antarctica on street view ( or in the real world for that matter ), but at least you can catch a peek of some of the highlights on google maps. Here's a look at five of the top locations you don't want to miss from google's sub-zero street view. Shackleton's hut built circa 1908, this hut was used by famed antarctic explorer ernest shackleton and his crew during the nimrod expedition that lasted from 1907-1909. The hut is located at cape royds on the far west of ross island. Cape royds adélie penguin rookery just down the ice sheet from shackleton's hut is the cape royds adélie penguin rookery. Ceremonial south pole located a stone's throw from the amundsen-scott south pole station, the ceremonial south pole features the flags of the original 12 signatory nations to the antarctic treaty. South pole telescope also at south pole station is the south pole telescope, constructed on-site between november 2006 and february 2007. The telescope is being used to study dark energy in the search for answers to age-old questions such as how old is the universe. Scott's hut located on cape evans on ross island, this hut was built in 1911 during robert falcon scott's terra nova expedition ( 1910-1912 ). Terra nova was the second expedition to reach the south pole; a norwegian team led by roald amundsen beat scott to the pole by about a month. Although they made it to the pole, scott's team perished on the return journey to their base camp.

        "summary": "The ancient egyptian mummy has been a favorite attraction at the british museum since it was discovered a century ago in gebelein, but only keen-eyed passers-by would've wondered at the dark smudges on the male's upper arm. Turns out, they were worth noticing. Infrared scans have revealed them to be the oldest figurative tattoos in the world, reports the guardian. The two slightly overlapping tattoos showing a wild bull and a horned sheep — together with four s-shaped marks found on the shoulder of a female mummy also kept in the museum — are thought to be at least 5,000 years old, a millennium older than other tattooing evidence found in africa, according to a study in the journal of archaeological science. With gebelein man and gebelein woman dating from 3351bc to 3017bc, their tattoos could technically be the oldest in the world. But there's competition from the simple lines tattooed on otzi the iceman, who lived in europe between 3370bc and 3100bc, reports the bbc. The more elaborate tattoos on the ancient egyptians are believed to have been created using soot and \" some type of needle made from bone or copper, \" british museum curator daniel antoine says, per the sydney morning herald. The bbc reports the tats likely \" denoted status, bravery, and magical knowledge. \" but though antoine says gebelein woman \" may have been a person of importance, \" gebelein man's tattoos are particularly important as they represent the first evidence that males in the region were tattooed in addition to women.

But there are other, less common causes of death that are actually much more typical in certain states compared with the nation as a whole. Now, a new map shows these so-called \" most distinctive \" causes of death for each state. The map is \" a somewhat of a colorful and provocative way of starting some conversations and highlighting some unusual things that are going on, \" said study co-author francis boscoe, a research scientist at new york state cancer registry.

And although the law might not have been an issue for pam tebow, who says she based her decision on her christian faith, the writer notes, \"it is an issue for, oh, the 1,000-plus women who died in 2008 because of the philippines ' abortion ban. \"",

            "Whether you like it or not, d.c. Congressional candidate missy smith wants you to see images of dead and dismembered fetuses. It doesn't really matter much whether \" you \" are a 5-year-old child or a 50-year-old mother. Her spots have aired this week during the day and early evening, and despite legion complaints, broadcasters say they are required by federal law to air the 30-second spots in full. You see, the communications act requires that candidates are given \" reasonable access \" to broadcast and prohibits censorship of political spots based on content. At the same time, though, the fcc forbids the broadcast of indecent content. This puts broadcasters in quite the bind, as these rules sometimes stand in opposition to each other, and yet violating either could result in a station losing its license. This isn't the first time a debate over indecency and candidates ' equal right to public broadcast has arisen. In 1992, congressional candidates michael bailey and daniel becker aired similarly gruesome antiabortion ads during prime time. Viewers complained and broadcasters went to the fcc, which ruled that the ads were not indecent and therefore could not be restricted to certain hours without violating the \" reasonable access \" and anti-censorship clauses. Two years later, the fcc determined that these ads could be restricted from airing from 6 a.m. To 10 p.m. \" so as to protect children, \" and that this wouldn't violate the \" reasonable access \" and no-censorship provisions. Then came another switcheroo in 1996: the d.c. Court of appeals tossed out the ruling, finding that it did violate the \" reasonable access \" and no-censorship provisions. If you followed all that perfectly, congrats, genius. If not, the simple takeaway is that broadcasters in d.c. Are now following a ruling that upheld the supremacy of provisions protecting candidates ' right to uncensored public broadcast over viewers ' right to not have to see aborted fetuses during their tv family dinners. Thankfully, i ' m allowed to give you a choice: to see aborted fetuses, click here. To see a puppy with hiccups, click here.",

Mr. Belser agreed. The two shook hands – and the rest is history. Up for the challenge, pate took to twitter thursday morning with the long-shot request for the retired nba star, along with two photos of him and mr.

On wednesday, she sent cooper to stay with relatives while she went to a wedding in jamaica — but instead of putting the dog on its flight from halifax, nova scotia to deer lake, newfoundland, westjet put the dog on the wrong flight and it ended up in hamilton, ontario, more than 1,000 miles away in the wrong direction, the cbc reports. And as if that wasn't bad enough, cooper slipped his leash and ran away after airport workers in hamilton took him outside to pee. Pittman flew to hamilton when she found out about the mix-up and searched the fields around the airport for cooper, joined by many local volunteers who had heard about the search on social media. After a night of torrential rains, residents spotted cooper around a mile away from the airport, friday morning, the hamilton spectator reports. In a facebook post, pittman says it was a \" wonderful feeling \" to be reunited with cooper after two terrible days.

Facebook recently admitted that teens are spending less time on its site, and if it wants to stay on top it has to \" evolve with the ever-changing tastes of the teenage set, \" and right now, they're on whatsapp. Whatsapp also has the almost unique power to \" capture the attention of users no matter where they are or what else they're doing. \" bloomberg points out that with that pricetag, facebook is valuing whatsapp at 19 times sales, \" a multiple investors currently only bestow on companies developing life-saving drugs. \" and that's assuming whatsapp does expand to a billion paying users. \" it's ludicrous, \" one analyst says. \" it reminds you of the dot-com bubble all over again.

Now dubbed \" measles mary, \" the 22-year-old theater worker in new york city had been released without quarantine because she was fully vaccinated. Then four people she'd interacted with got sick — including, oddly enough, two who had been vaccinated and two who showed signs of earlier measles exposure, which should have protected them. In measles mary's case, her vaccine-given immunity had apparently declined. We all have natural igm antibodies that protect us from microbial invasions, if imperfectly; a full vaccination or case of the measles should buttress that with stronger igg antibodies. But an investigation found that mary's igg antibodies had lost their power to fight off measles. The prospect of waning measles immunity is unnerving as the disease makes a comeback in major us cities, science notes. There were only 189 reported cases last year, reports the week, but even a low failure rate could devastate a large high school, according to a vaccination expert.

When it comes to the measles vaccine, two shots are better than one. Most people in the united states are initially vaccinated against the virus shortly after their first birthday and return for a booster shot as a toddler. Less than 1 % of people who get both shots will contract the potentially lethal skin and respiratory infection.

A 16-month investigation by espn finds that the university knew about the incident but neither investigated it nor informed law enforcement of it — despite the fact that title ix requires schools to investigate any alleged sexual violence, even after the alleged victim's death. And that's not all: while in counseling for depression after the alleged rape, menu courey was told to stop participating in swim team practices and competitions ( she was also suffering from a back injury, and the head coach says he had no idea about the alleged rape ). She felt she had been dropped from the team and feared she was in danger of losing her scholarship. She attempted suicide, and while hospitalized her athletic department academic adviser had her sign a university withdrawal form, though menu courey had made it clear she wanted to continue her studies. The head swimming coach says the withdrawal was only pushed because she was in danger of failing her courses, but one of her professors says she could still have passed the two classes she was taking with him. Less than a month before she took her life, she was told her withdrawal made her ineligible for financial aid.

His troops, however, have been shelling rebel positions in the border region the last few weeks. It's worth noting that turkey demanded a similar nato meeting after syria downed a turkish jet in june, but nothing much came of it.
