( also: no acting cameo from musical guest hozier. ) but even the dull nights have great moments, and we've got the three best here for you. \" the group-hopper \" this season is now three-for-three on perfect digital shorts. The group-hopper could've gone south if it was just a parody of the almost-month-old the maze runner, but instead it's a trailer for the hottest new young-adult dystopian franchise from \" the director of maze runner, the producer of divergent, and a casual fan of the giver. \" oh, and the source material? \" a y-a novel written entirely in the comments section of a hunger games trailer. \" if a send-up of cinema's biggest non-superhero trend isn't enough, you've got bill hader as a warpainted knockoff of the hunger games ' effie trinket … with a pair of giant horns. Fortunately for the kiddies, it's all rated g, \" for asexual kissing. \" sidebar \" hollywood game night \" friends don't let friends end their weekends without pointing them to an unexpected snl guest spot from kristen wiig. While wiig popped up a few times throughout the night — beginning in hader's so-so monologue — this was her shiny moment. Wiig was kathie lee gifford, right next to her skeleton twins costar bill hader, doing a grumbly al pacino. Then you had, in order of awesomeness: taran killam as christoph waltz, jay pharoah as morgan freeman, cecily strong as sofia vergara, kate mckinnon as jane lynch, and beck bennett as nick offerman. It might be snl's millionth skit about dimwitted celebrities failing at a gameshow, but a gigantic impression-fest always has its merits. Weekend update one word: stefon. Michael che and colin jost have been on a roll in their first few episodes manning update, but stefon always has been and always will be a show-stealer.

Out of necessity, he had to change his playing technique to make things easier, and that involved tuning his guitar lower.

The venezuelan-born ilich ramirez sanchez is already serving two life sentences in france for murders and attacks he was convicted of perpetrating or organizing in the 1970s and ' 80s. Sanchez, who belonged to the popular front for the liberation of palestine, was once the most wanted fugitive in the world before his arrest in sudan in 1994, notes the bbc. As the trial wrapped up tuesday, the 67-year-old known worldwide as \" carlos \" denounced \" an absurd trial \" for a 42-year-old crime. Carlos had denied involvement, saying there was no proof against him. Five judges found carlos, the only defendant, guilty of throwing a grenade onto a shopping area, killing two and injuring 32. When the trial began earlier this month, he had said, \" in all the fighting, there were collateral victims — it's unfortunate. \"",

Richland county sheriff leon lott has contacted the fbi and the justice department about the case, and a us attorney tells the state that there will be a \" thorough and thoughtful investigation \" of whether the girl's civil rights were violated by deputy ben fields. Lott says that while he \" wanted to throw up \" after first seeing video of the spring valley high school arrest, it's only a \" snapshot \" of what happened in the classroom, where the officer had been called in after the girl, who had been using her phone, refused to leave, nbc news reports. The sheriff adds that he doesn't think race was a factor because fields, who is white, has been dating a black woman for \" quite some time. \" fields has been suspended without pay during an internal investigation, and lott tells cnn that \" there's no justification for some of his actions, \" although he says one video of the incident shows the girl attacking the officer before he takes her to the ground. He says the girl wasn't injured, though she \" may have a rug burn or something like that. \" she was arrested on a charge of \" disturbing schools, \" as was classmate niya kenny, who filmed the incident and allegedly cursed at the officer. Kenny tells nbc that fields, who's also the defensive coach of spring valley's football team, is nicknamed \" officer slam \" for his readiness to use force. She says that as soon as he walked into the classroom, she \" felt something bad was going to go down \" and started filming.",

        "summary": "Female softball players, you might want to stop reading now. Researchers say that girls are indeed inherently worse at throwing than boys, reports the washington post. The gap in ability starts at a young age and gets progressively bigger. Some say it's all about nurture, because boys are usually encouraged to throw early and often. But a texas professor tested that theory by looking at the throwing velocity of australian aboriginal girls growing up in a culture where both men and women did the hunting, and thus the throwing. The aboriginal boys were still better. Much has to do with rotation of the hips, says the professor, which is a crucial part of the throwing process that many girls don't do, or do poorly. He argues that as humans evolved, male hunters needed to throw well to get the meat ( and the girl ). Women may have had to do their throwing while holding a baby, limiting their range of motion. Harvard's women's softball coach, jenny allard, agrees that girls often throw like girls ( her words ), and says overhand throwing techniques are the most under-taught skill in her sport. But with practice, she argues, girls can overcome the gap. Read tamar haspel's full piece here.",

He's learned to read braille and do math using an abacus. But when his mother and teacher took him to washington, dc, to test out a high-tech gadget called esight, the boy was able to see for the first time.

The gadget's hands-free headset resembles large black goggles and houses a tiny, high-speed camera that films whatever is in the user's line of vision. The footage is live-streamed to a computer, where special software manipulates and enhances pixels that are ultimately displayed on the headset's led screens. Esight says it all happens so fast there isn't even an image lag, and suddenly people like chris, who has never seen the blackboard, have midrange and long-range vision.

For people in states that use natural gas, nuclear power, or hydroelectric power to fire up the electric grid, the answer is yes — because powering up the car battery doesn't send greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. For coal-burning states, the news is not so good. In fact, electric car drivers across a wide swath of middle states will send more global warming emissions into the air than someone who has a top gasoline-engine subcompact. Put another way, only about 45 % of americans live in states where an electric vehicle will \" out-green \" a gas-driven car with 50 mpg combined city-highway driving. ( see a full state-by-state map here. ) despite the bad news, authors of the new report are pressuring car-makers to \" deliver viable alternatives to the oil-fueled internal-combustion engine — ie, vehicles boasting zero or near-zero emissions. \"",

        "summary": "The fbi once had a mole so deep within al-qaeda that he met with osama bin laden and provided the intelligence necessary to thwart his planned attack on a masonic lodge in la, new investigative reports from the washington times and nbc news have revealed. The informant started out as a driver for the \" blind sheikh, \" omar abdel-rahman, in los angeles in the early ' 90s. The driver was deported in 1993, first to jordan, which threw him in jail, and then to yemen. There, fbi agent bassem youssef approached him — initially as a friend — and offered to help reunite him with his family in california. He was eventually converted into an informant, and provided information from a meeting in sudan with bin laden. Nbc describes the mole as \" the sole human asset providing first-person information about al-qaeda in the mid-1990s as the terror group gained strength. \" the informant's existence was revealed in 2010, after youssef sued the fbi for discrimination. But the revelation came in testimony \" to an essentially empty courtroom, \" and so went unnoticed, according to the washington times, which first reported the story. Nbc then discovered the informant's fate: the cia secretly poached him from the fbi in 1994 and sent him on a mission to bosnia. The fbi thought he'd simply disappeared, but when youssef started digging, al-qaeda sources told him that bosnian jihadis became suspicious and killed the informant. The revelation might prove explosive, because the informant's existence was never revealed to the 9/11 commission or congressional intelligence committees.",

The paper, published in the french-language religious journal religieuses, argues that teresa was \" anything but a saint, \" and even found beauty in watching people suffer, the times of india reports. Doctors who visited some of teresa's \" homes for the dying \" reported terrible conditions, saying they were bereft of hygiene and exhibited a paucity of food, painkillers, and actual medical treatment, the study alleges. Those conditions weren't for lack of resources, because teresa's order of the missionaries of charity raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Teresa got her own care from a modern american hospital. The paper argues that the vatican deliberately crafted teresa's saintly image and rushed her beatification — she's credited with a miraculous healing that doctors say was a result of simple medicine. The authors add that teresa undoubtedly inspired countless humanitarian workers to help the underprivileged; they just wish the media coverage about her was \" a little more rigorous. \" but while the study is sure to be controversial, the week points out that the late christopher hitchens had lodged similar complaints, and keith wagstaff writes that it probably won't do serious damage to her legacy.

With much fanfare, construction of the world's most powerful telescope kicked off on friday in northern chile, reuters reports. When the $ 1.1 billion instrument goes online in 2024, proponents say it will revolutionize knowledge of the universe, enabling astronomers to study planets and stars in our own solar system and nearby galaxies in \" unprecedented \" detail, reports phys.org. Five times larger than any contender in use today, with a mirror measuring 43 yards across, the appropriately named extremely large telescope ( elt ) \" will produce discoveries that we simply cannot imagine, \" says tim de zeeuw, director general of the european southern observatory. He spoke at a ceremony at eso headquarters in the atacama desert near the 10,000-feet peak of cerro armazones, where the elt will rise. The desert's dry climate, said to be the best on earth for skygazing, has been luring astronomers for years. Among its selling points, the elt will be the first telescope that can adjust for atmospheric turbulence, per phys.org. It will also be able to snap 4,000 highly sharp images simultaneously in varying colors. From those pictures, scientists hope to gain clues into how space objects formed and evolved. They hope to pinpoint smaller planets and study the workings of larger ones, such as their atmospheres. Chilean president michelle bachelet called the project, per reuters, \" one of the greatest examples of the possibilities of science. \" ( hubble data suggests there are 2 trillion galaxies out there. )",

Known as messier 89, this galaxy appears to be perfectly spherical; this is unusual for elliptical galaxies, which tend to be elongated ellipsoids. The apparently spherical nature of messier 89 could, however, be a trick of perspective, and be caused by its orientation relative to the earth. Messier 89 is slightly smaller than the milky way, but ha... S a few interesting features that stretch far out into the surrounding space. One structure of gas and dust extends up to 150 000 light-years out from the galaxy's centre, which is known to house a supermassive black hole. Jets of heated particles reach out to 100 000 light-years from the galaxy, suggesting that messier 89 may have once been far more active — perhaps an active quasar or radio galaxy — than it is now. It is also surrounded by an extensive system of shells and plumes, which may have been caused by past mergers with smaller galaxies — and implies that messier 89 as we know it may have formed in the relatively recent past...

Another doctor told the couple that roi decided she couldn't treat their baby because they are lesbians. \"under current michigan law, a doctor has an absolute right to refuse medical treatment on the basis of sexual orientation, \" said wwj legal analyst charlie langton. The situation happened last october, but the contreras decided to go public with their story to raise awareness about discrimination against same-sex parents. \"we want people to know that this is happening to families. This is really happening, \" 30-year-old jami contreras told the detroit free press. The 49-year-old doctor has since written the couple a letter of apology, saying that after \"much prayer \" following their initial prenatal meeting, she didn't believe that she could develop a personal patient doctor relationship with them. \"i never meant to hurt either of you, \" she wrote. \"please know that i believe that god gives us free choice and i would never judge anyone based on what they do"

Officials in franklin county, where republican troy balderson and democrat danny o ' connor are competing for a house seat, say they found 588 previously uncounted votes from suburban columbus precincts, the cincinnati enquirer reports. The votes gave o ' connor a net gain of 190 votes, leaving balderson fewer than 1,600 votes ahead in a district that trump carried by 11 points in 2016. With more than 8,000 provisional and absentee ballots still to be counted, o ' connor hasn't conceded and is continuing to campaign ahead of the november rematch, wcmh reports. It's a similar story in kansas, where incumbent republican gov. Jeff colyer is fewer than 200 votes behind conservative secretary of state kris kobach in the gop primary. \" given the historically close margin of the current tabulation, the presence of thousands of as yet uncounted provisional ballots, and the extraordinary problems with the count, particularly in johnson county, this election remains too close to call, \" says colyer, whose rival was endorsed by trump. He says he won't start campaigning for the general election until the results are final, though kobach has already begun campaigning against democrat laura kelly, ksnw reports. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted wednesday that as long as he supports candidates, \" within reason, \" they will win. He predicted a \" giant red wave \" in november.",

For this study, researchers report in the journal of the american college of cardiology that light drinkers ( fewer than three drinks a week ) and moderate drinkers ( up to 14 drinks a week for men and up to seven for women ) were 20 % less likely to die from any cause than those who abstain from alcohol, and 25 % to 30 % less likely to die from heart disease. Those benefits disappear for heavy drinkers ( more than 14 weekly for men and seven for women ), where one's risk of death climbs — especially from cancer. The los angeles times notes that people ages 18 to 39 didn't enjoy lower death rates from moderate alcohol consumption, while adults 60 and older enjoyed the benefits more than those ages 40 to 59.

Tucker carlson's daily caller yesterday released what it termed a \" racially charged \" video of a speech then-sen. Barack obama gave to an audience of black ministers. In it, obama gives a \" special shout out \" to the infamous jeremiah wright, calling him a \" great leader. \" he also scolds the government for its handling of hurricane katrina. But many pundits are panning the would-be \" october surprise, \" saying the footage is old and not terribly explosive. Here's what people are saying: the drudge report has been showcasing the video on its front page, and matt drudge gleefully tweeted that the speech \" undermines obama's carefully crafted image. \" fox news is likewise having a field day. Gawker has a cringe-worthy video of sean hannity attempting to do an impression of obama's cadence, which he calls \" al gore preacher mode. \" but buzzfeed notes that the video has been online since 2007, and has been reported on before — by carlson himself. The atlantic wire was less than impressed, writing that most people agree the government failed katrina victims, and that \" everybody got over \" the whole jeremiah wright thing years ago. Howard kurtz agrees. \" an analysis of why some blacks are angry and frustrated is not the same as racial rabble-rousing, \" he writes in the daily beast. Not to be outdone, rachel maddow is swinging back, likening the video to an \" uncirculated \" video from huffpo of a 2011 paul ryan speech that echos romney's notorious 47 % comments: \" 70 % of americans want the american dream.

        "summary": "The phrase \" presumptive nominee \" is starting to emerge as a descriptor for donald trump, which has all kinds of story lines percolating: it's time to begin pondering names for a trump vp candidate, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Cillizza's early short list includes nikki haley, rick scott, carly fiorina, and, yes, sarah palin. A blogger at the daily beast makes the case that delegate math points clearly to trump as the inevitable winner. But a stats pioneer at sabermetrics says otherwise: \" i don't think that trump can win, frankly, because i don't think there are enough morons to elect him. \" maybe the only way to stop trump now is a rubio-cruz ticket, suggests jonah goldberg at real clear politics. The upshot blog uses game theory to explain why john kasich is hanging around. Formally, it might be called the \" anti-coordination game, \" but it really boils down to a game of chicken. Academic noam chomsky attributes the rise of trump to a \" breakdown of society \" and \" fear. \" his interview is at alternet. One key factor to keep in mind about super tuesday: none of the 11 states in play are winner-take-all, meaning rubio and cruz will be able to collect delegates if they fail to win outright. The wall street journal has a more detailed look.",

Christopher cornell, arrested by the fbi in january in ohio, apparently said that and more when he called reporter tricia macke from a jail in boone county, ky. \" i ' m very dedicated to establish the sharia in america, to wage war on the kafr ( an islamic term for ' unbeliever ' ) and raise the word of allah above all, \" said the 20-year-old. \" the planned attack against the united states capitol, the event in which i planned, was but a reaction to the continued american aggression, injustice, and oppression against our people. \" he also said he was ready to shoot president obama and members of congress. According to court papers, cornell told a confidential fbi source last year that he had communicated with people overseas but didn't think they would authorize him to perpetrate a us strike. Then, it seems, he and the informant conspired to do it anyway. Over a few meetings, the pair discussed their plan to set off home-made pipe bombs at the us capitol, then shoot people trying to run away, federal authorities say. Now he's been charged with three felonies, his parents have turned their back on him, and experts say he sounds a lot like a terrorist. It's a particular headache for cornell's lawyer, who couldn't convince a judge to stop fox19 now from airing the phone call: now it ' ll be hard \" to find jurors who haven't heard it, \" a public defender tells the cincinnati enquirer.",

I know i ' m going to jail for life, \" california teen obdulia sanchez said in livestreamed video of the dui crash that killed her little sister last year. \" i don't f ------ care at all. \" the 18-year-old was sentenced thursday not to life, but to six years and four months for vehicular manslaughter, dui, and child endangerment, the merced sun-star reports. Prosecutor thomas min had sought a 12-year sentence for the stockton teen, noting that she was not only under the influence of alcohol in the july 2017 crash that killed 14-year-old jacqueline sanchez and injured her 15-year-old friend, her blood tested positive for cocaine and marijuana, reports abc30. Min said sanchez displayed \" callousness \" in the instagram video recorded before, during, and after the crash. In court, sanchez said she was sorry and she wished she could take her sister's place. \" when i look at my mom's face, i know she hates me, \" she said. \" i would hate myself, too. I ' m such a disappointment to my parents. \" her parents and attorney, however, asked for her to be sentenced only to probation so they could be with her and get her the help she needs. \" lula did something wrong, and she knows and she accepts everything, \" father nicandro sanchez said. Her attorney said the teen had an extremely troubled life and was sexually abused at 11 before being abducted and trafficked. She ended up in a group home, which she left months before the crash. ( \" everybody does it, \" sanchez said of filming while driving. )",

In a new study from the annals of tourism research titled \" autonomous vehicles and the future of urban tourism, \" researchers note that self-driving cars could ultimately become rolling hotel rooms rentable by the hour. Autonomous vehicles are expected to eventually replace traditional taxis; cab companies, no longer having to pay drivers, could instead invest in roomy interiors — perhaps roomy enough to include bedding or even, researchers suggest, massage chairs. ( volvo has already introduced the concept of a self-driving car with a sleeping pod. ) \" it is just a small leap to imagine amsterdam's red light district ' on the move, ' \" they write. Customers could summon the rolling \" rooms \" via as-yet-undeveloped mobile apps, researchers suggest. \" it's only a natural conclusion that sex in autonomous vehicles will become a phenomenon, \" one of the study authors, a tourism professor, tells the washington post. If the cars are used for prostitution, of course, there will be legal ramifications as the practice is barred most everywhere in the us; the study also notes driverless taxis could be used for other illegal activities including drug use or drug dealing. And there are also less-illicit ramifications to the rise of autonomous vehicles: the study notes restaurants and hotels will have to compete with self-driving taxis that users can dine and sleep in, per a press release. Travelers may even opt to take driverless vehicles long distances rather than flying, the telegraph reports. ( why one self-driving car is \" eerie. \" )",

Ukraine's president, petro poroshenko, has asked the country's parliament to introduce martial law in response to what he calls \" an act of aggression against our state and a very serious threat, \" the ap reports. He added: \" unfortunately, there are no'red lines ' for the russian federation. \" there are fears, however, that poroshenko will use martial law to delay march elections that he had been expected to lose, reports the new york times. Ukraine says six of its seamen were wounded when russians fired on the three vessels near the kerch strait, which connects the black sea to the sea of azov, where ukraine has several ports. Russia resisted western calls monday to free the three ships and their crews, reports reuters. Russian authorities said they were opening a criminal case on what they called an illegal intrusion into their territorial waters. Dmitry peskov, a spokesman for vladimir putin, said the move to introduce martial law \" clearly smacks of electoral intrigues. \" in the western ukraine city of lviv, meanwhile, dozens of far-right protesters burned tires outside the russian consulate, the guardian reports.",

After the war, miller became \" indiana's own, well, indiana jones, \" the star notes. A former coworker adds more color, saying miller told him he was one time interrogated by libyan military units who suspected him of being a cia operative. \" he was remarkably consistent with his stories, \" says the man, \" and all the details i ever checked were accurate. \" as of yesterday, miller's ornate home and astounding collection — which visitors say includes a shrunken human head, civil war memorabilia, and a 60-foot anaconda snakeskin, per the ap — remained surrounded by squad cars, tractor trailers, and atvs. The fbi is remaining tight-lipped on how the probe began or whether it thinks miller knowingly committed any crimes, but an agent did divulge that miller had been in contact with the fbi for months, despite the fact that he, apparently, doesn't own a phone.

People who had toured donald miller's rush county home years before the fbi's arrival wednesday described it as a homemade museum containing diverse items including fossils, civil war memorabilia and what the owner claimed to be a chunk of concrete from the bunker in which adolf hitler committed suicide toward the end of world war ii. \"",

Some have seen the spectacles that pack the home, from the life-size chinese terra-cotta figurine on the front porch to the seemingly authentic egyptian sarcophagus in the basement. And then there are the tales about the man himself. That he, as a young army enlistee during world war ii, was called in on secret operations with high-ranking government officials. That he helped build the atomic bomb. But none of the stories friends and former colleagues shared with the indianapolis star on thursday came close to explaining the latest mystery surrounding 91-year-old don miller, brought on by a throng of fbi agents that surrounded his house tuesday. Why did they begin removing thousands of artifacts from miller's home despite not charging him with a crime or placing him under arrest? and why, two days later, were they still there? archive: rush county home is full of collectibles from years of missionary work around the globe \" it's odd. The whole situation is odd, \" said elizabeth dykes, an acquaintance"

Duchesnay, maker of the morning-sickness pill diclegis, has received a formal warning from the regulator over facebook and instagram posts in which the reality star praised the drug, nbc news reports. The fda says the \" false and misleading \" posts fail to \" communicate any risk information, \" including the fact that side effects can include dizziness and sleeplessness and that it's not recommended for women suffering from prolonged vomiting, reports usa today. Kardashian is pregnant with her second child and says her morning sickness was \" pretty bad \" before using the drug. The reason the fda got involved is because she wasn't \" just a happy celebrity sharing her health tips with her 464,000 closest friends, \" as david kroll at forbes puts it, but had been paid by duchesnay to promote the drug. The offending posts have been deleted and the fda says \" corrective messaging should be distributed using the same media, \" which means kardashian's millions of followers may soon be hearing about the side effects of diclegis, nbc notes.

Fittingly, the new york times notes, it was exactly a dozen years after their first date. Other couples across the state also started marrying the very minute they could, as gay marriage became legal in new york today. In new york city, 823 couples will get marriage licenses today, and many are expected to marry in city clerk's offices. Others are planning fancy catered affairs; brooklyn will open its borough hall for an entire series of weddings. Officials in other cities and towns will also open today to issue licenses, with more than 100 judges volunteering to officiate. But the times notes that at least two town clerks have resigned over the new law, and the national organization for marriage is planning at least four protests today.

One of the most high-profile prisoners released today is activist zarganar, who was sentenced to 35 years in 2008 after criticizing the government's slow response to cyclone nargis and organizing aid deliveries to victims. Others released included top members of ethnic minority political parties as well as student activist aung kyaw soe, who had served 21 years. It's the clearest move yet from the country's new government toward liberalization, but the ap notes that burma likely must release a significant number of political prisoners if it wants economic and political sanctions from the west lifted.",

Instead, they performed a sleeve gastrectomy to remove up to 80 percent of her stomach. He said it wasn't a medical complication, but a clinical decision to alter plans. Doctors knew her liver was large, but couldn't tell how difficult it would be to manipulate it until they got into surgery. \" it's not disappointing at all, \" inge told reporters. \" our goal is do to a safe operation under circumstances that are not always 100 percent predictable. \" alexis ' parents, jenny and ian shapiro, agreed. \" yes, unexpected. But it's ok, \" jenny shapiro told nbc news in an email"

Per the cbc and bbc, steve ecklund, host of the wilderness show the edge, had legally taken down the cougar in northern alberta in early december, but it wasn't the fact that he'd simply gone on a hunt that earned him the backlash he's now receiving — it was the photos he put up afterward. In at least two facebook posts ( one apparently since deleted ), ecklund put up a bunch of photos, including one showing him holding up the bloodied dead cougar, along with the caption: \" what an unreal ending to a fun filled season. \" there was also a picture of him making a cougar stir-fry. All of which spurred ire online, including from laureen harper, the wife of ex-pm stephen harper. \" i come from a family that hunts and fishes, \" she tweeted wednesday. \" learned to use every part of an animal.

Today, marseilles prosecutor brice robin indicated that was indeed the case, saying it appears that co-pilot andreas lubitz, who was at the controls, intended to \" destroy this plane. \" lubitz began the descent manually and \" intentionally, \" reports the ap, and was conscious until impact. The guardian reports that the revelations came by way of the cockpit voice recorder's last 30 minutes. The initial 20 minutes capture normal conversation, says robin; at that point, the pilot leaves to make a \" natural call. \" in what robin classified as a \" voluntary \" move, the 28-year-old german co-pilot then manually accelerated the descent, having pressed \" the buttons of the flight monitoring system, \" per the bbc. The pilot's entreaties to be let in go unanswered, and the co-pilot's breathing can be heard; he doesn't utter a single word. Though the plane had a keypad that could be used to gain entry outside the cockpit door, the new york times reports by way of an airbus video that someone in the cockpit can move a \" toggle to a position marked ' locked ' \"; doing so renders the keypad useless for five minutes. As for lubitz, he is \" not known as a terrorist, absolutely not, \" says robin, who did not categorize the move as a suicide, though \" it is a legitimate question to ask. \" nbc news reports lubitz signed on with the airline in september 2013 after completing his training; he had flown for 630 hours.",

Authorities today released the murder indictment against angelika graswald, days after the body of 46-year-old vincent viafore was pulled from the river, reports the poughkeepsie journal. The orange county district attorney accuses the 35-year-old graswald of pulling a plug from the kayak to make it less buoyant and making sure viafore wasn't able to save himself from the choppy waters after it flipped, all in a bid to get $ 250,000 in life insurance. Her attorney says the plug was missing for a while and had little effect on the boat, reports the new york times. He also notes that his client is a native of latvia and chalks up what the police call suspicious statements made by her to a language barrier. And as for her pushing viafore's paddle away from him as he struggled? \" says who? \" he asks, as per ap. \" this is some new contortion and mischaracterization of some oral statement she's made.

The official line from the club is one of outrage, at what they deem an \" extraordinary \" judgement. The fa will provide full written justification for its ruling in due course, but liverpool are clearly under the impression suarez has been punished on the basis of evra's testimony alone. It is this element of the case that has promoted the notion amongst suarez sympathizers that the fa has conducted a \" witch hunt \" for the uruguayan. \" we find it extraordinary that luis can be found guilty on the word of patrice evra alone when no-one else on the field of play - including evra's own manchester united teammates and all the match officials - heard the alleged conversation between the two players in a crowded kop goalmouth while a corner kick was about to",

        "summary": "If you're one of the approximately 45 million americans who wear contact lenses, researchers at arizona state university have a request based on their new study: stop flushing them down the sink or toilet. The researchers concluded that disposing of lenses this way — and they estimate that up to 20 % of wearers do so — takes a surprisingly large environmental toll. The study, presented at the national meeting and exposition of the american chemical society, estimates that up to 3.36 billion lenses get flushed per year, and that amounts to about 50,000 pounds of plastic, reports usa today. The problem is that the lenses don't just dissolve when they reach wastewater treatment plants — they break down into potentially dangerous microplastics that wind up in sewage sludge, and that sludge is routinely applied on land for soil conditioning. \" we know that whatever's in sludge can make its way into runoff from heavy rains, back into surface water and that is a conduit to the oceans, \" researcher rolf halden tells the bbc. \" there is the potential of these lenses being taken on quite a journey. \" one remedy is obvious, notes the atlantic. The researchers looked at 11 brands and did not find any directions for proper disposal. Users should skip the sink or toilet and instead put their contacts with their solid trash, though one hope for the future is that manufacturers will get better about recycling old lenses. As of now, the researchers say that only one major manufacturer, bausch + lomb, is seriously pursuing such an initiative. ( this contact lens wearer recently got a bizarre, 28-year-old surprise. )",

Instagram, which was bought by facebook in 2012 for $ 1bn, is part of the facebook \"bug bounty \" program, created in 2011, under which people who spot chinks in facebook's digital armour are given a reward. The program has paid upwards of $ 4.3m to more than 800 people who have spotted bugs in the social network's programming, a spokesperson for instagram said.

The previous record was set by a 13-year-old back in 2013, meaning this latest young hacker is the first person to crack a facebook product that they aren't technically even able to use, given that it's supposed to be restricted to under-13s. While clearly poking around where he shouldn't have been, jani found he could alter code on instagram's servers and force-delete users ' posts. This was confirmed by facebook using a test account and patched in february, the company told forbes. Since it launched five years ago, facebook says the program has had more than 2,400 valid submissions and awarded upwards of $ 4.3 million to over 800 researchers.

Now a doctor who's been diagnosed with a rare and deadly disease, he's founded another organization, the castleman disease collaborative network, where he works with fellow patients to advance understanding of the disease. But he barely made it to this point; after a 2010 flu-like illness that landed him in an icu for six months and got so bad his last rites were read to him, the then-medical student was diagnosed with a subtype of an immune system disorder known as castleman disease, reports cbs news. In spite of multiple relapses, he graduated in 2013 and went on to earn his mba in 2015. \" at the heart of this, i ' m a patient and also an investigator, \" says fajgenbaum. \" we, as patients — well, no one wants to figure out what is going on with diseases as much as the patients do. \" around 7,000 people are diagnosed with castleman disease every year in the us, according to the university of pennsylvania, where fajgenbaum went to med school and is now an assistant professor of medicine. Thanks in large part to his research, it's now understood that the \" multicentric \" subtype involving multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes is triggered by the immune system overreacting, per a post at phys.org. Now fajgenbaum and 14 patients are sequencing their whole genomes to look for which genes are the culprits. Fajgenbaum ultimately hopes to find a drug that \" works for every single patient with castleman disease. \" ( few kids fully recover from this rare disease. )",

Over the weekend, the singer participated in a concert in brussels, which was to mark the start of a comeback following vocal cord problems in 2016. But a tour planned to kick off early next year is now out of the question. Just 24 hours after the aforementioned interview, maurane was found dead monday in her home in the brussels suburb of schaerbeek. She was 57. Authorities are still investigating the cause, but they say the death is \" not considered suspicious, \" reports metro. \" a committed artist left us, \" tweeted belgian prime minister charles michel, calling maurane \" an outstanding singer, an inspiring voice, an endearing personality. \" canadian-belgian singer lara fabian, who dueted with maurane on the 2002 french-language hit \" tu es mon autre, \" also celebrated the \" rare \" artist she said was \" bigger than music. \" the daughter of a pianist and a music academy director, maurane began performing in singing competitions as a teen before nabbing a role in the musical starmania. She went on to release 10 solo albums — including 1991's ami ou ennemi, which went platinum in france — and perform with celine dion. Maurane most recently had a role in the tv talent show nouvelle star. She leaves behind an adult daughter.",

        "summary": "Consumer advocates are accusing the education department of caving to pressure from the student loan industry to the detriment of borrowers after betsy devos rescinded two obama administration memos tuesday, usa today reports. According to nbc news, the memos called for government contracts to be awarded to companies that had proven themselves good at helping borrowers instead of companies that were best at collecting debts. The memos were issued by the obama administration due to a history of student loan companies with government contracts mistreating borrowers, bloomberg reports. Devos says the memos were rescinded because they had a \" lack of consistent objectives, \" and to lessen the burden on taxpayers. One student loan expert says the move shows the government is backing student loan companies over borrowers. \" this move is a big win for companies that have run roughshod over borrowers, \" a former student loan ombudsman for the consumer financial protection bureau tells usa today. For example, with the obama administration memos now revoked, one of the favorites to get an upcoming government contract is a company that was sued by the attorneys general of two states and the cfpb in january for allegedly taking advantage of borrowers to increase profits. Last month, devos rescinded another obama-era memo that prohibited charging student loan borrowers huge fees in most cases.",
