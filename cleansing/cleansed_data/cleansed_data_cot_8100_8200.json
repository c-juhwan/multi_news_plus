She was sent a video of curtis pleading to survive, but the fbi \" said ' we don't think you want to watch this, ' and i said, ' i certainly do not, ' \" she says. \" you don't want to see your child in distress, fearful, looking dirty and disheveled, those are obscene images. \" when the us called on the militants for proof curtis was still alive, his mother wracked her brain to think of a question to which they couldn't fake an answer. \" i was struggling because you don't know all these intimate details about your son's life when he's 45, \" nancy curtis says. Finally she asked about the subject of his phd dissertation — and received the correct answer. The aftermath of foley's death was \" excruciating. \" \" i was getting words of reassurance, but when i didn't hear something, i worried something would go wrong, \" she says. Finally, this weekend, \" i got a call from the fbi agent and she said, 'nancy, your son is standing beside me right now, and he's free.

The brain waves were measured with electroencephalography, and as expected, the healthy subjects ' brains exhibited \" rich and diversely connected networks. \" brain networks are characteristically impaired in comatose patients, but as the researchers write in plos computational biology, they also found that \" some vegetative patients who show signs of hidden awareness have remarkably well-preserved networks similar to healthy adults. \" as livescience explains, when asked to imagine playing tennis, some patients who couldn't otherwise move on command did show activity in the part of the brain tied to movement in a way that was similar to how a healthy person's brain would respond. The researchers describe the portion who did so as a \" significant minority. \" \" if a patient's ' awareness ' networks are intact, then we know that they are likely to be aware of what is going on around them, \" one of the study authors tells cambridge news.

Consciousness is one of the most mysterious phenomena.

The northern lights are nothing new to reykjavik, which is located close to the arctic circle, but they have been particularly vivid this week, as the earth is currently getting walloped by solar wind.

Besides the sheer amount of gas, the discovery is notable because it appears to be the first time that stores of helium have been purposely found ( they're usually stumbled upon during oil and gas drilling ). And the find, which will be presented tuesday by durham university phd student diveena danabalan at a japanese geochemistry conference, could help restock nearly depleted stockpiles. Researchers figure there's about 54 billion cubic feet of helium in just one section of the valley. To put that in context, the federal helium reserve in texas, which supplies more than 40 % of domestic helium needs and contains about 30 % of the world's total helium supply, right now holds about 24.2 billion cubic feet, per live science. \" it could be substantially larger, \" researcher jon gluyas says. \" this is a globally significant discovery. \" the scientists from durham, working with oxford university counterparts, used a new method of gas exploration to track down the rift valley helium, studying volcanic activity in the region, as well as how intense heat from that activity works to release helium trapped in the earth's crust, and then pinpointing which sites would likely prove to be plum drilling sites, much like those looking for oil would do. The problem arises when the helium-storing rocks are too close to the volcanoes — meaning the helium will be mixed in with and diluted by volcanic gases — so now the researchers ' next goal is to find the sweet spot ( or, as danabalan puts it, the \" goldilocks zone \" ) \" where the balance between helium release and volcanic dilution is ' just right.

        "summary": "Heads up football was supposed to be the nfl's salve for parents wary of letting their kids play football. The safety-training program for coaches — which the nfl funds and promotes and the usa football organization manages — has been given a strong push by the nfl, and the league has been citing a 2015 study claiming the program lowered the overall injury rate by 76 % and concussions by 30 %. But the new york times took a closer look at the study, carried out by the datalys center for sports injury research and prevention, and found the research indicates something else: namely, \" no demonstrable effect on concussions \" and \" significantly less effect \" on all injuries than what the nfl and usa football have been touting. Both groups say they erroneously shared preliminary data, which turned out to be much rosier than the final results published five months later. \"we're the ones that put out the numbers, \" says the president of datalys. \" we're the ones that kind of blew it. \" a post at deadspin, however, is skeptical that the nfl didn't know it was pushing iffy data, and louis bien writes at sbnation that \" bad science is a pattern for the nfl. \" laura wagner writes at slate that \" blaming this all on a couple of bumbling researchers isn't going to fly \" and that it seems the final results were \" swept under the rug \" — she notes that both the nfl and usa football still have older promotional info with the inaccurate data on their sites, despite promising to yank it down after the times report. In a statement on its site, usa football says it will no longer cite studies until they've undergone peer review. ( how concussions ruined a young athlete's brain. )",

About 90 % to 95 % of diabetics are classified as type 2, according to medical news today. But: \"diabetes is not the grey mass we have been calling type 2, \" researcher leif groop tells the guardian. \" there are really subsets of the disease that require different treatment. \" groop's team studied 14,775 diabetics and determined diabetes should actually be broken into five \" genetically distinct \" clusters. They are: cluster 1: severe autoimmune diabetes. Essentially the same as type 1. Cluster 2: severe insulin-deficient diabetes. As in cluster 1, strikes young and healthy people, but the immune system isn't at fault. Cluster 3: severe insulin-resistant diabetes. Bodies of largely overweight people no longer respond to insulin being produced. Cluster 4: mild obesity-related diabetes. Patients are very overweight but have metabolisms closer to normal than patients in cluster 3. Cluster 5: mild age-related diabetes. Mild form of diabetes developed by older people. The most common cluster. Each cluster has different risks associated with it, and patients could respond better to different treatments, researchers say. \" i think it will mean a more individualized therapy [ and ] a better quality of life, \" groop says.

        "summary": "Nothing like taking a break on a long trip — for, say, 10,000 years. That's how long the first human settlers stayed in beringia — the region that once bridged siberia and alaska — before inhabiting north america about 15,000 years ago, according to a new scientific paper by university of utah researchers. Until now, scientists thought the vast tract of land was a treeless tundra unable to support much human life, but new drilling samples sourced from the bering sea and alaskan bogs show insect and plant fossils, along with pollen, which suggest that shrubs, trees, and even animals may have lived there, national geographic reports. \" it was an area where people could have had resources, lived, and persisted through the last glacial maximum in beringia, \" says co-author dennis o ' rourke, unews reports. The stopover theory also explains why native american dna differs from that of asian ancestors: settlers had time to develop their own genetic blueprint in isolation. No evidence of human settlement has yet been found in beringia, but o ' rourke attributes that to melting glaciers that submerged the lowland areas where he suspects the land favorable to habitation would have been located. Still, he admits, his theory remains just that until archaeological evidence is discovered — which he thinks might be possible in \" low-lying portions \" of alaska and russia's eastern chukotka. ( in related news, an infant's dna speaks to the origins of the first americans. )",

            "Sediment cores from alaska and the bering sea support genetic evidence that the first human settlers of the new world spent thousands of years inhabiting beringia, the region that included the land bridge between siberia and alaska, scientists say. The bering land bridge measured as much as 1,000 miles ( 1,609 kilometers ) from north to south and as much as 3,000 miles ( 4,828 kilometers ) from west to east. Scientists once thought this vast tract consisted mostly of tundra steppe, a treeless environment incapable of supporting a large human population. But in recent years paleoecologists — scientists who study ancient environments — have been drilling sediment cores in the bering sea and in bogs in alaska. The samples have yielded plant and insect fossils, as well as pollen, indicating that beringia's tundra steppe was dotted with oases of brushy shrubs and even trees such as spruce, birch, willow, and alder. These woody refuges could have provided fuel for fires, raw material for shelters, and cover for animals such as hares, birds, elk, and moose — game that humans could have hunted for food, said",

            "Air fuel synthesis in stockton-on-tees has produced five litres of petrol since august when it switched on a small refinery that manufactures gasoline from carbon dioxide and water vapour. The company hopes that within two years it will build a larger, commercial-scale plant capable of producing a ton of petrol a day. It also plans to produce green aviation fuel to make airline travel more carbon-neutral. Tim fox, head of energy and the environment at the institution of mechanical engineers in london, said: \" it sounds too good to be true, but it is true. They are doing it and i've been up there myself and seen it. The innovation is that they have made it happen as a process. It's a small pilot plant capturing air and extracting co2 from it based on well known principles. It uses well-known and well-established components but what is exciting is that they have put the whole thing together and shown that it can work. \" although the process is still in the early developmental stages and needs to take electricity from the national grid to work, the company believes it will eventually be possible to use power from renewable sources such as wind farms or tidal barrages. \" we've taken carbon dioxide from air and hydrogen from water and turned these elements into petrol, \" said peter harrison, the",

        "summary": "Police have arrested a white 48-year-old male after 11 people were killed and six injured saturday during a baby-naming ceremony at a pittsburgh synagogue, the ap and cbs pittsburgh report. Identified as robert bowers, 46, the alleged shooter is said to have entered the tree of life synagogue in squirrel hill and yelled \" all jews must die. \" the shooting occurred in a third-floor classroom where saturday's class had been canceled, a former tree of life president tells the pittsburgh post-gazette. A man attending weekly shabbat services says he heard repeating fire like that of an automatic weapon. Bowers reportedly shot at arriving police, who used their vehicles as shields amid the gunfire; four officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Bowers, described as heavy-set and bearded, was also wounded. A social media profile under the name robert bowers is full of anti-semitic posts including one right before the shooting, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. \" i can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered, \" the post reads. \" screw your optics, i ' m going in. \" all three congregations at the conservative synagogue — tree of life, dor hadash, and new light — were having services when the shooting erupted. President trump said saturday that \" it's a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world, \" but said the shooting had \" little \" relation to gun laws: \" if they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. \" a victims ' center with grief counselors has been set up for survivors. The fbi is leading the investigation, which will be prosecuted as a hate crime, a pittsburgh official tells cnn.",

But he tells the national post there was no chance he was going to turn it down. \"if you deny that, it means the inheritance has to go to a different tribe or family and we will lose that for the rest of your life, \" manu says. \"if i deny that, i am denying my ancestors — that's something you worked for and inherited for years and years. \" thanks to watson, manu won't be showing up empty-handed.

After the switch, george takei tweeted, \" oh, a thousand times, yes. If there is a god, please let this happen, \" per abc news. One petition to have o'donnell appear as bannon on snl has more than 5,000 signatures. Slate has come up with a list of 12 actresses who could play trump's inner circle on snl if so asked; see its photo gallery here.",

        "summary": "Vladimir putin promised the 2014 olympics will celebrate the values of \" openness and friendship \" as he struggled to light the olympic flame today, but documents obtained by the guardian suggest that's all just hot air. Russian investigative journalists have found that the country's fsb security service has set up infrastructure to monitor all phone and internet communication in the host city of sochi, using russia's surveillance system, sorm. Sorm has been undergoing across-the-board updates since 2010, but there has been a particular focus on making it robust enough to cope with the extra olympic traffic, the guardian reports. A professor at the university of toronto who has researched the sorm updates describes it as \" prism on steroids. \" by law, all phone and isp providers must now install sorm boxes, which the fsb can monitor without their knowledge. Russia's telco has also installed \" deep packet inspection \" technology on its mobile networks, allowing the fsb to filter traffic via keywords. It's probably no coincidence that the chief of security for the games is one of the fsb's top counterintelligence chiefs, notes the guardian, indicating the country is more interested in stopping spies than terrorists. The fsb will also monitor the event with 40,000 cops, 5,000 surveillance cameras, drones, and two sonar systems, the guardian reports in a separate story.",

Park, 19, early wednesday on suspicion of making a terror threat on yik yak and other social media the night before, the columbia daily tribune reports. An mupd release says park is not a student at the columbia campus, but the tribune notes that a hunter michael park is listed in the online directory for the missouri university of science &amp; technology, which is part of the mu system. Although the police aren't releasing many details, screenshots from twitter posted by the riverfront times show the yik yak posts, with one noting, \" some of you are alright. Don't go to campus tomorrow. \" another was much darker: \" i ' m going to stand my ground tomorrow and shoot every black person i see. \" the threats — which led to increased security and the evacuation of the school's culture center tuesday night, per the tribune — were especially troubling partly due to the medium. As explained by the washington post, the yik yak messaging app is an anonymous, location-based network — which means that while users near a certain school's network \" don't have to be a student to post, or to read the messages … they do have to be geographically close, \" per the times. But a university alert posted online wednesday notes the suspect \" was not located on or near the mu campus at the time of the threat. \" mizzou cops say they contacted park in rolla ( about 90 miles away from the columbia campus ) and brought him to columbia, where he was arrested, the times notes. He's now being held in the boone county jail on a $ 4,500 bond, per the tribune. \" i ' m afraid for my peers, \" one student tells the paper. \" this shouldn't be happening — it's 2015. \"",

The early consensus is that obama got aggressive and did much better than in the first go-round, though romney didn't retreat much from his aggressive attacks — on the economy in particular. Full transcript here, and some highlights: obama jabs early: \"romney doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan, and that's to make sure the guys at the top play by a different set of rules. \" romney says the \" middle class has been crushed over the last four years. \" testy: romney at one point scolds the president — \" you ' ll get your chance in a moment, i ' m still speaking, \" and print reporters say there was an \" audible gasp \" in the room. Economy: \" romney's recollection of the last four years under obama is a strong moment for him, as he describes — more in sorrow than in anger — how bad the economy has been. Economic growth is too slow, he said, and food stamp usage is too high.'the president wants to do well... But the policies he's put in place... Have not led this economy take off and grow as it could have. ' \" laura meckler, sara murray, wall street journal ' binders full of women ': the viral phrase of the night, issued by romney when describing how he was pushing to hire women for his cabinet as governor. \" i went to a number of women's groups and said, ' can you help us find folks? ' and they brought us whole binders full of women. \" and a twitter meme is born. Globalpost libya: \" the suggestion that anybody on my team... Would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own is offensive, governor, \" says obama. He adds that he declared the benghazi assault an \" act of terror \" in the rose garden the day after it occurred, an assertion romney challenged. Moderator candy crowley, however, confirmed that obama used the phrase. A common theme: \" obama supporters wanted an aggressive obama, and an aggressive obama is what they got. Twenty minutes into the debate and there has been forceful rebuttals and vigorous interrupting on both sides. Obama has accused mitt romney of saying something untrue at least three times. \" nia-malika henderson, washington post the two sparred on their approaches to the auto industry, with obama \" quickly becoming aggressive the way his supporters said he did not during the last debate.",

The exxonmobil ceo spent years as a director of exxon neftegas, exxon's russian subsidiary based in the bahamas for tax purposes, according to corporate documents leaked to sueddeutsche zeitung. Tillerson was a director from at least 2001 until 2006, according to the guardian, which notes that while there's nothing particularly shady about the position, it's certain to add to questions about tillerson's ties to russia during his secretary of state confirmation hearings. He has publicly called for the lifting of sanctions against moscow. It was already known that tillerson served as president of the subsidiary, but analysts say the directorship of the firm, one of at least 67 exxon-related entities based in the bahamas, raises questions about the range of his financial holdings. \" if he's a director of corporate entities outside the us, including in jurisdictions that are more secretive, it could make it more difficult to ensure that he did divest fully, \" an oil and gas sector expert at the natural resource governance institute tells the center for public integrity. \" it shows that there's going to have to be a lot of scrutiny on that divestment process. \" tillerson holds at least $ 228 million in exxon stock, and his decisions in government will affect their value.

        "summary": "That incredibly accurate atomic clock we heard about last year just upped its game. The jila timepiece, created in a joint venture between the national institute of standards and technology and the university of colorado boulder, received upgrades that now have it ( in theory, at least ) faithfully ticking away for a very, very long time — it reportedly won't lose or gain a second for 15 billion years, the washington post notes. In a study published in nature communications, the scientists behind the moving parts explain that they were able to significantly increase the clock's accuracy — it boasted a mere 200 million years of accuracy just six years ago — by better controlling the temperature of the strontium atoms used inside, among other factors. The newspaper spells out the process: an optical lattice is formed by \" intense \" lasers, trapping thousands of strontium atoms in a column, where they're prodded back and forth between two energy levels by a red laser ( hence creating pendulum-like \" ticks \" ). To make those ticks even more consistent and stable, scientists took into account how heat from the clock's surroundings affect the atoms and then cooled it down. Of course, a 2010 relativity study showed time goes by more slowly the closer someone is located to the earth, so the post boggles our already fragile minds with \" the question of whether the whole earth can really have one standard, super-accurate clock that speaks for us all \" and asks, \" should we tell time by our highest points or our lowest? \" ( the quantum superclock may one day put the atomic clock out of business. )",

The stretching out of time predicted by einstein's theories of relativity is known to occur on cosmic scales, such as near a black hole or with a speeding galaxy. But now researchers have measured the effects of relativity on a smaller scale. Physicists used extremely accurate atomic clocks to calculate how time flows more slowly the closer someone is to earth. The researchers found that even a height difference of around 1 foot ( 33 centimeters ) causes a measurable change in the passing of time. For example, if one twin spent 79 years living at an altitude 1 foot higher than her sister, the first twin would end up approximately 90 billionths of a second",

John pinnegar, director for marine climate change at the center for environment, fisheries, and aquaculture science, told the british ecological society's annual meeting on monday. \" in 2025 and beyond, we may need to replace cod and other old favorites with warm-water species such as squid, mackerel, sardine, and red mullet. \" pinnegar tells the bbc that species like cod, which were already in long-term decline in british waters due to overfishing, are now shifting their ranges northward, while fishing boats are now catching species usually associated with spanish or portuguese waters. Pinnegar says most squid caught in british waters are currently exported — but that may change if squid and chips catches on. The washington post notes that on social media, reactions among the british ranged from \" never \" to \" bring on the calamari. \" ( earlier this year, a study found that squid, octopuses, and cuttlefish are thriving amid changing ocean conditions, while finned fish are in decline. )",

Scientists in brazil, writing in the journal plos one, say the araguaia dolphin, named after the river where it was found, is a distinct species that formed around 2 million years ago when rapids cut it off from the rest of the amazon river basin, reports the bbc. It is very similar to the amazon river dolphin, but dna samples proved it was a different species, slightly smaller and with fewer teeth. It becomes the fifth known river dolphin species in the world ( though one is thought to be extinct ); the last was identified in 1918. \" it was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked, \" the lead researcher says. \" it is very exciting. \" but he warns that there are only around 1,000 of the creatures in existence and its \" future is pretty bleak, \" new scientist reports. Dams have fragmented its habitat, which has already been degraded by farming and ranching operations, and fishermen have been know to kill it as a pest.

Robert blake of corrales, new mexico was reported missing on friday after he failed to return from an afternoon of cross country skiing near the delores county line, said san miguel county sheriff bill masters. A bell 407 classic lifeguard helicopter contracted from moab, utah joined the search saturday. Blake was found dead at 11: 39 a.m. Saturday by a ground search team near lizard head pass, masters said. At about the same time, the helicopter experienced a sudden loss of power at 10,000 feet -- but a low altitude above the ground -- on the dolores county side of lizard head pass. The helicopter crashed with three classic lifeguard crew members and a deputy with the san miguel sheriff's office on board, according to masters. All four crewmembers on board the helicopter when it went down were uninjured and were able to walk away from the crash. Federal authorities will be investigating the cause of the helicopter crash. Blake appeared to have died from natural causes on friday, and there was no sign of foul play. Blake's golden retriever \"buddy \" was found at his side in a \" protective state \" -- still guarding his body from scavengers and coyotes that had been seen in the area the night before, masters said.

( illegal ones are, for obvious reasons, far harder to track. ) it turns out that, at least in washington, the average recreational weed consumer is a 37-year-old man, though millennials are the largest consumer group, reports bloomberg. And while users in their 40s spend the highest amount per year on weed at a median of $ 823, the average user across all ages spends $ 647. That amounts to $ 54 a month or $ 1.77 a day — less than the $ 1,000 headset says americans spend on their coffee habits a year and about as much as it says the average household devotes to alcohol, reports marketwatch. Women lag men as legal marijuana consumers, at least in washington, where 68.9 % of buyers are men compared to 31.1 % who are women, reports debra borchardt for forbes. She quips, \" where did all the hippies go? \" noting the over-65 set makes up less than 5 % of buyers. Still, the clientele appears to differ from one region to the next. A dispensary owner in denver, where marijuana has been legal since early 2014, tells marketwatch females make up 45 % of his buyers and are one of his \" faster-growing segments, \" along with seniors.

Researcher sharon dewitte analyzed nearly 600 london skeletons, dated before and after the black death — 464 between 1000 and 1300, and 133 between 1350 and 1538, real clear science and medical news today report — and found a higher proportion lived to middle age or beyond in the years following the plague. \" even in the face of major threats to health, such as repeated plague outbreaks, several generations of people who lived after the black death were healthier in general than people who lived before the epidemic, \" dewitte notes. Why? \" by targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the black death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within europe, \" dewitte writes. Pair that with the fact that depopulation led to lower food prices, better diets, and higher wages, and you ' ll find post-plague london had a better standard of living than before the black death hit.

This was the first outbreak of medieval plague in europe and the ensuing tens of millions of deaths resulted in broad social, demographic and economic changes.

        "summary": "The death of antonin scalia has set the stage for a massive partisan battle during a time that was already unlikely to go down in history as a golden age of bipartisan cooperation in dc. The biggest dispute centers on whether nominating a supreme court successor during an election year should be considered outrageous or routine. Some related highlights: scalia's death may affect six major cases this term on immigration, abortion, contraception, labor unions, voting rights, and affirmative action, and the new york times lays them out. Usa today also has a breakdown. Scotusblog looks at election-year nominations since 1900 and finds there have been several nominations and confirmations — and there's little evidence of any tradition of leaving a seat open during election years. In a sunday interview with abc's this week, ted cruz praised the \" incomparable \" scalia and vowed to filibuster anybody obama nominates to replace him. The tug-of-war for the \" ideological soul \" of the court is going to drastically change the nature of obama's final year in office, the new york times predicts in a look at where the nomination battle lines have been drawn. Politico looks at how scalia's death has split the gop presidential candidates, with senators taking a more hard-line approach than governors. The washington post dives into the \" chaos, confusion, and conflicting reports \" that followed scalia's death at a west texas ranch, noting that the judge who deemed his death a natural one did so over the phone without having seen his body. The new york times looks at the remote ranch that scalia was visiting, calling it a \" rugged oasis \" that has long attracted politicians and celebrities seeking peace and quiet. Anybody who thinks people with opposing political views can't be friends could learn a lot from the supreme court's most liberal and most conservative justices, vox reports in a look at the close friendship between scalia and ruth bader ginsburg.",

        "summary": "The world's longest-distance flier is a fly — a dragonfly to be exact. That's what scientists at rutgers university-newark claim in a new genetic study of pantala flavescens, also known as the wandering glider, per discovery news. Populations of the dragonfly, which is only 1.5 inches long, have been found on every continent except antarctica, but all have similar genetic profiles, reports newsweek. They're actually so similar that researchers say they're likely traveling across huge distances — more than 4,400 miles — and breeding with each other. Monarch butterflies were previously thought to be the longest migrating insects, fluttering 2,500 miles one way across north america. Pantala not only crushes that record, but is in \" competition with whales and birds for being the longest migrators, \" says study author jessica ware. \" if north american pantala only bred with north american pantala, and japanese pantala only bred with japanese pantala, we would expect to see that in genetic results that differed from each other, \" ware adds in a release. \" because we don't see that, it suggests the mixing of genes across vast geographic expanses. \" the dragonflies seem built for the journey with \" increased surface areas on their wings that enable them to use the wind to carry them, \" ware says. \" they stroke, stroke, stroke, and then glide for long periods, expending minimal amounts of energy. \" it is a \" kind of suicide mission, \" but the insects make the trek to escape dry seasons because they need freshwater to lay eggs. In fact, when a dragonfly spots freshwater, it will often lay eggs, wait for them to hatch, then resume its journey with its offspring in tow. ( this tiny songbird also crosses an ocean. )",

It's not clear whether the 10 vehicles got the gas for free, paid the hackers, or were in on the scheme. Police are investigating. Gizmodo reports that the fuel management software used by gas stations has long been considered a target for hackers, because many of the interfaces are web-based and not password-protected, making it easy for someone to hijack them. But it's not clear what remote device the hackers might have used to take control of the pump, or how the hackers were able to keep the attendant from shutting things down.

Cnn reports the patch job took place in 2014, but after a report this week on it by beijing news, it's being pilloried on social media. \" glad venus de milo is not in china, or someone would get her a new arm, \" wrote one user on the network weibo. The restoration of what the new york times describes as a 1.2-mile stretch of the wall in northeastern china went \" very badly, \" admits dong yaohui, deputy director of the great wall of china society. \" although the local government was well intentioned and wanted to restore the bricks of the wall, the result turned out to be the opposite, \" he says. The times reports officials say they didn't use concrete, but rather a lime-sand mix, in the restoration of part of the xiaohekou stretch of the wall; a park officer counters that both were used. Quartz notes the xiaohekou portion had been known as a delightfully \" wild \" and less trafficked part of the wall to visit, but a hotel owner in yong ' anpu village says bookings have tanked, clients have complained, and it's \" slippy \" to walk on. The mishap occurred despite regulations established in 2006 governing the development of tourist sites. It also comes just as conservationists launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $ 1.6 million to protect deteriorated portions of the 13,000-mile-long wall. It could have been worse: china's nationalist government in 1931 considered turning the wall into a highway, notes time. ( china's great flood legend might actually be true. )",

Overwhelming evidence shows this has already begun to happen: it is not the subject of a scientific discussion in an ivory tower. Let there be no doubt: we are not talking about a small number of people on a remote island having to give up their stretch of the beach. We are talking about sea level rises that might seriously impact the lives of millions of people who live close to the coast -- and only a little higher than sea level. Densely populated mega-deltas of the ganges, nile, mekong or mississippi or big coastal cities such as karachi, new york, singapore or tokyo"

Related coverage: \" i refuse to call megyn kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead i will only call her a lightweight reporter! \" yep, that's a trump tweet. Is his decision to skip the debate brilliant or stupid? yes. Vox runs through the arguments on both sides of that coin. The new york times suggests that trump's spokesman is sounding a little less definitive wednesday about the debate boycott. A normal candidate who did this might be seen as un-presidential, but trump, of course, isn't a normal candidate. The ap has an analysis. If you missed trump's full statement on this decision, chris cillizza at the washington post provides an annotated version. Even by trumpian standards, it's \" amazing. \" fox unleashed its own statement about the \" terrorizations \" of trump, and mediaite notes that the network was having fun with some \" first-rate trolling \" of him.

According to wtvg, the boys — between the ages of 13 and 14 — were walking to a store to buy candy last december in toledo when they started throwing rocks off a freeway overpass. Then they dropped a sandbag. The sandbag landed on a passing vehicle, injuring 22-year-old father marquis byrd. Byrd died in the hospital three days later. The boy who dropped the sandbag pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to the department of youth services until he turned 21, the toledo blade reports. The other three boys pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and were sentenced to three years each in the state prison. On friday, those sentences were suspended to time in the lucas county youth treatment center. The average stay at the center is eight months. Judge denise cubbon says she suspended the original sentences \" so these boys change their behavior and can become productive members of our community. \" after the change in sentencing, marcus byrd said the family didn't get justice for his brother. \" suspended what? if you do what? so eight months you get to go home? \" the byrd family's lawyer, lillian diallo, tells wtvg. All four teens apologized to the byrd family in court. \" i pray for him and his family every single day and night and cannot imagine what they are going through and how they feel right now, \" one of the boys said at friday's sentencing.",

This month, the city will start replacing them with free wifi hot spots, the wall street journal reports. Ultimately, more than 7,500 phone booths will be turned into hot spots, with 500 expected to be up by july, as part of the linknyc project. The 9.5-foot-tall wifi hubs, called \" links, \" will have android tablets that can be used to browse the web and make free phone calls, or users can access the free wifi using their own devices. They can also charge those devices via usb port, and there will be a dedicated red 911 button at each link. Of course, there will also be two 55 \" hd displays on each one featuring sidewalk advertising ( and public service announcements ). The free wifi at each link will cover about a 150-foot radius and be able to service hundreds of users simultaneously, per linknyc. As the journal notes, other cities have experimented with free public wifi, but typically speeds are so slow ( or users are required to watch ads before connecting ) that not many people use it. Citybridge, the joint venture running linknyc, says its broadband will be up to 100 times faster than typical free public wifi and about 20 times faster than average home internet service, and users won't have to watch ads. The city says data will be encrypted and any information collected for advertising purposes will be anonymized, the ap reports. Citybridge, which is putting more than $ 200 million into the project, expects to make $ 1 billion over 12 years from advertising and will pay the city $ 500 million or a 50 % revenue share, whichever is more. The first two links are being unveiled in manhattan tuesday and will be available for use within a week or two, gizmodo reports.",
