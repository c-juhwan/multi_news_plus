        "summary": "\" i ' m numb and i ' m shocked. I ' m relieved most of all, \" says the florida woman who secretly recorded jared fogle for the fbi for four years, building up evidence that led to charges that will send the ex-subway pitchman to prison. Per wwsb, rochelle herman-walrond, ided as an ex-journalist by the chicago tribune, says fogle made comments to her about having sex with underage teens not only in the us, but also abroad, including in thailand. \" jared fogle is a monster, \" she says. Herman-walrond, who wwsb says first met fogle in the mid-2000s, says she was covering a 2007 health event at a local school when she first heard fogle say something disturbing, cnn reports. \" he told me that he thought middle school girls were so hot, \" she says. \" i was in shock. … i looked over at my cameraman … and he was just astounded. \" she told anderson cooper last night that fogle's comments were \" off the cuff \" and \" came out of nowhere. \" she says she saw him many times after that and his comments got bolder — so she informed the fbi, which gave her a wire so she could record their talks. \" he trusted me for unknown reasons, \" she told cooper. Among the worst of his statements: that he \" really, really enjoyed \" sex with underage children, as well as something he said about her own kids. \" i had two young children at the time, and he talked to me about installing hidden cameras in their rooms and asked me if i would choose which child i would like him to watch, \" she says. Herman-walrond doesn't think fogle's eventual prison sentence — which will be somewhere between five and 12.5 years — is nearly enough. ( fogle's wife has dumped him, as has his high school. )",

The move is sure to upset democrats after sessions used the same excuse in refusing to answer similar questions in june. According to the new york times, the nine democrats on the committee sent a letter to sessions last week saying he was expected to answer the questions unless president trump formally invoked executive privilege, which he has not. Most of wednesday's hearing was centered on russia, and sessions largely avoided saying \" anything of real substance, \" the washington post reports. For example, sessions refused to say whether or not he had been asked for an interview by special counsel robert mueller, saying he \" will check and let you know. \" the attorney general also had a heated interaction with sen. Al franken, who noted sessions has changed his story from having no contact with the russian government during the campaign to having no improper contact after it was revealed he met with the russian ambassador. While accusing franken of being \" totally unfair to me, \" sessions admitted wednesday it was \" possible \" that \" some comment was made about what trump's positions were \" during his meeting with the ambassador.",

Scientists have long believed sleep promoted memory, but they hadn't known precisely how. \" finding out sleep promotes new connections between neurons is new, nobody knew this before, \" one nyu professor says. \" it really helps to make connections and that in sleep the brain is not quiet, it is replaying what happened during the day. \" the study reinforces yet again how important sleep is, amidst growing fears that society as a whole isn't getting enough of it. Two other recent studies on that score: researchers in utrecht found that many people are simply \" sleep procrastinating, \" delaying their bed times for essentially no reason, the daily beast reports. Researchers believe it's a \" relatively modern phenomenon, \" born of our \" electrical devices and the 24/7 entertainment industry. \" in other words, we're too busy staring at screens to sleep — and as medical daily points out, that artificial light can trick your brain into thinking it's daytime.

        "summary": "A huge sigh of relief in a troubling case came wednesday as authorities found the three missing kids of a murdered woman in a new mexico motel, the los angeles times reports. Kimberly harvill was found slain on the side of a california road on aug. 14, and her three children, all under the age of 6, were nowhere to be found. Last seen with the kids: harvill's half-sister, 22-year-old brittany humphrey, and 27-year-old joshua robertson, who the los angeles county sheriff's department says are \" persons of interest \" in harvill's death and who allegedly snatched the kids either sometime before or after their mom was killed. The children — 2-year-old joslynn watkins, 3-year-old brayden watkins, and 5-year-old rylee watkins — were left with a good samaritan at the motel outside of albuquerque, per a sheriff's official, and that person contacted the police, the santa clarita valley signal reports. Robertson and humphrey are thought to be armed and dangerous ( robertson has a criminal past, including an arrest for possessing a firearm ) and heading east, and authorities say they're traveling with a baby. Per kabc, robertson is described as humphrey's husband on her facebook page, though sources have also referred to him as her boyfriend. The two are thought to be on the run in harvill's 1999 ford expedition, possibly still bearing its california license plates with the number 7bek024. Because it's believed the dad of harvill's children's is dead — her neighbor tells kabc their father took his own life — they ' ll be brought back to california and turned over to the department of children and family services. Hannah anderson, a friend of harvill's, tells kfsn that harvill was a \" great mom \" and \" loved her kids more than life. \"",

Which maybe would have been treated as a simple accident, save for the fact that martinez appeared to be drunk, investigators say. Two bac tests administered to martinez at the scene turned up readings of.143 and.144, authorities say, and martinez was charged with driving under the influence and booked at a local jail. He was released on $ 500 bail monday morning. There's no word on how the deputy who was inside the vehicle is doing.

Snowden had top-secret clearance to help run the national security agency's computer systems but he was a contractor, hired by the giant us defence contractor booz allen hamilton. The company issued a statement describing the disclosures as \" shocking \" and pledging to co-operate with any investigation. It said: \" news reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm.

The network says ahmad khan rahami — a naturalized us citizen born in afghanistan — was captured after a shootout with police, and ap reports the same. Images on tv showed a man believed to be rahami on a stretcher with an apparent arm wound. Nbc news reports that rahami's fingerprints were found on a device that failed to detonate and that other evidence from cell phones wired to unexploded bombs link him to the attacks. \" he certainly seemed to do virtually nothing to cover his tracks, \" says one law enforcement official. The arrest came after police raided an apartment in elizabeth, nj, located above a fried-chicken restaurant run by rahami's father, reports the new york daily news. Cnn also reports that one officer was shot in the hand during the raid; another was shot in his bullet-proof vest. One big question that remains unanswered: authorities say they don't know whether the bombings are the work of one person or a group.",

For years, advocates have been calling for the creation of a national park in the vicinity of manhattan's stonewall inn, where a 1969 police raid sparked a protest by gay men, now considered the start of the modern gay rights movement. On monday, interior secretary sally jewell will hear from supporters during a listening session, after which president obama is expected to approve the move, officials tell the ap. Though the land would still need to be transferred to the federal government, it could be designated part of the national park service \" as soon as next month, which commemorates gay pride, \" reports the washington post. Since the protest in 1969, many have returned to the stonewall inn and the two-tenths of an acre of greenery it faces, known as christopher park, to celebrate victories for gay rights. Some 13,000 people have signed a petition in the hope of making the area a national park site. \" we must ensure that we never forget the legacy of stonewall, the history of discrimination against the lgbt community, or the impassioned individuals who have fought to overcome it, \" says rep. Jerrold nadler, who's co-authored legislation to create the national park if president obama decides against it, reports the new york times.

Reuters/bryan woolston/file photo the regulator said it was aware of 36 deaths associated with kratom, which can have similar effects to narcotics like opioids. Kratom, a natural plant grown in parts of asia, is available in the united states as a dietary supplement and the fda has said kratom products have been crossing into the u.s. In increasing amounts. \"at a time when we have hit a critical point in the opioid epidemic, the increasing use of kratom as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use is extremely concerning, \" fda commissioner scott gottlieb said. In 2012 and 2014 the fda placed import alerts on kratom, allowing fda agents to detain the products at the border. U.s. Marshals have since seized thousands of pounds of raw kratom and dietary supplements. In august 2016, the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) announced it would temporarily reclassify kratom as a schedule 1 drug, a class that includes heroin and marijuana. Schedule 1 drugs are"

        "summary": "The nation's christians are experiencing a steep slide in numbers, according to a new pew research center poll. The survey of 35,000 adults finds the number of those who identify as christian slid from 78.4 % in 2007 to 70.6 % in 2014, the new york times reports. Almost every major christian denomination saw a decline, and no age group, race, or region was immune. The trend \" is big, it's broad, and it's everywhere, \" report editor alan cooperman tells usa today. \" the decline is taking place in every region of the country, including the bible belt, \" he adds, per the times. While some of the slide is attributed to non-christian millennials supplanting the elderly, many once-christians have shifted to the unaffiliated category of atheists, agnostics, and those of \" no particular religion, \" which has grown from 16 % of adults to 23 %. That means the 56 million \" nones \" are now the second-largest faith group behind evangelicals, who make up about a quarter of the religious market. Catholics make up about 21 % of the population, though roman catholics and mainline protestants saw the greatest declines, each falling by more than 3 %. Evangelical protestants actually grew in number but fell by 1 % as a share of the overall population. About 19 % of adults are now ex-christians and 13 % are former catholics, the report finds. \" overall, there are more than four former christians for every convert to christianity, \" cooperman says. Affiliations with non-christian faiths, including judaism, islam, and hinduism, rose slightly from about 5 % in 2007 to 6 % in 2014. Experts say the survey will have political consequences and may be greatest felt by conservatives and republicans, who typically rely on white christian voters, the times reports.",

        "summary": "New jersey sen. Robert menendez has been fending off allegations of corruption for two years now, but things are about to get much worse. Cnn reports that the feds will bring criminal corruption charges against the prominent democrat in a matter of weeks, and the wall street journal confirms. Outgoing attorney general eric holder has reportedly signed off on the move by the justice department. Menendez is accused of doing political favors for a wealthy eye doctor named salomon melgen. Among other things, the investigation has focused on whether menendez improperly used his political clout to help melgen fight accusations that he overbilled medicare. Menendez also took repeated flights to the dominican republic as melgen's guest, and in 2013, he acknowledged that his failure to disclose them was an \" oversight, \" notes cnn. He reimbursed melgen $ 58,000 for the trips. It was on one of those visits to the dr that the most sensational angle of the scandal emerged — allegations of a menendez tryst with underage prostitutes, paid for by melgen. The senator denies it and says the story was manufactured by his enemies in cuba. ( the women who made the accusations eventually recanted, but the fbi continued investigating, notes the new york times. ) menendez is the top-ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, though he's not exactly a white house darling. He's been a critic of negotiations with iran and renewed ties with havana.",

The company, which employed 1,800 people in 2015, rents more than 250,000 square feet across nearly two dozen buildings in the downtown area, per privco, which provides data on privately held companies. That's roughly 12 % of the commercial space available downtown, which has some worried that palantir is crowding out other nascent startups, and others fretting about the potential for skyrocketing rents. The concerns aren't imagined ones, per figures cited by the mercury news: availability is at a seven-year low, and the cost of commercial space downtown is up to $ 102 per square foot; five years ago, it was $ 71. A january report from cnbc on the issue also noticed that these leases there are becoming \" super long, \" as venture investor jeff clavier puts it, and prohibitively so for many start-ups at 10- to 15-year terms.

On its facebook page, the el segundo police department noted that at around 4am sunday, officers heard an \" extremely loud air-horn being actuated \" and followed the sound to a 2006 chevy aveo driving around, which they pulled over. Inside: driver john nuggent and air horn equipment, which nuggent admitted to using to stir residents out of sleep. Several locals emerged from their homes and made a citizen's arrest against nuggent — an important fact, the san diego union-tribune notes, with police explaining that officers can't be victims of \" disturbing the peace. \" had the residents not come out, the cops would only have been able to give nuggent a slap on the wrist for a traffic infraction; now the charge gets prosecutable misdemeanor status, with a maximum of 90 days in jail, a $ 400 fine, or both if he's found guilty. Sgt. Vincent martinez tells the times the blare fest was apparently nuggent's way of retaliating against someone in the area with whom he had a beef. \" i've been an officer for over 27 years and i don't know if i've ever seen someone retaliate using an air horn, \" martinez says. \" but people find very creative ways at getting at other people. \" wcmh notes that the car, along with the horn, was impounded.

At first they thought the limestone-encrusted object, which the international business times reports was found near the right arm of the skeleton of the griffin warrior — buried around 1450 bc — was a simple bead. They were way off. More than a year's worth of work to remove the limestone has revealed what davis now says is \" a spectacular find. \" the pylos combat agate is a sealstone, a carved gemstone that can be stamped into clay or wax. Its carving depicts a warrior stabbing another fighter in the neck with a sword while a third fighter lies dying at his feet. Davis and stocker say it's one of the finest works of prehistoric greek art yet discovered and the best glyptic art from the aegean bronze age ever seen. The skill shown in depicting the human form wouldn't be seen again in greece for another 1,000 years. Even more impressive: the pylos combat agate is only 1.4 inches across. Some of the details are \" incomprehensibly small \" and require a magnifying glass to appreciate, and yet no magnifying glasses were known to exist in the area at the time.

        "summary": "A texas republican paid $ 84,000 of taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim against him in 2015, nbc news reports. Lauren greene says rep. Blake farenthold told a staffer he had \" sexual fantasies \" and \" wet dreams \" about her while she was working as his communications director. She says he routinely made comments to her to see if she was interested in having sex with him and says she was fired a month after complaining about the behavior. Greene filed a sexual harassment, discrimination, and hostile work environment claim against farenthold in 2014. According to the washington post, farenthold denies any wrongdoing in the case. Still, sources say farenthold, who politico reports has a minimum net worth of $ 2.4 million, settled the claim using $ 84,000 from the office of compliance. The office of compliance was created nearly 20 years ago after dozens of complaints of sexual harassment against republican sen. Bob packwood. Since then, it has spent more than $ 17 million of taxpayer money to settle workplace complaints involving house lawmakers. It's unclear how much of that money went toward settling sexual harassment complaints. A republican lawmaker said friday that only the single $ 84,000 payment was made to settle a sexual harassment complaint since 2012. In a statement prepared by farenthold and greene in 2015 but not released at the time, they say they settled to save the taxpayers ' money because \" further litigating this case would come at great expense to all involved. On friday, farenthold said he \" can neither confirm nor deny \" that he was involved in the $ 84,000 settlement.",

Researchers at yale university surveyed more than 7,000 teens at eight connecticut high schools and found that among the 1,080 who report vaping with e-cigarettes, 26 % admitted to having tried so-called \" dripping \" for reasons that include \" a stronger throat hit \" or \" made flavors taste better. \" reporting in the journal pediatrics, researchers call for an investigation into the \" toxicity \" of dripping and its effects on youth. A press release suggests the practice could cause increased exposure to chemicals like formaldehyde. The harsher dripping isn't exactly new, and it even has its own metaphor. \" compared to the standard e-cigs you can get, it's like, you can go buy a prius or you can go buy a corvette, \" one vaping blogger tells the new york times. He says manufacturers have taken note, and some are creating devices that have more accessible coils, ostensibly to cater to this crowd. But for the bigger flavor bang, scientists worry that people inhaling the vapors may be exposing themselves to higher concentrations of carcinogens given the liquid is subjected to elevated temperatures than through vaping. The study didn't investigate how often teens who engage in dripping do so. ( among teens, e-cigarettes appear to be a gateway to real cigarettes. )",

            "Yale researchers found in a study that one in four high schoolers who use electronic cigarettes are inhaling vapors produced by dripping e-liquids directly onto heating coils, instead of inhaling from the e-cigarette mouthpiece, possibly increasing exposure to toxins and nicotine. This form of e-cigarette use, known as \" dripping, \" is gaining in popularity among youth, who report it produces thicker clouds of vapor, a stronger hit in the back of the throat when inhaled, and a more pleasurable taste, according to the study, published online feb. 6 in the journal pediatrics. Applying the liquid directly to the battery-powered coil heats it at a higher temperature than inhaling from a cartridge or tank, possibly increasing exposure to harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein in the vapors, according to other existing research. The yale study, the first to look at dripping rates among teens, recommends that more",

A full 1,874 said they had indulged in vaping with e-cigarettes at some point, though researchers counted only 1,080 after winnowing out some surveys with inconsistent answers. Of those, 282 said they had tried dripping. Dr. Suchitra krishnan-sarin, a psychiatry professor at yale and lead author of the study, wasn't surprised about the prevalence of vaping. \"teens are certainly drawn to both the novelty of the product and the availability of different flavors, \" she said. A cbs news report and other summaries of the yale findings may have been be the first that many parents had heard of the practice. But blake brown, 32, who blogs extensively about vaping, said in a phone interview that dripping is nothing new. \"there's a side of vaping that's super simple, and that",

            "Yale researchers found in a study that one in four high schoolers who use electronic cigarettes are inhaling vapors produced by dripping e-liquids directly onto heating coils, instead of inhaling from the e-cigarette mouthpiece, possibly increasing exposure to toxins and nicotine. This form of e-cigarette use, known as \" dripping, \" is gaining in popularity among youth, who report it produces thicker clouds of vapor, a stronger hit in the back of the throat when inhaled, and a more pleasurable taste, according to the study, published online feb. 6 in the journal pediatrics. Applying the liquid directly to the battery-powered coil heats it at a higher temperature than inhaling from a cartridge or tank, possibly increasing exposure to harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein in the vapors, according to other existing research. The yale study, the first to look at dripping rates among teens, recommends that more",
            "The study was based on anonymous surveys of 7,045 high school students in connecticut. A full 1,874 said they had indulged in vaping with e-cigarettes at some point, though researchers counted only 1,080 after winnowing out some surveys with inconsistent answers. Of those, 282 said they had tried dripping. Dr. Suchitra krishnan-sarin, a psychiatry professor at yale and lead author of the study, wasn't surprised about the prevalence of vaping. \"teens are certainly drawn to both the novelty of the product and the availability of different flavors, \" she said. A cbs news report and other summaries of the yale findings may have been be the first that many parents had heard of the practice. But blake brown, 32, who blogs extensively about vaping, said in a phone interview that dripping is nothing new. \"there's a side of vaping that's super simple, and that",

        "summary": "\" black friday is for suckers, \" declares farhad manjoo in slate — but, assuming you still insist on going shopping tomorrow, he has some advice. So do caity weaver in gawker, matthew ong in us news and world report, and herb weisbaum on today: download some of the new black friday apps. Walmart and macy's, for example, now offer mobile apps that feature in-store maps and directories so you can actually locate all the deals. Check out what's available in advance. Sites like bfads.net, blackfriday.com, and blackfriday.gotadeal.com round up the circular ads, or click here for a rundown of what popular stores have planned for the day. See if the stores you're hitting offer price-matching. You can check here, but you also need to make sure the policy doesn't exclude black friday sales. Don't bother camping out. Some retailers have finally figured out that black friday campers deter a lot of less-dedicated shoppers, since they figure they ' ll just miss out on the \" doorbusters. \" walmart, for example, is guaranteeing that anyone who visits a store from 10pm to 11pm tonight will be able to score some of its deals, even if the products are out of stock. Step away from the ipad 2. Apple put out a bunch of new products this year, but also kept older models that are missing a slew of neat features. So the ipad 2, while it may look like a deal, doesn't have the new ipad's high-resolution display. You'd be better off, and save more money, buying an ipad mini. ( for more of what not to buy, click here. ) bring along a good attitude. \" just kidding, \" writes weaver. \" that's for suckers. Do not bring that. A murderous attitude will do. \" ( click for her entire hilarious guide. ) of course, you could just stay home and get your shopping done in sane, mob-free conditions. Last year, 70 % of walmart and target deals were available online for the same — or less. But what fun is that?",

The complaint claims cvs, walmart, and walgreens, as well as the top three drug distributors, \" flooded \" communities in the state ( home to 14 cherokee counties ) with opioids, leading to hundreds of native american deaths. Per the suit, the firms ignored the opioid epidemic in the region and kept pumping painkillers out, with cherokee ag todd hembree noting they turned a \" blind eye \" to federal safeguards \" because their profits are much more important to them. \" what makes the cherokee complaint unique isn't that it's the first against major drugmakers. A city in washington state sued the maker of oxycontin for endangering its residents, for example, and cardinal health and amerisourcebergen — two of the distributors named in the cherokee suit, along with mckesson — settled a pain pill suit with west virginia last year. Npr notes this case is different in that it's the first of its kind filed in tribal court, which could help expedite access to corporate records if the case doesn't get moved to federal court.

In a lengthy facebook post, daniel majesky, who is 37 and one year older than his wife of three years, leah, even manages to inject a bit of humor — and not just when describing the misguided presence of wicker furniture in a room meant for masturbating fathers-to-be. To wit, when talking about the hormones leah had to take: \" my job was to try and not say anything dumb, because she also needed to be calm. I tried to avoid triggering phrases like ' hey, ' or ' good morning, ' or ' i love you, ' but i kept f --- ing up, and opening my mouth, or allowing leah to see tv programs, or commercials, to read books, and interact with the world in any way. \" majesky, who describes himself on twitter as a \" nominal reverend, \" also writes about the crushing loss he felt when they were informed just weeks into their first pregnancy that there was no heartbeat: \" i've felt time stop before.... I have not felt the vertigo of infinity like when we were told our baby was dead.... I don't think it was until around the new year that i went a day without crying about it. \" majesky tells abc news that people in his position feel \" isolated \" and \" alone, \" but that \" it's hurting people to hold it in. \" the couple is now expecting a daughter in november, and majesky says he ' ll be holding his breath for 26ish weeks. As for why he wrote the 3,336-word pregnancy announcement that he did, majesky tells today \" that [ miscarried ] baby left a permanent mark on us, and it didn't seem fair that it would get hidden away. \" ( scientists find a cause of repeat miscarriages. )",

Also out from amazon today: 8-inch ( $ 150 ) and 10-inch ( $ 230 ) fire hd tablets, as well as an updated kid's tablet ( $ 100 ) and new versions of fire tv ( $ 100; $ 130 for the gaming model ). Built into all the new tablets is amazon's os 5 ( aka \" bellini ), which the company's senior manager of fire tablets calls amazon's \" biggest redesign ever, \" per pc world. The new os includes the word runner reading program, designed to help consumers speed-read by showing words one at a time in the center of the screen ( it sounds odd, but here's a neat video demo ). What makes the company's tablet push somewhat unexpected is that it hasn't exactly been a leader in that market: per idc data cited by fortune, amazon didn't even break into the top five of worldwide tablet vendors in the second quarter of 2015, and sales of the ipad put out by competitor apple have declined as of late. But with the new os'splashy interface and instant-download features for amazon prime members, amazon hopes to not only steal some of apple's thunder, but also lure more consumers to its online store, the ap notes. Those hoping to beat the black friday crowd for the adult-sized tablets can pre-order starting today and expect shipments to start sept. 30, per usa today.

        "summary": "Across the us, elections are being closely watched to see if clues can be gleaned as to how the 2018 midterms will go and wisconsin gave democrats another notch tuesday. Rebecca dallet, a liberal milwaukee county judge, was elected over conservative judge michael screnock of sauk county to the state's supreme court, in what the new york times deems a \" matter of intense interest \" as the midterms approach in wisconsin, which donald trump carried in 2016 in the first gop presidential victory in decades. Fortune notes another important aspect of dallet's win, which came with a 56 % majority: the state's supreme court goes from a 5-2 conservative majority to a 4-3 one, and six of the seven justices are now women. The party lines were explicitly drawn in this race, though judgeship races are meant to be nonpartisan: dallet had strong democratic support, including from former ag eric holder and ex-vp joe biden, while screnock had endorsements from wisconsin's gop and the nra. Although one strategist tells the times that spring elections are very \" different animals \" than the midterms, such a win can still serve as a motivator for both sides. Critical seats are up for grabs in november in wisconsin, including that of rep. Paul ryan ( although vox says seizing his spot would be a \" reach \" ), dem sen. Tammy baldwin, and the governorship, currently held by the gop's scott walker. Walker, for one, seems like he might be worried. \" tonight's results show we are at risk of a #bluewave in wi, \" he tweeted tuesday. \" the far left is driven by anger &amp; hatred — we must counter it with optimism &amp; organization. \"",

Researchers asked the question \" does large body size make elephants the shortest mammalian sleepers? \" and sought to answer it in the wild, in a departure from most previous related research, which involved elephants in captivity. After tracking two wild african elephant matriarchs in botswana's chobe national park for 35 days, they found the creatures averaged just two hours of sleep daily, \" the shortest... Of any mammal recorded to date. \" the study, published wednesday in plos one, describes elephants as \" polyphasic \" sleepers, meaning they sleep multiple times a day, though most of their sleep occurred between 2am and 6am. As for the quality of that sleep, oof: elephants slept in a recumbent position only every three or four days, with the other sleep occurring in a standing position. That \" potentially limit[ s ] their ability to enter rem sleep on a daily basis, \" per the researchers. And on five occasions, the elephants were tracked as being awake for as many as 46 consecutive hours and \" exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. \" the amount of sleep they got had no correlation with their amount of daily activity; they were tracked traveling as many as 19 miles in 10 hours, \" possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching. \" mashable notes that previous studies have pegged the sleep time for elephants in captivity at 3 to 7 hours, and lead author paul manger says the quest for food is probably the differentiator. \" as we build up more information, the ideas for conservation will become stronger and guided by real data — and not just people's gut feelings, \" he says.",

We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02: 00 and 06: 00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter rem sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences",

If confirmed, that would be the shortest-known sleep time of any land mammal. These herbivores can also regularly go nearly two days without sleeping at all, according to the paper published wednesday in the journal plos one.

Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter rem sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences",
            "When you weigh more than 10,000 pounds, you need a lot of food just to survive. All those hours spent searching for grasses, roots and fruits means there's little time left over for sleep. How little? try two hours a day for african elephants in the wild, a new study found. If confirmed, that would be the shortest-known sleep time of any land mammal. These herbivores can also regularly go nearly two days without sleeping at all, according to the paper published wednesday in the journal plos one. Researchers followed two free-roaming female elephants inside botswana's chobe national park. They outfitted each matriarch with an \" actiwatch \" — like a fitbit for elephant trunks — and a collar with a gyroscope to monitor the elephants'sleep times and sleeping positions.

In its first eight years, it raised around $ 100 million in charitable contributions, almost all of it through a direct marketing campaign. The organization, headed by jack l. Nimitz, boasted of 41 state chapters and some 66,000 members. This would be a great story of charitable success, except for the fact that virtually everything about the association turned out to be false: no state chapters, no members, no leader with the name redolent of naval history. Instead, there was one guy: a man calling himself bobby thompson who worked from a duplex across the street from the cuesta-rey cigar factory in the ybor city neighborhood of tampa. But the money raised was real enough, generated by a series of for-profit telemarketers. The victims, by and large, were unsuspecting small-money donors who received urgent solicitations asking for support for needy naval veterans. Most of the money raised stayed with the fund-raisers, though plenty apparently dripped through to mr. Thompson and a succession of republican lawmakers who received generous contributions from the association's political arm. But little ever made it to the intended beneficiaries. In 2010, the scheme was unwound by two reporters for what is now the tampa bay times, but not before mr. Thompson had fled the state of florida. From june 2010, mr. Thompson was on the run, the search for him hamstrung by the fact that no one had any real idea of who he was. Finally, on april 30, 2012, federal marshals tracked him down in portland, ore., finding him with a card to a storage unit containing $ 981,650 in cash and almost two dozen fake identity cards. Earlier this month in ohio, where the charity's registration documents had been filed, the man arrested as bobby thompson was convicted on 23 felony counts, including fraud, theft and money laundering. Authorities have identified him as john donald cody, a former army intelligence officer and harvard law graduate.

        "summary": "Since he started campaigning for his job, canadian pm justin trudeau has promised that marijuana legalization was high on his to-do list. Now his liberal government is apparently about to make good on that vow: per the cbc, pot will be legalized throughout the entire country by july 1, 2018, with legislation on the issue to be unveiled on april 10. ( the toronto star cites another report that says the pot holiday 4/20 may be the target date, though the globe and mail notes the house of commons will be on break during 4/20 week. ) while quality control over the cannabis will fall to the federal government for safety reasons, and licensing will come out of ottawa, each canadian province will wield control over cost, distribution, and where pot can be sold. The nationwide age to legally buy marijuana will be set at 18, though provinces will be able to up that minimum. The legislation follows recommendations in a 106-page report by a federal task force. This may slow the roll of trudeau's political opponents — specifically the new democrats — who've recently tried to nail the prime minister for breaking his campaign promise, which some have insinuated was made just to get votes. This premise has been helped along by the fact that trudeau has remained firm on \" [ enforcing ] the law \" as it stands now, including hitting illegal pot dispensaries with criminal charges, the star has reported. Although the latest news may boost trudeau's credibility, a senior federal official tells the globe that crafting the legislation is \" big and complicated, \" with \" lots of moving parts, \" and there have been rumblings that pot that's legal for recreational users may not happen until 2019 due to the complexities.

        "summary": "The end of the pentagon's ban on transgender troops serving openly could be just days away. It has been almost a year since defense secretary ash carter ordered a review to determine whether lifting the ban would affect military readiness, and sources tell usa today that the pentagon will announce repeal on july 1 after consulting with military chiefs on the final details. The sources say branches of the military will be given a year to bring in new policies on issues like recruitment and housing for transgender troops. The new york times reported last month that the pentagon's review found that allowing transgender troops, estimated to number around 2,450 out of 1.2 million service members, would neither affect military readiness nor cost more than a few million dollars a year. Usa today's sources say there have been internal disagreements over some issues, including how long troops would have to serve before becoming eligible for gender transition treatment. Air force staff sgt. Logan ireland, who is transgender, tells the washington post that transgender service members just want to serve under the same rules as everybody else. \" we don't want any gray areas, \" he says. \" just afford us the same opportunities as the genders as which we wish to be seen. \" the post's sources say \" nothing has been set in stone \" on a date for repeal, but it is expected to happen before the end of july.",

            "Voters in two major california cities overwhelmingly approved cuts to retirement benefits for city workers in what supporters said was a mandate that may lead to similar ballot initiatives in other states and cities that are struggling with mounting pension obligations. Supporters had a simple message to voters in san diego and san jose: pensions for city workers are unaffordable and more generous than many private companies offer, forcing libraries to slash hours and potholes to go unfilled. \" the public is frustrated, \" said san diego councilman carl demaio, a republican who staked his mayoral bid on the pension measure and advanced to a november runoff in tuesday's election to lead the nation's eighth-largest city. In san diego, 66 percent voted in favor of proposition b, while 34 percent were opposed. Nearly 97 percent of precincts were tallied by early wednesday.

Scott walker — who has become an enemy of labor unions nationwide — two california cities dealt blows of their own to organized labor. In san diego and san jose, voters overwhelmingly approved ballot initiatives designed to help balance ailing municipal budgets by cutting retirement benefits for city workers. Around 70 percent of san jose voters favored the pension measure, while 66 percent of san diego residents supported a similar measure. \" this is really important to our taxpayers, \" mayor chuck reed of san jose, said tuesday night. \" we ' ll get control over these skyrocketing retirement costs and be able to provide the services they are paying for. \" statewide, voters also remained very closely divided on a $ 1-per-pack tax on cigarettes, which would be the first increase in the cigarette tax here in 14 years. Proceeds from the tax would not go to state coffers, but would instead finance cancer research. The tax remained too close to call on wednesday morning, according to the associated press, although opponents of the measure appeared to cling to a razor-thin lead with all precincts reporting. Antismoking advocates, who promoted the tax as the best way to reduce smoking rates, were outspent nearly four to one. Their opponents, financed largely by the tobacco industry"

        "summary": "Botanists were sure that the wentworth elm had gone extinct as part of a mass die-off of elm trees in the uk in the 1970s. Soaring 100 feet in the air in the garden of none other than queen elizabeth was proof to the contrary. Two botanists say they've identified two \" weeping \" trees standing in the queen's garden at the palace of holyroodhouse in scotland as wentworth elms, thought to have been eradicated by dutch elm disease some 20 years ago. The trees, apparently missed by scientists, are actually some of the most photographed trees at the palace, reports the bbc. However, max coleman of the royal botanic garden edinburgh explains wentworth elms were so rare before they were thought to be extinct that few knew how to point them out. \" such a discovery when the trees in question are just shy of 100 feet and in plain sight does sound rather odd, \" coleman says in a release, per gizmodo. But \" if you pull your tree book off the shelf to try and look them up, you won't find wentworth elm listed in the books. \" the queen's wentworth elms might have come from the rbge; records show it received three from germany in 1902, but only one was mentioned in later records. It died in 1996. No matter their source, coleman credits edinburgh for keeping the trees alive. After millions of elms were killed, the city council began removing diseased elms to protect those remaining, coleman says. \" without that work many more of the thousands of elms in edinburgh would have been lost. \" ( this is europe's oldest tree. )",

But while walmart was hit with a $ 7,000 fine for its role in his death, it has yet to pay up, reports huffington post. The reason likely has nothing to do with the amount of the fine, which is the maximum amount the occupational safety and health administration can fine a company for serious violations. The retail giant reported net sales of $ 473 billion last year, and has spent $ 2 million litigating this case already, reports the consumerist. For walmart, there could be considerable ramifications if the fine is upheld. ( the case is currently on appeal with osha, which handles workplace safety fines, and is listed as \" pending review \" — where it's sat for more than three years. ) because osha found walmart at fault using the general duty clause, which rather vaguely puts the onus on employers to make their workplaces \" free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to [ their ] employees, \" upholding the fine essentially means that employers will become responsible for crowd control.

            "Washington -- this coming black friday will mark six years since a worker died beneath a throng of shoppers at a walmart on long island. Although federal regulators faulted the retail giant in the tragedy, walmart still hasn't been compelled to pay the modest $ 7,000 fine that was levied against it. The case, department of labor v. Walmart stores, has not moved forward since huffpost reported on it a year ago -- on appeal with a federal review commission that handles workplace safety fines. As of this writing, the commission lists the status of the case as \"pending review. \" the case was first referred to the commission three and a half years ago. A spokeswoman for the commission said it does not comment on the timeline for pending cases. It's common for employers to appeal whatever penalties the labor department's safety inspectors issue against them, including when workers are killed on the job. But the case of 34-year-old jdimytai damour, who had worked at walmart for only a week when he was asphyxiated beneath the black friday crowd, underscores just how long those appeals can drag on, even in cases where the fines are comparably small. Brooke buchanan, a walmart spokeswoman, said the retailer has made significant changes in recent years to minimize the frenzy among shoppers and make for a safer atmosphere, including",
            "In 2008, a walmart employee was killed when a mob of deal-desperate black friday shoppers tore the store's doors from their hinges and stormed inside, trampling him to death. The chain was eventually fined $ 7000 for their role in the employee's death — but six years and $ 2 million later, the world's largest retailer has yet to pay up. The fine was the result of an investigation by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ), which found that walmart did indeed put employees at risk by failing to put \"reasonable and effective \" crowd management in place. When the fine — the maximum possible — was levied in may of 2009, walmart had 15 days either to pay or to appeal. The chain, which brought in over $ 475 billion in revenue last year, chose to appeal the $ 7000 fine. A year later, in 2010, they'd spent more than $ 2 million on the appeal. Their argument went to the occupational safety and health review commission — an independent group set up to rule on challenges to osha penalties — back in 2011. And it's been sitting there ever since. The appeals process can take years, as the huffington post explained today. And it's clearly not about the money but is, for walmart,"

            "Washington -- this coming black friday will mark six years since a worker died beneath a throng of shoppers at a walmart on long island. Although federal regulators faulted the retail giant in the tragedy, walmart still hasn't been compelled to pay the modest $ 7,000 fine that was levied against it. The case, department of labor v. Walmart stores, has not moved forward since huffpost reported on it a year ago -- on appeal with a federal review commission that handles workplace safety fines. As of this writing, the commission lists the status of the case as \"pending review. \" the case was first referred to the commission three and a half years ago. A spokeswoman for the commission said it does not comment on the timeline for pending cases. It's common for employers to appeal whatever penalties the labor department's safety inspectors issue against them, including when workers are killed on the job. But the case of 34-year-old jdimytai damour, who had worked at walmart for only a week when he was asphyxiated beneath the black friday crowd, underscores just how long those appeals can drag on, even in cases where the fines are comparably small. Brooke buchanan, a walmart spokeswoman, said the retailer has made significant changes in recent years to minimize the frenzy among shoppers and make for a safer atmosphere, including",
            "In 2008, a walmart employee was killed when a mob of deal-desperate black friday shoppers tore the store's doors from their hinges and stormed inside, trampling him to death. The chain was eventually fined $ 7000 for their role in the employee's death — but six years and $ 2 million later, the world's largest retailer has yet to pay up. The fine was the result of an investigation by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ), which found that walmart did indeed put employees at risk by failing to put \"reasonable and effective \" crowd management in place. When the fine — the maximum possible — was levied in may of 2009, walmart had 15 days either to pay or to appeal. The chain, which brought in over $ 475 billion in revenue last year, chose to appeal the $ 7000 fine. A year later, in 2010, they'd spent more than $ 2 million on the appeal. Their argument went to the occupational safety and health review commission — an independent group set up to rule on challenges to osha penalties — back in 2011. And it's been sitting there ever since. The appeals process can take years, as the huffington post explained today. And it's clearly not about the money but is, for walmart,"

Giuliani said trump could theoretically pardon himself in any situation, and he used an extreme hypothetical in an interview with huffpost, suggesting that the president could not be indicted even if he shot james comey. In all his interviews, however, giuliani stressed that he was sure trump would never pardon himself, because the move could lead to impeachment. \"it's not going to happen. It's a hypothetical point, \" he said on nbc. And to huffpost: \"if he shot james comey, he'd be impeached the next day, \" giuliani said. \"impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him. \" his comments come in the wake of a new york times report that trump's legal team ( before giuliani came aboard ) wrote a memo arguing that the president could not have obstructed justice because the president is in charge of federal investigations. \" the president is not saying he is going to pardon himself, \" house majority leader kevin mccarthy told cnn, per the hill. Trump ally chris christie agreed. \" listen, there's no way that ' ll happen, and the reason it won't is because then it becomes a political problem, \" said the former new jersey governor on abc. \"if the president were to pardon himself, he ' ll get impeached. \" the washington post, meanwhile, talks to a fordham law professor who disagrees that a president could pardon himself, in part because the constitution stipulates that the president \" shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. \"",

        "summary": "President obama has disappointed a slew of environmental activists by giving shell the green light yesterday to drill deeper in the arctic for oil, quartz reports. The approval issued by the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement expands the oil company's current permissions, allowing it to drill even further down into the chukchi sea after proper safety gear was installed, the hill reports. But the decision is being decried by already active critics as the president's trip to alaska to talk about climate change looms later this month. Greenpeace usa's executive director calls the move \" deeply hypocritical, \" per politico. \" president obama should know better — shell has no business in our arctic ocean, and he will bear responsibility for the damage that shell wreaks there, \" a rep for friends of the earth says, while the executive director of the sierra club adds the decision \" goes against science, the will of the people and common sense, \" per the hill. An april reuters article proffered theories why this may be happening: for one, onshore shale oil production may start to fall off in a few decades, and it may take that long to build up sufficient reserves of arctic oil. Energy companies could also reap the benefits of lower-emissions gas in the region, and the president may be able to gain a strategic advantage over russia and china by starting now. A shell rep tells politico: \" we remain committed to operating in a safe, environmentally responsible manner and look forward to evaluating what could potentially become a national energy resource base. \" that's not swaying environmentalists. \" president obama is willing to allow the pristine chukchi sea to become an energy sacrifice zone, \" the friends of the earth rep says, per quartz.

The married couple from platte, south dakota, were in the same room in a nursing home on july 31 when jeanette, 87, suffering from alzheimer's, died peacefully at 5: 10pm, reports cnn. At that point, family members told her 86-year-old husband, who was battling prostate cancer next to her, that he could follow his wife. He \" looked very intently over where mom was, \" then closed his eyes, his son, lee, tells ksfy. Henry died 20 minutes after jeanette and while \" you don't pray for it because it seems mean... You couldn't ask for anything more beautiful, \" lee says. But if that wasn't enough, he also received \" a sign from god that was the right time. \" lee says a battery-operated clock on the wall just happened to stop at the exact moment his dad passed away.

That's what we most felt was missing in the past in the last several elections. \" here are some of the plan's details: cost of living: democrats promise to lower the cost of prescription drugs and college tuition, fight for \" families struggling with high monthly bills, \" and crack down on monopolies. Higher wages: the \" better deal \" plan promises millions of good-paying jobs, a higher minimum wage, investment in infrastructure, and an aggressive crackdown on corporations that outsource american jobs. 21st-century economy: democrats say they are committed to providing tax breaks to employers who offer workforce training, bringing high-speed internet to the whole country, and offering millions of apprenticeships. What's missing: noticeably absent from the \" better deal \" plan is any mention of the social issues that motivate many democratic voters but that may turn off the rural, blue-collar voters who abandoned the party for donald trump last year. Those include immigration, lgbt rights, and abortion, politico reports. Strategy: democrats want to talk about \" how working- and middle-class incomes have stagnated as the costs of housing, health care, education, and everything else have continued to increase, \" writes ben mathis-lilley at slate. Critique: roll call reports that it took the twitterverse no time at all to point out the similarity between the \" better deal \" slogan — \" better skills, better jobs, better wages \" — and that of pizza delivery giant papa john's: \" better ingredients.

However, by the time they arrived, half of the 145 or so whales were already dead, and the other half had to be euthanized due to \" the remote location, lack of nearby personnel, and the whales'deteriorating condition, \" the doc said in a statement, per the bbc. \" it's always a heartbreaking decision to make. \" two separate pods were found, beached about 1.2 miles apart along the shoreline. New zealand is considered a \" hot spot \" for the stranding of marine creatures, though it's typically single animals that are found, not multitudes of them. Researchers are still trying to fully understand what causes the whales to wash up on shores there, and so far the doc suspects factors that include \" sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather. \" stewart island in particular could be \" confusing \" for the whales, the manager of a whale rescue group says, messing with their echolocation-dependent communications system due to its \" gently shelving waters, \" per stuff.co.nz.

The family patriarch ( known only as \" tim \" ) was unloading the groceries when he spied the venomous brazilian wandering spider — the world's most dangerous arachnid, livescience reports — and panicked, dropping the bananas into a bowl and trapping the spider by one of its legs. After he discovered its lethal status online, he says, \" we were terrified. We got ourselves and our kids out of the house straight away. \" unfortunately, no one seemed to want to deal with the spider: both police and the local animal welfare group said they weren't equipped to handle it. In the meantime, the spider had chewed its own leg off and disappeared, and a waitrose worker sent over found hundreds of spider eggs in the bananas. Waitrose finally sent a pest control expert, who battled what he called the \" hard-core \" arachnid and its spawn the old-school way: he stuck the eggs in the freezer to kill them and battled the fang-baring spider with a 3-foot stick until he was able to direct it into a heavy plastic container. Waitrose gave the family $ 240 in store vouchers, a \" family day out, \" and an apology. The spider, which usually resides in south america and occasionally shows up in imported fruit, can kill a human within minutes with its toxin, which also gives men long-lasting erections — it has been proposed to help treat erectile dysfunction, the huffington post reports. ( it may have been lethal, but at least the spider wasn't as big as a puppy, nor did it burrow into anyone's chest. )",

Researchers report in the journal of pediatrics that 34 patients under age 18 end up in the er every day because of injuries related to the swabs. The stat is the daily average of 263,000 er trips they tracked down over 21 years through 2010, reports the columbus dispatch. About three-quarters of the injuries — such as perforated eardrums — came during ear cleaning, with others from kids playing with the applicators ( 10 % ) or falling with them in their ears ( 9 % ). In the majority of such cases, 77 %, the kids were using the applicators themselves. And the younger the child, the more prone they were to a problem: two-thirds of patients were younger than 8, and 40 % were age 3 or younger. \" the two biggest misconceptions i hear as an otolaryngologist are that the ear canals need to be cleaned in the home setting, and that cotton tip applicators should be used to clean them; both of those are incorrect, \" says senior author dr. Kris jatana of the nationwide children's hospital in a news release. In fact, our ear canals are largely self-cleaning and best left alone, she advises. That echoes advice earlier this year from the american academy of otolaryngology, which said that earwax has health benefits to boot. Health experts say that those who just can't resist do-it-yourself ear cleaning should instead opt for drops, and gizmodo spells out the details. The bright side of the report is that 99 % of the hospital trips ended up with the patient treated and released. ( your earwax says a lot about you. )",

He still won't take money from pacs or lobbyists, the new york times notes, and with the economy in mind, his inaugural committee plans to keep things more low-key this year. In 2009, there were 10 official balls; this year, the number is down to three, with one for obama's national finance committee, one for the military, and a presidential ball. In another change from 2009, donations of more than $ 250,000 from individuals and $ 1 million from institutions bring access to the most exclusive events. Previously, donations were limited to $ 50,000 per person and $ 100,000 per couple. The decision comes amid donor fatigue following history's most expensive campaign, the times notes. Though the administration says it will not accept money from corporations with conflicts of interests, watchdog groups have attacked the shift. \" there's no corporation which has no conflict of interest, \" says one. It's a \" significant symbolic reversal, \" notes politico, from a president whose team initially rejected corporate money as part of a \" commitment to change business as usual in washington. \"",

In fact, he thinks a trump victory would be disastrous in november.

Specifically, fournier took issue with this statement from clinton on fox news over the weekend regarding her infamous email server and fbi chief james comey: \"director comey said my answers were truthful, and what i've said is consistent with what i have told the american people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails. \" that statement is \" wrong and she knows it, which makes it a lie, \" writes fournier. He cites fact-checker glenn kessler of the washington post, who accused clinton of \" cherry-picking statements by comey \" and awarded her a worst-you-can-get ranking of four pinocchios. The deception angers fournier because while he expects little of trump, he expects clinton to rise above this sort of thing. \" it's too late for clinton to come clean, but honorable democrats should at least insist that she stop muddying the water, \" writes fournier.

Between them, they allow the agencies to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search-engine queries. Though tuesday's statement does not mention these programmes by name, it says the extent of surveillance revealed by snowden has challenged and undermined the right of all humans to \" remain unobserved and unmolested \" in their thoughts,"

The only silver lining is that the weekend timing and days of warning could help limit deaths and damage. Still, saturday will be \" an absolute mess, \" says a meteorologist for the weather channel. Travel will be \" literally impossible anywhere in the mid-atlantic region. \" as food and supplies vanished from store shelves, five states and the district of columbia declared states of emergency. Schools and government offices closed preemptively, and thousands of flights were canceled.

            "Thundersnow is a snowstorm event in which thunder and lightning occur. An example is the classic 2011 thundersnow in chicago that surprised jim cantore. Thunderstorms accompanied by snow are usually of a different character than the \" normal \" thunderstorm. The latter are usually rather tall, narrow storms containing a rising updraft of warm, moist air that has risen in a layer from near the surface that may go upward to 40,000 feet or more. Temperatures at the surface are usually well above freezing. Snowstorms, by contrast, are mostly associated with rather extensive layers of flat, relatively shallow cloud. Precipitation in the clouds is usually formed below 20,000 feet, as sketched in the first diagram on the right. Upward and downward motions in ordinary snowstorms are rather gentle. The exception is lake-effect snow, where the clouds are created by heating of air moving over relatively warm lakes. Lake-effect snowstorms have narrow clouds shaped more like ordinary thunderstorms, and actually sometimes develop thunder and lightning. Most thundersnow events develop when \" ordinary \" flat, layered snow clouds develop upward bumps or \" turrets \", as illustrated in the second diagram. They rise upward above the rest of the flat snow cloud by about 5,000 feet. These turrets can develop",
