Alvarez thinks one of the major reasons the bank is so troubled is that \" for a long time no one has been minding the store. \" ever since vatican ii, \" ministry has displaced management in the papal job description.

            "By any standard pope francis ' brazil trip was a great success. Enthusiastic crowds clogged the routes of the papal motorcade and reportedly more than a million people were present for the pope's final mass on copacabana beach. The media no less than catholic pilgrims seemed enchanted by the new pontiff and his appeals for dialogue, conciliation and social justice. For this pope, who presents himself above all else as a pastor and teacher, the achievements of this first international foray must be satisfying. Now, though, it's time for francis to put away his bags, step out of the international spotlight and tackle the job of administering the church of which he is the head. At this moment in the history of the roman catholic church, francis can do more good working at his desk than waving from the popemobile. For papal functionaries, the positive headlines from brazil may have been especially welcome because they displaced several less edifying vatican story lines. In june, italian police arrested a priest working in the office responsible for overseeing vatican properties and investments, charging him with conspiring to illegally move about $ 27 million from switzerland to italy. After the priest's arrest, the director and deputy director of the vatican bank resigned and became objects of criminal investigations by the italian police. Next the media turned to",

Researchers believe all children between the ages of 1 and 2 should be screened for familial hypercholesterolemia ( fh ), a genetic condition that drastically increases the risk of heart attacks under the age of 40, according to a press release. In a study published thursday, researchers screened more than 10,000 toddlers for fh through genetic and cholesterol testing. They found nearly 0.4 % of children have fh — nearly twice as many as previously believed. Researchers say early testing could prevent about 600 heart attacks in people under the age of 40 every year in britain alone. \" it's reasonable to screen for something that's common, dangerous, and has a treatment that's effective and safe, \" one doctor tells the ap. Researchers argue that early screening would be easy to implement, medical daily reports. Toddlers can be tested at the same time they're vaccinated, and there's no follow-up visits required. According to afp, the best treatment for children with fh is exercise and eating right. Testing toddlers also has another benefit. Because fh is passed on genetically, finding a child with fh also means finding at least one parent with the condition who may or may not have been aware of it. Researchers say 90 % of parents who found out they had fh during the study sought treatment for it. And early testing is apparently popular with families. During the study, 84 % of families asked if they wanted their child screened said yes. ( a study found 45 % of heart attacks may go unnoticed. )",

The software, developed at uc riverside, suggests that a painting known as the nidd hall portrait may also show henry viii's beheaded second wife. Experts have debated whether the portrait, housed in northern england, features boleyn or jane seymour, henry's third wife. The software aimed to help settle the issue, the guardian reports. The technology compares known images of a person with uncertain ones, looking at characteristics like nose width and eyebrow curvature. In this case, researchers compared the painting to a leaden portrait called the moost happi medal. The medal is the only known portrait of the queen, most of whose images were destroyed after she was beheaded; the king wanted to remove her from history, the sydney morning herald reports. But when her daughter, elizabeth i, became queen, portraits of boleyn re-emerged, though they were quite possibly based on other noblewomen, the telegraph reports. Indeed, along with the possible match, the researchers also found that well-known images supposedly of boleyn, including two at london's national portrait gallery, may not show her at all, the telegraph notes.

As the ap reports, hundreds of male villagers ( and, per npr, a single female ) dressed as women, armed themselves with bolos, and sounded the signal to attack: the peal of one of the town's church bells. Then came revenge: the new york times reports the responding us soldiers were ordered to kill every male 10 and older; they also took balangiga's bells. On tuesday, what president rodrigo duterte last year called \" the spoils of war \" were returned. Sung kim, the us ambassador to the philippines, said duterte's plea for their return was hardly the first: the country's presidents have made such a request for nearly 30 years. But kim said duterte's forceful july 2017 words made a difference: \" they are ours. They belong to the philippines. They are part of our national heritage. \" at a ceremony in manila tuesday, kim called it a \" great honor to be here at this closing of a painful chapter in our history. Our relationship has withstood the tests of history and flourishes today. \" the bells — which had been kept at a us air force base in cheyenne, wyo., and with the us army in korea — will be transferred to balangiga on saturday.",

Archaeologists say the rock etching found at the moli del salt site in spain is about 13,800 years old and breaks all the conventional rules of art from the paleolithic era, the los angeles times reports. \" we think that someone was experimenting with new themes, focusing for the first time on the social realm, \" marcos garcia-diez and manuel vaquero, co-authors of the paper describing the find, tell the times. What exactly appears on the 7-inch-wide, 3-inch-high rock: what look to be seven semi-circular huts at a campsite, etched — \" probably with another rock or a pointed flint artifact, \" the paper notes — into three rows on the stone to perhaps create depth in the image, per the authors. The rock was unearthed in 2013 at the site about 30 miles west of barcelona, though nothing seemed special about it initially, notes the times. But once the dirt and debris was wiped off the specimen, they realized they might have something more on their hands. The study, published in plos one, notes that \" landscapes and features of the everyday world were scarcely represented \" during that hunter-gatherer time period; instead, animals, symbols, and \" figurative motifs, \" especially those linked to that society's religious and magical beliefs, were de rigueur. \" unlike other purported examples of landscape depictions, it mainly represents a human landscape, suggesting that the human world was the main concern of the artist, \" the authors write, per the christian science monitor. But not everyone is so sure that the paleolithic artist was a true rebel: an archaeology professor from the uk's durham university says that, because that era's art is often hard to decipher, the scribblings may symbolize nothing more than what the new scientist labels \" highly stylized animals. \" ( most ancient cave artists were probably women. )",

John glenn ( credit: nasa ) glenn had fallen in love with flying at an early age, building model airplanes while growing up in ohio. In 1941, glenn discovered a u.s. Department of commerce program looking for students to train as pilots. Just six months after he received his license, the japanese bombed pearl harbor. Glenn initially enlisted in both the u.s. Army air corps and u.s. Navy aviation cadet program, but was eventually assigned to the u.s. Marine corps. Glenn flew 59 missions in the south pacific, where one of his wingmen was baseball legend ted williams. After serving in the korean war, glenn was appointed to a naval test pilot program, where he completed one of the world's first supersonic transcontinental flights in 1957.

        "summary": "The mother and stepfather of 16-year-old kendal ball claim they were trying to teach him \" a lesson about alcohol, \" but it was a lesson that killed him. Prosecutors say the lyman, wyo., teen died of acute alcohol poisoning after joining stepfather joseph richardson and a friend for a drinking session in early july, the uinta county herald reports. The boy's mother, paulette richardson, told investigators that he drank a few shots of fireball whiskey and a few shots of jack daniel's over two-hour period on july 6 before going to bed around 10: 30pm. The stepfather called an ambulance after he checked on the teen at 3: 45am and found him unresponsive. The coroner says kendal had a blood alcohol content of 0.587 — more than seven times wyoming's legal limit for an adult. The richardsons were yesterday charged with involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. According to court documents, they told investigators they wanted to \" get him sick \" because he had since age 13 been expressing a desire to drink and they didn't want him to become an alcoholic like his biological father. The prosecutor tells the herald that the case shows the dangers of some \" traditional parenting lore. \" \" sometimes a person's actions have tragic results, and there are often criminal consequences for those poor decisions. \" the ap reports the richardsons were still in county jail as of yesterday and have a preliminary hearing on friday. ( police say a missouri family staged a kidnapping because they thought a 6-year-old boy was \" too nice \" to strangers. )",

Gurbir grewal, who wears a turban and full beard, took to twitter on thursday morning to call for an end to \" small-minded intolerance \" after he was attacked by the hosts of the dennis &amp; judi show, a fixture on new jersey radio for more than 20 years. Wkxw-fm hosts dennis malloy and judi franco uttered the slur on their wednesday show while talking about grewal's directive to prosecutors to temporarily suspend marijuana prosecutions statewide. Malloy said he couldn't remember grewal's name, telling franco: \" i ' m just going to say the guy with the turban. \" malloy and franco acknowledged their words might be offensive, but malloy said \" if that offends you then don't wear the turban and maybe i ' ll remember your name. \" officials at the station, new jersey 101.5, suspended malloy and franco indefinitely. \" my name, for the record, is gurbir grewal.

The emails referenced shindle and 2013 winner mallory hagan, referencing their appearance, sex lives, and intelligence with what huffpost calls \" misogynistic and inappropriate language. \" haskell initially called his correspondence \" a mistake of words \" and said he wouldn't step down, though he eventually did. Carlson, who tweeted monday she was \" honored \" to take the helm, told huffpost in a statement: \" everyone has been stunned by the events of the last several days, and this has not been easy for anyone who loves this program. … we appreciate the existing board taking the steps necessary to quickly begin stabilizing the organization for the future. \" ( one ex-miss america wants the entire board to step down. )",

Per serving, plain popcorn contains nearly twice as many polyphenols as the average fruit, according to the preliminary results of a laboratory analysis presented today at the annual meeting of the american chemical society. Polyphenols, a type of plant-based chemical found in foods ranging from vegetables to chocolate, help neutralize the harmful substances known as free radicals and are thought to protect against heart disease and other health problems. \"nobody had paid much attention to popcorn as a source of anything other than fiber, \" says lead researcher joe vinson, ph.d., a professor of chemistry at the university of scranton, in pennsylvania, which funded the study. \"popcorn has more antioxidants in total than other snack foods that you can consume, and it also has quite a bit of fiber. \" vinson and his colleagues analyzed four brands of commercially available popcorn. After grinding kernels ( both popped and unpopped ) into a fine powder, they separated out the polyphenols by adding a pair of solvents — a process that roughly mimics what happens in the stomach as food is digested, vinson says. A single serving of popcorn —"

In its first formal response to criticisms made by the government following the publication of the cloyne report, the vatican said it was \" sorry and ashamed \" for the sexual abuse of children in ireland by priests. However, it expressed significant reservations about the content of mr kenny's speech in july when he said: \"for the first time in ireland, a report in child sexual abuse exposes an attempt by the holy see to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign, democratic republic as little as three years ago, not three decades ago. \"and in doing so, the cloyne report excavates the dysfunction, elitism... The narcissism that dominates the culture of the vatican to this day. \" the vatican statement says mr kenny's allegations, which \"he made no attempt to substantiate \" were \"unfounded \". It said the claims were based on an incorrect reading of a 1997 vatican letter expressing \"serious reservations \" about the irish bishops ' 1996 policy requiring bishops to report abusers to gardaí.

The winning powerball numbers drawn saturday night were 12-29-30-33-61 and powerball 26. The powerball jackpot was the nation's seventh largest. The florida lottery says the winning mega millions ticket was bought at a 7-eleven convenience store in port richey. The retailer will receive a $ 100,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. The winning numbers to claim the mega millions jackpot were 28-30-39-59-70-10. The jackpots refer to the annuity options for both games, in which payments are made over 29 years. Most winners opt for cash options, which would be $ 281 million for mega millions and $ 358.5 million for powerball. Powerball odds are one in 292.2 million. Those odds weren't enough to slow utah residents from crossing state lines into wyoming so that they could get in on the action, notes fox news. The identity of either winner was not immediately available. However, under florida law, the mega millions winner cannot remain anonymous. The winner has 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim the prize. However, to elect the one-time, lump-sum cash payment option for $ 281.2 million the claim must be filed within 60 days, according to lottery officials. Only three mega millions jackpots have been larger than the most recent grand prize: a jackpot of $ 656 million in 2012; a jackpot of $ 648 million in 2013; and $ 536 million in 2016.",

The man, identified as roosevelt pleas, entered the fifth avenue building at 10: 30pm and aroused suspicions during the secret service security screening when he told agents he had just gotten a call from donald trump and needed to speak to him straight away, the new york daily news reports. The agents contacted police officers on duty in the building and the 26-year-old was taken into custody for a psychiatric exam. The new york post reports that a record check found that pleas was wanted for failing to answer a court summons in brooklyn. Pleas did not have a weapon and posed no threat to trump, authorities say. A law enforcement source tells cnn that to protect trump and his family, who plan to spend a lot of time in new york even after he becomes president, the secret service is considering renting an entire floor at trump tower to serve as a command post. The rent would be around $ 1.5 million a year — and it would be paid to the trump corporation.",

But new research suggests that it is the very act of having them, and being alone with one's thoughts about them, that takes a toll, as opposed to the idea of keeping them from others being the most harmful aspect of secrets. As lead researcher michael slepian of columbia business school reports in the journal of personality and social psychology, this new theory of secrecy holds that secrecy is not an activity but a state of being. It's not the murder, as the new yorker puts it, but \" the incessant beating of the telltale heart. \" to test this, researchers surveyed 1,200 americans online and 312 picnicking in central park in new york about 38 categories of behavior or identity commonly known to be withheld in our culture. On average, respondents keep secrets in 13 of these categories, and haven't told anyone their secrets in five categories. At the top of the list: extra-relational thoughts, romantic desire while single, and sexual behaviors such as fantasies, porn consumption, etc. Researchers break down their findings at keepingsecrets.org, and note that when people are alone, they think about their secrets twice as often as when they're actively withholding them in conversation. What surprised the researchers, per scientific american, is that this active concealment didn't impact personal well-being, but the more often a person considered his secret while alone, the bigger a toll it took in terms of things like stress, depression, and anxiety.

The western australia government on saturday began placing baited hooks on drum lines off popular beaches in the state capital perth and to the south to kill white, bull and tiger sharks over three meters ( 10 feet ) long. The policy is a response to seven fatal shark attacks in australia's southwest in three years. Government spokesman simon beaumont said the first shark was killed by a government-contracted commercial fisherman on sunday morning off castle rock near the town of dunsborough, 250 kilometers ( 155 miles ) south of perth. The shark was longer than three meters ( 10 feet ) and was one of the three targeted species. Beaumont would not say which of the three species it was. Once the fisherman had confirmed with fishing authorities that the shark was the required species and size, he shot it and dumped the carcass at sea, beaumont said. The policy has divided the community since it was announced several weeks ago and led to thousands of people demonstrating on perth beaches against the shark cull.

Six deaths have been confirmed and at least 50 other people are being treated in the hospital after the fire at the 24-story grenfell tower in west london. The death toll \" is likely to rise during what will be a complex recovery operation over a number of days, \" says police commander stuart cundy. The fire, which started around 1am, burned through the night despite the efforts of hundreds of firefighters. The fire stretched from the second to the 24th floor and witnesses tell the bbc they saw trapped people, including children, screaming for help from the building's upper floors. The latest: london fire commissioner dany cotton said at 9: 40am london time that firefighters had been able to access all floors for the first time, the evening standard reports. \" this is an unprecedented incident. In my 29 years of being a firefighter i have never ever seen anything of this scale, \" she said. Cotton wouldn't speculate on the cause of the blaze. There had long been concerns about fire safety in the building, which was completed in 1974 and renovated last year, reports the guardian. In the grenfell action group blog, residents repeatedly warned about issues including safety equipment that hadn't been checked in years. \" only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence or our landlord, \" they warned in november last year, adding that the event would probably be a fire, and the blog would serve as \" damning evidence of the poor safety record. \" relatives are desperately searching for loved ones, including children and elderly people, missing after the blaze, the telegraph reports. Officials believe there were up to 600 people in the building when the fire broke out. The former chief of the residents ' association tells cnn that amid serious safety concerns, residents tried to get the management association to change its \" stay put \" policy, which recommended that residents stay in their apartments in the event of a fire. Resident paul munakr tells the bbc that he was alerted to the fire not by alarms, but by hearing people in the street shouting \" don't jump. \" he was on the seventh floor and managed to get out safely. \" as i was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible, \" he says.

After the shootings, dozens of police vehicles, including a swat truck, quickly descended on the area, a rural, wooded area near hackett, a town of about 800 residents. Police say jones also shot a police robot and a police dog, the ap reports. Hollenbeck says the suspect shot and disabled the robot that was being used to confirm jones was inside the home where he was holding officers at bay.

Milk produced roughly 30 miles away from the plant had around five times the normal amount of radioactive material iodine-131, while spinach some 75 miles away had about four times the limit. The ap reports that japan has also detected trace amount of radioactive iodine in tap water in tokyo and five other areas; the radiation didn't exceed government limits, but normal water tests show no iodine. The radiation raised concerns about the safety of japan's food supply, but a top minister said that the elevated levels don't pose an immediate hazard to human health. \" it's not like if you ate it right away you would be harmed, \" he tells the ap. But \" it would not be good to continue to eat it for some time. \" the journal notes that based on the heightened radiation levels found, if a human consumed the milk for a year, it would equate the radioactive exposure of one ct scan; the spinach would equate one-fifth of a ct scan.

Rick snyder on monday blamed \" career bureaucrats \" for the flint crisis and said his staff lied to him about the city's lead-tainted water, the detroit news reports. Snyder says he got a briefing on sept. 27 telling him \" outside experts \" were wrong and that flint's water was safe, reports the detroit free press. He says during a conference call the next day he learned the city's drinking water was so contaminated with lead that it risked permanent brain damage in children. ( snyder had previously claimed he learned about the crisis oct. 1, nbc news reports. ) \" talk about being upset, i was upset, \" the free press quotes snyder as saying. The problems in flint started when the city switched to the flint river for its water as a money-saving move. Snyder says the blame lies with state employees who showed \" an absolute lack of common sense \" and decided not to pay $ 150 per day to add chemicals to the water to protect aging pipes. Still, he says he's taken responsibility for the crisis. And — despite widespread calls for him to step down — snyder says he won't resign. In the past six months, snyder, who still classifies his governorship as a success, has gone from a possible presidential candidate to a spot on fortune's list of most disappointing leaders. \" it's a humbling experience, \" the news quotes snyder as saying. \" it's been a very difficult time period. But what i keep in mind is there are people suffering in flint, and i want to do something about it. \" flint's tap water is still considered unsafe to drink.",

        "summary": "The united states hiked tariffs on chinese imports friday and beijing announced it was retaliating against american goods in a technology dispute between the world's two biggest economies that president trump says he is prepared to escalate. Washington imposed 25 % tariffs on $ 34 billion worth of chinese imports, a first step in what could become an accelerating series of tariffs. Retaliatory measures \" took effect immediately, \" said a chinese foreign ministry spokesman, lu kang. Hu gave no details, but the communist party newspaper people's daily said the customs agency was carrying out a plan announced last month to impose 25 % tariffs on a $ 34 billion list of american goods including soybeans, pork, and electric cars, reports the ap. The ap reports the first exchange of tariffs is unlikely to inflict much economic harm on either nation. Indeed, asian financial markets took friday's developments in stride. Japan's main stock index, the nikkei 225, gained 1.1 % while the shanghai composite index added 0.5 %. Hong kong's hang seng rose 0.8 %. But president trump said thursday that he's prepared to impose tariffs on up to $ 550 billion in chinese imports — a figure that exceeds the $ 506 billion in goods that china actually shipped to the united states last year. Escalating tariffs would likely raise prices for consumers, inflate costs for companies that rely on imported parts, rattle financial markets, cause some layoffs, and slow business investment. A full-fledged trade war, economists warn, risks tipping the us economy into recession. See the ap for more, including the impacts the tariffs have already had and what could be to come.",

While other stolen items were recovered from an apartment building the next day, the medal wasn't there, per wsb radio. Jacobi says chloe found the medal \" right up against the curb on the side of a quiet, wooded road \" and her dad recognized it from news stories. He then emailed jacobi, who visited the family on monday, bringing a $ 500 reward and olympic memorabilia. \" she's an amazing little girl; she's got a lot of personality, \" jacobi says of chloe. \" obviously, she and her parents have just the highest, strongest, moral character. \" jacobi tells the chattanooga times free press that only a portion of the medal was actually found. The 1992 olympic medal is made of two parts: an upper disc and larger metallic base, which is attached to the ribbon. The upper disc \" has the greek goddess of victory on it, the olympic rings, and the 1992 olympic markings, \" he says. \" so we got that back but we didn't get the base. \" reuters notes it's possible the medal can be fixed, but \" it's pretty cool just as it is, \" says jacobi, who lives in tennessee and had the medal with him in anticipation of an atlanta tv appearance he was slated to do the day after the theft.",

The new law bans police officers from having sex with motorists that they pull over, reports the wichita eagle. Although kansas did have a law prohibiting police from having sex with people in jail, the new law bans sex \" during the course of a traffic stop, a custodial interrogation, an interview in connection with an investigation, or while the law enforcement officer has such person detained. \" kansas was one of 33 states where sex between police and detainees is not illegal. The bill was introduced by rep. Cindy holscher, a democrat, in response to the case of a detective who was alleged to have repeatedly coerced sex from black women in kansas city by threatening to arrest them or their loved ones. One such incident led to the arrest of lamonte mcintyre, who spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he didn't commit. Mcintyre's mother said in an affidavit that she had spurned the detective's advances, per nbc4. Holscher also cited a case in new york, where a teen alleged that two officers raped her in their van, but because the officers said the sex was consensual, no charges were filed. New york passed a similar bill in march, in response to that incident. \" i was shocked, \" new york state sen. Diane savino told cbs news when she learned of the gap in the law. \" it should be clear across the state for officers from every department, that when someone is in custody they do not have the ability to consent to sexual activity. \"",

But sales of mcdonald's coffee products have been stagnating since that initial jolt, per crain's chicago business, with nick karavites, a chi-town owner of 18 mcdonald's, revealing his own mixed feelings. It \" does too well to just get rid of it, but it doesn't do well enough to be very excited about it, \" he says. Mcdonald's is hoping to change that with a nationwide brand redo that includes $ 12,000 espresso machines, taking a play from starbucks'seasonal-themed coffees and snackable sweets, and environmentally friendly coffee beans. The overhaul, expected to cost tens of millions of dollars in restaurant redesign and marketing, is part of the chain's overall major upgrade. The move shows mcdonald's hand in trying to lure snack- and caffeine-craving consumers who usually flock to places like starbucks and dunkin'donuts for a fix. \" we see the snacking...

American officials had urged the panel not to announce the tally before conducting a widespread audit, the special envoy to afghanistan, james f. Dobbins, said in an interview with the voice of america channel here. In a somber speech, mr. Ghani said tuesday that he would agree to a thorough audit of 7,100 polling places, which would amount to a review of more than three million ballots. He also urged calm and unity, saying that he regarded mr. Abdullah as a respected national figure who did not want to hurt the country, but insisting that any talk of a parallel government would remain just that: only talk."

The singer — who accidentally exposed janet jackson's right breast to half the nation in 2004's notorious \" wardrobe malfunction \" — made the announcement in a tonight show skit with jimmy fallon on sunday, people reports. Super bowl lii will be held feb. 4 in minneapolis, and variety predicts that \" it doesn't seem completely unlikely \" that jackson, who was blacklisted by the nfl and several broadcasters after the 2004 incident, could make a surprise appearance at the show. \" if justin timberlake doesn't bring out janet jackson at the super bowl halftime i ' m gonna take a knee, \" tweeted ray rahman. The 2004 incident caused 540,000 complaints to the federal communications commission, which launched a crackdown on \" indecent content \" and heavily fined then-super bowl broadcaster cbs, though the fine was eventually chucked out on appeal. Gizmodo notes that the incident not only led to a broadcast delay during live performances, it changed the way we share video online: jawed karim, who co-founded youtube the following year, says he decided to start the site to make it easier to find the jackson clip and other videos online.",

        "summary": "Residents of the west calumet housing complex in east chicago, ind., remember having \" mud fights \" as kids, per the guardian. Today, the once-happy memory haunts them. The epa recently revealed that the top six inches of soil surrounding the complex — built atop a former smelting operation — contains 30 times the safe level of lead, plus dangerous levels of arsenic, reports the new york times. In some areas it's 66 times the safe level of lead and 55 times the limit for arsenic, reports cnn. Lead was found in soil tests in 2006, but the 1,100 complex residents — the majority of whom are black — say state and epa officials were slow to tell them how bad things were, with many drawing comparisons to the flint water crisis. \"if i'd have known the dirt had lead, he wouldn't have been out there playing in it, \" says one mom of a 3-year-old with elevated lead levels in his blood. \"oh, my god, i ' m ready to go. \" an epa rep says officials began cleaning up \" hot spots \" years ago and decided on a plan to remove the contaminated soil in 2012. But only in may did test results show \" exactly where \" the contamination was, he says.

            "Oscar pistorius, who has cried, wailed and vomited through his murder trial for the shooting death of his girlfriend, denied an allegation today that he was tutored by an acting coach before the trial began. The \" suggestion that mr. Pistorius \"took acting lessons \" is totally devoid of any truth, \" said a statement released by anneliese burgess, identified as the media manager for the pistorius family. The statement went on to \" further deny that our client has undergone any ' acting lessons ' or any form of emotional coaching. \" \" this type of comment makes a mockery of the enormous human tragedy involving the steenkamp family and our client and his family, \" burgess said. Pistorius, 27, is charged with shooting his model girlfriend reeva steenkamp, 29, before dawn on valentine's day 2013. He maintains he mistook her for a burglar when she went to the bathroom during the night and has pleaded not guilty. He could face at least 25 years in prison if convicted of murder. The trial has been marked by pistorius ' emotional reactions that have ranged from plugging his ears with his fingers during detailed descriptions of steenkamp's wounds, to vomiting several times in a bucket when photos of his dead girlfriend were displayed. His loud sobbing has been so uncontrollable at times that court was adjourned to allow",

We \" deny that our client has undergone any ' acting lessons ' or any form of emotional coaching \", anneliese burgess, media manager for the pistorius family, said in a statement on his website. Pistorius broke down repeatedly in the witness box as he gave his version of shooting dead his girlfriend, reeva steenkamp, on 14 february 2013. His vomiting and loud crying have often disrupted proceedings, and some have questioned his sincerity. Well-known south african columnist jani allan claimed he had been coached for his emotional performance. \" i have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting lessons for your days in court.

Dik, along with assorted developers, art historians, and data scientists, spent 18 months trying to solve it. The guardian reports the answer is the next rembrandt, a computer-generated painting unveiled tuesday in amsterdam. The team analyzed all 346 of rembrandt's paintings — more than 168,000 painting fragments — to create software that understands how and what rembrandt painted. \"it is a way of keeping the great master alive, \" says bas korsten, whose ad agency was the driving force behind the project. The next rembrandt is a 148-million-pixel portrait of a 17th century man wearing a hat that the team hopes could be mistaken for a lost rembrandt. The 3d printer used to create the image even mimicked the physical texture of an actual oil painting. Dutch news reports not all rembrandt fans who've seen the work were convinced, quoting one who said they \" would expect more accent on the collar and the painting to be sharper. \" and korsten admits some people may be upset by the idea that a great artist could be replaced by an algorithm. But he wants to assure art lovers they aren't trying to make rembrandt obsolete. \"we are creating something new from his work, \" korsten says. \" only rembrandt could create a rembrandt. \" ( the mystery of a dismembered rembrandt was finally solved. )",

Yet it wasn't until sept. 1, 1985 — 30 years ago yesterday — that robert ballard famously found it, submerged more than two miles deep and 380 miles southeast of newfoundland. In a special interview with national geographic, ballard says that because the wreck is in international waters and the company that owned it no longer exists, maritime law dictates that no one owns it — thus allowing anyone to visit and swim away with artifacts. But this free-for-all may change now that the ship has been underwater for a century and has thus been designated a unesco heritage site. Also, because the titanic is on the continental shelf, canada is requesting an extension to claim that territory and thus the right to the vessel. Unfortunately, the wreckage that ballard called a \" museum piece \" in an interview with time back when he found it is no longer in such pristine condition. With no light and little life so far below the surface of the ocean, as the belfast telegraph reports, many artifacts were well preserved and thus carted away by tourists. \" the salvagers have reached a point of diminishing returns, \" ballard says today. But still, \" most of the destruction is being done by humans that are landing on it. \" he adds: \" [ we ] have the technology to preserve the ship. Conservation and preservation in situ is possible, but who would do that? \" if canada wins the rights to the ship, time will tell what it chooses to do with the remains.

The titanic came to rest roughly 380 miles ( 612 kilometers ) southeast of newfoundland in international waters. According to maritime law, a shipwreck in international waters is under no national jurisdiction. Since the company that owned the titanic went out of business long ago, anyone with the right equipment and expertise to reach the ship could go down for a visit — and return with artifacts. Visitors to the site have made their mark — modern trash litters the area and some experts claim that submersibles have damaged the ship by landing on it or bumping into it. And natural processes are relentlessly breaking down the titanic, too.

The titanic came to rest roughly 380 miles ( 612 kilometers ) southeast of newfoundland in international waters. According to maritime law, a shipwreck in international waters is under no national jurisdiction. Since the company that owned the titanic went out of business long ago, anyone with the right equipment and expertise to reach the ship could go down for a visit — and return with artifacts. Visitors to the site have made their mark — modern trash litters the area and some experts claim that submersibles have damaged the ship by landing on it or bumping into it. And natural processes are relentlessly breaking down the titanic, too. Specialized mollusks have gobbled up most of the ship's wood while microbes eat away at exposed metal, forming icicle-like \" rusticles. \" ( read about why the titanic is falling apart. ) years of legal wrangling has resulted in little resolution.

Ralph white — corbis ca. 1985 --- the prow of the hms titanic, as she lies on the atlantic ocean floor south of newfoundland. When the titanic sank in 1912, the famous ship wasn't exactly sailing in obscurity. Yet it took decades before the wreckage was discovered. It wasn't until sept. 1, 1985 — 30 years ago tuesday — that scientists, after years and years of searching, found what they were looking for. As shown by these photos, taken that year and shortly after, the ship was in surprisingly good condition considering the time that had passed. Robert ballard, the leader of the discovery expedition, told time that month that the ocean had shielded the grand liner and kept it a \" museum piece. \" but the find was exciting for more than the titanic's history. As time explained, the discovery proved that the rest of the ocean's mysteries were now fair game: in a sense, it was a dream fulfilled for all seafaring scientists. To locate one of the most technologically advanced vessels of its day, the researchers employed the most advanced technology"

It's about the entitlement given to minorities. \" sheheen responded that \" there's a quiet bigotry that still exists, and if those of us who are white don't say anything … then we're part of the problem. \" \" when i see a confederate soldier, i don't get goosebumps and feel all warm and fuzzy, \" says sen.

All i ' m saying is, you can't force all of us to have [ that same ] passion. \" martin says the flag went up over the capitol building in the 1960s for the 100th anniversary of the civil war — but stayed up to defy the civil rights movement. \" in my view, that's the reason the flag stayed up. \" \" i hate that it took a tragedy like [ the charleston massacre ] for me to really, fully understand it, \" says sen.

        "summary": "A federal judge has tossed a lawsuit claiming sheriff's deputies and school officials failed to protect students during the feb. 14 parkland shooting. Claiming severe trauma and psychological injuries, 15 students of florida's marjory stoneman douglas high school argued their civil and due process rights were violated. \" viewed properly, the claim arises from the actions of [ shooter nikolas cruz ], a third party, and not a state actor, \" us district judge beth bloom wrote in a dec. 12 ruling, per nbc miami, clearing broward's school district and sheriff's office of any legal duty to protect students not in custody. At best, the lawsuit filed in july alleged \" deliberate indifference \" on the part of defendants — including campus monitor andrew medina and school deputy scot peterson — which is \" insufficient to constitute a due-process violation, \" bloom said. While the judge noted \" further amendment of these claims would be futile, \" she did allow a small portion of the suit, alleging a wrongful search by peterson on the morning of the shooting, to move forward. A student claimed peterson took $ 200 from him, suspecting the money to have come from a drug deal, when it was to be used to pay for a valentine's dinner date, reportedly confirmed by the student's mother. \" as alleged, the basis for peterson's search was not reasonable, \" bloom wrote. Peterson could still be on the hook in another suit brought by the family of shooting victim meadow pollack. A broward circuit judge last week rejected peterson's argument that he had \" no legal duty \" to protect students and faculty at the school, per the orlando sentinel. Several lawsuits filed by parents of parkland students remain in state court. ( peterson described \" seven chaotic minutes. \" )",

A federal judge last wednesday dismissed broward school and sheriff's officials, as well as broward county itself, from a lawsuit filed by 15 students who say the feb. 14 attack at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland caused them psychological injury and severe trauma.
