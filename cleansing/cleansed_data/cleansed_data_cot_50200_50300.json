        "summary": "While you're spending october planning what candy you ' ll hand out on halloween, fabien cousteau will be spending the month underwater. He's aiming to spend a record-breaking 31 days in the deep blue, surfacing on october 31, on the 50th anniversary of his grandfather jacques cousteau's record-setting 30 days underwater in the red sea. The third-generation oceanographer and a team of five others will stay at noaa's aquarius habitat, a 43-foot cylindrical lab off the florida keys that sits 50 to 60 feet below the surface — the last undersea lab still in operation, reuters reports. The adventure, which will take place twice as deep as the elder cousteau's, will be broadcast 24 hours a day, the tampa tribune adds. While there, the \" mission 31 \" team will go diving outside the lab and will also explore on underwater motorcycles, collecting information about the ocean's health as well as the impact living underwater has on their bodies. \" we get to see things in the way you would if you were immersed like a fish, \" cousteau says. They ' ll look for evidence of climate change and test new equipment, the florida keys keynoter reports. They ' ll also skype with school children, the weather channel, and international space station astronauts; make a 3d imax documentary; and entertain vip guests including richard branson and, tentatively, will.i.am. As for the nitty-gritty, aquarius does have a shower, bathroom, and air conditioning in addition to six bunks, where they ' ll sleep just five to six hours per night.",

Critics say federal prosecutors went after swartz too aggressively and were bent on locking him up for decades as an example, with mit's help. But the school says the report shows it didn't \" seek federal prosecution, punishment, or jail time \" for swartz. The report, however, faults \" the mit community's apparent lack of attention to the ruinous collision of hacker ethics, open-source ideals, questionable laws, and aggressive prosecutions that was playing out in its midst. \" basically, it says this wasn't just a simple case of a hacker caught red-handed; bigger principles were at play, and the school seemed ignorant of them. Swartz's girlfriend calls the report a \" whitewash, \" adds the atlantic wire. \" this report claims that mit was ' neutral ' — but mit's lawyers gave prosecutors total access to witnesses and evidence, while refusing access to aaron's lawyers to the exact same witnesses and evidence. That's not neutral. \" swartz's father, robert, has a similar take: \" mit claimed it was neutral, and it was not — and besides, should have advocated on aaron's behalf. \"",

If you were a man he would likely hit you, punch you, knock you down, choke you. \" scobee says members who misbehave are sent to something called rehabilitation project force, and she herself was sent there before ultimately leaving the church. \" you run everywhere you go. You do hard manual labor. You call everybody'sir. ' you have no communication in and no communication out within that group. \" security guards keep members from fleeing.

Argue their church committed against its own: destroying families in order to protect scientology. \" remini delves into the process of \" disconnection, \" in which the church forbids members from having relationships with ex-members, even their own children, in the show. According to the huffington post, remini says she herself paid $ 3 million \" if not more \" to the church over the years, but that even an \" average person \" is expected to pay at least $ 250,000 for their \" religious freedom. \"",

Unlike other colleges, however, it was staffed entirely by homeland security agents. The department of justice announced this week it had indicted 21 people for visa fraud in a sting operation that centered on the fake school, invented in 2013 as a tool to catch those seeking fraudulent student visas to remain in the us. Agents say brokers purchased forged paperwork from unnj to obtain visas for 1,076 clients, knowing they would never attend any classes. Some acquired work visas, allowing clients to get jobs at apple, facebook, morgan stanley, and join the us army, per abc news and the new york times. In exchange, the brokers took home thousands of dollars in commissions. \" the university of northern new jersey was just another stop on the pay-to-stay tour, \" says the us attorney for new jersey. Authorities describe the defendants are mainly naturalized citizens and legal permanent residents. One chinese national allegedly enrolled dozens of students at unnj. \" you know that none of these people are going to class? \" an undercover agent asked him, per buzzfeed. \" we've been doing this for years, no worries, \" he replied, according to an indictment. An immigration rep says the 1,076 \" students \" — many of whom are indian or chinese — have had their visas revoked and will be investigated by immigration authorities, reports nj.com.",

After stressing the long-held ties between the us and the uk — \" the tens of thousands of americans who rest in europe's cemeteries are a silent testament to just how intertwined our prosperity and security truly are \" — obama writes that \" now is a time for friends and allies to stick together. \" one person clearly not on board is london mayor boris johnson, who wrote a blistering response in the sun newspaper. He says he admires the us and has \" respect \" for obama, but thinks the white house view is off base. \" it is incoherent. It is inconsistent, and yes it is downright hypocritical, \" writes the mayor. \" the americans would never contemplate anything like the eu, for themselves or for their neighbors in their own hemisphere. Why should they think it right for us? \" in revving up his argument, johnson also complains that a bust of winston churchill displayed in the oval office for nearly 10 years was removed from its perch \" on day one of the obama administration \" and given back to the british embassy in washington. He writes that it's unclear whether obama was to blame but adds, \" some said it was a symbol of the part-kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the british empire. \" ( the washington post in 2015 dug into the \" complicated story \" of the bust. ) see obama's full op-ed here, and johnson's here.",

It's like having your 90-year-old aunt get sick, and there is nothing you can do except give her basic care and keep her comfortable, \" the lead zookeeper told the san diego union-tribune last month. Another female died at a czech zoo in july, and the final three survivors are all at a conservancy in kenya. \" let this be a warning of what is happening to wildlife everywhere, \" the park wrote in a facebook post. But hope for the species lives on: the zoo's \" frozen \" section now has genetic material from at least a dozen northern whites, and scientists hope to bring back the species with embryos that can be carried by southern white rhinos, six of which recently arrived at the park, the union-tribune reports. \" the white rhinos represent the wild places and prehistoric animals that are still with us, \" a park curator tells the union-tribune. \" it is devastating to think that in just a few hundred years, we can wipe that out.

Looking back on the imbibing habits of more than 4 million people globally over the last 100 years or so, aussie researchers say the ladies have closed the drinking gap with men, partly due to marketing efforts and products geared toward young women, the guardian reports. The university of new south wales mega-study in bmj open journal looked at 68 studies covering the drinking habits of subjects born between 1891 and 2001. While guys born between 1891 and 1910 were twice as likely as women to drink alcohol and three times as likely to abuse it or experience booze-related \" harms \", all three aspects had reached near-equal status by the time scientists got to individuals born between 1991 and 2000. A press release calls that phenomenon \" sex convergence. \" the study points to a bunch of cultural and economic reasons for the shift, including cheap wine and beer being readily accessible, more women working outside of the home and participating in workplace drinking events, and what the director of uk nonprofit alcohol concern calls a \" concerted effort \" by the alcohol industry to push products and brands on women. What all of this means, per the study's authors: prevention and treatment programs need to start targeting the gals. \" women are now drinking as much as men... And we need to be thinking about what will happen to their health as they get older, \" says lead author tim slade, per the new york times. ( are women drinking more because of … sexism? )",

        "summary": "Oscar pistorius will know next month whether he's going to prison for killing girlfriend reeva steenkamp. Closing arguments finished today, and judge thokozile masipa said she would announce her verdict on sept. 11, the ap reports. After prosecutor gerrie nel ripped into the defense's case yesterday, pistorius ' lawyer took to the floor today to describe the double-amputee athlete as vulnerable and insecure because of his lifelong disability. Attorney barry roux went so far as to compare him to a wife who kills her partner after years of abuse, reports the telegraph. The \" slow burn of insecurities, \" paired with his athletic training, caused him to snap when he felt his life was in danger, said roux. Prosecutors are pushing for 25 years to life for premeditated murder, though the judge has a range of lesser penalties at her disposal, along with exoneration. Roux also said that pistorius ' behavior following the shooting — including calling for help — shows that it was a tragic mistake, not a murder. As for his poor memory on the stand? roux linked it to pistorius ' \" severe depression. \" and though the prosecution argued steenkamp's stomach contents indicated the couple stayed up arguing after pistorius said they went to bed, roux said the judge \" cannot exclude \" the possibility that steenkamp woke up for a late-night snack. He also said that a security guard who passed pistorius ' house and heard no argument when the prosecution said it took place is \" fatal to the state's case. \" roux did, however, admit pistorius is guilty of a gun charge related to an incident at a johannesburg restaurant.",

In addition to language tests, the government is also considering banning face veils in certain places, such as schools and courts, and banning gender segregation in muslim meetings, the telegraph reports. \" people coming to our country have responsibilities too, \" the guardian quotes cameron. According to the bbc, critics of the plan say there are bigger issues affecting muslim women, that connecting language skills and radicalization isn't helpful, and that it's wrong to focus on muslims instead of all migrants. Cameron says he ' ll be putting more than $ 28 million toward a program to teach muslim women english, and that starting in october, people entering the uk on five-year spousal visas will be tested on their english skills after two and a half years.

Iwai believes the thumb-dagger evolved to allow males to anchor to the female during mating. And field observations in southern japan's amami islands, the frog's only home, showed that the males indeed jab their spikes into the sides of the females to hold on during amplexus — a form of pseudocopulation in which the males mount the female and fertilize her eggs as, or soon after, she lays them.

While drinking vinegar may aid in weight loss, \" it is not magic, \" says one of them, author beth warren. Another says drinking vinegar could cause stomach discomfort and acid reflux. ( some researchers think it's those adverse effects that actually curb the appetite. ) the recent hubbub about vinegar seems to stem from a 2009 japanese study, in which obese adults dropped two to four pounds in 12 weeks after taking up to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar daily. Other outlets echo glamour's findings. Nutritionist carol johnston tells the new york times that vinegar can help you shed pounds \" if you're a very, very patient person, \" but, she adds in a now-common refrain, it's not a \" magic bullet. \" vinegar may help, johnston tells the washington post, by inhibiting enzymes that help digest starch. The less starch you digest, the less your blood sugar spikes after eating carbs. Over time, those undigested calories may add up to \" very modest \" weight loss. To those who want to give vinegar a shot, experts advise ingesting just one tablespoon in eight ounces of water during the first bites of a meal. And johnston notes, it needn't be apple cider vinegar — red wine vinegar or white vinegar will do. But take with caution: consumption of vinegar, per the times, has been linked to vocal cord spasms, fainting, damage to the esophagus, and tooth erosion.

The deal was supported by the families of both of his victims, according to wtvr.

Twenty-year-old virginia tech student morgan harrington disappeared in 2009 after attending a concert at the university of virginia. Eighteen-year-old hannah graham was a uva student when she disappeared five years later. Matthew worked at the uva medical center at the time of the disappearances. \" today's events do not bring hannah back to us, \" graham's father said during wednesday's hearing, per nbc. \" but at times like this, we must take comfort where we can. \" graham's mother described her daughter as a \" heroine \" for giving her life to help police arrest \"a serial rapist and murderer hiding in plain sight. \" matthew was sentenced to three life sentences last year for sexually assaulting and attempting to murder a 26-year-old woman in 2005.",

A left turn can be a \"stressful scenario that requires crossing multiple lanes of oncoming traffic, \" according to waze. Yet the app routinely leads drivers into them because it prioritizes empty side streets to help users avoid traffic, laist reports. To solve the problem, waze worked with los angeles citizens to identify problem intersections, ending up with a list of 100 or so. Because the new feature requires the input of actual humans, it will take a while to introduce it in other cities. New orleans is next. The new feature could do more than make driving more pleasant for waze users. Left turns cause about 500,000 crashes and hundreds of deaths every year in the us.

One common theme, as in this editorial by the new york times: he was terrific on civil rights and criminal-justice reform, but lousy on wall street accountability and on the trampling of rights under the excuse of \" national security. \" the editorial ticks off various accomplishments, from same-sex marriage ( he torpedoed the defense of marriage act ), to his staunch defense of voting rights, to his reform of drug-sentencing laws. His legacy will be defined in a good way by such things, says the editorial, but \" it will also be defined by deeply harmful actions — and failures to act — involving issues of national importance. \" among other things, the editors call out holder's defense of the government's right to kill citizens without judicial review, his over-zealous prosecution of leaks, and his approval of the secret monitoring of american journalists. Other views: too big to jail: holder secured no big convictions in the nation's financial crisis, writes roger parloff at fortune. This criticism, widely \" encapsulated in the phrase'too big to jail, ' is the albatross that threatens to weigh down holder's legacy in the business realm. \" good riddance: sure, he's got some good marks on his record, but \" holder's tenure has been marked by a disturbing mix of duplicity, incompetence, and obliviousness, \" writes nick gillespie at time. Holder put his loyalty to president obama above his loyalty to the constitution. Good, but...: \" the sad truth is that holder could have been truly great — not simply as the first black attorney general but as a man of principle who stood with the law over politics and friendship, \" writes jonathan turley at usa today. \" in one of the great lost opportunities in history, holder will finish his tenure as he began it: a man with great but still unrealized potential. \" best for our times: keep in mind that holder served in extremely partisan times, writes jamelle bouie at slate. He's not sure he can go as far as al sharpton in pronouncing holder \" the most effective civil rights attorney general in american history, \" but, writes bouie, \" he was a very good one, and given the times, that's just as vital. \" click to see who's in the early running to be the next attorney general.",

The former republican governor of florida, who turned independent for a failed 2010 senate bid, will be speaking at the democratic national convention next week, reports usa today. Crist, who declared his support for president obama over the weekend, was seen as a potential running mate for john mccain in 2008, but fell out of favor with the gop after backing obama's economic stimulus plan in 2009, the new york times notes. Crist has been denounced as a turncoat by republicans, who have a turncoat of their own at their convention. Artur davis, co-chair of obama's first campaign, now supports mitt romney and will be one of the rnc's featured speakers tonight.

At that point, the driver allegedly flicked off his headlights and sped away. With police investigating, and arguelles ' riding group posting on facebook, a tip came in about a man seeking to dispose of a body. Police tracked him down to the site of a ford pickup with extensive front-end damage and the body lying beside it. Officers then arrested emilio gomez on charges including intoxication manslaughter, and nelson cantu for failure to report a felony. Now a website has raised more than $ 11,000 for arguelles ' wife, 11-year-old son, and 4-year-old daughter, fox rio 2 reports, and an editorial at the monitor applauds bike lanes but says drivers don't always respect them — \" and tragedy is often the result. \"",

Just shy of 2,000 years later, what's believed to be a piece of one of his bones has been presented to westminster cathedral. The path from there to here is filled with legend, crime, and a google search. Clement, one of the catholic church's first popes, was killed on the orders of the roman emperor trajan around ad99, and his watery death led to him becoming a patron saint of mariners, reports the guardian. The bbc reports something miraculous was said to have followed: the sea receded, revealing his bones, a fragment of which reportedly came to be kept in a wax-sealed case that shows the words \" ex oss s. Clementis pm. \" it was recently stolen from the car of the unnamed person who owned it and ended up in london's trash. It might have stayed there were it not for enviro waste owner james rubin, whose staff set aside the case while pulling items that could be recycled or refurbished from the waste it collected. A google search of those latin words led rubin to believe it was a saint's bone, and he blogged about the find, asking for advice on what to do. Some 650 suggestions later, he settled on giving it to westminster cathedral, and the owner, who also emerged, agreed to hand it over on permanent loan. A ceremony was held to transfer the relic on tuesday. ( a thief stole what was left of a saint's brain. )",

According to techcrunch, every cell network was down inside the park within 20 minutes of the festival starting. Kotaku states connection errors made the popular game \" unplayable. \" for those who somehow managed to get online, the game itself was also having issues. Attempts to capture a monster — part of the draw of the festival was the chance to catch rare pokemon — resulted in error screens. John hanke, the ceo of pokemon go developer niantic, took the stage to boos and chants of \" we can't play \" and \" fix the game. \" but it wasn't just the people inside the park having a bad time. Lines to enter pokemon go fest stretched for blocks, with some people reporting waiting four hours to get inside. With problems mounting, organizers announced all attendees would be refunded the $ 20 ticket price plus an extra $ 100 in in-game credit. Many attendees traveled from across the country or paid hundreds of dollars for tickets being re-sold online. \"it's a small gesture, but we're sorry, \" niantic's chief marketing officer told the crowd. \"we didn't envision the day going this way. \"",

Washington was saturday's big prize with 101 delegates at stake, and politico called a victory there \" essential \" to sanders ' campaign hopes. The delegates will be awarded proportionately and sanders was headed toward a lopsided win — good news for him given that he trailed clinton by more than 300 pledged delegates heading into the day. It's no surprise to see sanders do well in washington, notes fox news. On friday, he drew 10,000 to a rally in seattle, one of the most liberal cities in the country. Seattle also leads the country in per-capita individual donations to sanders — about $ 145 for every 100 people. The story was largely the same in alaska, where sanders had a lead of nearly 60 points with more than a third of precincts reporting. Analysts say the overwhelming whiteness of alaska, which has 16 delegates up for grabs, favored sanders. The final 25 delegates of the day came from hawaii's caucuses. Throughout the campaign, sanders has done better in caucuses than primaries. \" the deep south is a very conservative part of the country, \" he tells the ap. \" now that we're heading into a progressive part of the country, we expect to do much better. There is a path to victory. \" that path, the ap notes, is steep: after the first two wins saturday, clinton's delegate lead was 1,234 to 956 over sanders, which widens considerably when superdelegates are included: 1,703 to 985.",

The museum bought the machine for about $ 15. Initially, museum volunteers thought they had discovered a civilian version of the teleprinter. But later they realized it was a military-issue machine upon discovering a swastika and military serial number, according to the telegraph. \" everybody knows about enigma, \" the museum's andy clark tells the bbc, referring to the machine used by nazis to send communications to frontline troops. \"but the lorenz machine was used for strategic communications. \" the lorenz also produced a more complex code than the enigma, per the guardian. But mathematician bill tutte was able to break it, leading to the creation of the first programmable computer, colossus, that could translate messages sent via the lorenz. \"we were able to drip-feed the russians the locations of the german tank divisions of kursk, \" wetter tells the telegraph, adding that it was the \"turning point of the war. \" on june 3, the national museum of computing plans to recreate the breaking of the lorenz cipher code using the teleprinter and a lorenz cipher unit on loan from norway's armed forces museum.

Researchers then used a kind of alcohol to alter electrical impulses that cells send through protein channels in the worms, ifl science reports. Amazingly, some of the worms grew heads that were rounded, triangular, or had pointy ears — and all from other species.

Now a researcher at oregon state university is reporting that \" making a more intentional effort \" to have a healthy sex life is an actual \" issue of human sustainability \" and, as would of course follow, a \" potential career advantage. \" reporting in the journal of management, his team followed 159 married employees over a two-week period and looked at their sexual behaviors as well as mood, engagement at work, job satisfaction, and more. Sure enough, having sex reaps positive benefits for a solid 24 hours — and for men and women equally, they found — likely due to the release of dopamine and oxytocin, reports new york magazine. Keith leavitt, a business professor at osu, goes so far as to say that people should \" just make time for it, \" and notes that it's actually \" a real thing \" when people have a \" spring in their step. \" if this all seems rather obvious, it did to gizmodo, which points to studies linking sex with mood benefits all the way back to 1958. But while the study shows correlation and not causation — hey, people who elect to have sex more might be happier already, and being happier in general could be behind that higher work satisfaction — gizmodo urges people not to overthink it. \" there's a college professor in oregon telling you to make time for sex and expect good things to happen as a result.

Archaeologists digging at one of london's oldest playhouses, where shakespeare's company performed from 1597 to 1599, have found a ceramic bird whistle they believe was used for sound effects — perhaps during the 1598 premiere of romeo and juliet, in which the characters discuss hearing a nightingale or lark. \" theater producers at that time were always trying to find new ways to animate their productions and delight audiences, \" archaeologist heather knight tells the bbc. Clay tobacco pipes and an animal bone comb were also found at the curtain theatre, but most interesting is that the playhouse is rectangular instead of circular, as was more typical in that era, per the ap. \" it's a total surprise to us, \" a shakespeare scholar tells the independent of the 1,000-person venue. It stretched 100 feet by 72 feet and \" has probably the best preserved remains of any of the playhouses we've looked at, \" including an open gravel yard where attendees would stand to watch the action and inner walls that held the galleries, she adds.

The remains of the curtain, which opened in 1577, were found behind a pub as part of regeneration works in 2011.

Their parents say police haven't done enough since their children — the youngest of whom is 16 — went missing early may 26, because they come from a poor neighborhood. Since then, the story has made headlines around the world, and police today arrested two waiters from the bar and another woman; they're still looking for the bar's owner, who is now considered a fugitive, reports the bbc. The parents insist the disappearance was a kidnapping. But investigators say there is no evidence of an abduction, and only one person on the scene claims to have seen anything — in his telling, masked gunmen stormed the bar and seized the group, but he has since disappeared, leaving behind a false name and contact info. To make things twistier, three of the missing young people are related to crime bosses currently in prison, fueling theories that a rival gang may be involved. And a cnn report makes things twistier still: police say they've identified no fingerprints from any of the missing on the bottles or glasses found at the bar.",

And as something of a starving artist, friends counseled her to take it. She countered at $ 6 million, she says, figuring \" i could probably have gotten him up to three, \" but ultimately \" i was like — ew, gross, you're disgusting, i don't want your money, that would make me feel disgusting. \" mcgowan, who settled with weinstein 20 years ago for $ 100,000 after she says he raped her, recently learned there was no confidentiality clause attached to that agreement. Meanwhile, director robert rodriguez tells variety that he not only knew about mcgowan's allegation, but that he cast her in the weinstein-backed grindhouse as a deliberate jab at the producer. After finding that she had been banned from appearing in any miramax films, he says he offered to \" write her a bad ass character and make her one of the leads. I wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her off the blacklist, and the best part is that we would have harvey's new weinstein company pay for the whole damn thing. \"",

Close to a cinematic miracle. \" the writing is clever and the stars ' chemistry is \" awesomeness. \" the film pokes \" its r-rated finger \" at everything from sequels to its stars. It's \" a solidly implausible story, sight gags galore, endless jokes for the two new freshmen to go sophomoric, all unfolding at breakneck speed, \" writes betsy sharkey for the los angeles times. Put it all together and it's a \" a raucous, raunchy, irreverent, imperfect riot. \" oh, and keep an eye out for the scene-stealing jillian bell. As david edelstein writes at vulture, \" they get to poke fun at sequels and simultaneously make sequel money, which is a great frigging gig if you ask me. \" the first half \" had my preview audience in stitches, \" though edelstein wasn't as entertained. \" but either the movie got better or i got worn down. \" he praises bell, too, and notes \" the ultrameta epilogue ( no spoilers ) is irresistible — it sends you home on a cloud. \" but stephen whitty at the star-ledger finds missteps and notes the sequel jokes are only \" mildly amusing. \" the film's best idea \" is to tease out the gay subtext barely buried in hollywood's new bromantic comedies. \" overall, \" sarcasm is fine in small doses.

The $ 4.4 billion dam would enable a hydropower project earmarked for sichuan province and produce twice as much energy as the hoover dam. True to form, the ok came even as the ministry admitted that the dam would deal a blow to rare or threatened fish and plants, according to state-run media.

The 13th annual state of the world's mothers report by the save the children foundation, out today, examines the well-being of mothers and their children in 165 countries, based on a range of measures, including mothers ' education, infant mortality and breastfeeding rates. Norway tops the overall list of best places to be a mother and ranks among the very best on contraceptive use, female education and political representation. It has one of the most generous maternity leave policies in the developed world. The improvement in the usa's rank is due largely to increases in its already high educational status, which benefits the economic potential of women and mothers, says carolyn miles, president of the charity. The usa still performs below average overall and quite poorly on a number of measures, miles says, including: •lifetime risk of dying from childbirth. Mothers in the usa face a one-in-2,100 risk of maternal death, the highest of any industrialized nation. •mortality rate of children.

Niger's current food crisis bears much of the blame for its placing at the bottom of the list, just above afghanistan, yemen, guinea-bissau and mali. The report also found high levels of maternal mortality, lack of access to contraception and poor levels of income relative to men's. Afghanistan, which came last the previous two years, was credited for providing skilled assistance at more births and a reduction in female mortality rates, among other factors. Hunger and deprivation are the chief factors keeping other developing nations, such as eritrea, chad, sudan and south sudan, near the bottom of the list. Of 73 developing nations on the table, which account for 95 % of child deaths, the save the children report rates only four as \" very good \" for child nutrition.

            "Just in time for mother's day, an annual ranking of the best and worst countries in which to be a mom puts the usa in 25th place, up from 31st last year. The 13th annual state of the world's mothers report by the save the children foundation, out today, examines the well-being of mothers and their children in 165 countries, based on a range of measures, including mothers ' education, infant mortality and breastfeeding rates. Norway tops the overall list of best places to be a mother and ranks among the very best on contraceptive use, female education and political representation. It has one of the most generous maternity leave policies in the developed world. The improvement in the usa's rank is due largely to increases in its already high educational status, which benefits the economic potential of women and mothers, says carolyn miles, president of the charity. The usa still performs below average overall and quite poorly on a number of measures, miles says, including: •lifetime risk of dying from childbirth. Mothers in the usa face a one-in-2,100 risk of maternal death, the highest of any industrialized nation. •mortality rate of children. The death rate for children younger than 5 is eight per 1,000 births, on par with bosnia and herzegovina. A child in the usa is four",
            "Niger is the worst country on earth in which to be a mother, according to a report by save the children. The charity's annual mothers ' index uses statistics covering female and child health and nutrition, as well as prospects for women's education, economic prosperity and political participation in its assessment of 165 countries. Niger's current food crisis bears much of the blame for its placing at the bottom of the list, just above afghanistan, yemen, guinea-bissau and mali. The report also found high levels of maternal mortality, lack of access to contraception and poor levels of income relative to men's. Afghanistan, which came last the previous two years, was credited for providing skilled assistance at more births and a reduction in female mortality rates, among other factors. Hunger and deprivation are the chief factors keeping other developing nations, such as eritrea, chad, sudan and south sudan, near the bottom of the list. Of 73 developing nations on the table, which account for 95 % of child deaths, the save the children report rates only four as \" very good \" for child nutrition. Of the bottom 10 nations, four have seen an increase in stunted growth in children caused by poor nutrition over the past 20 years. The authors stress that income is not the only"

He says he didn't know middleton was a friend of his daughter until after shooting him. Police, responding to a burglary-in-progress call, arrived to find fulton attempting cpr on middleton. Police say fulton's daughter was not in the guestroom at the time of the shooting. While friends and family mourned middleton's death, a local juvenile court judge said the situation is an example of \" what can happen when you don't listen to your parents. \" no charges have been filed.",

        "summary": "Scientists are seriously excited about a new long-necked dinosaur species found near china's qijiang city. For one thing, fossils of the beast, which lived 160 million years ago in the late jurassic period, show a skull still attached to its neck — a rare find among dinosaurs like this as \" the head is so small and easily detached after the animal dies, \" a researcher explains. For another, interlocking joints between the vertebrae suggest the dinosaur's neck moved vertically more than sideways, like a construction crane. Dubbed \" dragon of qijiang \" or qijianglong, the dinosaur belongs to the mamenchisaurids group, phys.org reports. It stretched about 50 feet long, with its neck taking up half that length. University of alberta paleontologists say qijianglong was able to support its massive neck because its vertebrae were filled with air, like a bird's, making it relatively lightweight, the washington post reports. \" qijianglong shows that long-necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in asia during jurassic times — something very special was going on in that continent, \" says a co-author of the paper in the journal of vertebrate paleontology. He's even curious whether qijianglong inspired the dragon myths of its homeland. \" i wonder if the ancient chinese stumbled upon a skeleton of a long-necked dinosaur like qijianglong and pictured that mythical creature. \" ( in contrast, scientists recently found a bunny-sized dinosaur. )",

            "Kansas city, mo. ( ap ) — missouri prisons have been ordered to eliminate smoking after an asthmatic inmate serving a life sentence for two murders won a court judgment. The kansas city star reports missouri has been ordered to go smoke-free by april 1 because of the lawsuit ecclesiastical denzel washington filed. Missouri already bans smoking inside prison buildings, but it allowed it in designated areas outside. The evidence at trial showed that inmates are commonly written up for smoking in their cells. State officials haven't announced details of their plan to eliminate smoking at 21 correctional facilities. Attorney phillip zeeck, who helped represent washington, said the ruling may save missouri taxpayers money because of the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses for the state's more than 30,000 inmates. \" this is a win ultimately for the people who work and live in missouri's correctional facilities, \" said phillip zeeck, who is with the polsinelli law firm washington sued the state because he said he kept getting paired in a cell with a heavy smoker despite doctor's orders that he be held in a smoke-free area. The case has been working its way through the federal courts for a decade. The 53-year-old washington, who used to be known as willie simmons, was sentenced to death in 1989 for the murders of two st. Louis women. His sentence was later reduced to life in prison. ___ information from: the kansas city star, http://www.kcstar.com",

The us thinks too many are being hunted in canada and will push for an international ban on the trade of polar bear pelts, claws, teeth, and other body parts, reports the los angeles times. If the us convinces the convention on international trade in endangered species to go along at its next meeting in march, polar bear skins would be as protected as elephant ivory. By most estimates, up to 25,000 polar bears exist in the world, and two-thirds of those are in canada. Native inuits would still be allowed to hunt the bears, but they would no longer be able to sell on the international market. They promise to fight the move, reports the cbc. \" the polar bear population is very healthy right now and traditional knowledge says that the numbers are increasing, \" says one rep.

As of june 25, the city of los angeles will boast a most unique attraction: a glass slide that hangs 1,000 feet above it, attached to the side of what has been the west coast's tallest building since 1990. The us bank tower is about to lose that honor to the wilshire grand, notes gizmodo, but it's not planning to lose its place in the spotlight. The us bank tower clocks in at 72 stories, and the building's owner intends to install the opening of a 46-foot-long glass slide on the 70th floor. It's the brainchild of singapore-based oue ltd., which bought the building three years ago and is sinking $ 50 million into a rehab of it. You can pay $ 25 to enter the new rooftop complex — oue skyspace la will also contain a bar and observation deck — and then another $ 8 to scoot your way down to the 69th floor, reports the los angeles times. The slide will be 4 feet wide and made of 1.25-inch-thick glass. Curbed los angeles notes that one rendering of the skyslide \" shows a totally calm person casually moving through the slide with arms overhead like this is merely splash mountain and not an $ 8 near-death experience. \" cnn notes it joins a number of similarly see-through attractions in the us, such as the ones at the willis tower and grand canyon.

        "summary": "After many thousands of years roaming much of central asia, the saiga antelope has had a terrible couple of decades — and a devastating few weeks. A mysterious illness that causes severe diarrhea and breathing difficulties has wiped out what could be up to half of the remaining population of the species, new scientist reports. Officials in kazakhstan say the disease has killed 85,000 of an estimated world population of 257,000 since about may 10, but experts say they've heard unofficial estimates closer to 120,000. The species — known for its distinctive tubular nose, the ap reports — numbered more than a million in the 1990s but has been in decline since, thanks in large part to poachers, and was already considered critically endangered before the latest die-off. \" it's very dramatic and traumatic, with 100 % mortality, \" the leader of an international team investigating the outbreak tells new scientist. \" i know of no example in history with this level of mortality, killing all the animals and all the calves. \" the team, which has been taking soil and vegetation samples, believes the mass deaths may have been caused by a bacterial infection or by a virus carried by mosquitoes, smithsonian reports. Whatever the culprit, it has been able to cause a staggering death toll because the population's females all have their calves in the same week, allowing disease to spread quickly, new scientist notes. ( in better news for an endangered species, the us government says most humpback whale populations have rebounded. )",

Kazakhstan's agriculture ministry said friday the number of saiga that have died may have reached 85,000. The ministry says it suspects the animals, which are recognizable for their distinctive humped snout, may have been struck by an epidemic of pasteurellosis caused by a bacterial infection. Officials say international veterinarian experts have been flown to kazakhstan to study other possible causes for the catastrophic die-off. The number of saiga plummeted in the 1990s as a result of poaching. At the latest kazakh government count in 2014, the saiga population stood at 257,000.

Danuta kean does this routinely and makes the case that knowing how things turn out doesn't ruin anything — in fact, it makes the book more enjoyable. If the ending works, she goes back and finishes the whole thing. But if it's weak, she moves on to something new, and that's the bigger point. \" not only does knowing the end mean i can enjoy the scenery, but it means i am insured against that dreadful crime — the bad ending, \" she writes. They're way too common, she writes, and they \" don't just betray the characters, they betray the reader. \" kean runs this by actual novelists, who generally sound a little horrified that any reader would do this. \"when you spend such a very long time carefully crafting pace and reveal, you do rather want the reader to trust you, \" says rowan coleman, who adds some reading advice of her own. \" i can tell if i trust a writer from chapter one. If i don't, i don't read on. \" kean is undeterred, however. She even cites a study out of the university of california san diego that found spoilers don't hurt readers ' enjoyment. Researchers discovered that \" once a reader knew how the story ended, they were able to enjoy a deeper experience of the prose, \" writes kean. \" my point exactly. \" ( click for the full piece. )",
