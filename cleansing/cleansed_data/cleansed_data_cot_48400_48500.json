Gauri budha's family found her body after going to the hut to check on her. Her father-in-law says she had spent sunday working on a farm \" and seemed normal. \" he says \" she had no complaints of any uneasiness. \" according to news18, the cause of death is not yet known, but villagers speculate budha, a student, may have died from smoke inhalation after starting a fire in the menstruation hut to keep warm. The practice of chhaupadi, in which women are sent into isolation during menstruation, has been illegal in nepal since 2005, and the himalayan times reports it was made a criminal offense in august. The district where budha lived was declared a \" chhaupadi-free zone \" two years ago. However, the practice still persists. Two other women from budha's district were found dead in menstruation huts last year. ( an 18-year-old nepali woman banished during her period last july died from a snake bite. )",

The ultra-orthodox woman gave birth to a healthy 5.9-pound baby boy this week, reports the jerusalem post. Haya shahar did so thanks to ivf treatment she had outside the country, likely russia, because israel forbids the procedure for women older than 54. \" we do not recommend this, \" says dr. Tal biron of kfar saba hospital. Nevertheless, he added that the baby is \" very cute. \" shahar's husband is 67, and they'd been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby throughout their 46-year marriage. The post notes the sperm was either donated or bought, but the hospital won't specify; haaretz says the couple used a donor egg. While the delivery ( by c-section ) makes shahar the oldest woman to give birth in israel, it's not a world record. Among the older verified births are one in spain and another in romania, both with women who delivered at age 66 after ivf treatments, notes the mommy files blog at the san francisco chronicle. The oldest woman on record to conceive naturally is a woman in the uk who gave birth at 59, it adds. Shahar and her husband credit a rabbi's blessing for their new son. \" the baby is a darling and there is no despair in the world, and the chapter never ends, \" they said.

But that hasn't stopped shark experts and entrepreneurs from chasing the \" holy grail \" of a completely effective shark repellent, outside reports in a story about man's quest to reduce one of nature's greatest predators to, essentially, an especially large mosquito. Take eric stroud, for example. The chemist got deep into shark repellents after a seeing a \" summer of the shark \" cover story in time in 2001. \" i decided to delve into it, and it just consumed me, \" says stroud, who was soon conducting his own research on baby sharks in inflatable pools in his backyard. Stroud's research inadvertently led him to what he calls \" death signals, \" chemicals present only in the decaying tissue of dead sharks. ( you can imagine how he may have stumbled onto this. ) stroud replicated the death signals into synthetic repellent — housing it in a batman-inspired aerosol can — which he claims is effective on 30 species of sharks. \"sharks will avoid the taste or smell of it like an evolutionary cue, \" he says. But three entrepreneurs who bought the rights to stroud's death signals weren't satisfied, heading to south africa to test the repellent on the notoriously hard-to-repel great white shark. \"the white is a very peculiar shark, \" says the man hired to conduct the tests. \"they do what they want. \" read the full story here for the results ( \" there are easier tests to conduct, \" one intern was left to bemoan ).",

The growing popularity of having a home-grown source of eggs once again has federal officials issuing a warning. This year's numbers are about on par with last year's, when 895 people got sick. While three people died last year, none have died this year, though 71 have ended up in the hospital. In all, people in 47 states have fallen ill. Cuddling cute baby chicks appears to be a problem, notes the washington post. Last year, about half of those who got sick admitted to doing so, and about half also said they let their poultry in the house.

The hardest-hit state is ohio, at 32 cases, with kentucky, tennessee, and california not far behind, reports cleveland.com. \"chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry that look healthy and clean can still carry salmonella bacteria, \" says the cdc, which offers a fact sheet on best practices here.

Under the new rule, women who work for a religiously-affiliated employer, such as a catholic hospital, will still get free access to contraceptives, but their employers won't need to pay for it. The employer will instead notify their insurance provider of their exemption, and the insurer will notify the employee that the contraception is coming from a separate policy, usa today explains. The rule drew praise from the executive director of catholics united. Health and human services \" has done the right thing, \" he said, according to politico. \" this is a victory not only for the obama administration, but for the catholic church. \" but the rule hews fairly close to obama's already announced compromise, which some catholics had declared inadequate.

Boris lushniak today called skin cancer a \"major public health problem, \" and pointed a finger at outdoor and indoor uv light, reports usa today. His warning cites rising skin-cancer numbers as the push behind the official warning: the report says that nearly 5 million americans are treated for the disease annually to the tune of $ 8.1 billion. That includes 63,000 new cases each year and 9,000 yearly deaths, reports the washington post. What's more, melanoma cases are increasing as other types of cancer are decreasing. The statement posted on the department of health and human services website implores people to take the usual precautions in the sun — including wearing sunglasses, a high-spf lotion, and other protective gear — but lushniak, a dermatologist, also places special emphasis on \"completely avoidable \" ultraviolet radiation exposure from indoor tanning beds and booths. The fda piggybacked on lushniak's comments with its own official take today, reminding the public about its mandate for sunlamp labels \"stating that they should not be used on anyone younger than 18 years. \" the indoor tanning association says in a statement that uv light from both the sun and sunlamps is \"healthful in moderation, \" as usa today puts it, a claim that lushniak disputes. \"tanned skin is damaged skin, \" he says in the hhs statement. \"we need to shatter the myth that tanned skin is a sign of health. \"",

Us census data published tuesday revealed the prairie state said goodbye to 37,508 people between july 1, 2015, and july 1, 2016, per the chicago sun-times, dropping its population to 12,801,539 — the lowest it's been since 2009 or so. The numbers lost by the state have increased exponentially in this most recent three-year span: in 2014, the loss was 11,961 people; in 2015, it was 28,497. And per a simon public policy institute poll in october of 1,000 registered illinois voters, 47 % of residents said they'd like to move away. \" when you have a big state like illinois … lose population for three years in a row? that's cause for alarm, \" a brookings institution demographer tells the tribune. So what's to account for the drop? first, there's been an exodus out of state ( more than 114,000 left in 2016 ), mostly to warmer climes like florida, texas, and arizona. But it's not just the weather that's causing defections: michael lucci, a vp with the conservative illinois policy institute, says there are also better job opportunities elsewhere. Combine that with the overall national trend of decreasing birth numbers and more deaths, as well as a decline in the number of immigrants to illinois specifically ( especially chicago, which has traditionally welcomed mexican immigrants ), and the influx of newbies isn't keeping up with the losses. \" to reverse this trend, we need structural reforms to create more jobs, lower property taxes, improve our schools, and enact term limits to fix our broken political system, \" a rep for gov.

Because the water doesn't have enough oomph to push waste out of sewer pipes, a not-so-pleasant odor wafts throughout the city at times, explains the san francisco chronicle. As a remedy, the city plans to buy $ 14 million of concentrated bleach — a 3-year supply — to disinfect wastewater before it goes into the bay. That's on top of a $ 100 million investment to upgrade plants over 5 years to cut down on the stink. The new solution \" translates into 8.5 million pounds of bleach either being poured down city drains or into the drinking water supply every year, \" notes the chronicle. Adds a blogger at cafe mom: \" for a city that believes happy meals are evil attempts to contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic, you'd think san francisco would have a problem with bleach being dumped into the ground.

            "Low-flush toilets are ridiculous. The concept is good, especially in california where water is in high demand and short supply. But the practicality of water-saving toilets is non-existent. Once upon a time, people did their business in buckets or holes in the ground. Fancy rich people used decorated chamber pots, and they employed people to empty them. I'd like to see dirty jobs ' mike rowe tackle that task. Actually, i take that back. I have no desire to watch anyone clean out a chamber pot. Ever. Then someone brilliant invented flushing toilets with the revolutionary u-bend, which kept the smell of the sewers from coming up through the bowl. Within a century, toilets as we know them today became commonplace in developed countries. Add the invention of charmin ultra-soft, and toileting became a much more pleasant task than it had once been. In 1994, congress decided that water was too precious of a commodity to waste flushing waste, so a new law was put into effect mandating low-flush toilets. Where toilets once used up to seven gallons a flush, the new law made it illegal for toilets using more than 1.6 gallons a flush to be sold in the united states. And people have been flushing three times for number two ever since. San francisco was especially determined to convert old-school water-wasting",

In response, jeffries was stripped of his board-chairman role last month and may be on his way out. \" what we ' ll remember jeffries for now is for failing to change, for all the store closures, for the way employees were treated, \" says a stock market analyst. \" and that's unfortunate. \" ( click for the full article. )",

        "summary": "The creator of a much-talked-about list of men in media accused of sexual misconduct revealed herself wednesday after harper's magazine was rumored to have had an article in the works naming her, reports the new york times. In the cut, moira donegan comes clean that she started the \" s --- ty media men \" spreadsheet, complete with a disclaimer that the allegations were just allegations, to help women in media avoid men named as predators. She says she was shocked the list went viral ( she'd only intended for it to stay within its intended audience ) and that her \" life changed dramatically, \" losing friends and her job. Then she found out about the rumored article set to appear in harper's march issue, written by firebrand katie roiphe. Even though others were afraid donegan would be \" threatened, stalked, raped, or killed \" if she was named, she decided to out herself before others did. Before that, though, others started advocating online against revealing donegan's identity. It kicked off with a tweet by n+1 editor dayna tortorici, imploring a \" legacy print magazine \" not to out donegan. Nicole cliffe, former co-editor of the toast, tweeted she found out it was harper's and even offered to pay other writers to pull their pieces from the march issue ( the times says cliffe committed to paying $ 19,000 to journalists who did just that ). Before donegan's essay appeared, roiphe said she didn't know the name of the person who'd created the list and would never have outed her without donegan's ok. But donegan says a harper's fact-checker sent her an email that said roiphe \" identifies you \" in the article. Donegan's takeaway: \" the experience of making the spreadsheet has shown me that it is still explosive, radical, and productively dangerous for women to say what we mean. \"",

The anonymous, crowdsourced document was a first attempt at solving what has seemed like an intractable problem: how women can protect ourselves from sexual harassment and assault. One long-standing partial remedy that women have developed is the whisper network, informal alliances that pass on open secrets and warn women away from serial assaulters. Many of these networks have been invaluable in protecting their members. Still, whisper networks are social alliances, and as such, they're unreliable. They can be elitist, or just insular. As jenna wortham pointed out in the new york times magazine, they are also prone to exclude women of color. Fundamentally, a whisper network consists of private conversations, and the document that i created was meant to be private as well. It was active for only a few hours, during which it spread much further and much faster than i ever anticipated, and in the end, the once-private document was made public — first when its existence was revealed in a buzzfeed article by doree shafrir, then when the document itself was posted on reddit. A slew of think pieces ensued, with commentators alternately condemning the document as reckless, malicious, or puritanically anti-sex. Many called the document irresponsible, emphasizing that since it was anonymous, false accusations could be added without consequence. Others said that it ignored established channels in favor of what they thought was vigilantism and that they felt uncomfortable that it contained allegations both of violent assaults and inappropriate messages. Still other people just saw it as catty and mean, something like the \"burn book \" from mean girls. Because the document circulated among writers and journalists, many of the people assigned to write about it had received it from friends. Some faced the difficult experience of seeing other, male friends named. Many commentators expressed sympathy with the aims of the document — women warning women, trying to help one another — but thought that its technique was too radical. They objected to"

One long-standing partial remedy that women have developed is the whisper network, informal alliances that pass on open secrets and warn women away from serial assaulters. Many of these networks have been invaluable in protecting their members. Still, whisper networks are social alliances, and as such, they're unreliable. They can be elitist, or just insular. As jenna wortham pointed out in the new york times magazine, they are also prone to exclude women of color. Fundamentally, a whisper network consists of private conversations, and the document that i created was meant to be private as well. It was active for only a few hours, during which it spread much further and much faster than i ever anticipated, and in the end, the once-private document was made public — first when its existence was revealed in a buzzfeed article by doree shafrir, then when the document itself was posted on reddit. A slew of think pieces ensued, with commentators alternately condemning the document as reckless, malicious, or puritanically anti-sex. Many called the document irresponsible, emphasizing that since it was anonymous, false accusations could be added without consequence. Others said that it ignored established channels in favor of what they thought was vigilantism and that they felt uncomfortable that it contained allegations both of violent assaults and inappropriate messages. Still other people just saw it as catty and mean, something like the \"burn book \" from mean girls. Because the document circulated among writers and journalists, many of the people assigned to write about it had received it from friends. Some faced the difficult experience of seeing other, male friends named. Many commentators expressed sympathy with the aims of the document — women warning women, trying to help one another — but thought that its technique was too radical. They objected to"

It really doesn't make sense to get any criticism for this. \" the \" this \" martin shkreli is referring to is the price hike his company instituted after it last month acquired daraprim, a 62-year-old drug that the new york times describes as \" the standard of care \" for treating those suffering from the potentially deadly parasitic infection toxoplasmosis. The overnight change made by start-up turing pharmaceuticals: from $ 13.50 a tablet to $ 750 a tablet. Usa today points out that's a 5,000 % increase. Shkreli justified the move by saying the overall impact will be a minor one as there are only 12,000 or so prescriptions for the specialized drug a year, and because the proceeds will go toward developing a newer treatment with fewer side effects. A professor of infectious diseases at emory university isn't so sure about that plan. She tells the times that while the drug is accompanied by potentially serious side effects, they're manageable. \" i certainly don't think this is one of those diseases where we have been clamoring for better therapies, \" says dr. Wendy armstrong. The times charts the drug's price history: its 2010 acquisition by corepharma saw its price hiked from $ 1 a tablet; that raised sales of the drug from $ 667,000 in 2010 to $ 6.3 million in 2011. The most recent price increase could push those sales into the hundreds of millions. As for what daraprim treats, the cdc describes toxoplasmosis as \" a leading cause of death attributed to foodborne illness \" in the us. While some 60 million americans are thought to carry the toxoplasma parasite, it causes illness in those with weakened immune systems.",

Us researchers at the salk institute have found that restricting eating to an 8-to-12-hour window each day can help the body burn fat instead of storing it, the telegraph reports. Mice whose eating was restricted \" had a number of protective and therapeutic health benefits compared with animals allowed to eat the same number of calories from the same food source at any time, \" says the lead researcher in a press release. Mice who only had access to food for up to 12 hours per day gained less weight than mice who could eat whenever they wanted — regardless of the number of calories consumed or whether the diet was high in fat or sugar. And mice that gained weight by eating on an unrestricted schedule were able to reverse the effect by restricting eating to a nine-hour window: even if they ate the same number of calories as before, they stopped gaining weight and dropped 5 % of their body weight in days, discovery news reports; by the end of the 38-week study, they weighed 25 % less than mice who kept eating on an unrestricted schedule. Researchers also found that brief breaks in the routine ( a \" cheat day, \" perhaps, or a weekend during which you don't restrict your eating times ) had little negative effect. And in addition to preventing obesity, the overnight fasting for 12 hours or more also had positive effects on blood sugar and cholesterol, as well as reversing the effects of diabetes, the bbc reports.

Opal lee, 90, set out from her home in fort worth, texas, in september with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in washington, dc, where she wants to present her petition to president obama calling for a federal holiday on june 19. That's the day — \" juneteenth \" — that union soldiers came to texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around lee's church last august mushroomed into something bigger. \" the people walked with me, and we've been going ever since, \" lee tells npr. \" i just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice. \" she was right. Invitations started coming, and lee was happy to take them — in states ranging from colorado and ohio and pennsylvania and virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition. \" i walk wherever i ' m invited, \" lee told cbs pittsburgh during a stop in november. \" two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free. \" lee, who collects donations on gofundme, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count juneteenth as a holiday, lee says federal recognition is important. \" it would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these united states, so it needs to be observed and celebrated, \" she tells fox4. \" slaves didn't free themselves, \" she adds, per npr. \" there were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished. \" and if her pitch falls short next week? there's a new president coming and lee plans to keep pushing with him.

The company has admitted that a self-driving lexus suv bears some responsibility for a feb. 14 crash in mountain view, calif., the verge reports. But no people — or robots — were seriously harmed: according to the dmv's accident report, the vehicle encountered sandbags placed around a storm drain when it approached an intersection. When it moved one lane over, it hit the side of a bus that it had incorrectly assumed would yield. The car was only traveling around 2mph at the time of the collision, which damaged its left front fender, the left front wheel, and a sensor. The 15 bus passengers were transferred to another vehicle. ' we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision, \" google said in a statement. \" that said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that. \" there have been other crashes involving google cars, but this is the first time the company hasn't blamed them on human drivers, reuters reports. The company says it has learned from the experience and adjusted its software so that its vehicles fully understand that buses are \" less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future. \"",

That procedure is called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and it involves taking blood out of a person's body, warming it and pumping it with oxygen, then putting it back in. Dr. James wu, the surgeon who did the procedure, says the freezing temps actually helped justin. \" very low temperatures … can preserve the brain and other organ functions, \" he said at the news conference, per abc. It took justin 15 days to come out of his coma, per cbs, and he lost his toes and pinkies to frostbite, but he suffered no apparent brain damage. Dr. Gerald coleman, the doctor who made the initial call to try the procedure, is thankful he did. \" this case has taught me that sometimes you have to go with your gut, even when all logic demands otherwise, \" he said, per the morning call. As for justin, he's trying to finish up his psych degree via online courses and his friends have a new nickname for him: iceman.

That stint aboard the earth-orbiting outpost earned him and his two crewmates the distinction of the longest human spaceflight up to that point. But the new york times notes that pogue and friends earned another distinction as well — they became the first astronauts to stage what amounted to a strike while in space. About halfway through the mission, the crew got fed up with the constant, mundane chores that ground control had them doing, and staged their job action. While nasa officials at cape canaveral chalked it up to possible depression, pogue explained later that he and his crewmates simply wanted more time to enjoy the view and reflect, reports the times. The two sides reached a compromise, making the last half of the mission more suitable for \"studying the sun, the earth below, and ourselves, \" pogue wrote in his autobiography.",

Here's what pundits and strategists are saying went into, and might come out of, the win: the democratic primary was a disaster, democratic strategists tell chris cillizza of the washington post. Labor spent millions supporting kathleen falk, weakening eventual nominee tom barrett. Walker spent more. His campaign and outside conservative groups outspent the democrats by 10 to 1 or more. Voters are suspicious of recalls. The strategists cillizza talked to are convinced that the few undecideds in the race thought walker deserved a full term before facing judgment again. A cbs exit poll found that 60 % said recalls should only be used for official misconduct. Nobody likes milwaukee. Most states dominated by one big city tend to resent that big city, which hurt milwaukee mayor barrett. Walker attacked the city as economically weak and crime-ridden. Walker didn't bend. This election was about walker, who \" won not despite his refusal to compromise, but because of it, \" argues alex altman of time. \" he cast himself as a politician of conviction, even when his convictions might not be popular. \" the truth is that voters \" prefer their elected leaders to be ideologues. \" this wasn't about obama. Exit polls show voters actually prefer the president to mitt romney 51 % to 45 %. But russ feingold worries that the vote \" could have effects on the presidential race, the senate race, sure, \" he told politico. \" there's always the risk of people being dispirited. \"",

        "summary": "Selma blair and rachel mcadams have come forward to join more than 200 other women accusing director james toback of sexual harassment. In a disturbing account to vanity fair, blair says toback lured her to a hotel room in 1999 and, after she refused to have sex with him, insisted on pleasuring himself by rubbing himself against her leg. She says he then apparently threatened her life, telling her that there had been a girl who went against him, and: \" i am going to tell you, and this is a promise, if she ever tells anybody, no matter how much time she thinks went by, i have people who will pull up in a car, kidnap her, and throw her in the hudson river with cement blocks on her feet. You understand what i ' m talking about, right? \" blair says was scared for her life then and still is, but she came forward out of \" pure rage \" after toback called other accusers liars. Rachel mcadams tells vanity fair that when she was 21, the director told her a visit to his hotel room would be her only chance to discuss her audition for harvard man. She says after she arrived, toback told her he had \" masturbated countless times \" thinking about her that day and asked to see her pubic hair. \" i was very lucky that i left and he didn't actually physically assault me in any way, \" she says. The guardian reports that on wednesday, julianne moore tweeted that in the ' 80s, toback had approached her \" with the same language \" he used with other women, asking her to come back to his apartment for an audition.",

Rick snyder has signed a pair of right-to-work bills that make it illegal to require the payment of union dues in order to work, the detroit free press reports. The state's house of representatives passed the bills earlier today. Some 12,500 people were in lansing to protest — which may be the most demonstrators the state capitol has ever seen. \" this is a national attack, \" united auto workers president bob king declared, as the crowd beat drums and chanted. \" unions built the middle class of america. \" michigan was a surprise setting for the battle, the new york times notes. Just last month, labor leaders were calling for collective bargaining to be written into the state constitution. It seems to have backfired: now, the uaw's home state is the 24th to ban required union dues — and a bellwether for future conservative efforts across the us. The battle comes after snyder shifted position; the governor had once called the issue too thorny too address. Elsewhere: president obama had weighed in yesterday: \" these so-called right-to-work laws, they don't have to do with economics, \" he said. \" they have everything to do with politics. What they're really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money. \" you can follow it all at the free press ' live blog, or catch up on the background here.",

That's got pundits talking today, and pretty much none of those people think it's a good strategy. Here's what they're saying: at the wall street journal, karl rove reveals crossroads polling that shows that, while independent voters widely oppose obamacare, they oppose the gop's repeal-or-shutdown tactics just as strongly. Rove also argues that a shutdown today \" would have much worse fallout \" than the 1995 shutdown, politically and otherwise. Besides, the repeal would need enough votes to clear the senate and override a presidential veto. \" no sentient being believes this will happen. \" republicans who prefer gradually delaying and dismantling the law are winning the argument, argues peter roff at us news and world report, and with good reason: \" they have the president on their side. \" obama's team \" has made such a hash of the implementation phase of obamacare that'delay ' is already a reality, \" and it now seems inevitable to him that the whole law will \" come tumbling down \" and be replaced with something else. But some republicans — displaying \" all the rationality of a justin bieber fan riot \" — argue that they must act quickly, before americans taste obamacare's sweet, sweet subsidies. The law will be \" worse than an invasion of giant zombies swinging nuclear-tipped crocodiles! \" quips gail collins at the new york times, and americans \" are going to love it so much they will never have the self-control necessary to give it up. \" it's not just bad politics, it's morally wrong, argues ej dionne at the washington post. \" there is a thread running through the kamikaze caucus, \" he writes. \" almost everything it is doing is designed to keep government from acting against inequality. \" obamacare, which would help 25 million americans get insurance \" is part of this larger story. \"",

            "In 2010, republicans took the house of representatives by gaining 63 seats. They also picked up six u.s. Senators and 675 state legislators, giving them control of more legislative chambers than any time since 1928. The gop also won 25 of 40 gubernatorial races in 2009 and 2010. These epic gains happened primarily because independents voted republican. In 2010, 56 % of independents voted for gop congressional candidates, up from 43 % in 2008 and 39 % in 2006. Today, independents look more like republicans than democrats, especially when it comes to health care. In a new crossroads gps health-care policy survey conducted in 10 states likely to have competitive senate races and in house districts that lean republican or are swing seats, 60 % of independents oppose president obama's affordable care act. If this holds through 2014, then republicans should receive another big boost in the midterms. There is,",

In a joint venture with oklahoma state university, the agency has released a brand-new peanut that's said to boast a richer flavor, health benefits, and resistance to crop disease, modern farmer reports. The new legume, a type of spanish peanut, is called olé and is the result of a sophisticated \" pedigree methodology \" that tapped into an \" advanced breeding line \" to create a peanut that would be more resistant to sclerotinia blight and pod rot. The diseases can devastate peanut crops unless farmers resort to using fungicides, so from a financial standpoint, olé could be a game changer; diseases like that in a peanut field's soil can wipe out up to half the crop, per a usda press release. \" growing a [ disease-resistant ] variety like the olé could save farmers up to $ 150 [ per ] acre because they wouldn't have to use any chemicals, and that's big savings, \" a usda research biologist tells the crop science society of america. The new peanut is also good news from the consumer perspective: it's loaded with oleic acid — the same fatty acid found in olive oil — which doesn't turn rancid as quickly as the linoleic acid also found in peanuts, meaning a longer shelf life for peanut-based products. And oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid ( one of the so-called \" good \" fats \" ), linked to lower blood pressure, better heart health, and decreased symptoms in diabetes patients, per the cssa. The peanut's high oil content also lends it a nuttier flavor; modern farmer notes spanish-style nuts are generally used to make \" high-quality \" peanut butter.

Fastigiata var. Vulgaris ) that was cooperatively released by the usda – ars and the oklahoma agricultural experiment station in 2014. Olé is the product of the cross 'tamspan 90 ' × f435. The male parent, f435, is the original donor of the high-oleic genes. Pedigree methodology was used in screening segregating populations. The advanced breeding line arsok-s140-1ol was identified due to its enhanced resistance to sclerotinia blight ( causal agent sclerotinia minor jagger ) and pod rot ( causal agents pythium myriothylum and/or rhizoctonia solani )."

On monday, the country added a pair of north korean officials, one of whom is reportedly a spy-savvy army colonel, in what reuters calls a \" coup for seoul. \" one of the new entrants, said by south korea's defense and unification ministries to have entered south korea last year, is reportedly a senior north korean diplomat who was stationed in africa. But it's the second defector, now being granted political asylum, who's of most interest, as he was linked to the north's clandestine general reconnaissance bureau and spent much of his time spying on the south. \" he is believed to have stated details about the bureau's operations against south korea to the authorities here, \" an official told yonhap via the bbc, adding the colonel was the highest-ranking military defector there ever. What's odd isn't just the defection of such a high-level official, but also that south korea is talking about it. Some liberal opposition members say it's a purely political move by the south's conservative president, park geun-hye, to nab votes in wednesday's parliamentary elections. But south korean officials deny that, saying they spoke up about the defection of the restaurant workers — said by cnn to be 12 women and a man who experienced \" pressure from north korean authorities \" to send money home — because there were so many from the same place; the ap notes it's the largest group defection since kim jong un took over in 2011. About 29,000 people have fled the north since the korean war's 1953 ceasefire, even though the bbc notes it's \" almost impossible \" for north koreans to cross the well-guarded borders. ( meanwhile, the north is demanding the south execute some of its own officials. )",

            "North korean players may face \" re-education \" on their return home, exiles suggest north korean players may face \" re-education \" on their return home, exiles suggest north korean football fans - at least, those with both a tv set and a reliable electricity supply - were allowed to see their team's first world cup game against brazil. But the broadcast gave new meaning to the term \" action replay \", making it onto the airwaves of the country's single, government-run channel more than 12 hours after the final whistle. That, though, is far from unusual. In fact, the latest match against portugal is reported to be the first time a north korean game played on foreign soil has been broadcast live back home. It was a risky decision for two reasons. Firstly, it was an open invitation for anyone who wanted to protest against north korea's human rights record to have their messages beamed directly into pyongyang living rooms.

For instance, he says her mother invited the attorneys into her room, and they say they did know where her car was.

        "summary": "If anyone has doubts that the united kingdom's advertising standards authority reads its complaint mail, this should put that to rest. Per fashionista, a lone detractor submitted a grievance to the british ad watchdog about a gucci ad campaign, and now it's banned in the uk — because of two \" unhealthily thin \" models. The brand's already expired promotion of its cruise 2016 collection was featured in the british times, and models madison stubbington and avery blanchard apparently took the complainant's breath away with their slim frames, spurring a challenge against the ad for being \" irresponsible \" and a ban on it appearing in its \" current form \" anywhere in the uk, per the asa ruling. Gucci's rebuttal, via cosmopolitan, says the ad was geared toward an \" older, sophisticated audience \" and that thinness is a \" subjective issue. \" gucci lists reasons why the models weren't portrayed as too skinny — their \" bones \" weren't on display, for example, nor was heavy makeup used to make their faces look too thin. \" the visual parts of their bodies appeared toned and slim, \" the argument reads. But the asa didn't buy that, noting after a review that stubbington's portrayal was ok, but blanchard's wasn't. \" her torso and arms were quite slender and appeared to be out of proportion with her head and lower body, \" the ruling says, adding that her pose accentuated her long torso and skinny waist and that \" her somber facial expression and dark make up, particularly around her eyes, made her face look gaunt. \" cosmo points out issues with the asa's ruling: \" even if intended to combat problematic portrayals of the female form, it's worth noting this is a pretty body-shaming statement in itself. \" ( models in france now need a doctor's note oking their bmi. )",

The plan will see the drug companies remove claims of growth promotion from their products, which will effectively make it illegal for the drugs to be used on livestock without a valid medical reason. Only antibiotics used similarly by humans — think penicillin and tetracycline — will be affected, and the 25 companies in agreement with the plan make 99.6 % of those drugs. \" i think that within three years we're going to see growth promotion gone when it comes to antibiotics, \" one expert tells the wall street journal.

            "The food and drug administration said 25 of 26 drug companies that were asked to phase out antibiotics to promote growth in farm animals have agreed to comply with the agency's voluntary plan. The development announced wednesday clears a major hurdle in the fda's push to combat growing human resistance to antibiotics because of their overuse. Farms use about 80 % of the nation's antibiotics supply, sometimes in healthy animals to speed up growth or prevent illness in unsanitary conditions.

The 25-year-old actress claimed last year that she was quitting — before production of the about-to-be-released transformers 3: dark of the moon — in order to pursue other \" acting \" opportunities. But in fact she was drop-kicked by her bosses immediately after a tirade against director michael bay, in which she said he wants to be \" like hitler on his sets. \" now bay himself has told the daily mail: \" you know the hitler thing. Steven said fire her right now. \" fox was immediately slammed after her comments against bay in a blog by other crew members, who blasted her \" porn star \" acting and called her \" dumb as a rock. \" co-star shia labeouf said in an interview that fox \" started s -- t-talking our captain, which you can't do. \" fox was replaced by british model rosie ­huntington-whitley.

Here are the six things you should read if you want to know what's going on: on friday, ceo nick denton said the post was coming down: while \" the account was true and well-reported... Gawker is no longer the insolent blog that began in 2003. The point of this story was not in my view sufficient to offset the embarrassment to the subject and his family. Accordingly, i have had the post taken down. \" there was a vote: gawker explains the nuts and bolts of the meeting in which it was decided the post would come down. \" the partners who voted to remove the post were andrew gorenstein, who serves as the president of advertising and partnerships; chief operating officer scott kidder; chief strategy officer erin pettigrew \"; and denton. The editorial staff issues a statement: they refer to \" today's unprecedented breach of the firewall, in which business executives deleted an editorial post over the objections of the entire executive editorial staff.... We condemn the takedown in the strongest possible terms. \" michael wolff weighs in on what denton is thinking: as the lead-in to his hollywood reporter piece puts it, \" weeks before the gossip outlet took down a reprehensible article amid outcry, denton seemed to suggest to wolff via an email apologizing for a personal attack that there is a lack of responsibility for the consequences of the site's content in the new age of after-the-fact mea culpas. \" gawker's editors resign today: gawker media executive editor tommy craggs and gawker.com eic max read announced they're leaving over the decision. From craggs: \" all i got at the end of the day [ friday ] was a workshopped email from denton, asking me to stay on and help him unf --- the very thing he'd colluded with the partners to f --- up. \" denton shares this letter with all of edit: \" were there business concerns? absolutely....

For the purposes of this study, \" risky \" alcohol use was considered to be more than 14 drinks a week for women or 21 drinks a week for men, the los angeles times reports. The study used cross-sectional analysis of 61 studies with nearly 334,000 subjects from 14 countries, as well as additional \" prospective \" analysis of 20 more studies that looked at 100,000 people from nine countries. So why do those who put in so many hours put in more appearances at happy hour? a few theories: they may be decompressing from work stresses; it's built into their personalities ( the same folks who work hard can't help but play hard ); or those who suffer from insomnia or depression may take longer to work and be more apt to pick up the bottle, notes the times. Although work-health expert cassandra okechukwu wrote in the study's accompanying editorial that those who have jobs experience lower rates of \" problem alcohol consumption \" and better recovery rates from alcohol abuse than the unemployed, these results warrant further examination: they indicate about 2 million people are adopting risky alcohol habits across labor forces in the participating nations. \" long working hours is an exposure that we cannot afford to ignore, \" okechukwu writes.

Only problem is, it's riddled with errors, according to a scathing review from the national park service bookstore at ford's theatre, salon reports. Here are a few alleged historical missteps: killing lincoln refers several times to the oval office. Little problem: the oval office wasn't built until 1909. O'reilly writes of ulysses s. Grant and robert e. Lee: \"the two warriors will never meet again. \" in fact, they did have a second meeting in 1865 to talk about prisoners of war. According to the book, ford's theatre \"burned to the ground in 1863. \" sorry bill, make that 1862. In o'reilly's words, john wilkes booth used \" a pen knife to carve a very small peephole \" to observe lincoln in his theater box. But one historical record says the hole was bored so guards could keep an eye on the president. Even an amazon reviewer is taking aim at apparent inaccuracies in the book.

            "For fans of led zeppelin, there's no such thing as too many remasterings and reswizzlings of those classic albums, and when a new series of reissues comes with the added bonus of previously unheard songs, it's time to celebrate in an appropriately enormous fashion. Bbc news has clips of two of the songs that will accompany the release of the band's first three albums, this june. There's the blues standard \"keys to the highway \" from 1970, and a not-quite-finished run through \"whole lotta love, \" both of which should serve as appetizers for the gigantic pile of songs — a rarities disc with each album — ranging from alternate takes and live performances, including an entire paris gig from 1969, to work-in-progress ideas and the occasional lost gem. Jimmy page has spent the last couple of years putting the releases together from the band's vault of recordings. And he told bbc news that the unvarnished version of a song like \"whole lotta love \" made him aware of how much work the band put into the fine polish and extra guitars and vocals to really make it fly: \"you realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is. \"there's all manner of bells and whistles to make it the song 'whole lotta love ' as we all know",

        "summary": "It turns out there's something sharks are even better at than spicing up your average made-for-tv movie about tornadoes: sensing electricity. Back in 1971, a dutch scientist discovered sharks use tiny pores on their heads to sense the electric fields produced by other aquatic animals — and hunt those creatures, atlas obscura reports. These electric fields are produced by the differences in ion concentrations between animals and the water and allow sharks to close in for the kill in murky or dark water from about a foot and a half away. Livescience in 2006 reported that the sense was \" so developed \" that sharks could even track down fish who had buried themselves in the sand. What's even more impressive is where sharks fall on the spectrum. According to atlas obscura, sharks are approximately 10,000 times more sensitive to electric fields than any other animal and are even more sensitive than the best machines made by humans. Here's how sensitive: \" they can detect electric field gradients as small as a billionth of a volt across a distance of a centimeter. \" what does this sixth sense mean for fearful summer beach-goers? atlas obscura reports humans ' insulating skin dampens any electric fields that would be sensed by sharks, but opening your mouth underwater could produce one by way of the mucous membranes there, leaving one biologist to advise, \" don't scream. \" read the full atlas obscura article here.",

The finding supports the idea that the early sea creatures which eventually evolved into humans could also sense electricity before they emerged onto land. The study, led by martin cohn and his lab at the university of florida, is detailed in the current issue of the journal evolution &amp; development. Sixth sense sharks have a network of special cells that can detect electricity, called electroreceptors, in their heads. They use them for hunting and navigation. This sense is so developed that sharks can find fish hiding under sand by honing in on the weak electrical signals emitted by their twitching muscles. The researchers examined embryos of the lesser spotted catshark. Using molecular tests, they found two independent genetic markers of neural crest cells in the sharks ' electroreceptors. Neural crest cells are embryonic cells that pinch off early in development to form a variety of structures.

They pick up on the scent of blood from miles away, their sleek, torpedo-like bodies and powerful jaws no match for the unsuspecting fish or seal. And if that's not frightening enough, it turns out that these killing machines also have a secret weapon — a sixth sense — that allows them to prey in murky waters or even complete darkness. Sharks can sense electricity. All animals produce weak electric fields because ion concentrations inside their bodies differ from ion concentrations in the surrounding seawater. This difference produces a slight voltage, which sharks detect at close range — from about half a meter away — when going in for the kill. \"you're like a battery, \" says stephen kajiura, a professor of biological sciences at florida atlantic university. \"the best i can say is it's like there's an electric aura around any organism, \" says kajiura, \"we don't have an analogous sense."

        "summary": "Wayne dyer, who wrote dozens of self-help books and was a guru of sorts for celebrities including oprah winfrey and ellen degeneres, has died at age 75. \" wayne has left his body, passing away through the night, \" his family wrote on facebook yesterday. \" he always said he couldn't wait for this next adventure to begin and had no fear of dying. \" dyer, who spent time in orphanages and detroit's foster system as a child, eventually served in the navy before going to wayne state university to study counseling. In 1976, he published his first book — your erroneous zones: step-by-step advice for escaping the trap of negative thinking and taking control of your life — and it went on to become one of the best-selling books of all time. Dyer discussed his \" self-actualization philosophy, \" which the washington post refers to as \" christian-y \" and \" buddhist-ish, \" on shows including oprah's, phil donahue's, and sally jessy raphael's. He officiated ellen degeneres ' and portia de rossi's wedding. A sample dyer quote, per cbs news: \" take the last five minutes of your day and put your attention on everything that you would like to attract into your life.... Then you ' ll marinate for eight hours, and you ' ll awaken and you ' ll begin to attract the things that are in your subconscious mind. \" his family did not reveal the cause of his death, but dyer was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2009; he claimed that the power of positive thinking and a brazilian doctor's \" psychic surgery \" healed him. Per usa today, dyer once noted that such illnesses are likely \" just the body's way of responding to, perhaps, psychological traumas \" in a person's past.",

Massachusetts'sun chronicle reports that school officials there emailed parents last week about the \" blue whale challenge, \" a \" game \" shared through social media that allegedly puts kids in touch with \" an anonymous curator, \" who then eggs users to complete a series of challenges over 50 days. Usa today documented it in may: it often starts with a fairly innocuous task — watching a horror movie, perhaps — and moves on to increasingly dangerous ones, such as cutting, before finally asking the participants to kill themselves on the 50th day. Per the washington post, school districts nationwide are addressing the murky challenge, though some people claim it's just a hoax to scare parents. The challenge is said to circulate via popular online mediums such as texting, snapchat, and instagram. Although some say deaths caused by the game are just urban legend — the sun chronicle says it's \" unclear \" if the challenge has been tied to actual deaths — the post notes the apparent recent suicide of 15-year-old isaiah gonzalez, whose family says he was a blue whale victim. A teen in atlanta also took her own life after participating in the challenge, her family tells cnn. Police and school officials say the game preys on vulnerable youth, and some are fighting back by saturating #bluewhalechallenge hashtags with warnings. Per the sun chronicle, one school superintendent says parents should check out their kids'social media accounts for related hashtags or pics of blue whales, noting they need to be \" policing [ their kids ' online ] environment. \"",

        "summary": "The resignation of a northern california town's city clerk generally wouldn't garner much in the way of press, but the drama surrounding kim lehmkuhl's exit from her pleasant hill post is just a wee bit outside the norm. Lehmkuhl was elected to the position in 2012, but things have since grown frosty between the city official and the town, with the contra costa times reporting that the 34-year-old was accused of taking no minutes during city council meetings in her entire first year, and instead tweeting her way through them — under a city account, and in a very opinionated way, the city charged. Some residents called for her to step down ( she refused, and the san francisco chronicle notes that she did later produce minutes for some meetings ), and the council in march announced a november ballot item would seek to change the position to an appointed one, reports the ap. The moves, as it turns out, were unnecessary: lehmkuhl quit on monday, in fiery fashion, to take a job in washington, dc. In an email to the mayor and city manager, she wrote that \" this has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience i would not wish on anyone. I wish the city the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by council. \" she also wished the city manager \" best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal, that is going to be a rough one. \" but lehmkuhl wasn't the only one with blistering words.

Congressional leaders on wednesday clinched a two-year deal to lift strict budget caps on defense and domestic spending, likely putting an end to a series of short-term spending bills and shutdown fights that have defined washington the past few months. The deal is expected to increase defense and domestic spending by roughly $ 300 billion over two years, according to administration and congressional sources, as well as lift the debt ceiling through the election and include tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid. Story continued below \" this bill is the product of extensive negotiations among congressional leaders and the white house. No one thinks this bill is perfect. But we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the american people, \" senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) said in announcing the agreement. \" the budget deal doesn't have everything democrats want. It doesn't have everything the republicans want.

That's more than what many were hoping to hear: robert gates, ahead of his retirement at the end of the month, has called for a conservative withdrawal, and the pentagon favors withdrawing just 3,000 to 4,000 troops this year. The officials were careful to note that obama is still \" finalizing \" his decision, but expect him to announce that the us has made great strides in damaging al-qaeda's ability to attack the us, giving him the chance to begin bringing troops home. Budget woes and input from white house aides who favor a steep withdrawal were also factors, notes the lat. Removing all the surge troops would still leave 68,000 us troops in afghanistan, more than twice as many as when obama took office.

The wrench was that downey was one of about 190 ira suspects who get a letter from the british government in 2007 assuring them that they were no longer wanted by the law, reports the guardian. It was part of the good friday peace agreement. The police service of northern ireland now acknowledges that downey never should have received such a letter because he had an outstanding warrant at the time, reports the belfast telegraph. \" i wish to apologize to the families of the victims and survivors of the hyde park atrocity, \" says the psni's chief constable. \" i deeply regret these failings which should not have happened. \" the families, meanwhile, criticized the \" monumental blunder \" and said their \" torment will be ongoing. \"",
