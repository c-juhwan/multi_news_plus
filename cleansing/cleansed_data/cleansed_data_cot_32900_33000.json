Now beth keegstra, 57, the contracted physician who tended to the 20-year-old last week at el camino hospital in los gatos, calif., has been permanently taken out of the rotation of er doctors at all of the health system's locations, per a release. The mercury news reports bardwell was hospitalized monday after he had an anxiety attack during basketball practice at west valley college. His dad, donald bardwell, tells the san francisco chronicle that samuel has a history of anxiety attacks and takes klonopin, a benzodiazepine, to treat that, but that he'd been busy over the previous few days and hadn't had a chance to pick up his new prescription. The father and son say keegstra started right off the bat by accusing samuel of using drugs, and that's when the elder bardwell started taping video, which he uploaded to facebook. In the video, keegstra scoffs at donald bardwell's assertion that his son was drifting \" in and out of consciousness, \" and at one point she answers \" mm-hmm \" when samuel bardwell asks her, \" [ so ] i ' m full of s ---? \" samuel bardwell also mentions he can't breathe in, to which keegstra replies: \" he can't inhale, wow! he must be dead! are you dead, sir? \" in the release, the hospital apologized for \" a physician whose demeanor was unprofessional. \" donald bardwell doesn't think that's enough. \" in my mind, i don't think she should be practicing medicine at all, \" he told good morning america.

( the sun-times reports his preferred identifier was actually \" loud-mouthed irish priest, \" which is what he said he wanted on his gravestone. ) the sun-times joins a slew of other publications in remembering some of the many fascinating aspects of greeley. Among them: considering it called him a \" scold, \" who better than the times to explain greeley's \" exuberantly combative \" nature? he had harsh words for many of the church's bishops ( \" mitered birdbrains \" ). But he also took on \" secular intellectuals \" ( calling out their religious prejudice ) and \" reform-minded catholics \" ( who were swayed by fads ). The times notes that as early as 1989 he was advocating for those abused by pedophile priests. Greeley wrote more than 100 works of non-fiction on topics as diverse as irish history and jesus'relationships with women. He wasn't one to sugarcoat; the times cites one book \" titled with typical directness \": a stupid, unjust and criminal war: iraq 2001-2007. But he also churned out some 50 novels that earned him millions ( he donated much of his profits to charity, including the survivors network of those abused by priests ). The books did contain explicit sex, though typically performed by married couples. Mystery novel the cardinal sins stuck on the nyt best-sellers list for eight months.

        "summary": "The us supreme court kicks off its new term monday — one that bloomberg anticipates will be quite \" boring. \" but while most of the cases on its docket aren't huge headline-generators, the court is ramping back up in circumstances that haven't been seen for nearly 50 years, notes the los angeles times. Specifically, voters will basically fill the seat left by the late antonin scalia, as whomever they pick for president will fill that slot. The last time this happened: when an outgoing lbj tried to replace retiring chief justice earl warren but was filibustered out of his choice by the senate, leading richard nixon to appoint conservative warren burger instead in 1969. If trump wins next month, the court would shift again to a conservative 5-4 majority, but if clinton wins, the dems would wrest back control for the first time since nixon's appointment. Four upcoming cases worth mentioning, per the ap: a church-state separation case in which a missouri church is fighting being left out of a state program that awards grants for the installation of rubber playground surfaces. A man's us citizenship claims ( and battle against deportation ) based on the fact that his mother is american, even though his father isn't and he was born outside the us himself. Two texas death penalty appeals, including that of african-american inmate duane buck, who says his own lawyers messed up his case by calling an expert witness who testified black people were more likely to be violent. Meanwhile, prisoner bobby moore says he shouldn't be put to death because he's intellectually disabled. A dispute that could also affect the washington redskins: asian-american band the slants fighting for trademark protection, initially denied by the feds because the band's name was deemed offensive. A transgender teen's case may also appear before the high court.",

Ralls corp's proposed wind farm next to a naval testing facility in oregon is the first deal to be blocked by a president in 22 years, and the company's lawsuit accuses the us government of overstepping its authority, the bbc reports. Obama was following the recommendation of the committee on foreign investment in the us, a government panel that scrutinizes the national security implications of foreign investments. Most deals the cfius scrutinizes are withdrawn or changed long before they reach the president's desk. The ralls corp lawsuit, which accuses the president and the cfius of acting in an \" unlawful and unauthorized manner, \" is \" a little bit of a hail mary, \" a trade lawyer tells the wall street journal. \" it's going to be interesting to see if there's a court that would take the view that the president's decision on something related to national security is something that ought to be second-guessed. \"",

While archaeologists are still working to establish whether man or, perhaps, glacier carried them to wiltshire, the royal college of art researchers suggest the rocks were intentionally brought to stonehenge because of their \" unique acoustic properties. \" as part of a larger study of the acoustic elements of the pembrokeshire landscape where the bluestones hail from, it was discovered that many of the rocks in the area issue a metallic sound ( akin to a bell or gong ) where hit with a hammerstone. In fact, the study notes that one preseli village used bluestones as its church bells through the 1700s. The bbc reports that the researchers tested thousands of rocks, and that a high percentage rang \" just like a bell, \" says a lead researcher. \" and there's lots of different tones, you could play a tune, \" he adds. In july, the team was granted permission to acoustically test stonehenge's bluestones, and found that a number of them did indeed return a sound, though a slightly muted one, perhaps in part because some of the rocks have been shored up using concrete. They also saw indications that some of the bluestones featured what could be strike marks; more study is needed on that front. ( click for more on the mysteries of stonehenge's bluestones. )",

The last endemic cases reported in the americas were in argentina and brazil in 2009 and health chiefs now say that in a \" historic achievement, \" the americas are the first region in the world that can be declared free of the virus, reports the bbc. \" although it has taken some 15 years, the fight against rubella has paid off, \" the director of the pan american health organization tells the times. \" now, with rubella under our belt, we need to roll up our sleeves and finish the job of eliminating measles as well. \" she says the eradication shows \" how important it is to make vaccines available even to the remotest corners of our hemisphere. \" health authorities aim to make europe the next rubella-free region by the end of this year, and hope to make the disease extinct worldwide by 2020, the huffington post reports. ( smallpox is the only infectious human disease to have been completely wiped out, but the deadly cattle virus rinderpest was eradicated in 2010. )",

It's not that janet yellen is mysterious by nature. She's a regular person from brooklyn. She has an open face and a warm smile and, as her predecessor ben bernanke told me recently, \"more of the common touch than i did. \" she also has a decade-long pedigree serving in various jobs at the u.s. Federal reserve. ( \"if you were dreaming up a training school for fed chairmen, it would be her life story, \" her old colleague, alan blinder, once joked. ) yet there are so many unknowns about where yellen is taking the newly empowered fed that she's making alan greenspan look plain-spoken by comparison.

It's the sort of thing you don't hear about at the confirmation hearings, and yet it is often this grand passion — suddenly given voice in the world's bulliest economic pulpit — that shapes the nation's future in unexpected ways. Alan greenspan, the erstwhile \" maestro \" of the fed, wanted to turn finance into the kind of laissez-faire market that his mentor ayn rand, the uber-libertarian author, had always envisioned.

When ben bernanke took over greenspan's job, he appeared to be just another conservative economist in the mold of his predecessor ( who had endorsed him ). But his great passion was using his life's work as a scholar of the great depression to stop another one.",

In a times square hotel ballroom, yellen, a small woman with a helmet of white hair, sat on a three-tier dais, looking out over a hundred tables of paying guests. She was visually amplified by two jumbotron screens, and read scripted remarks about her \"expectation that the achievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for some time. \" it's one of the institution's central rituals for the chair to drop deliberately bland hints about the future direction of interest rates, and for the markets instantly to respond, as if on command of an omnipotent genie.

        "summary": "A bipartisan effort to advance the keystone xl pipeline bill picked up steam just a few hours after congress got back from an extended break yesterday. The house is expected to vote on the measure sometime today, and the bill would then head to the senate early next week, reports reuters. The $ 8 billion project would then end up on the president's desk for approval. Behind the sudden movement: louisiana sen. Mary landrieu, who's clinging to her political life. She and republican sen. John hoeven introduced the bill together in may, but senate democrats dropped opposition to keystone in hopes of giving her a lift in her dec. 6 runoff against rep. Bill cassidy in her \" energy-rich \" state, npr reports. Landrieu even agreed to submit a version of her measure with cassidy's name on it just to get it in the works, politico adds. If keystone does get to obama, he may need to dust off his veto pen, which he's used precious little thus far in his tenure; experts predict more vetoes to come with a republican-controlled congress, roll call reports. With regard to keystone, the president's predilection seems apparent: a white house spokesman traveling with obama in asia told reporters, via reuters, \" the administration has taken a dim view of these kinds of legislative proposals in the past. It's fair to say that our dim view of these kinds of proposals has not changed. \" as for landrieu, even if her proposal doesn't pass, louisiana voters will recognize her efforts. \" they ' ll know back home that she's trying, \" a former louisiana senator tells politico.",

        "summary": "It's been the subject of a half-century-long debate. But thanks to a new mapping technique, mountain experts have identified the tallest mountain in the us arctic and uncovered a bit of a surprise as well. Using fodar, a technique he invented to map terrain using airborne photography, glaciologist matt nolan created a high-resolution topographic map of the brooks range in alaska, which reveals mount isto to be the tallest mountain in the us arctic, standing 8,975 feet tall, reports live science. But though scientists have long thought that mount chamberlin, located about 30 miles away, was isto's biggest competition, nolan says it actually falls short of another peak. At 8,914 feet, mount hubley stands about 16 feet taller than chamberlin, he explains in cryosphere. Nolan was actually using fodar to observe glacier volume change when he realized he was flying over the highest mountains in the us arctic — only scientists couldn't decide which should wear the crown. That's when nolan decided to put his technology to the test to find out. As he flew over the brooks range in a cessna 170b equipped with a dslr camera linked to a gps unit, skier and mountaineer kit deslauriers climbed up and skied down the mountains with her own gps unit, allowing the pair to chart elevations from the air and ground simultaneously to provide a \" measure of accuracy. \" the resulting maps are accurate to about 8 inches, according to a release. Nolan notes his technology is much like lidar but costs $ 30,000 rather than $ 500,000 and can measure coastal erosion, glacier melt, and landslides. \" the possibilities are truly unlimited, \" he says.

It denies vapors are present at dangerous levels where workers are and says it's looking into new safety measures.

Hours after the downgrade, the government announced a $ 100 billion credit facility to help the japanese economy ride out a spike in the yen in recent weeks amid the global market turmoil, which has battered japan's export-led economy. \"taking into account that there is a lopsided rise in the yen, i felt that swift measures were needed, \" yoshihiko noda, the finance minister, told reporters. Moody's investors service lowered japan's grade by one step to aa3, the fourth-highest rating, the company said in a statement. The downgrade brings moody's rating for japan in line with standard &amp; poor's, which lowered the country's grade by one notch to aa-minus in january, the fourth highest on its scale. Moody's had put japan on review for a downgrade in may.

        "summary": "Two weeks ago, ethan couch was moved from a juvenile facility to an adult jail. Now the \" affluenza \" teen will move into the grown-up leagues in yet another way: a texas judge decided friday to transfer couch's case from juvenile to adult court when he turns 19 on april 11, reports the dallas morning news. The transfer will take hold at midnight on his birthday, and a new judge assigned to him will rejigger the terms of his probation. Couch could be ordered to serve 120 days in jail and then complete his 10 year-probation, reports ap. If he violates the new conditions, he could receive up to 10 years in jail for each crash victim; four people died in the drunk-driving crash he caused in 2013. Couch, who was sentenced to probation in 2014, would have simply run out his time in the juvenile system when he turned 19 if the judge hadn't moved the case, cbs dallas notes. Couch will now serve out the time until his birthday in tarrant county jail, where he's currently being kept in isolation. This time the probation conditions will likely be more rigid, based on his jaunt to mexico with his mom, and may include a gps ankle bracelet and at-home alcohol testing. Not that everyone thinks couch will adhere to the new conditions: a prosecutor last month said the \" goal is to put him into the adult system and wait for him to do what i believe he will do, at which time we will seek to revoke him, \" per cbs. A texas lawyer experienced in vehicular manslaughter cases adds, \" if he messes up even one of these conditions, i doubt the judge will have much sympathy for him. \"",

The paris prosecutor's office confirmed today that the moroccan suspect in the foiled attack on a high-speed train was hit with terrorism charges overnight. Paris prosecutor francois molins has said el-khazzani, 26, watched a jihadi video on his cellphone moments before the attack and that — although he claimed to be homeless — he used a first-class ticket. Molins said the suspect's explanations became increasingly incoherent until he stopped speaking altogether to investigators. Among the terrorism charges he faces are multiple counts of attempted murder, possession of weapons, and conspiracy. Meanwhile, an american hero is back on us soil. Sacramento state student anthony sadler, who helped subdue el-khazzani, arrived in sacramento around 7pm last night. While the sacramento bee reports that he didn't speak to media, kcra notes sadler hasn't entirely avoided the spotlight: he hit the red carpet in paris on monday for the straight outta compton premiere.

Approximately 75,000 refugees arrived in europe during the first six weeks of 2016; that's 25 times more than during the same period in 2015. Europe was supposed to use the winter to prepare for the new wave of refugees. Instead, its plans started falling apart. According to the guardian, countries that were once pro-refugee are starting to tighten up their borders. And a group of eastern european countries is formulating a plan to seal up their borders to trap refugees in greece, which the greek government states will lead to a \" security and humanitarian emergency within days. \" the arrival of this year's refugees could cause even more \" disorder and political disruption \" — as the post puts it — than in 2015 while dooming the era of borderless travel in europe. Refugee sorting locations in greece have failed to open and the system to distribute refugees isn't working, among other problems. Meanwhile, an eu document released by wikileaks highlights military operations to stop smugglers bringing refugees into europe and calls for the eu to push for a \" reliable \" government in libya to help with the crisis, rt reports. But one migration expert says whatever happens in europe this spring is largely a result of its own political infighting. \"it's a crisis of europe's own making, \" she tells the post. \"if lebanon and jordan can manage it, why can't the richest region in the world? it's politics. \"",

        "summary": "Amazon held a massive nationwide job fair wednesday, which is a good thing since retail companies are blaming the internet giant for forcing them to close thousands of stores and lay off employees. On its first-ever jobs day, amazon aimed to hire 50,000 workers to fill positions at 12 warehouses in a single four-hour period, nbc news reports. According to fortune, thousands of hopeful applicants lined up outside amazon warehouses in new york, maryland, tennessee, ohio, kentucky, wisconsin, and more with the hopes of being offered a job on the spot. Some complained about the pay at their current jobs, while others touted the benefits package available to amazon's warehouse workers. Amazon was hiring for positions that pay between $ 11.50 and $ 13.75 an hour. But not everyone was excited about jobs day. Mashable calls it \" corporate propaganda \" and \" bleak as hell. \" yes, amazon is offering decent jobs, but there was no reason to force applicants to get up at the crack of dawn to stand in line for hours just so amazon could hire 50,000 people in a single day. No reason, that is, except good press — a chance for the company to show off its power in a positive light. \" on jobs day, amazon is delivering feels, \" mashable states.",

That was the conclusion offered tuesday by a national transportation safety board investigation into the incident. Engineer brandon bostian had heard 24 radio messages in six minutes about another train being hit by a rock nearby. He was busy thinking about that possible emergency and lost track of where he was on the track. He accelerated to 106mph into a curve with a 50mph speed limit. An investigator tells the ap the acceleration makes sense if bostian thought he had already passed that curve. \" it is a world in which the engineer relies in part on the memorized details of the route, and a world in which a loss of awareness can take a terrible toll, \" the ntsb chairman tells the inquirer. Bostian, who was suspended without pay, had a \" sterling work record \" prior to the crash, nbc news reports. \" this was a standard human error, \" an investigator says. [ engineers ] have no more of the right stuff than pilots or anyone else. \" the ntsb also put some of the blame on the rail industry for being slow to implement equipment that automatically slows speeding trains.

        "summary": "Death is more like the slow shutdown of a computer than the flipping off of a light switch, says a scientist, explaining a new study that shows genes in the body remain alive for about two days after the heart stops. In the study of mice and zebrafish, university of washington researchers found that gene activity generally decreased after death, as would be expected, per new scientist. But 548 zebrafish genes and 515 mouse genes showed peak levels of messenger rna — which genes use to communicate with cells — up to 48 hours after death in what researchers termed the \" twilight of death. \" in other words, \" not all cells are'dead ' when an organism dies, \" study author peter noble tells seeker. He believes the same thing occurs in humans, too. The activated genes were associated with fetal development, stress, immunity, inflammation, and cancer, says noble, who suggests the cells may be \" attempting to repair themselves \" just as if the body were alive. It's also possible that they're activated simply because the genes that normally suppress them do turn off after death. Researchers note that a similar activation of cancer genes may explain why organ transplant recipients are more prone to get cancer, though more research is needed to determine possible strategies to rectify this, per a release. Researchers say a measurement of mrna in the body after death may also result in more precise times of death, possibly down to the minute. ( scientists are working to reverse death. )",

Ernest lee johnson, 55, was sentenced to death for killing three convenience store workers with a claw hammer during a 1994 robbery, but lawyers argue that a lethal injection drug could cause painful seizures because of a brain tumor and a hole in his head, the ap reports. Surgery in 2008 left johnson with the hole in his skull and removed a large portion of brain, but it left part of the tumor behind. His lawyers say the \" severely painful \" execution with a dose of pentobarbital would constitute cruel and unusual punishment, nbc news reports. The supreme court told the 8th us circuit court of appeals to reconsider its decision not to stay the execution because johnson did not prove he would suffer pain and failed to offer an alternative execution method, reports the columbia daily tribune. His death warrant expires at 6pm wednesday, and a missouri department of corrections official says there is \" no indication of any kind that this is going to be resolved \" before then, the ap reports. After his conviction, testing found that johnson had an iq of 67, and a separate appeal before missouri's supreme court argues that he is mentally disabled and it would be unconstitutional to execute him, the tribune reports.

( missouri... ( associated press ) death row inmate ernest lee johnson, 55, claims in his appeal that the execution drug could cause painful seizures because he still has part of a benign tumor in his brain, and surgery to remove the rest of the tumor in 2008 forced removal of up to 20 percent of his brain tissue. Johnson, who was convicted of beating three people to death with a claw hammer, had been scheduled to die at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the missouri state prison in bonne terre. But the supreme court granted a stay while the 8th u.s. Circuit court of appeals considers whether his complaint was properly dismissed. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the appeals court might rule, but mike o ' connell, a spokesman for the missouri department of corrections sent media witnesses home for the night. \" there is no indication of any kind that this is going to be resolved tomorrow, \" o ' connell said.

            "St. Louis ( ap ) — the u.s. Supreme court on tuesday put on hold the scheduled execution of a missouri man at the last minute, sending the case back to an appeals court for further review. This photo provided by the missouri department of corrections shows ernest johnson. Johnson was convicted of killing three columbia, mo., convenience store workers with a claw hammer in 1994. ( missouri... ( associated press ) death row inmate ernest lee johnson, 55, claims in his appeal that the execution drug could cause painful seizures because he still has part of a benign tumor in his brain, and surgery to remove the rest of the tumor in 2008 forced removal of up to 20 percent of his brain tissue. Johnson, who was convicted of beating three people to death with a claw hammer, had been scheduled to die at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the missouri state prison in bonne terre. But the supreme court granted a stay while the 8th u.s. Circuit court of appeals considers whether his complaint was properly dismissed. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the appeals court might rule, but mike o ' connell, a spokesman for the missouri department of corrections sent media witnesses home for the night. \" there is no indication of any kind that this is going to be resolved tomorrow, \" o ' connell said. In missouri, the state has 24 hours — in this case, until 6 p.m. Wednesday — to fulfill the execution warrant or the execution has to be rescheduled. A second appeal, to the missouri supreme court, claims johnson's life should be spared because he is mentally disabled. The missouri attorney general's office says both claims are without merit. Johnson was convicted of three counts of first-degree",

( stop here if you don't want spoilers. ) the show's end introduces us to her newborn, grover, who she's struggling to breastfeed and to whom she lobs some classic hannah lines ( \" you think you're the first man who's rejected this? well, think again! \" ). And yet what it gave us was, in the eyes of critics, somewhat unexpected. Some takes: the final scene — a literal manifestation of the episode's title, \" latching \" — \" may or may not be the closing statement you wanted from girls, \" writes james poniewozik for the new york times. But he for one seems pleased: with the episode's humor, with lena dunham's \" remarkable \" growth as an actor, with the pacing with which the series wrapped up loose ends. \" hannah has become an author, become a teacher, become a parent. But she also — like all of us — will never stop becoming.... You triumph and screw up, you succeed and backslide. You walk on, pantless and unbowed, \" he writes. An odd closing statement it was, notes willa paskin at slate, calling it \" a just-okay episode lacking all the typical trappings of a finale. \" but that's ok. The last scene for her was \" a baby step forward. It's a testament to all the ( better ) episodes of this excellent, trying, fascinating show that in the next episode, which we ' ll never get to see, we still know exactly what happens: hannah inevitably takes a step back. \" the main elements of the episode — hannah, her baby, being upstate — were what joshua alston was anticipating, but he was \" initially underwhelmed \" all the same, he writes at the av club. He calls it a \" bold ending \" that feels more like a season finale, \" like a complete thought with an ellipsis at the end. \" but it ends on a memorable note. \" what [ dunham ] does with her face in the final few seconds is astonishing. \" writing for vulture, kathryn vanarendonk has a few quibbles, but like many other critics, sees nice literal and figurative ties between how the series ended and how it began, and what it's been about all along: \" whether hannah could detach....

Per cnn, the study out of the university of north carolina at chapel hill found that one factor tied to higher risk for the disease is having had a child within the last decade, with the greatest potential increase seen in women who've given birth in the last five years. Researchers on the study were careful to say that the increase in risk is very minimal. Per medical xpress, what the research also appears to show is that -- while childbirth may lead to greater cancer risk in the short term -- having had a child actually becomes a protective factor against a woman's chances of developing the disease years down the road. At about 23 years after having a child, a woman's chances of developing breast cancer appear to decrease. ( meanwhile, more pharmaceutical drugs are being recalled over potential cancer risk. )",

The players are being questioned about stealing from a louis vuitton store that is located next to the team's hotel in hangzhou, where the bruins had been staying before moving on to shanghai on wednesday. A source tells espn the three players are not currently with the team in shanghai, where ucla was scheduled to practice wednesday. \" we are aware of a situation involving ucla student-athletes in hangzhou, china, \" ucla said in a statement. \" the university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time. \" pac-12 commissioner larry scott said the conference was directing specifics about what transpired to ucla. \" we are very disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about, \" scott said. \" whether in the united states or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation. \" lavar ball; his wife, tina; and lamelo ball were having breakfast with the ucla team in shanghai on wednesday morning. Lavar was expected to address the media from his hotel suite wednesday morning in shanghai, but he said he was advised by counsel not to speak \" due to the legal nature of the matter. \" as he was leaving the hotel later wednesday, lavar said: \" i ' m going to wait until i get some more intel on what's going on, and then i can tell you what's up. \" asked if he was worried"

        "summary": "America is waking up to the first federal shutdown since the mid- ' 90s, and the more familiar sight of democrats and republicans squabbling. Both sides blame each other for the shutdown — with the dems accusing the gop of \" extortion \" to delay obamacare and the republicans accusing their counterparts of refusing to negotiate — but the public believes the gop is most at fault, according to a washington post poll. Just 26 % approve of how the congressional gop is handling the situation, the poll found, while 34 % support democratic lawmakers and 41 % approve of president obama's approach. Nancy pelosi, saying that the fight was much bigger than obamacare, called john boehner and his allies \" anti-government ideologues \" of the kind george washington himself had warned of, politico reports. \" this is a proxy fight for really the debate on the extent of government and that has been a debate in the history of our country, \" she said. \" but to say no government, that's what president washington cautioned against. \" republicans blamed the shutdown on democrats for failing to negotiate, with sen. John cornyn accusing obama of being \" absolutely allergic \" to doing his job. \" we know the president has been eager to negotiate with the president of iran about a very serious issue, iran's nuclear aspirations, but he won't talk to the speaker of the house of representatives or the republican leader of the us senate, \" the texas republican said. But with some republicans, including maine sen. Susan collins, publicly disagreeing with the gop's strategy, insiders say the white house sees little reason to give ground to the gop. \" this is republican-on-republican violence right now, \" a former senior administration official tells the hill. \" this has absolutely nothing to do with democrats or the president. So all obama has to do now is sit back. \" the blame for the shutdown, however, can be spread a lot further than today's lawmakers, the ap finds in a look at the history of government shutdowns. On the way to today's mess, there was carter-era ag benjamin civiletti, who ended the long-running \" look the other way \" policy for short-lived budget disputes; newt gingrich, whose \" hissy fit \" over being told to use the back door of air force one set the tone for the 1995- ' 96 government shutdown; and the founding fathers themselves, who gave congress control over government spending.",

        "summary": "Scientists have long cautioned that stress is bad for the heart, and a new study provides insight into precisely why. In the lancet, researchers lay out a chain of events: when people feel stress, the amygdala area of the brain — it processes emotions such as fear and danger — fires up with extra activity to help them cope. The problem is that the amygdala sends a signal to bone marrow to generate more white blood cells, and those blood cells in turn cause arteries to become inflamed, explains the bbc. That inflammation can then result in heart attacks and strokes. Researchers based their findings on two studies, the larger of which tracked nearly 300 people for about four years. The pattern seemed clear: those with higher amygdala activity were more likely to develop heart disease of some kind. \" while the link between stress and heart disease has long been established, the mechanism mediating that risk has not been clearly understood, \" says study leader ahmed tawakol of massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school, per live science. A link between stress and higher activity in bone marrow and arteries had previously only been recorded in animals, but the new research suggests it applies to humans as well, reports reuters. The takeaway: \" reducing stress could produce benefits that extend beyond an improved sense of psychological wellbeing, \" says tawakol. Those at increased risk of heart disease should look into stress-reduction techniques, he adds. ( almost half of all heart attacks are silent. )",

Law, a former beautician and mother of two, had sent her back to the country in january 2014 in a diaper, because she was too frail to use a toilet, and wearing several layers of clothing and makeup to hide her thin body and bruises. A taxi driver who took the pair to the airport testified that he smelled urine and feces, the times notes. The maid testified law also broke two of her teeth, forced a vacuum cleaner tube in her mouth, beat her with a mop, and threatened to kill her family, afp and reuters report. Law \" showed no compassion \" and saw her domestic staff as \" people that are beneath her, \" said the judge, who called for an investigation into domestic worker employment agencies, which charge workers \" significant fees \" that they must work to pay. She also criticized a law requiring workers to live with their employers. Though law faced a maximum seven years in jail, erwiana slammed law's sentence as \" light. \" some 300,000 women, largely from indonesia and the philippines, work as domestic servants in hong kong, where they earn far less than minimum wage.",

        "summary": "New york university medical school research into using a marijuana-like drug to treat ptsd sufferers turned out to be so flawed that eight studies were suspended and the data was rejected as unreliable, the new york times reports. Federal investigators found that the research led by dr. Alexander neumeister failed to carry out the follow-ups that would be expected in any study, let alone one involving dozens of subjects with mental disorders. Dr. Charles marmar, chief of nyu's psychiatry department, says neumeister was suspended after fellow researchers raised their concerns. Neumeister, who has now resigned, was also accused of violations such as signing a fellow researcher's name instead of his own on reports. The study was an attempt to follow up earlier research that suggested marijuana relieved anxiety in people with ptsd. \" i think their intent was good, and they were considerate to me, \" test subject diane ruffcorn, who says she has ptsd from being abused as a child, tells the times. \" but what concerned me, i was given this drug, and all these tests, and then it was goodbye, i was on my own. There was no follow-up. \" ruffcorn, who documented the trial in her blog, a little bent, says she had to stop and restart her existing medication several times after the study had false starts — and after experiencing some strange symptoms, she was relieved to discover she had been in the placebo group.

        "summary": "North korea has put china in a difficult spot with its latest nuclear test. And that spot will only get more difficult if radioactive contamination suddenly turns up in china. The wall street journal reports china is stepping up its radiation monitoring in the wake of last weekend's north korean nuclear test, which was staged less than 50 miles from china's border. More than 100 million people live in the three chinese provinces closest to north korea, and china is worried that nuclear fallout could lead to massive public outcry and force it to take a tougher stance against north korea. China has stepped up radiation monitoring to emergency levels and will continue to test the soil, air, and water. No radiation has so far been detected from north korea's underground nuclear test, its largest ever. Meanwhile, chinese president xi jinping told president trump over the phone wednesday that the solution to the north korean nuclear crisis must lie in peaceful talks, reuters reports. However, north korea's repeated nuclear tests may be weakening china's position on that. \" obviously, it is an insult to china, \" an international politics professor in china tells nbc news regarding the latest nuclear test. Experts say china is frustrated and embarrassed that north korea's nuclear tests are forcing it into conflict with the us and making people question its ability to control north korea.

The problem wasn't with lockett's veins — in fact, they were found to be healthy — but instead with the medical team trying to insert an iv line. After repeated failed attempts to insert it into his arms, legs, and feet, a supervising doctor ordered the line to be placed in his femoral vein, located in the groin. That's a tricky procedure requiring \" serious medical expertise, \" explains mother jones, and it seems the team didn't pull it off correctly. The autopsy suggests that the catheter punctured the vein and never adequately delivered the drugs.

            "Rome &#124; rome ( reuters ) - if tourists find rome unusually quiet next wednesday, the reason will probably be that thousands of locals have left town in fear of a devastating earthquake allegedly forecast for that day by a long-dead seismologist. For months italian internet sites, blogs and social networks have been debating the work of raffaele bendandi, who claimed to have forecast numerous earthquakes and, according to internet rumors, predicted a \" big one \" in rome on may 11. The national television network rai has run programs aimed at calming rising panic among romans. The civil protection agency has issued statements reiterating the official scientific view that earthquakes can't be predicted. Yet many residents of the eternal city aren't listening. \" i ' m going to tell the boss i've got a medical appointment and take the day off, \" barman fabio mengarelli told reuters. \""

Though italy had one of the lowest rates of organ donation in western europe at the time, nicholas green's parents opted to donate his organs. It was a life-saving decision for pedala and six others, including 15-year-old andrea mongiardo, who received nicholas ' heart. But it had an effect on many more. Nicholas ' parents campaigned hard for organ donation in the years that followed, showing good could come out of tragedy, reports the bbc. Their efforts, says reg green, had a \" quite astonishing effect which we couldn't possibly have foreseen. \" in a little over a decade, italy's organ donation rate more than tripled. Though the country adopted an opt-out rather than an opt-in system for organ donation in 1999, officials also credit the \" nicholas effect. \" as green notes, other countries use opt-in systems but \" no other country has tripled organ donation. \" green, 88, continues to raise awareness about organ donation to this day, traveling to italy twice a year. During his most recent visit, he met with pedala, who has since given birth to a son named nicholas. He was unable to meet mongiardo, who died earlier this year of respiratory failure related to chemotherapy treatment for lymphoma, green writes at the los angeles times.

He complimented trump on his handing of foreign policy, but added: \"everything else he's done has been a complete disaster.

Video available via wis tv shows a woman apparently tampering with food in a refrigerator. According to police, that's hayley king, a 22-year-old who had had \" multiple altercations \" with her two roommates not long before the feb. 4 video was recorded on a hidden camera; those altercations aren't detailed in the police report. But authorities say she not only spat in the containers but also put glass cleaner in one container, abc news reports. One roommate told officers she'd eaten some of the tainted food. King admitted to the actions in a recorded interview, per the police report. King has been charged with unlawful malicious tampering with human drug product or food ( a felony ) and faces up to 20 years in prison. Her roommates — also university of south carolina students, the huffington post reports — said she rejected their attempts to get her to move out following disagreements. The feuds got them worried about what king might do, so they decided to record her, they told police. Wis tv notes that one roommate also got a text, apparently from a friend of king's, saying the roommates had been \" taunting ( king ) since the semester started \" and if they didn't stop, the texter would \" personally come and check you. \" king is due back in court next month, abc reports.

The case occurred in hong kong, where a 56-year-old man living in public housing contracted the disease, the south china morning post reports. It's a \" wake-up call, \" said yuen kwok-yung, a microbiologist at hong kong university, during a press conference. \" we don't know if in the future there will be a serious outbreak of the rat hepatitis e virus in hong kong. We need to closely monitor this issue. \" now health officials are calling for stepped-up rodent control, and that means cleaning up the streets and alleys which, per yuen, \" are very dirty with lots of rubbish. You can see rats that are bigger than cats. \" he said that public cleanliness improved after the sars outbreak in 2003, but has since gone downhill again. Doctors say the patient who contracted the so-called rat hepatitis is now cured, cnn reports. He had the disease after having a liver transplant last year. Still showing signs of abnormal liver function — doctors had ruled out infection from blood or liver donors — the man was tested for the human form of hepatitis e. Those tests were negative, prompting doctors to perform genetic sequencing of the virus, leading to the determination that it was the form of hepatitis that is present in rats. Researchers think the man may have been infected after eating food contaminated with rat droppings or by possibly being bitten by a rat. The rat hepatitis e virus, discovered in germany in 2010, has been found in rodents throughout the world, including the us, per the new york times.",

Their announcement made international headlines and brought an influx of treasure hunters to the area. But since then no scientific evidence the train even exists has ever been produced, according to afp. Geologists studying the area last december said they were \" 100 % sure \" there was no buried train, though a tunnel was a possibility. That's good enough for andrzej gaik, spokesperson for the new hunt: \" that ' ll also be a success. The train could be hidden in it. \" the hunt, led by koper and richter, is scheduled to start monday with a geo-radar sweep. The digging of three 18-foot holes will follow on tuesday, and \" it should all be clear [ as to whether the train is there ] by thursday, \" says gaik. Dpa reports the armored train was supposedly used by the nazis in an attempt to smuggle valuables out of poland as the soviet army arrived. It's rumored to contain jewels, gold, and art, though koper and richter suspect it mostly holds weapons.

Permanent settlements, however, didn't show up in the harsh higher altitudes until 3,600 years ago. What happened that allowed ancient settlers to survive in a region nicknamed the \" roof of the world \"? they discovered barley, reports science. Analysis of charred seeds suggests that humans figured out around that time that barley could be grown at 11,000 feet — unlike their previous staple of millet, reports the washington post. \" as barley is frost-hardy and cold-tolerant, it grows very well on the tibetan plateau even today, \" archaeologist dongju zhang of china's lanzhou university tells reuters. \" therefore, barley agriculture could provide people enough — and sustained — food supplies even during wintertime. \" the discovery was probably a \" lucky accident, \" say the researchers, given that barely had been first domesticated in a different part of asia. Scientists think that tibetans had acquired genes to survive in high altitudes tens of thousands of years ago, but they still needed to a crop to make that survival possible — and barley did the trick.

In the video, which first appeared on andrew breitbart's big government, shirley sherrod, the director of rural development for georgia, is seen speaking before an naacp rally. She says she'd decided not to give a white farmer \"the full force of what i could do to help him. \" the video quickly appeared on fox news, and sherrod resigned yesterday. But she tells cnn the comments were taken out of context. In the video, she explains that she took the farmer to a white lawyer, assuming \"his own kind would take care of him. \" but the lawyer didn't help, sherrod tells cnn, and the moral of the story was that \"the issue is not about race. It's about those who have versus those who don't. \" she says she wound up befriending the farmer.",

Sherrod made the remarks captured in the first video featured in this post while she held a federally appointed position, the story she tells refers to actions she took before she held that federal position. *** context is everything. In this piece you will see video evidence of racism coming from a federal appointee and naacp award recipient and in another clip from the same event a perfect rationalization for why the tea party needs to exist. But first the context: for the past week, americans who consider themselves aligned with the tea party movement have suffered the indignity of being falsely labeled racist by the naacp and their pro-bono publicity managers, the main stream media. The constant calls to \"repudiate the racists from your ranks \" have not only been insulting, but have also served to force a false standard upon america's fastest-growing and most vibrant political movement that no other group could ever live up to nor would ever be asked to live up to. While the media has chosen to do the democratic party's bidding in allowing for the naacp to negatively and falsely brand the millions strong, loosely affiliated tea party phenomenon as \"racist \", the moral indignation over race and racism has taken center stage in a summer of economic and political discontent. The naacp, an undeniable weapon in the democratic party '",

        "summary": "A man in sweden has been acquitted on charges of \" child rape \" because the girl's body was considered too \" well-developed \" for a 13-year-old, the daily beast reports. The 27-year-old man, whose name was withheld, saw the charges tossed out of court when officials decided the girl was so curvy that he \" could not have known \" her real age. Two courts — a district court and sweden's court of appeal — threw out the case after seeing video of the girl talking to police officers, the local reports. It's considered \" child rape \" in sweden to have sex with someone younger than 15, but such charges depend on the defendant reasonably knowing that the sex partner is underage. The girl had apparently fled her foster home for västerås, just outside stockholm, without money or a place to stay, when she met the man at a playground. She accepted his invitation for a drink, she says, because she was thirsty and hungry. The man initially denied having sex with her until his semen was discovered in her underwear. Now the girl's attorney says they plan to take the case to sweden's supreme court, in the hope of setting a new benchmark case in their favor. Similar cases have cropped up elsewhere, including a 16-year-old london girl accused by a judge of \" grooming \" an older, male teacher for sex, and a 14-year-old girl dismissed by a montana judge as \" older than her chronological age \" after having sex with a 47-year-old teacher.

        "summary": "Michael flynn stepped down monday night after just 24 days as president trump's national security adviser — and it's surprising he lasted that long, sources tell the washington post. The sources say officials, including former acting attorney general sally yates, notified the trump team late last month that flynn had misled mike pence and others about his pre-inauguration talks with the russian ambassador to the us and warned that he could be vulnerable to blackmail. The sources say fbi agents uncovered evidence of \" highly significant \" and \" potentially illegal \" communication on sanctions following an investigation launched after vladimir putin's surprise decision not to retaliate for us sanctions. In other coverage: flynn was fiercely defended tuesday by lawmakers — in moscow. Konstantin kosachev, chair of the foreign affairs committee in the upper chamber of the russian parliament, said getting rid of flynn over russia contacts was \" not just paranoia but something even worse, \" the ap reports. He said trump had either been \" driven into a corner \" or was running an administration riddled with \" russophobia. \" leonid slutsky, kosachev's counterpart in the lower chamber, claimed flynn had been forced to resign as part of a campaign to damage us-russia ties, reports reuters. The new york times has a detailed timeline of flynn's troubled tenure as national security adviser, which was by far the shortest since the position was created in 1953. Politico reports on flynn's final days in the white house. Sources say aides urged trump to fire flynn when it became clear that he had lied to pence about his contacts with the ambassador, though trump was struggling with the decision because he highly valued flynn for his loyalty. The ranking democrats on the house judicial and oversight committees have called for a full investigation, saying they were \" shocked and dismayed \" to discover the white house learned weeks ago that \" general flynn had provided false information to the public about his communications with the russian government, but that the trump administration apparently did nothing about it, \" the hill reports. They said congress \" needs to know who else within the white house is a current and ongoing risk to our national security. \" cnn profiles the three men seen as most likely to replace flynn. They are retired lt. Gen. Keith kellogg, who's now acting national security adviser, retired gen. David petraeus, and former vice adm. Bob harward. Flynn's resignation letter can be seen in full here. He apologizes for \" inadvertently \" providing pence and others with \" incomplete information, \" thanks trump for his loyalty, and predicts that his team will \" go down in history",
