        "summary": "The grieving parents of 15-year-old reid comita say he died after going on a hike the boy scouts should never have sent him on. The texas teenager died from heat stroke in june while on an \" intro to backpacking \" course that would have been his final task to become an eagle scout. \" the boy scouts of america are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple, \" father john comita tells wfaa. Reid's parents are suing boy scouts of america, accusing them of being negligent by sending the boy on an \" extremely aggressive hike \" through rugged terrain in southwest texas on a day when temperatures were around 100 degrees. \" he wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike, \" the father says. John comita says the family signed reid up for the course — which was supposed to include two days of training followed by a three-day hike — because they thought it was the safest option, but he was immediately sent on the hike, reports the fort worth star-telegram. The lawsuit also faults the boy scouts for sending reid on a hike with two other teenagers, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, instead of the two adults that regulations require. Boy scouts of america, which awarded reid the rank of eagle scout after his death, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the \" health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance, \" the washington post reports. ( this woman got sick on a hike and was dead 9 hours later. )",

( photo: wfaa ) dallas -- a recently filed lawsuit in dallas county district court blames negligence on behalf of the boy scouts of america for the death of a fort worth teen three months ago. Reid comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at buffalo trail scout ranch in june. \" the boy scouts of america are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple. They are responsible, \" john comita told wfaa in a sit-down interview. The new lawsuit outlines a series of allegations surrounding reid's death, namely that he was \"...

The comita family had specifically signed reid up for an introductory backpacking class, under adult supervision, because they felt it was the safest option for their son. \" he wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike, \" his father said. Photos from the camp's facebook page show rugged, mountainous terrain meandering through jeff davis county in southwest texas. The petition further contends that reid didn't receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. The circumstances have left copper comita, reid's mother, baffled, angry and crushed. \" it doesn't take it away. It doesn't make it any better. It's just that much more pain, \" said copper. The lawsuit also outlines communication issues, claiming the comita family wasn't notified of his death for more than four hours. \" we were calling, and no one could give us a straight answer as to how he was, \" said copper. The backpacking course would have been reid's final task to accomplish eagle scout. His troop has since awarded him the honor posthumously. \" his friends, his troop, have been great, \" says john. \" but we haven't heard from the bsa or organization at all. \" the bsa sent wfaa the following statement: \"this remains a difficult time for our scouting community, and we continue to keep the family in"

It wasn't exactly a firm statement, with the newsmax ceo saying that trump is \" considering perhaps terminating \" mueller, who is looking into ties between the trump campaign and russia. He added: \" i think he's weighing that option. \" that prompted a quick response from white house press secretary sean spicer, who said that ruddy \" never spoke to the president regarding this issue \" and that \" only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment. \" related coverage: who's ruddy? the los angeles times has a quick bio of the longtime trump pal that explains why he's generally a reliable gauge on what trump is thinking.

A big no: rosenstein himself testified before a senate panel on tuesday and was asked a simple question by democratic sen. Jeanne shaheen: \"have you seen good cause for firing mueller? \" he had a simple answer, per the hill: \"i have not. \" conservative push: newt gingrich initially praised mueller as a \" superb choice, \" but on monday, he tweeted: \" republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. Look who he is hiring.check fec reports. Time to rethink. \" fellow conservative ann coulter joined the push, tweeting, \" now that we know trump is not under investigation, sessions should take it back &amp; fire mueller. \" big hire: gingrich's remark about mueller's hires may be in reference to high-powered criminal specialist michael dreeben joining the team. A post at lawfare on friday called the hire \" the worst thing that happened to donald trump this week, \" because it signaled an aggressive investigation. Overplayed? a post at axios suggests all this will amount to nothing. \" ordering the firing of mueller really does seem unlikely, \" writes mike allen. \" the near-universal advice trump will be getting from his white house team — and from legal advisors close to the administration — will be that",

In the case from 2015, a 55-year-old spanish woman died of multiple organ failure after two years of the treatment to relieve muscular contracture and stress. In bee-sting therapy, bees placed on a patient's body have their heads squeezed until they extend their stingers, the telegraph reports. The idea is that the stings cause inflammation and lead to an anti-inflammatory response from the body. The unnamed woman started wheezing and having shortness of breath during one of her monthly treatments at a private clinic before losing consciousness. She died weeks later at the hospital. Researchers say severe anaphylactic shock caused a \" massive watershed stroke and permanent coma, \" as well as the multiple organ failure. \" the risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable, \" one researcher says.

            "President obama is content to let other nations publicly lead the search for solutions to the libyan conflict, his advisers say, a stance that reflects the more humble tone he has sought to bring to u.s. Foreign policy but one that also opens him to criticism that he is a weak leader. The tactic is anathema to many conservatives and worries some liberal interventionists, who believe that only overt american authority can assemble an effective opposition to brutal authoritarian governments such as that of libyan leader moammar gaddafi. Although obama sees advantages in keeping washington in the background, especially in a region where the united states is held in such low regard, he has exposed himself to republican charges that he is absent at a time of crisis. Conservatives say his one-of-the-team approach could also signal a decline in american fortitude after nearly a decade of war. Since the uprising began, obama has devoted just one",

        "summary": "A sunday deadline is looming for iran to strike a nuclear deal with six world powers under a plan set in motion last year — but with just days to go, iran's supreme leader has made the chances of a deal being forged in time look supremely unlikely. In a major speech, ayatollah ali khamenei said the country will need 190,000 centrifuge machines, 19 times as many as the 10,000 negotiators from the us, france, britain, russia, china, and germany want to limit the country to in order to reduce its capacity to build nuclear weapons. After the leader's speech appeared to undermine negotiators, analysts began to wonder whether iran really wants a deal that would limit its nuclear capacity in return for the lifting of sanctions, or if khamenei is playing for time, the atlantic notes. \" in ostensibly expressing support for the iranian negotiating team, close scrutiny of khamenei's speech shows that in reality his remarks were aimed at severely curtailing his team's room for maneuver, making it effectively impossible to bridge gaps with the stance \" of the six powers, an intelligence analysis seen by reuters states. If all sides agree, the talks could be extended for another six months, though us officials say they will need to see some progress in the days to come before they will agree to an extension. John kerry joined the talks in vienna yesterday, but it's not clear whether he made any progress during hours of talks with iran's foreign minister; issues including afghanistan were also discussed, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "The hillary clinton-donald trump showdown on monday night was billed as the most anticipated in many years, and it did not disappoint, according to the hill, which describes the clash as one between \" the more incisive and prepared clinton and trump, who leaned heavily on instinct and combativeness. \" five other takes on the debate, which many analysts are calling a win for clinton: glenn thrush at politico calls it a clear loss for trump, who \" became muted and pouty \" toward the end. Clinton \" went right for trump's ego, \" and he \" wilted and offered a series of meandering answers \" when challenged on things like his wealth and his record of job creation, writes thrush, who believes trump \" flat-out forgot to pursue \" a line of attack on the clinton foundation. Fivethirtyeight kept track of the number of interruptions, and trump comes out way ahead on that score: he had three full-fledged interruptions, where he seized the floor, compared to zero for clinton, and 24 \" fleeting interjections \" while his rival kept talking, compared to five for clinton. The biggest contrast may have been between styles, not policy positions, according to alexander burns at the new york times. \" he shouted, interrupted, and sniffed. She kept a level tone and wielded prefab one-liners, \" writes burns, who thinks clinton prevailed on issues of race, gender, and national security, while trump was strongest when portraying himself as a political outsider. Paul farhi at the washington post takes a look at the moderation and finds that nbc news anchor lester holt played a \" largely passive role, \" declining to intervene as \" trump interrupted clinton and made a series of questionable assertions, \" though he did seem \" to push harder on the republican businessman \" than on clinton. Farhi notes that holt's questions didn't cover issues such as \" supreme court nominations, social security, gun control, abortion, student loans, military affairs and health care, especially the affordable care act. \" it was a debate that highlighted the stark choice voters face, and one where the \" two contenders did, in fact, play to their strengths, \" decides gerald f. Seib at the wall street journal. \" he to his ability to connect with voters on visceral terms, she on her ability to move smoothly from subject to subject with an air of authority. \" trump, however, sometimes \" seemed a bit too eager to interrupt and play the part of the bully, \" he writes, while clinton \" occasionally seemed on the verge of appearing smug. \" ( click for 12",

A study published in pediatrics that surveyed 534 primary care physicians found that 93 % of them were asked to delay a vaccine by a parent in any given month; a fifth of respondents said more than 10 % of parents in their practice had asked for delays. More than one-third of the physicians copped to giving in \" often \" or \" always \"; another 37 % said they did \" sometimes. \" \" doctors are feeling really conflicted because they overwhelmingly think this is the wrong thing to do, and is putting children at risk, but at the same time, they want to build trust with their patients and meet people halfway, \" the study's lead author says, per time. It's not for lack of trying to reach these vaccine-wary parents, the researchers note: doctors will often use a variety of strategies to convince parents to stick to the traditional schedule, including telling them their own kids have been vaccinated, bringing up possible future outbreaks if they buck vaccination, or even warning that the alternate schedules haven't been studied adequately. But in the end, the doctors still often acquiesce and are faced with a stressful decision. \" to know i ' m going to pick one [ vaccine ] and leave the other behind, despite all the time i spend explaining the risks and benefits to the parents — it's very difficult for me, \" a pediatrics professor at baylor college of medicine tells time.",

Instead, it seems, the shape of a person's social network is a powerful signal that can identify one's spouse or romantic partner — and even if a relationship is likely to break up. So says a new research paper written by jon kleinberg, a computer scientist at cornell university, and lars backstrom, a senior engineer at facebook. The paper, posted online on sunday, will be presented at a conference on social computing in february. The pair used a hefty data set from facebook as their lab: 1.3 million facebook users, selected randomly from among all users who are at least 20 years old, with from 50 to 2,000 friends, who list a spouse or relationship partner in their profile. That makes for a lot of social connections to analyze, roughly 379 million nodes and 8.6 billion links. The data was used anonymously. Their key finding was that the total number of mutual friends two people share — embeddedness, in social networking terms — is actually a fairly weak indicator of romantic relationships.

Simply put: you have more friends in common with your closest friends than with your acquaintances. Facebook data scientists have developed a novel method for identifying who among a user's friends is that person's partner — and their work puts an empirical stamp on something that is perhaps intuitive: a significant other occupies a unique place in a person's social network, one characterized not by \" embeddedness \" — the standard way of measuring a tie's proximity — but by what the researchers call \" dispersion. \" another measure fared much better: \" dispersion, \" or how many different networks of theirs a person's friend shares.

Here's what that means: the number of mutual friends ( \" embeddedness \" ) is a reliable indicator of how close two people are. Simply put: you have more friends in common with your closest friends than with your acquaintances. Facebook data scientists have developed a novel method for identifying who among a user's friends is that person's partner — and their work puts an empirical stamp on something that is perhaps intuitive: a significant other occupies a unique place in a person's social network, one characterized not by \" embeddedness \" — the standard way of measuring a tie's proximity — but by what the researchers call \" dispersion. \" another measure fared much better: \" dispersion, \" or how many different networks of theirs a person's friend shares. In other words, your significant other won't just share many friends with you, but friends"

Advertisers, however, seem wary, and aja will start out with just six minutes of commercials per hour. Former al jazeera english reporter dave marash believe aja's focus on solid news will help it make its mark. \" almost all of their hires are respectable people with real careers and real records, \" he tells the ap. \" several are flat-out outstanding — sheila macvicar is outstanding. I ' m optimistic. \" other major hires include john seigenthaler, joie chen, and antonio mora. But the new channel faces plenty of hurdles: it will be available in fewer than half of us homes; and like current tv, which it replaces, cable systems have given it high-numbered channels unlikely to draw in many channel viewers.

Colin yost, the valedictorian for the new hampshire school's senior class, decided he wanted to shake things up — and off — during his commencement speech, so after his words of inspiration, he stepped out from behind the podium and started dancing, by himself, to taylor swift's \" shake it off, \" eliciting laughter and some \" oh gosh, what is he doing? \" reactions, mtv reports. Soon, however, his intentions were made clear as the rest of his graduating class ( more than 230 in all ) stood up and joined colin in a choreographed celebration of the end of their high school career. While colin's flash mob surprised the audience, it was far from spontaneous. The senior posted a video tutorial on youtube for his classmates to study and cajoled the school's administration beforehand into letting him use five graduation rehearsals to get the moves down just right, mtv notes. \" as we practiced, the energy was just building and everyone was feeling how great it was to work together and send this positive message, \" he tells the station. He adds that the song-and-dance show played perfectly into what he had talked about in his speech on embracing your inner nerd, the portsmouth herald notes. But despite the taylor-made two-stepping's success, we probably won't be seeing colin — who admits he's never taken a dance lesson — on so you think you can dance: he's headed to princeton to study chemical and biological engineering, per mtv.

So, colin yost knew he needed to up his game. The valedictorian at portsmouth high school in portsmouth, new hampshire, pulled off one for the ages on friday, when he ended his inspirational speech by saying, \" all you have to do it shake it off. \" he then stepped back and began shaking it as taylor swift's hit came on over the gym's loudspeakers. \" i've always wanted to do a flash mob and i thought graduation would be the perfect place because our class is very cohesive and doesn't really have a lot of cliques, \" yost told mtv news on monday morning, while taking a break from his job as an assistant in a cardiovascular operating room at a portsmouth hospital. \" i was listening to'shake it off ' in the car and i thought that would be great",

            "Youtube the commencement speech arms race is no joke this year. It takes something pretty special to grab attention during a season when one valedictorian got a nationally televised do-over after his school banned him from coming out in his address, and everyone from president obama to matthew mcconaughey, bill nye, ed helms and stephen colbert have been lighting up stages. So, colin yost knew he needed to up his game. The valedictorian at portsmouth high school in portsmouth, new hampshire, pulled off one for the ages on friday, when he ended his inspirational speech by saying, \" all you have to do it shake it off. \" he then stepped back and began shaking it as taylor swift's hit came on over the gym's loudspeakers. \" i've always wanted to do a flash mob and i thought graduation would be the perfect place because our class is very cohesive and doesn't really have a lot of cliques, \" yost told mtv news on monday morning, while taking a break from his job as an assistant in a cardiovascular operating room at a portsmouth hospital. \" i was listening to'shake it off ' in the car and i thought that would be great",

According to channel a, south korean authorities have confirmed that the soldier is immune to the deadly bacterium, though it's not clear whether his immunity comes from vaccination or exposure. Anthrax can kill within 24 hours if people are not vaccinated, the international business times notes, and the south korean military says its anthrax vaccine will not be ready until the end of 2019. The news adds to concerns about possible biological attacks: the white house released a report last week that said pyongyang had spent \" hundreds of millions of dollars on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that could threaten our homeland, \" and japan's asahi newspaper recently reported that north korea has been trying to find ways for anthrax to survive the high temperatures that intercontinental ballistic missiles experience.",

Police say the teen used neighbors ' internet connections, voice manipulation, and other \" advanced camouflage technologies \" to hide his identity while making threats against jewish centers in the us, australia, and new zealand, the new york times reports, via israel radio. However, police believe he's also responsible for hundreds of other threats around the world over two or three years, reports haaretz. Those include threats against shopping malls and airports. In one case, he forced a delta flight to make an emergency landing, police say. Authorities say five computers, antennas, and other equipment were seized from his residence. Per haaretz, the teen tried to grab the gun of an officer who arrived to arrest him; he was previously found unfit for military service in israel. Police had previously said they were searching for a single individual believed to be behind the majority of more than 100 bomb threats made against jewish centers in the us this year. \" this is the guy we are talking about, \" rosenfeld says.

Gabrielle giffords ( d-ariz. ), in tucson — jared lee loughner phoned an old and close friend with whom he had gone to high school and college. The friend, bryce tierney, was up late watching tv, but he didn't answer the call. When he later checked his voice mail, he heard a simple message from loughner: \"hey man, it's jared. Me and you had good times. Peace out. Later. \" that was it. But later in the day, when tierney first heard about the tucson massacre, he had a sickening feeling: \"they hadn't released the name, but i said, 'holy shit, i think it's jared that did it.

He suggests pham sold the drugs and gave ha a cut of the proceeds. Court records show that pham had prior conflicts with others: in 2014, a woman accused pham of sending two men \" looking for me and my husband \" over a money dispute. Pham later said the woman \" hired somebody to cause me harm for $ 2,000 … after i talked about the money owed my family. \" pham said someone broke windows of a family business and slashed the tires of her son's car around the same time. Police, who've named no suspects, are investigating whether the saturday shooting death of a pizza hut delivery driver three blocks from ha and pham's home is related, per the washington post.",

Reuters reports the islamic state claimed responsibility thursday in its own al-naba paper for the attack, saying that the 29-year-old is \" one of the caliphate soldiers. \" although investigators are still looking into saipov's background, the criminal complaint against him says he told officials he was glad he'd carried out the attack, gained inspiration for it by viewing isis propaganda clips on his phone, and wanted to put up an isis flag in his room at bellevue hospital, where he's recovering after being shot in the abdomen by nypd officer ryan nash. Cnn reports that isis didn't use saipov's name in its claim and offers no evidence to back that claim up, including any showing that isis helped plan the attack or even knew about it beforehand. The site notes the wording is similar what it used after the pulse orlando shooting and a 2016 attack in nice, france. Cnn adds this is the first time isis has posted such a claim first in its newspaper rather than via its amaq news agency. Per abc news, the isis statement also mentioned that the attack took place \" close to the monument for the 9/11 raid \" and, oddly, claimed that \" 60 crusaders \" were killed or injured in the halloween attack; the official count so far is eight dead, around a dozen wounded.",

Officer ryan nash, a 28-year-old who has worked for the department since 2012, shot suspect sayfullo saipov in the abdomen after saipov exited his vehicle carrying weapons that turned out to be a pellet gun and a paintball gun. Saipov was wounded, and, as of wednesday morning, was out of surgery and in custody at an unidentified hospital, according to cnn.

The last boat still looking for the plane left the australian port of fremantle on tuesday to scan areas that might have been missed during the initial search because of sonar issues or too-deep water, reports perth now. If no fresh evidence or trace of the plane has been found once its month-long mission wraps up, no future search missions will likely follow, reports nbc news. Though officials \" remain hopeful, \" australia's transport minister says that \" we have to prepare ourselves for the prospect \" that mh370, which disappeared in march 2014, will not be found, per the bbc. Relatives of mh370's 239 victims plan to continue hunting for evidence of what happened to their loved ones, however. Frustrated by a lack of activity from malaysian officials, family members from malaysia, china, and france have banded together to search for debris, including on remote beaches in madagascar, where jiang hui, 44, of china says he recently found a possible plane part. \" i felt excited but at the same time it was saddening, \" he tells the guardian. \" it is a small piece and will not really be able to show what happened to the plane, but i hope so much that the authorities … will try to find more. \" relatives have also handed out brochures in three languages that explain to locals what to do if plane parts are found, per the bbc.

He wouldn't, and after a legal battle that made its way to new york's state supreme court, justice donald greenwood sided with the parents tuesday and told michael he would have to leave. The story went viral after syracuse.com first reported on it last week; its article features a series of letters the rotondos gave their son, starting with one on feb. 2 of this year giving him 14 days to move out. Letters given to him after that include everything from a formal eviction notice to money ( $ 1,100 to help him find a new place ), advice ( \" there are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you. Get one. \" ), and strongly-worded suggestions that he sell his things ( \" especially... Any weapons you may have \" ) to raise funds. The rotondos went to the town court in april after michael stayed put, then found out only a state supreme court justice could remove a family member. During tuesday's hearing, which syracuse.com called \" surreal, \" michael rotondo argued with the judge for 30 minutes, including insisting he was legally entitled to six months ' notice before having to move out. The judge said that's not true, pointing to an appellate court decision ruling, and asked the parents ' lawyer to come up with an eviction order that greenwood could sign. He also asked adult protective services to investigate the case. Outside the courthouse, michael rotondo, who moved back home eight years ago after losing a job, told reporters he would appeal the decision. He said he doesn't speak to his parents but that he is not ready to move out. According to court filings cited by abc 7, his parents say he does not contribute to household expenses or do chores.",

A team that included canadian olympian ryan fry, however, got so drunk before a game saturday that they were banned from a tournament in red deer, alberta, and told never to come back, the cbc reports. \" they went out to curl and they were extremely drunk and breaking brooms and swearing and just unacceptable behavior that nobody wants to watch or hear or listen to and it was just ' enough was enough, ' \" says facility manager wade thurber. He says there was \" some damage in the locker room \" and other teams complained about having their stuff kicked around. Thurber tells the red deer advocate that the foursome drank so much before the game that staff at the curling club lounge cut them off. They ended up with only three players on the ice because skipper jamie koe was too drunk to even play. Thurber says there were complaints from spectators and other teams. Fry, who was part of the team that won gold for canada in sochi in 2014, issued an apology. \" i will strive to become a better version of myself while contributing positively to the sport and curling community that i love so much, \" he said. The team forfeited the rest of its games in the red deer classic, which is part of the world curling tour, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "Our very primitive beginnings look to have been very primitive indeed. It turns out the earliest known ancestor of humans was a sea creature a millimeter in size that likely lacked an anus. In a study published in nature on monday, scientists named saccorhytus coronaries as a 540 million-year-old member — at that age the oldest one — of a category of animals called deuterostomes. The bbc explains deuterostomes gave rise to vertebrates. \" all deuterostomes had a common ancestor, and we think that is what we are looking at here, \" researcher simon conway morris tells the bbc. As for what they're looking at, \" the bag-like body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds, \" the researchers write. Live science reports the deuterostome groups scientists have previously discovered were at most 520 million years old, and had begun evolving into vertebrates, echinoderms ( ie, starfish ), and hemichordates ( acorn worms ). That left scientists stumped as to what a common ancestor would have looked like. Now they say they know. \" we had to process enormous volumes of limestone — about [ 3 tons ] — to get to the fossils, but a steady stream of new finds allowed us to \" answer that question, says co-author jian han of the find, made in china. Two other details, from a cambridge press release: the minuscule creature is thought to have lived between grains of sand on the sea bed, and it featured small conical structures that the water it ingested may have exited through \" and so were perhaps the evolutionary precursor of the gills we now see in fish. \" ( scientists have found earth's oldest civilization. )",

It is thought to be the most primitive example of a so-called \"deuterostome \" – a broad biological category that encompasses a number of sub-groups, including the vertebrates. If the conclusions of the study, published in the journal nature, are correct, then saccorhytus was the common ancestor of a huge range of species, and the earliest step yet discovered on the evolutionary path that eventually led to humans, hundreds of millions of years later. Modern humans are, however, unlikely to perceive much by way of a family resemblance. Saccorhytus was about a",

Still, no one can verify cavill ever got anything close to $ 14 million. One source says of the figure: \"it certainly isn't for one picture. That's insane. \" actors leading their first big blockbuster typically get something more in line with gadot's reported base salary.

        "summary": "For the first time, scientists have successfully implanted living bone grown in a laboratory, live science reports. And while those implants were in miniature pigs, not humans, it's pretty impressive nonetheless. Scientists removed part of the jaw bones of 14 pigs, carved cow thighbones into the right shape, removed all the cells from the cow bones, saturated the cow bones with stem cells from the pigs, and left the bones to grow in the lab. When the new, living bones were implanted in the pigs, they showed impressive regrowth and returned the jaw to full strength, according to science magazine. \"the pigs woke up, and a half-hour later they were eating, \" researcher gordana vunjak-novakovic tells the new york times. \"we thought they would be in pain. But no, they're doing great. \" the researchers published their findings this month in science translational medicine. They want to try the process in humans in the next few years. At the moment, no great options exist for people who need replacement bones due to injuries, birth defects, or diseases. There are titanium replacements or donated bones, but those come with the risk of rejection. Doctors replacing facial bones currently take the bone from elsewhere in the patient's body, but that causes a new injury, and it can be hard to find a large enough chunk of bone to borrow. Prior methods of bone regrowth have involved letting the new bone grow inside the body, but researchers say growing it first in a lab could have a number of benefits.

But he says the new technique, now inching toward testing in humans, will still have to prove its advantages over other experimental bone regeneration approaches.

New york had held the top spot since wealth-x first started ranking cities in 2011. The firm defines a uhnwi as a person worth $ 30 million or more.

Among hong kong's most prominent billionaires are li ka-shing, whose cheung kong ( ckhuy ) empire controls ports, telecommunications networks and energy companies across the globe. No single city in mainland china made it into wealth-x's top 10 in terms of its number of super-rich individuals.

Canada also threatened retaliation of its own. The us was the largest market for cars exported from the eu in 2016, importing over 1 million, cnbc reports. According to the washington post, trump's newest tariff threat mostly targets germany, which exported $ 23 billion in cars to the us in 2016. Germany's bmw and volkswagen employ thousands of workers in factories in the us, and critics say a tariff on their cars would only hurt us consumers. Trump said during his presidential campaign that he wanted to fix trade imbalances with china and mexico. But his announced tariffs on aluminum and steel would mostly affect canada, the uk, germany, south korea, turkey, and japan — all allies of the us. \"none of this is reasonable, but reason is a sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world, \" the president of the eu says.

Animal-loving yang xiaoyun paid about 7,000 yuan ( us$ 1,100 ) to save around 100 dogs in the southern city of yulin on saturday, web portal netease reported. The city holds an annual festival devoted to the animal's meat on the summer solstice, which has provoked an increasing backlash from animal protection activists. Reports said that yang, 65, plans to rehouse the dogs at her home nearly 2,000 kilometres",
            "Dog and cat meat traders at yulin festival in china have said that business is booming, despite calls for it to close amid animal cruelty accusations. It is expected that thousands of cats and dogs will be slaughtered this weekend to mark the summer solstice on sunday in yulin, washed down with lycee wine. Government officials have ostensibly \"banned \" the controversial annual yulin dog meat festival after it attracted protesters and criticism from around the world. Some readers may find the below images distressing a woman on her moped transports more than 10 dogs, which had just been slaughtered, to her market shop for sale however, the slaughter of cats and dogs for meat is not outlawed in china, and the local government in yulin says it cannot stop legitimate businesses preparing meat in the run-up to this year's solstice on 21 june.

            "Peter li is a china policy specialist at humane society international. He is also an associate professor of east asian politics, university of houston-downtown. The views expressed here are solely his. ( cnn ) yulin's dog meat \" festival, \" where some 10,000 dogs are slaughtered and served up as meals, is often wrongly assumed to be an ancient chinese tradition. In fact, the festival only dates back to 2009 when it was launched in the city in china's southwest to celebrate the summer solstice. The consumption of dog meat does have historical precedence in china. At its height during the han dynasty ( 202 - 220 ad ), dog meat was considered a delicacy. Yet, dog eating soon lost favor and by the sui-tang dynasties ( 581 -- 907 ad ), dog eating had been rejected as an indecent habit. Subsequent dynasties valued dogs as helpers"

        "summary": "Will ferrell's latest comedy about a wealthy white guy who enlists a law-abiding black man to help him prepare for life in prison is proving more controversial than his usual work. With accusations that get hard is homophobic and racist, ferrell defends the flick to the ap, noting he and costar kevin hart \" show a mirror to what's already existing out there. \" do critics agree? \" perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but get hard is not it, \" claudia puig writes at usa today. The film's \" jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness. \" and though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \" unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest. \" it \" seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts, \" writes peter howell more favorably at the toronto star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \" i enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke, \" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \" it's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity. \" and \" ferrell and hart make a good team. \" cary darling at dfw is less kind. \" since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence, \" she writes. Excepting a scene in which hart portrays a black guy, a latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \" weighed down by middle-school jokes. \" at its best, get hard \" does a smartly scathing job \" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes ann hornaday at the washington post. At its worst, it \" veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize. \" particularly, \" the movie is drenched in gay panic \" and includes \" tiresome'don't drop the soap ' jokes, \" based on ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \" ferrell and hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry, \" hornaday writes.",

            "The statue of jefferson davis, once president of the confederate states, stands just south of the main building on ut's campus on june 22, 2015. Editor's note: this story has been updated throughout. Just days after an advisory panel recommended the university of texas at austin relocate some or all of its statues of confederate leaders, ut-austin president gregory fenves announced that the statue of confederate president jefferson davis will soon have a new home. Ut is relocating the davis statue to an exhibit in the dolph briscoe center for american history. Four other statues the panel considered relocating — including ones of confederate generals robert e. Lee and albert sidney johnston — will remain on the university's south mall, but fenves will consider adding explanatory plaques to place them in historical context. \"while every historical figure leaves a mixed legacy, i believe jefferson davis is in a separate category, \" fenves wrote in a letter to the ut-austin community, \"and that it is not in the university's best interest to continue commemorating him. Davis had few ties to texas; he played a unique role in the history of the american south that is best explained and understood through an educational exhibit. \" the statue of former u.s. President woodrow wilson will also be relocated to another outdoor location, but for symmetrical reasons: he stands",
            "Updated throughout at 10: 21 a.m. Austin — the university of texas at austin will move the statue honoring jefferson davis to the dolph briscoe center for american history, president greg fenves announced on twitter thursday morning. The other four confederate statues will remain in place. \"james stephen hogg, albert sidney johnston, and john reagan had deep ties to texas, \" fenves wrote in a letter to the ut community. \"robert e. Lee's complicated legacy to texas and the nation should not be reduced to his role in the civil war. \" fenves said he will consider placing a plaque on the littlefield fountain to explain the context behind the four remaining statues. \"this combination of locating the jefferson davis statue in a center devoted to history and keeping the remaining statues along the main mall is both respectful of the heritage that is important to many and serves as a poignant display of our nation's and university's history, \" fenves wrote. To preserve symmetry on campus, u.s. President woodrow wilson will be moved to another exterior location on campus. Currently wilson and davis sit atop the main mall together, overseeing ut's south mall lawn.

        "summary": "Human blood is rich with genetic material, and scientists have in recent years taken many steps forward in decoding it. The latest announcement — that a blood test can spot cancer at its earliest stages — has the potential to save millions of lives as treatment is administered earlier in the disease's progression, reports reuters. Reporting in the journal science translational medicine, scientists say that by analyzing dna fragments in blood to look for several dozen cancer-driver genes, they spotted 86 out of 138 stage 1 and stage 2 cancers; they also confirmed no trace of cancer in 44 healthy patients ( in other words, there were zero false positives ). Some call this minimally invasive test a \" liquid biopsy. \" \" this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers, \" says lead author dr. Victor velculescu, an oncologist at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center. While the test is proof-of-concept and not yet ready for prime time, detecting 62 % of cancers that were only in stages 1 or 2 is a major milestone, experts say. For instance, less than one in five ovarian cancers are caught that early, when the survival rate is higher than 90 %; those that are caught after the cancer has spread face a dramatically lower 40 % survival rate five years out, per healthday news. For this study, however, the blood test caught early-stage ovarian cancer 68 % of the time. Scientists hope they can get the test much closer to a 100 % detection rate.

            "The detection and analysis of cell-free dna in patients ' blood are becoming increasingly accepted in oncology. However, this approach has generally been applied for the monitoring of patients with existing tumors. It has not been useful for early diagnosis of cancer because of insufficient sensitivity to detect really small tumors that only shed minute quantities of dna into the blood, as well as difficulties with identifying cancer-associated genetic changes without knowing what mutations are present in the primary tumor. A method developed by phallen et al., called targeted error correction sequencing, addresses both of these limitations and demonstrates the feasibility of detecting circulating cell-free dna from many early tumors, suggesting its potential use for cancer screening. Early detection and intervention are likely to be the most effective means for reducing morbidity and mortality of human cancer. However, development of methods for noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors has remained a challenge. We have developed",

        "summary": "The distributed denial of service attack that sent internet users into a tailspin friday was the most powerful of its kind by far, say cybersecurity researchers, and they're especially alarmed because it looks to be the work of amateur hackers. Twitter, netflix, reddit, and other sites went down as the mirai botnet took over poorly protected \" internet of things \" devices like dvrs and webcams — whose owners hadn't changed the devices'default passwords — and bombarded domain host company dyn with traffic so regular users couldn't get through. Apparently there were a lot of insecure devices out there to use. Dyn says there were \" 100,000 malicious endpoints \" leading an attack twice as powerful as any other ddos attack reported, per the guardian. Researchers from cybersecurity firm flashpoint suspect the attack was tied to the community at hackforums.net — where the mirai source code was published earlier this month, per mashable — and was meant to target a video game company, perhaps the playstation network, reports computer world. If amateur hackers did so much damage, \" imagine what a well-resourced state actor could do with insecure iot devices, \" says a cybersecurity rep at the council on foreign relations. \" we have a serious problem with the cyber insecurity of iot devices and no real strategy to combat it. \" experts recommend users reset an iot device to its factory settings to erase any existing malware, then create a new password immediately.",

        "summary": "Donald trump entered the national abortion debate on wednesday as smoothly as a burning oil tanker slamming into a fireworks warehouse. After causing an outcry by saying that if abortions are banned, women who have them should be punished, he went on to claim the issue was \" unclear \" before issuing a statement saying that doctors, not women who have abortions, would be the ones to be punished if abortion was outlawed. \" my position has not changed — like ronald reagan, i am pro-life with exceptions, \" he insisted. A roundup of reactions: the statements came amid what politico calls \" 24 hours of mayhem \" for trump that also included scrapping his gop loyalty pledge, a fresh line of attack in the corey lewandowski case, and complaining about the geneva conventions. Politico predicts that with the party now hopelessly divided, a contested gop convention is almost inevitable. Ben carson offered a very carsonesque defense of trump in a cnn interview. \" i don't think he really had a chance to really think about it, \" carson said, adding that trump was able to \" come up with a more rational and informed type of answer \" after talking to advisers. Carson said he agreed with trump's latter position that abortion providers, not women, should be the ones to be punished if the us ever bans abortion. Ted cruz didn't pass up the opportunity to slam trump, the hill reports. Trump \" has demonstrated that he hasn't seriously thought through the issues, and he ' ll say anything just to get attention, \" cruz said in a statement. \" we shouldn't be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world, \" added cruz, who, unlike trump, does not support exceptions for rape and incest under an abortion ban, according to the washington post. Some anti-abortion activists are just as outraged as pro-choice groups by trump's earlier comments, the new york times reports. They say the call to punish women shows that trump's shift toward being anti-abortion is very recent — and insincere. \" no pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion, \" says the president of the march for life education and defense fund. \" we invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment. \" the washington post fact-checks trump's claim that his change of position mirrors reagan's, finding that this time, trump is not \" glaringly incorrect, \" although the comparison is a \" gratuitous one that lacks",

In a wrongful death lawsuit filed sunday, rondini's parents accuse the university, school officials, sheriff's deputies, and rondini's alleged rapist of enabling her suicide in february 2016. Rondini had been a 20-year-old student at the university of alabama in july 2015 when she alleged she was raped by local businessman tj bunn jr. But authorities \" wrongfully acted or failed to act in response, \" the lawsuit alleges, per buzzfeed. It adds deputies — who found the case didn't meet alabama's legal definition for rape — didn't test rondini's rape kit or interview witnesses, an \" intentional \" behavior that was due to rondini's gender. Rondini — who allegedly stole $ 3 and a gun from bunn — was \" treated as a crime suspect, \" not a victim, the suit continues, per the ap, also alleging a school counselor refused to see rondini unless she took anxiety medication. Rondini later dropped out of school, moved back to texas, and suffered \" extreme depression, anxiety, ptsd, fear, panic attacks, decline of cognitive functions and general well-being … all of which directly led to megan's loss of life, \" the suit states. Per al.com, two days before her suicide, she sent a text reading, \" i wonder what i could've accomplished if one man didn't completely rip everything away from me. \" bunn, who claimed the sex was consensual, was never charged with a crime. His lawyer tells al.com that the lawsuit is \" baseless \" and \" simply false. \"",

The new york times reports the proposed framework reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 %, doubles deductions for married and single filers to $ 24,000 and $ 12,000 respectively, and reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The top bracket would see a reduced tax rate; the lowest bracket would see an increased tax rate. Overall, trump claims the plan represents the biggest tax cut in history: \" there's never been tax cuts like we're talking about. \" trump is promising the middle class will be \" the biggest winners \" of his tax plan, which will cause \" jobs to start pouring into our country. \" but the framework presented lacks details to show whether that would or would not be the case. ( cnn reports trump also claims the plan is \" not good for me, \" but that's impossible to prove without his tax returns. ) the framework does, however, include details that will specifically benefit rich americans, for example by getting rid of inheritance taxes paid by the country's wealthiest families. Without further specifics, the head of the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget calls trump's tax plan \" nothing more than a fiscal fantasy. \" trump says he wants to work with democrats to fill in those details, but republican leaders say they ' ll likely use a special rule to pass tax reform without democratic support.",

But — news alert! — princeton has tumbled from tying the venerable crimson to no. 2.

Some highlights: the majority don't know how to write in cursive. They have never had trouble understanding what a \" caramel macchiato \" is. Clint eastwood is some guy who directs movies. Fergie is a member of the black eyed peas, not the british royal family. Czechoslovakia has never existed. The post office has always been basically broke.

One part of this chasm occurs when the older party, the teacher, assumes knowledge that the younger party doesn't have. It's an old principle of learning that we gain new knowlede based on what we already know. So in the 1970s, if students knew about the watergate scandal, teachers could use that knowledge to teach about shakespeare's richard the third.

Parent company salem media on friday purged a slew of bloggers in a \" mass firing, \" and many of those who lost their jobs were critics of president trump, reports cnn media writer brian stelter. Former editor erick erickson, now at the resurgent, writes that it's not a huge surprise given that salem similarly got rid of many anti-trump voices at its radio properties. Both stories point out that the move wasn't entirely political. Salem wanted to cut costs; it's just that those who bore the brunt of the cuts were generally critical of the president. \" they fired everybody who was insufficiently supportive of trump, \" one source tells cnn. The daily beast lists some of those fired writers as caleb howe, jay caruso, ben howe, patrick frey ( who writes as patterico ), neil stevens, and susan wright.
