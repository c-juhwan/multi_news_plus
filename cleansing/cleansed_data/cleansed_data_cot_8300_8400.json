Brad sherman formally launched a bid to impeach president trump on wednesday — but the move has next to no support among his fellow democrats, let alone the house republicans whose votes would be needed for impeachment. The measure's only co-sponsor was rep. Al green from texas. Sherman, who represents a district in suburban los angeles, introduced the articles of impeachment on the house floor wednesday afternoon, the los angeles times reports. He said he hopes the move will inspire an \" intervention \" in the white house that will see \" incompetency replaced by care. \" the latest: sherman says the firing of fbi director james comey was obstruction of justice, which amounts to the \" high crimes and misdemeanors \" that warrant impeachment, the san diego union-tribune reports. \" we now begin the effort to force the house judiciary committee to hold hearings on obstruction of justice and russian interference in our election, \" he said in a statement.

Nancy pelosi \" has repeatedly called for an outside, independent commission to get to the bottom of trump's connection to russia's interference in our election, \" a spokeswoman for the house minority leader said. The white house reacted with what breitbart calls \" disdain. \" \" i think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst, \" spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said. The move shows that \" talk of impeachment isn't going away, \" even though most democrats see it as a distraction from their policy agenda, writes claire foran at the atlantic.

        "summary": "Prepare for a spring that's about 30 seconds shorter than last year's, which was 30 seconds shorter than the one before. The changing length of the season is related to the tilt of the earth's axis, livescience reports. It's a matter of what's known as precession, or the way the axis wobbles. The summer solstice occurs, as the smithsonian explains, when the northern hemisphere is most tilted toward the sun. Precession changes exactly when that occurs, meaning it comes a little bit earlier each year. The result is that we get a little more summer and a little less spring; this year, it's 93.65 days of summer and 92.76 of spring. Another factor in season length is the speed with which the earth is traveling around the sun. Due to the elliptical shape of earth's orbit, right now, we move fastest along that orbit between december and march, meaning winter and spring are shorter, while summer and autumn are longer. The shortening-spring trend won't last forever: around the year 8680, the season will be at its shortest, at 88.5 days. After that, spring will start getting longer again. ( a longer summer may mean a few more moody people are born. )",

The season of flowers and showers actually gets shorter every year by about 30 seconds to a minute, due to astronomical quirks, researchers say. This year, spring officially starts at 6: 45 p.m. Edt on march 20, according to the u.s. National weather service ( nsw ). At that exact moment, which is called the vernal equinox, the earth's axis will reach a halfway mark, where it points neither toward the sun ( as it does on the summer solstice ) nor away from the sun ( as it does on the winter solstice ), said gavin schmidt, the director of the goddard institute for space studies in new york city. But for thousands of years, spring has been losing time in the northern hemisphere.

        "summary": "We know hobbits existed. And we know humans may have killed them off. But new fossils discovered on the indonesian island of flores in 2014 — and announced wednesday via two papers in nature — show they were older and smaller than previously believed. Gizmodo reports the remains of the first hobbits — scientifically known as homo floresiensis — were found in the liang bua cave in 2003. Usa today describes the hobbits as no taller than an average us kindergartner. The new remains — amounting to a lower jaw and six teeth from three individuals, according to the guardian — were the first found outside liang bua. They were also 500,000 years older than the fossils at liang bua, dating back 700,000 years. Skeptics of homo floresiensis as its own species believed the hobbits could have simply been homo sapiens with a congenital disease. Gerrit van den bergh, who found the new fossils, says they \"quash once and for all any doubters that believe homo floresiensis was merely a sick modern human. \" thats because they predate modern humans by half-a-million years and appear to be descended from homo erectus. Researchers say a group of homo erectus somehow got stuck on flores a million years ago and spent the next 300,000 years shrinking in a process known as \" insular dwarfism. \" \" being big is no longer an advantage when you're trying to survive in such an isolated and challenging environment, \" researcher adam brumm tells the guardian.

But that doesn't mean he ' ll buy any nearby vegetable. In fact, when mr. Yglesias heard earlier this year that a high-tech, indoor farming facility was now growing greens just around the corner from mompou, he was pretty sure he would never become a customer. \"i really needed to be convinced, \" mr. Yglesias said recently. In january, he walked to the nearby outpost of aerofarms, a vertical farming company that started in 2004, and convinced, he was. It wasn't so much what he saw that changed his mind, it was what he tasted. \"they're producing these greens that taste the way greens are supposed to taste, the way i remember",
            "Vertical farm startup aerofarms is about to open a farm with the potential to harvest 2 million pounds of fresh, leafy greens a year, without any soil, pesticides, or sunlight. Crops sit on stacked trays outfitted with led lights and sensors that track the growing process. All of this happens inside a 69,000-square-foot warehouse in newark, new jersey. When it officially starts production this spring, it will become the world's largest vertical farm. \" cities have a lot of mouths to feed. We have population growth, urbanization, and we need better ways to feed humanity that are sensitive to the environment, \" aerofarms ' ceo and founder david rosenberg tells tech insider. \" vertical farms are one of many solutions. \" i recently toured the farm, where 250 different types of herbs and greens grow on trays stacked 30 feet high. Take a look inside.",
            "Aerofarms has put $ 30m into a green revolution that seeks to produce more crops in less space, but whether it's economically viable is an open question an ambitious, almost fantastical, manifestation of agricultural technology is expected to come to fruition this fall. From the remains of an abandoned steel mill in newark, new jersey, the creators of aerofarms are building what they say will be the largest vertical farm, producing two million pounds of leafy greens a year. Whether it even qualifies as a \"farm \" is a matter of taste. The greens will be manufactured using a technology called aeroponics, a technique in which crops are grown in vertical stacks of plant beds, without soil, sunlight or water.

Relatives attending a high school graduation ceremony in senatobia, miss., last month were ordered not to cheer until the end, and when four people cheered early, foster didn't just kick them out of the ceremony, he contacted police and had warrants issued for their arrest, cnn reports.

To have charges filed, he filled out an affidavit with the help of a police chief, stating that the \" loud, boisterous noise \" at the ceremony was \" against the peace and dignity of the state of mississippi, \" the times reports. The relatives are due in court next week. ( in 2012, a south carolina mom was arrested and fined $ 225 for cheering at her daughter's graduation ceremony. )",

Per a report by the center for the study of women in television and film, women directors made up just 9 % of all directors who had worked on the top 250 grossing domestic films in 2015. There has been an attitude shift and increased willingness to talk about the issue — stacey snider, for instance, became the co-chairman of 20th century fox in november 2014 and noted, \" it's incumbent upon us as business leaders to really address [ the gender discrimination problem ] seriously. \" but it may take awhile to remedy, as films coming out over the next few years were in the works long before \" the outcry of gender-bias reached deafening levels, \" as the wrap puts it.

The 300-some rolled-up pieces of papyrus were in herculaneum, a town pummeled by the eruption of mount vesuvius in ad 79. The scrolls were left in a delicate state. While researchers have been able to unroll and read pieces of them, the bbc reports, the process damaged the scrolls, and experts gave up. Now, however, scholars in italy have been able to decipher letters written in the scrolls without unrolling them, the new york times reports. Special 3d x-ray technology, also used in some breast scans, reveals the distinction between the ink and the papyrus itself, the bbc notes. \" the letters are there in relief, because the ink is still on the top \" of the papyrus, a researcher says. That fact helped scientists detect the letters. They're not exactly zooming through the full text now; they've picked up some letters and words, livescience reports. But \" at least we know there are techniques able to read inside the papyri, finally, \" a researcher tells the times.

With maximum sustained winds near 200 mph, patricia is the strongest storm ever recorded in the eastern pacific or in the atlantic, said dave roberts, a hurricane specialist at the u.s. National hurricane center. Astronaut scott kelly tweeted a photo of the hurricane from space: patricia's power was comparable to that of typhoon haiyan, which left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the philippines two years ago, according to the u.n.'s world meteorological organization. \" this is really, really, really strong, \" wmo spokeswoman clare nullis told a u.n. Briefing in geneva, according to reuters. In mexico, officials declared a state of emergency in dozens of municipalities in colima, nayarit and jalisco states that contain the bustling port of manzanillo and the posh resort of puerto vallarta. The governor of colima ordered schools closed on friday, when the storm was forecast to make what the hurricane center called a \" potentially catastrophic landfall. \" teams",

More than 7 million residents — and an estimated tens of thousands of u.s. Citizens visiting or living there — were told to prepare for the \" worst-case scenario \" as the ferocious storm was expected to race ashore on mexico's pacific coast between 6 to 10 p.m. Et friday. At 5 p.m. Et, patricia was about 60 miles west of manzanillo, and about 110 miles south-southeast of cabo corrientes. The u.s. National hurricane center said patricia was expected to make landfall \" in the next several hours. \" a hurricane warning was in place for san blas to punta san telmo. The tourist magnets of puerto vallarta and manzanillo were directly in the category 5 storm's projected path, and puerto vallarta's airport was closed friday out of precaution as some stranded vacationers described their inability to fly out of a \" nightmare. \" by 5 p.m. Winds had weakened slightly to 190 mph, the hurricane center said.

At least eight complaints were made against dr. George tyndall between 2000 and 2014, but they weren't brought to light until an internal usc probe in 2016, launched after a health center staff member complained about tyndall, found he had sexually harassed patients. But the private university didn't report him to the state medical board, instead simply allowing tyndall to resign last year, reuters reports. More allegations have sprung up recently, including several lawsuits filed by former patients, a new accusation dating back to 1991, and hundreds of reports from concerned patients who responded to a hotline and special website set up by usc. Tyndall, 71, who worked on the campus for 30 years, is accused of photographing students ' genitals, touching students inappropriately, making sexually suggestive comments during exams, and forcing students to strip naked, the ap reports; his victims allegedly included many foreign students from china. Usc did file a complaint with the medical board in march, after tyndall requested reinstatement, and recently alerted the los angeles county district attorney's office of the situation. The da's office in turn referred it to the los angeles police department, but an lapd spokesperson said this week there is no active criminal investigation. Nikias has promised to \" change the culture \" at usc and acknowledged tyndall should have been reported earlier, while the chair of usc's board of trustees called the situation \" distressing \" but said the board has \" full confidence \" in nikias. Tyndall spoke to the los angeles times last week and insisted he'd done nothing wrong.",

They reviewed thousands of hours of cognitive-based moves across all skill levels, essentially tracking the players'responses to their rivals and the amount of time it took them to make those responses. And it's not casual game play: starcraft 2 is a \" ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money \" and a game that's of interest to psychologists for the same reasons chess and bridge are, notes their paper, in plos one. What the psychology and statistics doctoral students and an adviser found: even at high levels of skill, after about age 24, \" players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance. \" but don't panic, reports the washington post. Older players may be slower, but they're smarter: the data showed they were more prone to use short cuts or intricate commands to give them an advantage. Essentially, they're more effective, and are still able to win. ( a 2011 study found more bad news for those past their mid-20s. )",

The canadian mom just couldn't believe it when she learned she had survived for six days without lungs — an impressive feat detailed in a study published wednesday. According to the guardian, benoit, 32, was born with cystic fibrosis. After she came down with a flu that left her coughing so hard she fractured ribs, she was admitted to the hospital in april, the canadian press reports. There, doctors realized she had only hours to live. Benoit's lungs were failing, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was sending her into septic shock, dropping her blood pressure, and knocking her organs out of commission. Life support wasn't working. Desperate, surgeons decided to remove benoit's lungs — the source of the bacteria — and go from there. Doctors say \" there were a lot of unknowns \" — as far as they know, nothing like this had ever been done before — but got \" courage \" knowing that benoit would \" for sure \" die that day if they did nothing. It took 13 people nine hours to remove benoit's lungs, which were swollen and hard with mucus. They had no idea how long they'd have to wait until a new set of lungs would be available for transplant. In the meantime, they hooked benoit's heart to an artificial lung. Within minutes, her blood pressure returned to normal. Six days later, she received a successful lung transplant. Benoit says doctors \" pulled me back from the dead. \" ( a baby went on the transplant list, and a match turned up in 40 minutes. )",

She asks the government to \" do everything that they can to bring my husband, child, and i to safety and freedom. \" the ap notes that though coleman mentions a child, one isn't seen in the videos and the families have no information on its name or gender.

After a second officer arrived on the scene, swansea police administed a standardized field sobriety test. Busch appeared unable to keep a single train of thought, and his speech appeared mumbling and slurred but he blew a.000 on a breathalyzer test, fox 2 st. Louis reported, citing court records. His wife told officers busch has anxiety issues and is off his medication because of recent fertility treatments, according records obtained by fox 2. Officers also believed busch may have been under the influence of a controlled substance, according to court records. The 53-year-old then told officers that he had a conceal carry license and had a rohrbaugh r9 9mm gun in the front pocket of his pants, adding that the weapon was \"hot. \" busch then removed the gun from his pocket. Officers also found dexamethasone, which is used to treat inflammatory conditions such as allergies, in his pocket, but the prescription was for busch's wife, court records obtained by fox 2 said"

How so? the house minority leader condemned \" antifa \" protesters who turned violent at a weekend protest in berkeley. \" our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public, no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts, \" she said in a statement. \" the violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted. \" in doing so, she becomes one of the few high-ranking democrats to call out the antifa movement, notes mediaite. \" antifa \" is shorthand for \" anti-fascist, \" and adherents have sprung up in groups around the nation to counter white supremacist and other far-right groups. President trump drew condemnation when he called out antifa protesters in blaming \" both sides \" for the violence in charlottesville, and his supporters have argued that the movement gets too little scrutiny. In a washington post op-ed, marc thiessen calls antifa protesters \" neo-communists \" and says their willingness to use violence makes them \" morally indistinguishable \" from neo-nazis. He praised pelosi's statement and called for other top democrats to follow suit. \" if black-clad neo-nazis had attacked peaceful protesters at a ' no to racism in america ' march in berkeley, politicians in washington would be falling over themselves to express their disgust — and any who failed to do so would be vilified, \" he writes. \" but when neo-communists commit this kind of violence, they get a pass from the left. \" ( don't expect the antifa movement to go away anytime soon. )",

According to researchers, washing your hands in cold water is just as effective at reducing bacteria as washing your hands in hot water. That's based on a small study of 21 people described in the journal of food protection. Over a six-month period, rutgers university researchers covered participants ' hands in harmless bacteria, then asked them to wash their hands 20 times each with water at around 60 degrees, 79 degrees, and 100 degrees fahrenheit. They also experimented with the amount of soap used: either 0.5, 1, or 2 milliliters. No matter the amount of soap or the water temperature, the amount of bacteria removed when washing was the same, reports the bbc. \" as far as effectiveness, this study shows us that the temperature of the water used didn't matter, \" researcher donald schaffner says in a release. Currently, the fda recommends restaurants use water at 100 degrees for hand-washing, but schaffner says there should now be a policy change. \" we are wasting energy to heat water to a level that is not necessary, \" he says. While the cdc notes individuals can use either warm or cold water, it also recommends washing hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. The rutgers study, however, found \" washing for 10 seconds significantly removed bacteria from the hands, \" schaffner says.

Swift offers up her opinion on the state of the music industry in the journal, noting that though \" many ( many ) people... Predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity, \" people are still buying albums — but they only buy \" the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart. \" that means it's harder nowadays to put out a multiplatinum album, but artists should feel challenged and motivated by that, she writes. Instead of practically giving their music away ( \" music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. \" ), artists should focus on keeping their fans engaged. How? well, swift notes that since most of her fans can watch her concerts on youtube before actually attending a show, she brings out \" dozens of special guest performers \" to keep things fresh; she also recommends mixing genres and trying new things because nowadays, \" anything goes. \" kids these days \" want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe, \" she writes. Her other piece of advice: engage with your fans on social media. \" in the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans — not the other way around. \" predictably, many bloggers have responded to swift's op-ed: \" at least one person in the music industry made $ 64 million last year, \" writes caity weaver on gawker. \" it's important to be an optimist and have a good attitude. \" indeed, writes lindsey weber on vulture, swift's main point seems to be that people are still buying albums... \" albums like hers, you see. \" \" of course, taylor swift is ' enthusiastic ' \" about the music biz, writes esther zuckerman on the wire. \" you've seen her'surprise face, ' right? \" \" the piece lets loose a spectacular string of metaphors, similes, and analogies comparing music to affairs of the heart, \" writes jordan weissmann on slate. \" which is to say, it's exactly what you'd want from a taylor swift op-ed in america's most prestigious business newspaper. \"",

        "summary": "On the heels of a contentious report that the cia illegally spied on aides to the senate intelligence committee as they gathered information for a report on the cia's torture program comes yet more contention. Mcclatchy, which first reported on the allegations yesterday, now reports that those senate staffers tasked with using computers at cia headquarters to review documents related to the program took classified material with them. The cia then reportedly complained about the pilfered documents to the committee in january, leading committee staffers to determine that the computers they had used were monitored. Via a source, mcclatchy reports that senate staffers spotted a draft of an internal review of the materials the intelligence committee had been given by the cia, completed at the request of leon panetta. This draft was uncovered after the cia issued its official response to the report, and the staffers felt the draft indicated that the cia had disputed findings it actually internally determined to be correct. The source says the staffers printed the material and ferried it to capitol hill. Mcclatchy notes that sen. Mark udall in december called for the panetta review to be released, but didn't specify how he was made aware of its existence. Meanwhile, cia director john brennan didn't mince words over the senate's accusations yesterday, calling them \" spurious \" and \" wholly unsupported by the facts, \" and implying that the committee was the one to commit an offense, notes the guardian.",

They say he kept to himself, paid bills promptly, and never requested drugs or prostitutes.

        "summary": "An illinois woman accused of giving her severely disabled adult daughter a fatal dose of meds last year before trying to kill herself stood before a cook county judge wednesday, explaining that her love for her daughter was so strong that killing her seemed the most humane thing to do. Per the chicago tribune, 56-year-old bonnie liltz — whose sentence for pleading guilty on involuntary manslaughter charges will be announced next week — told judge joel greenblatt's courtroom that \" every day was a privilege \" caring for courtney. Wls notes the 28-year-old was \" profoundly disabled \" by cerebral palsy and couldn't \" communicate, eat, or bathe herself. \" the single mother said the day she adopted 5-year-old courtney had been \" the happiest day of my life \" and that it wasn't courtney's disabilities or the stress of caring for courtney that led her to do what authorities say she did: add powder from broken-up medicine capsules into courtney's feeding tubes, then into her own wine. Instead, it was the thought of courtney suffering if liltz, said to have recurring cancer and intestinal issues, died from her own illnesses. \" i prayed to god, ' what's going to happen to courtney? ' \" she told the court about the morning of may 27, 2015, when she woke up with pain so terrible she thought she was dying. \" i felt the only place she would be safe would be in heaven with me. \" she noted courtney had been institutionalized in 2012 while she ( liltz ) was hospitalized, and that courtney had come back dirty and upset, per the daily herald. Liltz's parents and sister, who found liltz and courtney unconscious that day in may, stand by her, with her dad calling her actions \" an act of love. \" the judge could give liltz, who had originally been charged with first-degree murder before the charges were lessened, anything from probation to 14 years in prison; prosecutors have recommended four years ' probation. Liltz, meanwhile, said she wished she could \" turn back the clock and … care for [ courtney ] again. \" ( a british mom said she killed her adult son \" with love. \" )",

In another tweet, he said \" certain middle eastern countries agree with the ban, \" because \" they know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction! \" the white house has vowed to appeal us district judge james robart's restraining order against the ban. A roundup of coverage: airlines including british airways, emirates, and lufthansa allowed travelers from the affected countries to board flights to the us after the judge's order late friday. \" i am very happy that we are going to travel today, \" an iraqi man on his way to start a new life with his family in the us tells reuters. He was banned from traveling last week despite having a us visa. \" even at that time, i was optimistic, \" he says. \" i was sure that we were going to go. I didn't surrender and i fought for my right and other people's right. \" the department of homeland security is complying with the judge's order and has suspended all actions implementing the trump travel ban, cnn reports. Us customs and border protection has told airlines that visas canceled under the ban are now valid again, including visas issued to refugees. The washington post describes the ruling as a \" rare and early rebuke of presidential authority, \" and predicts that there will be years of legal fights ahead as trump keeps pushing the limits of executive power. Uber ceo travis kalanick says the company is buying tickets for drivers and their families stranded overseas by the ruling, the ap reports. Uber's head of litigation is \" buying a whole bunch of airline tickets asap!! \" kalanick tweeted. The bbc reports that the trump travel ban is being challenged in virginia, new york, massachusetts, and michigan, as well as washington, where the restraining order with nationwide effect was issued. Washington attorney general bob ferguson describes the trump ban as \" un-american. \" \" folks who had visas, folks who were allowed to travel were denied that right without any due process whatsoever — that's un-american and unconstitutional, \" he says. Senate minority leader chuck schumer warned that trump's attack on the judge means that democrats will push even harder for a supreme court nominee who demonstrates that they can be an independent check on the president.

Now the retail giant is being accused of selling fake craft beers in order to trick customers into paying more in a lawsuit that calls walmart's craft beers \" wholesale fiction. \" walmart says it's working in \" collaboration \" with trouble brewing to brew four styles of craft beer. But here's the catch: there's no such us brewery. Government filings say the beer is actually made by wx brands, and the address listed is for genesee brewing, which is based in costa rica and makes \" cheap college-party staples. \" so it's little surprise one taste-tester describes walmart's red flag amber as \" good for flip cup. \" the four trouble brewing craft beers are stocked at more than 3,000 walmarts in 45 states, where consumerist reports they're placed on shelves with other craft beers. But the lawsuit alleges the beers — whose packaging gives no evidence walmart has anything to do with them — don't meet any of the standards for craft beers listed by the brewers association, according to courthouse news. Those standards include being less than 25 % owned by a non-craft brewer and making fewer than 6 million barrels of beer per year. An attorney believes wx brands/genesee brewing makes 6 million barrels of beer for walmart's trouble brewing brand alone. The lawsuit, filed in ohio, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for anyone in the state who's purchased a trouble brewing beer.

        "summary": "The romantic poet lord byron found inspiration for one of his greatest works in a \" single star \" that he said reigned with the moon \" o ' er half the lonely heaven. \" so here comes science to replace the romance with fact: a physics professor at texas state university believes byron's muse was not a star at all, but rather the largest planet in our solar system. According to astronomer donald olson, the english poet found inspiration for one section of \" childe harold's pilgrimage \" during a night spent riding in la mira, italy, on aug. 20, 1817, live science reports. Olson found the date for the poetic evening in the diary of john cam hobhouse, a close friend of byron's, per the smithsonian.

The coconino county sheriff's office has confirmed on facebook that the body of jerold joseph williams was found last night in kaibab national forest, where he disappeared while camping last thursday. Police tell nbc news jerold was at most 200 yards from a campsite the boy and his parents were sharing with a 20-strong group of friends and relatives when he escaped his mother's sight. A previous report from abc15 suggests his mother was with him at the time, and that he vanished from her view as he started to chase grasshoppers. More than 500 volunteers searched the rugged terrain for the missing boy over a five-day span alongside military helicopters carrying night vision equipment and crews with dogs and atvs, reports abc15. The ap describes volunteers trudging shoulder-to-shoulder through thick vegetation in the pouring rain yesterday in search of jerold, whose body was found by a member of the search team. A sheriff's rep last night said a positive id would need to be made using dental records and fingerprints. A cause of death has not been released; officials previously said there was no indication of foul play.",

But weed-toking drivers show marked differences from those who drink alcohol: those who've smoked frequently seem very aware of it. They often drive slowly and ensure space between them and other cars in an effort to stay safe, the ap notes. And indeed, studies on the dangers of such driving are \" highly inconclusive, \" says an expert. They range from showing triple the risk of crashing to apparently showing a decreased risk. Currently, colorado and washington, the only states where recreational pot is legal, have set a thc intoxication level of five parts per billion, but there's no quick way to test a pulled-over driver for the psychoactive ingredient. What's clear in washington is that since the drug was legalized, some 25 % more drivers are testing positive for it — but accident and arrest numbers haven't shown a matching increase, the ap notes. \" right now we have a patchwork system across the nation regarding mandatory drug testing following highway crashes, \" says a former highway safety official; transportation officials are investigating the issue.",

The microsleeps apparently account for extra car crashes and workplace injuries that follow our lost hour each march. \" small changes in the amount of sleep that people get can have major consequences in everyday activities, \" researcher stanley coren wrote in the new england journal of medicine years ago. \" it is likely that the effects are due to sleep loss rather than a nonspecific disruption in circadian rhythm, since gaining an additional hour of sleep at the fall time shift seems to decrease the risk of accidents. \" what to do, then? sleep scientists suggest hitting the hay a little earlier over the first few nights after the time change, and absorbing some extra sun in the evening. But as days grow longer, those bright nights affect the brain and make it harder to fall asleep as early as before, sleep specialist dr. Supat thammasitboon tells the times-picayune. He explains that our brains react to darkness by secreting melatonin, a hormone linked to sleep timing, so longer days make melatonin kick in later. But it seems most people adjust after a couple of weeks. In dire cases, melatonin supplements can be bought over the counter — and if you do it, thammasitboon says, half a pill is often best so you're less groggy in the morning.

He could experience a third enormous surge in the polls, he has a billionaire casino owner backing him, and \" maybe a former bain executive will turn up and admit that he and romney used to smoke cigars filled with $ 100 bills as they laughed maniacally about the companies they'd looted. \" gingrich will certainly stay in the race, writes steve kornacki at salon, but the big question is: for how long? he can stay in \" as long as he wants, \" but the political world may not continue to take him seriously much longer. \" if he's getting clobbered in primaries and caucuses, accumulating few delegates, unable to force romney into debates, and largely ignored by the media, then his lingering presence won't really be a problem for romney. \"",

A source said: \" working and living together was incredibly intense and it basically overwhelmed their relationship. \" the pair have a very different work ethos. Whereas sam wanted to switch off after a long day, kate liked to analyse every nuance of her performance. It was just too much. \" the problem got worse when sam was subsequently away in florida, connecticut and arizona while filming away we go and suddenly spent a lot of time separated from kate, 34, and children joe and mia. The source added: \" after being in each other's pockets for so long, this, ironically, also proved really difficult. \" so last year they both made a commitment to spend the year together and do less work. But it actually ended up with them both going a bit stir crazy. \" they are both really driven and were arguing more than ever before. \" kate even did a really small amount of filming towards the end of the year just to try and release some of the pressure and tension that had built up between them.

They were so quick to adapt. \" this \" implicit learning, \" he says, can last for a year and halves seniors ' risk of falling. It costs $ 30 billion a year to treat injuries stemming from falls, which can start a nose dive in seniors ' health. Colleagues say pai's subconscious learning theory — which needs several more years of study — is promising and could become part of seniors'standard care. To that end, pai is now testing his \" vaccine against falls \" with seniors on smaller, computerized treadmills that are designed for doctor's offices, clinics, and physical therapy centers. Which means grandma's yearly trip to the doctor may someday include a walk on such a treadmill, learning how to keep both feet on the ground. ( another novel treatment? hot cocoa for alzheimer's. )",

            "Stars may burn out and die, but their light goes on forever. All the light ever produced by stars is still circulating through the universe, a phenomenon known as extragalactic background light or ebl. This light is a kind of cosmic \" fog \" that dims light from distant stars passing through it, much like the beams from a lighthouse are dimmed by real fog. Now, for the first time, astronomers have been able to measure the sum total of ebl and to calculate the spacing of stars in the cosmos. They reported thursday in the journal science that the average density of stars in the universe is about 1.4 per 100 billion cubic light-years. That means that the average distance between stars is about 4,150 light-years. To measure ebl, astronomers needed a kind of galactic signpost to allow them to determine how much light from distant stars is being lost. As their measuring marks, a team headed by marco ajello of stanford university chose blazars -- galaxies emitting large amounts of gamma-radiation. Blazars are characterized by massive black holes at the center of the galaxies. As matter falls into the black hole, some of it is accelerated outward at nearly the speed of light. In the gamma-ray spectrum, these beams of light are especially bright and their sources are called blazars. The highest-energy gamma rays tend to pass through",
            "This plot shows the locations of 150 blazars ( green dots ) used in the ebl study. The background map shows the entire sky and was constructed from four years of gamma rays with energies above 10 billion electron volts detected by fermi.

            "Stars may burn out and die, but their light goes on forever. All the light ever produced by stars is still circulating through the universe, a phenomenon known as extragalactic background light or ebl. This light is a kind of cosmic \" fog \" that dims light from distant stars passing through it, much like the beams from a lighthouse are dimmed by real fog. Now, for the first time, astronomers have been able to measure the sum total of ebl and to calculate the spacing of stars in the cosmos. They reported thursday in the journal science that the average density of stars in the universe is about 1.4 per 100 billion cubic light-years. That means that the average distance between stars is about 4,150 light-years. To measure ebl, astronomers needed a kind of galactic signpost to allow them to determine how much light from distant stars is being lost. As their measuring marks, a team headed by marco ajello of stanford university chose blazars -- galaxies emitting large amounts of gamma-radiation. Blazars are characterized by massive black holes at the center of the galaxies. As matter falls into the black hole, some of it is accelerated outward at nearly the speed of light. In the gamma-ray spectrum, these beams of light are especially bright and their sources are called blazars. The highest-energy gamma rays tend to pass through",
            "This plot shows the locations of 150 blazars ( green dots ) used in the ebl study. The background map shows the entire sky and was constructed from four years of gamma rays with energies above 10 billion electron volts detected by fermi.

Lovett — who has pleaded not guilty — later told police ryan had been sick for two weeks and collapsed while trying to reach the bathroom.

        "summary": "A german u-boat set off from the north coast of germany for a routine patrol with four officers and 31 crew members on board on jan. 13, 1915. It was never seen again. The mysterious disappearance sparked a rumor — believed to have been started by another u-boat commander — that the submarine had washed ashore in britain with all those on board dead, perhaps caused by a gas leak, reports the telegraph. After more than a century, that story has now been debunked. Offshore wind farm developers uncovered the wreckage of the u-31 sub in 100 feet of water about 55 miles off the coast of norfolk, england. \" we looked across the maps we had and this wreck didn't appear on any of them, \" a member of the survey team tells itv news. \" we knew pretty quickly that we'd found something really special. \" the scanning team first spotted the wreck in 2012, but marine archaeologists didn't identify it as the u-boat until now. Divers initially suspected it was a dutch sub that vanished in world war ii. The u-boat is believed to have struck a mine and sunk. \" after being on the seabed for over a century, the submarine appears to be in a remarkable condition with the conning tower present and the bows partially buried, \" says one of the marine archaeologists on the project. \" relatives and descendants of those lost in the u-31 may now take some comfort in knowing the final resting place of the crew. \" the wreck will remain on the seabed and the director of the wind farm project says it will be left undisturbed.

        "summary": "Renowned california climber, surfer, yoga instructor, cyclist, and traveler brad parker was dehydrated and seemed fatigued on the day that he died, according to various people who encountered him before he fell while climbing in yosemite national park. After climbing a route with his girlfriend and proposing at the top ( she said \" yes \" ), he told her it was the happiest day of his life. But it turned tragic when he went on to tackle another route solo — the matthes crest traverse is considered easy to experienced climbers, but he was climbing without any ropes or gear — where, according to climbers who passed him, he appeared tired and complained of dehydration and cramping, the san francisco chronicle reports. After climbing cathedral peak with jainee dial, the newly-engaged parker hiked three miles alone to the tuolumne meadow to climb a traverse on the granite crest, known for being a lateral and not a technically difficult climb, according to a park ranger. Still, in some areas there are 300-foot drops, which is how far he fell at around 5: 45pm saturday. He was reportedly training for a major climb at the time. Parker's father tells the press democrat that his son once climbed the area's famous half dome in near-record time, but that his passion for climbing was \" always a concern \" to his parents. ( meanwhile, three more climbers have fallen to their deaths on europe's mont blanc just days after several others died. )",

Republicans say more revenue is out of the question, and they're not desperate to avoid sequester.

But party leaders say they see no clear path to compromise, particularly given a growing sentiment among republicans to pocket the cuts and move on to larger battles over health and retirement spending. Adding to the sense of inevitability is the belief that the cuts, known as the sequester, would improve the government's bottom line without devastating the broader economy. Though the cuts would hamper economic growth, especially in the washington region, the forecast is far less dire than with other recent fiscal deadlines, and financial markets are not pressing washington to act.

The idea would essentially be a continuation of the current strategy to shift the burden of $ 1.2 trillion in cuts to defense and spending on other domestic programs by increasing tax revenue and finding spending cuts both parties could agree to. But by insisting that future deferrals of the spending cuts, known in budgetary jargon as the sequester, include new revenue, mr. Reid is almost certain to run into stiff opposition from republicans, who have insisted they aren't open to any further tax increases. Two top gop senate leaders were quickly dismissive of the plan, saying that they wouldn't contemplate any tax increases as part of an effort to avoid the sequester beginning to take effect."

The idea would essentially be a continuation of the current strategy to shift the burden of $ 1.2 trillion in cuts to defense and spending on other domestic programs by increasing tax revenue and finding spending cuts both parties could agree to. But by insisting that future deferrals of the spending cuts, known in budgetary jargon as the sequester, include new revenue, mr. Reid is almost certain to run into stiff opposition from republicans, who have insisted they aren't open to any further tax increases. Two top gop senate leaders were quickly dismissive of the plan, saying that they wouldn't contemplate any tax increases as part of an effort to avoid the sequester beginning to take effect."

As the house of commons voted on a procedural motion, pat martin voted, then dashed out of the chamber unexpectedly before returning a short while later. When a conservative party mp suggested he should forfeit his vote — mps aren't to leave the chamber during a vote — the new democratic party member gave this response: \" they had men's underwear on for half price and i bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me. I find it difficult to sit for any length of time. \" cheers and laughter ensued, and his vote was allowed to stand. Martin later told cbc news it was a joke and that he actually left his seat to talk to the house speaker. But since \" some conservative mp got his knickers in a knot, i think, about the fact that i stepped away from my chair for a couple of seconds...
