Brian schweitzer has all but declared open season on gray wolves, ordering wildlife officers not to investigate or prosecute ranchers who shoot the endangered animals to protect their livestock, cnn reports. He's also directed them to kill entire packs if they endanger the state's elk or livestock. Schweitzer, a democrat, revealed his plan in a defiant letter to ken salazar on wednesday, arguing that montana's wolf population had \"fully recovered. \" \"i am profoundly frustrated, \" schweitzer wrote. \"i cannot continue to ignore the crying need for workable wolf management while montana waits, and waits, and waits. \" the interior department responded by saying that, though wolf management should be turned over to states, \"the governor's letter is not the answer. \" last week, montana's us senators introduced a bill to take gray wolves off the endangered species list.

Schweitzer ordered wildlife officers not to investigate or prosecute ranchers who shoot wolves that attack livestock, and he authorized the killing of entire packs that endanger livestock or elk. The democratic governor outlined his initiative wednesday in a defiant letter to interior secretary ken salazar, a copy of which was published on schweitzer's website. \" at this point, i can do nothing less and still maintain my commitment as governor to uphold the rights of our citizens to protect their property and to continue to enjoy montana's cherished wildlife heritage and traditions, \" schweitzer wrote. Montana livestock producers are frustrated over rules that protect wolves, which were hunted to near-extinction in the early 20th century. Gray wolves killed livestock at a rate of one animal per day in 2009, including 148 sheep in one herd in august that year, the missoulian newspaper reported. Kendra barkoff, a spokeswoman for the department of interior, told the missoulian that wolf management should be turned over to states with approved management plans. \" but the governor's letter is not the answer, \" she added. \" it's unnecessarily heavy-handed, \" said mike leahy, director of the rocky mountain region for defenders of wildlife. \" any concerns that wolves create can be addressed in a targeted fashion, and there's no reason for states to start whacking wolves in large numbers. \" \" the frustration over wolf impacts on the ground is overblown, \" he added. \" these are impacts that are manageable. \" gray wolves were listed as an endangered species in 1973.

        "summary": "Conservatives like ted cruz and sarah palin have alleged that president obama's \" lawlessness \" — in the form of his jury-rigged de facto dream act implementation — is to blame for the children currently swarming across the border. But the truth is \" that this crisis has actually been brought about by obama following the law, \" points out dana milbank at the washington post. Indeed several columnists today are focusing on the impact of an obscure 2008 human trafficking law that passed both houses by unanimous consent and was signed by george w. Bush. Here's what they're saying: the law guarantees child immigrants a hearing, allowing them to stay with family in the us in the meantime. The process can take 18 months, and most children simply don't show up for their hearings when the time comes. The law was a well-intentioned attempt to fight sex-trafficking, but it's \" mutated into a source of chaos, \" writes charles lane at the washington post. Trafficking mafias are getting rich on it and an unforeseen wave of central american immigrants are crowding detention centers. Children wind up growing up undocumented and living in the shadows. \" this isn't anyone's idea of sustainable immigration … some call the situation a humanitarian crisis. I prefer ' national scandal. ' \" lane prefers amending the law to exclude unaccompanied central american minors, so there's no incentive to send them. But charles blow at the new york times rejects that, saying that the premise of the law is \" noble and humane. \" \" these are children we are talking about, not just numbers, not just data, not political pawns. \" this is the fundamental problem; everyone agrees our immigration laws are out of date and broken, but not on how to fix them, observes rob hunter at ktar. He advises lawmakers to remember what john f. Kennedy said: \" there are risks and costs to action. But they are far less than the long range risks of comfortable inaction. \"",

Some explanations are more grounded in science, if not in evidence. These include oceanic flatulence ( methane gas erupting from ocean sediments ) and disruptions in geomagnetic lines of flux.

In the latter, a husky dude is typically found biting into a burger while leaning against his truck, without a care in the world about the caloric content of his meal or that he's getting ketchup all over his face. Are advertisers telling us that meat is masculine and diet-friendly food is girly, or are they playing into our preconceived notions of these stereotypes? though it's difficult to say which came first, the chicken or the egg, a new study published in the journal social psychology touches upon how food manufacturers play into the pervasive belief that healthy food is somehow inherently feminine. The report, conducted by the university of manitoba and cheekily titled \"macho nachos: the implicit effects of gendered food packaging on preferences for healthy and unhealthy foods, \" surveyed 93 adults about how they would gender-categorize foods if they were prepared two different ways, with one version being healthier than the other ( for example, baked chicken versus fried chicken, or light potato chips versus regular potato chips ).

            "Getty images the moon is home to some of the most lyrically named bodies of water that never existed. The sea of tranquility is familiar enough, but what about the ocean of storms, the sea of nectar, the lake of forgetfulness, the bay of rainbows? altogether, the lunar map features 20 seas, 14 bays, 20 lakes and one ocean. That's both poetic and ironic, because a world that's positively drenched in aquatic names has not a drop of actual water. Or that's what we always thought. In recent years, however, evidence for a watery moon has been mounting — particularly from nasa's lunar reconnaissance orbiter and its sister probe, the lunar crater observation and sensing satellite. The moon is hardly a sodden place — it's wetter than the sahara desert, but that's about it. Still, that's huge compared to what we once believed. Now, a paper in science explains in greater detail than ever how water got to so unlikely a place and how it survived the fiery violence that gave birth to the moon in the first place. The prevailing — and now all-but universally accepted — theory for how the earth-moon system came to be was first proposed in 1975 and quickly became known as the big whack theory. About",

Scientists have found that it's not any better than regular soap in killing bacteria, they report in the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The news comes out of south korea, where researchers examined the effectiveness of a common ingredient in such soaps called triclosan, according to science daily. Volunteers washed their hands for the recommended 20 seconds under room- or warm-temperature water, and germs were killed as effectively whether they used antibacterial or non-antibacterial suds. The results held true in both lab and real-world experiments. The upshot is that while it's important to wash your hands thoroughly, \" plain old soap and water will do just as well, \" in the words of time. It turns out that antibacterial soap can make a significant difference — but only if it's applied for nine hours. The researchers suggest the perceived superiority of antibacterial soap is a marketing ploy, adding that \" advertisement and consumer belief regarding the effectiveness of antibacterial soaps needs to be addressed. \" not coincidentally, the fda is trying to do just that, demanding that manufacturers provide more evidence to back up their claims and more information about the potential health risks of ingredients such as triclosan, notes the huffington post.

        "summary": "It seems like an expected enough conclusion: a starbucks is good for the neighborhood. But just how good? zillow ceo spencer rascoff and chief economist stan humphries dig into the question by syncing their own real-estate data with known starbucks locations. What they conclude: \" starbucks equates with venti-sized home-value appreciation. \" and starbucks isn't chasing the higher home values — it seems to be creating them. In an excerpt from zillow talk: the new rules of real estate running on quartz, they acknowledge that the locations where starbucks sets up shop are typically higher value ones. But consider the effect on appreciation. Three ways they analyzed the data: \" a home that is now [ within a quarter-mile of ] a starbucks would have sold, on average, for $ 137,000 [ in 1997 ]. A home that is not near a starbucks would have sold, on average, for $ 102,000. Fast-forward 17 years to 2014. That average american home has now appreciated 65 %, to $ 168,000. But the starbucks-adjacent property has far outpaced that, appreciating 96 % to $ 269,000. \" to verify there was indeed a \" starbucks effect \" happening, they also looked at homes within the same distance from a dunkin'donuts. Those near the latter still enjoyed appreciation above the norm since 1997, but at 80 %. To try to verify that the \" starbucks effect \" really took place after the opening ( rather than already being present ), it looked at homes within a 1/4-mile and 1/2-mile ring of a starbucks location in the five years after the store opened. Those in the closest ring appreciated about 21 %, to the outer ring's 17 %. Besides buying near a starbucks, what other insights does rascoff offer? from the new york post: undertake a mid-range bathroom remodel, not a kitchen remodel, to get a better return on investment; avoid the words \" unique \" or \" potential \" in your real estate listing; and street name suffixes like \" way \" and \" sunset \" correspond to higher home values than \" street. \" ( if you enjoy a nice starbucks frappuccino, you may want to thank kenny g. )",

        "summary": "The eve of the 10th anniversary of the start of the us-led invasion of iraq brings more bloodshed: at least 56 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded in bombings in and around baghdad today, the ap reports. Bombs rocked a market and a restaurant in the capital; another bomb was attached to the bottom of a minibus. A suicide attack, meanwhile, struck a police base in a shiite area south of baghdad, reuters reports. The bombings came 10 years to the day after washington announced the start of the invasion on march 19, 2003 — though by that time it was already the following morning in iraq. Today's attacks occurred over a two-hour period; no group has claimed responsibility, but sunni militants have pledged increased attacks this year. Indeed, sectarian conflict is more of a focus for locals than the anniversary, the new york times notes. \" people are not interested in ( the anniversary ). They are desperate and want to see real change, so they've stopped looking at the news or remembering past events, \" a local man tells the times. Adds another: \" i don't think we need to do any kind of celebrating or make an effort to remember that day. I think even the americans wish they could forget it. \"",

Senate majority leader mitch mcconnell appears to have promised that at some point during that period, he will bring a bill to the floor that will address the fate of the 690,000 young unauthorized immigrants facing the loss of their protections under the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program. This is something both parties supposedly agree congress needs to do. But in the months congress has spent working on this problem since the trump administration announced in september that it would wind down daca, the negotiations have gone around in circles.

The \" economy class cabin hexagon \" turns the middle seat in rows of three around, so one passenger is facing two others. The patent says it will allow airlines to fit more passengers in cabins while increasing \" space available at the shoulder and arm area, \" but it seems like most people would rather walk. A roundup of reactions: \" if you're traveling with your kid or spouse, being face-to-face can be nice, \" writes jordan golson at wired. \" but if you're around the sort of people one usually sits next to on airplanes, it would be horrible. At least if you're all facing the same direction, you can pretend they don't exist. Here, if you're a human with peripheral vision, fat chance of that. \" even worse than staring at a seat back is staring at a \" stranger who's probably a mouth-breather with a bad nail-biting habit, \" writes adam clark estes at gizmodo. \" what's even worse than that is the new staggered design also ensures that you're flanked by two more strangers ' faces, a peripheral inconvenience [ that's ] bound to be as anxiety-inducing as the very act of soaring 30,000 feet in the air inside a metal tube that weighs several tons. \" the new arrangement \" threatens to eliminate every last ounce of air travelers'dignity, \" writes claire zillman at fortune, who decides shoulder space is overrated and most people would sooner \" have their arms totally immobilized instead of having to sit inches away from strangers, while positioned face-to-face. \" at the verge, ross miller calls the \" evil \" design a \" truly nightmarish idea that lives somewhere between saw and the twilight zone, \" and he wonders what would happen during turbulence. Shawn langlois at marketwatch calls the design \" the worst air travel idea since pay toilets, \" but he notes that there are no current plans to install hexagon seating in planes.

That's not the plot of an unoriginal new movie, but the scenario behind a recent nasa-fema exercise, the new york times reports. Reps from nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, the energy department's national laboratories, the air force, and the california governor's office of emergency services were among those that gathered for the oct. 25 exercise, which simulated the discovery of an asteroid and the gradual realization that it would hit in 2020. In the simulation, it took from now until november 2017 to determine that there was a 100 % probability of the asteroid striking, and that the impact would occur across southern california or just off it. Experts presented estimates for population displacement and infrastructure damage, as well as ways to present accurate information to the public, according to nasa's jet propulsion laboratory. \" the high degree of initial uncertainty coupled with the relatively long impact warning time made this scenario unique and especially challenging for emergency managers, \" says fema national response coordination branch chief leviticus a. Lewis. \" it's quite different from preparing for an event with a much shorter timeline, such as a hurricane. \" but four years wasn't long enough to prepare a \" deflection mission, \" the times notes, meaning that the exercise focused on evacuation scenarios.

He explained at a wednesday news conference that when he was \" little \" he wanted to be an astronaut, then he met steve harvey and became inspired to work in front of the cameras — so he decided to do both.

A seattle house went up in flames last night after a tenant tried to flush out an eight-legged foe in his laundry room by setting it on fire using a lighter and spray paint, komo news reports. A spokesman for the seattle fire department says that the man couldn't put out the fire himself and that firefighters originally fought the fire from a distance because there was speculation of ammunition inside the home — that threat was later ruled out, according to kiro-tv. There were said to be no injuries, but the rental home and its contents reportedly sustained $ 60,000 worth of damage. While all this was going on, neighbors scrambled to hose down their own homes and yards to keep the fire away. \"i saw flames coming out of the side of the house and heard popping sounds, \" one of the neighbors tells kiro-tv. Another neighbor adds, \"there were giant clouds of smoke pouring out of the windows. \" the red cross is said to be helping the man and a second tenant ( his mother ) find new lodgings.

According to the seattle times, a 2,500-pound, plaster-encased lump of dirt and rock arrived at the burke museum in seattle on thursday. In october, a team will remove the nearly 4-foot tyrannosaurus skull hiding inside. It's one of the 15 most complete tyrannosaurus skulls in the world. Researchers hope to use the skull to learn more about the tyrannosaurus ' jaw strength and eating habits. The skull comes from a 40-foot-long tyrannosaurus that died 66 million years ago and was found buried in montana by two burke museum volunteers — luke tufts and jason love. So far, 20 % of the dinosaur's bones have been dug up, and researchers are confident there are still more to be found at the site. The museum plans to put the tyrannosaurus skull on exhibit in march and hopes to display the entire skeleton in 2019. It will be the first major dinosaur specimen on display in washington, kiro reports. \" we think the tufts-love rex is going to be an iconic specimen for the burke museum and the state of washington, \" the ap quotes a museum curator as saying.",

Seminole county judge jerri collins and the florida judicial qualifications commission reached a plea agreement of a public reprimand for her actions after charges were formally made wednesday with the florida supreme court. During a july 30 hearing, collins sentenced the crying lake mary woman to three days in jail for contempt. In its decision to recommend a public reprimand, the commission said collins \" admits that her discourteous conduct was inappropriate and should not have occurred, \" per wftv. The commission also noted that the court system failed the abuse victim, who did not have a lawyer during her contempt hearing, by not informing her she had a right to present evidence or testify on her own behalf, the orlando sentinel reports. Alex williams, the commission's assistant general counsel, says the supreme court will now decide whether it will accept or reject the agreement. If the supreme court accepts the recommendation, collins will have to appear before the state's top court in tallahassee to be formally reprimanded.

A man in northern germany turned up a gold coin in october while searching near a pine tree at a field's edge. Further searching yielded nine coins, at which point florian bautsch, 31 — described by the local as an \" amateur archaeologist \" and \" certified metal detectorist \" and by the irish mirror as a \" licensed treasure hunter \" — called in the professionals. Archaeologists ultimately found an additional 207 gold coins that archaeologist edgar ring says he is confident once belonged to the nazi-era reichsbank. A second archaeologist tells bild, \" we believe that the coins were hidden in the last days of world war ii or shortly after the war there. \" experts were able to date the coins, which themselves were minted between 1831 and 1910, thanks in part to two seals that had formerly been part of the two pouches that held the coins; those pouches no longer exist. Chemical analysis dated the seals — which are made of aluminum, per reuters — and other remnants to between 1940 and 1950. The seals featured a swastika, imperial eagle, and the words \" reichsbank berlin 244. \" the mirror puts forth the theory that the gold was left there \" in the chaotic final days of the war \" and notes that the reichsbank hid coins throughout the country as berlin came under attack. The gold is believed to be worth about $ 50,000, though bautsch's finder's fee will be only about $ 2,700. They were turned up near luneburg, where the \" last auschwitz trial on earth \" just came to its end. ( read the tragic tale of the man who wouldn't salute hitler. )",

Serving 5 ½ years for a string of thefts and not considered dangerous, hirao, 27, was nabbed near a hiroshima train station, and a video aired on local tv showed a man said to be hirao trying to flee over a concrete wall before being yanked to the ground by police, the ap reports. Hirao stymied those looking for him since his escape on april 8 from the minimum-security prison, which has no walls or fences. Hirao's fingerprints were found during the search, and he apparently went on a theft spree, taking the socks and phones, as well as a wallet, sandals, and even a car key, allegedly leaving a note that said: \" i ' m borrowing your car but i ' ll never damage it. \" hirao is said to have told cops he first hunkered down in various vacant houses scattered around the island — many of them vacation homes empty for the season — but that strategy eventually tired him out, so he decided to swim to the mainland, then take a train to hiroshima. \" i deeply apologize to local residents and many people for troubling and worrying them for such a long time, \" says justice minister yoko kawakami in a statement.

More on the situation: background: ri was the one who previously likened trump to a barking dog, and in a un speech on saturday, he called president trump \" a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency \" whose decision to call kim jong un \" rocket man \" makes \" our rocket's visit to the entire us mainland inevitable all the more. \" trump responded, tweeting this saturday night: \" just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at un. If he echoes thoughts of little rocket man, they won't be around much longer! \" today's response to ri: sarah huckabee sanders addressed the subject head-on in monday's white house press briefing. \" we've not declared war on north korea, and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd. \" cbs news has more: \" it's never appropriate for a country to shoot down another country's aircraft when it's over international waters. Our goal is still the same: we continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the korean peninsula. That's our focus, doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point. \" \" how worried should we be? \" that's the question joshua keating asks at slate. It's \" pretty scary \" stuff, he admits, but he cautions against overreacting and explains why. He also points out that \" in some sense the us and north korea are already at war, \" as the korean war of 1950-1953 didn't end with a peace treaty. About those bombers: the ap reports america flexed its military muscle on saturday as well, with us bombers and fighter escorts entering international airspace off north korea's east coast and flying to the farthest point north of the demilitarized zone of any american aircraft in the 21st century. Who is ri, anyway? according to a sept. 16 article in the atlantic by joel s. Wit,",

Now a french airplane manufacturer thinks it has a solution to keep those americans comfortable when they take to the skies. According to nbc news, airbus filed a patent application for a bench seat on feb. 11. The patent shows three different seat-belt configurations that would allow three average-sized passengers, two obese passengers, or two adults with two small children to use the bench. The design also calls for various armrests that can pop down depending on the passenger configuration. The \" utilization of space available in a passenger cabin is of major economic importance, \" the patent application notes. And seating in an aircraft \" should be as flexibly, rapidly, and easily re-configurable as possible. \" the patent application doesn't specifically mention obese passengers, focusing instead on families, senior citizens, and passengers with mobility issues. But cbs reports it could be used to charge obese passengers more, as the bench would otherwise be able to accommodate three to four passengers. An airbus spokesperson says the company isn't necessarily developing the bench, as it files \" hundreds of patents each year. \" but nbc notes the new design hasn't faced the quick online backlash usually seen by other proposed seating alternatives for obese passengers. However, there is one aspect to the new seats that could give all passengers pause: they don't recline.",

        "summary": "It's an unspeakable tragedy, and one that police say started over a failure to say \" checkmate. \" a 10-year-old new jersey boy died on march 6 after jumping from his school's second-story window. After a nearly month-long investigation, the dumont police department says the action followed a game of chess during a recess period at grant elementary school; the unnamed fifth-grader's opponent reportedly didn't say \" checkmate \" before taking his king, and things spiraled from there. A lunch aide says the boy asked his opponent, \" do you want me to do something drastic? \" and then wrote a note that he handed to him. The aide intercepted the note ( the report did not reveal what it said ), put it in her pocket — and then saw the boy go out the window, reports the record. He climbed on a shelving unit in order to do so, and the police chief on wednesday said he went out the window \" headfirst, unforced, unassisted, and of his own accord. \" nj advance media reports it was a roughly 25-foot drop. The report included a statement from a classmate who said the boy had threatened to jump out the window in december after a chess game; it was one of four times the classmate says he made such a comment. The record has a sad detail: the aide cited in the report also noted that the boy had complained earlier that week about being excluded from games, and so she ordered his classmates to play with him. Police ultimately determined \" there was no criminal activity on the part of any individual that would warrant further investigation or criminal charges, \" per the police chief.",

As a young child, he was physically abused and molested by an older friend. \" like most people, i was too afraid to say anything, \" bennington said. \" it was a horrible experience. \" after his parents divorce when he was 11, bennington turned to drugs and alcohol. \"i've done everything, \" he said. \" i got really, really bad. \" the singer would later get sober during his time with linkin park. Here's what else you need to know: rolling stone reports linkin park rode the nu-metal wave to great success with its 2000 album hybrid theory, which blended rap, metal, and electronic music and would eventually be certified diamond with more than 10 million copies sold. The band would go on to have multiple number-one albums while collaborating with jay-z and others. Bennington had also recently served as the lead singer for stone temple pilots. Here's the music video for linkin park's hit \" numb. \" the band released a new music video for the song \" talking to myself \" just minutes after bennington's body was found thursday morning, tmz reports. In an obituary, the new york times describes bennington as a \" ferocious \" singer \" known for his piercing scream and free-flowing anguish. \" it notes bennington and linkin park were scheduled to play a show thursday night in massachusetts. In a tweet, bennington's linkin park bandmate mike shinoda said he's \" shocked and heartbroken. \" vicky cornell — whose husband, chris cornell, was friends with bennington and killed himself earlier this year — tweeted: \" just when i thought my heart couldn't break any more..... I love you. \" entertainment weekly rounds up other celebrity reactions to bennington's death. Jimmy kimmel called the singer \" one of the kindest men i've had on my show, \" and joss whedon said bennington's music \" got me through a horribly dark time. \" finally, bennington talked about a close friend's attempted suicide during an interview with rock sound in march: \" i relate to that. And what's crazy is that after seeing someone i care about go through that, the fact that i wanted to do that myself freaks me out, because it's horrible. \" he later added: \" if it wasn't for music i'd be dead. \"",

        "summary": "The last survivor of the nazi death camp treblinka — which systematically murdered 875,000 people during world war ii, a gruesome toll eclipsed only by auschwitz — died friday at his home in israel at the age of 93. Samuel willenberg, born in poland in 1923, was a physically fit bricklayer at the time of his arrival at treblinka and was sent to work instead of immediately gassed like most prisoners, reports the bbc. He said it was \" chance, sheer chance \" that on aug. 2, 1943, shortly before the camp was destroyed, he managed to escape during a mass revolt, reports the ap. The then-20-year-old had to climb over bodies to mount a fence and then keep running even as friends were shot alongside him. He was one of just 67 people known to have survived treblinka. Willenberg credits his blue eyes and \" non-jewish \" looks with his ability to evade capture in the following weeks as he made his way back to poland and joined the uprising there ( his mother was an orthodox christian but converted to judaism, notes haaretz ). Both his sisters were killed at the camp, and he's survived by a daughter and grandchildren. Eventually willenberg settled down in israel and worked as a surveyor, and he told the ap in 2010: \" i live two lives, one is here and now and the other is what happened there. It never leaves me. It stays in my head. It goes with me always. \" he regularly visited the area to guide youth tour groups and said, \" the world cannot forget treblinka. \" ( the nazis tried to destroy evidence of treblinka in 1943, but archaeologists uncovered some of its secrets. )",

Four months after releasing the girl on the train, the author's first thriller has reportedly broken a record as the fastest adult hardcover to reach a \" staggering \" 2 million copies sold, and a film adaptation is now in the works. \" from every record we can find, this is the fastest that an adult new release has ever reached the 2 million mark, \" a publisher at riverhead books tells the wall street journal. ( as a children's book, harry potter's record of 8.3 million copies sold in 24 hours doesn't count. ) dreamworks nabbed the movie rights to the book before it even hit shelves amid the gone girl craze, and director tate taylor has signed on to direct, reports the hollywood reporter. The book follows rachel, an alcoholic divorcee fascinated by a couple she sees in a house each morning while riding the train. She becomes wrapped up in a mystery when the woman disappears — and rachel may have seen something. Though set in london, it isn't clear if the location will change for the movie. There's no word yet on which actors will star, but hawkins has suggested carey mulligan or kate winslet for rachel and michelle williams for the missing woman. Hawkins is also working on her second psychological thriller, likely due out in 2016, which is \" very different \" than her first, she told entertainment weekly earlier this year. \" it's got quite a gothic feel to it. It's not about witch-hunting, \" she said, but contains \" something about women being accused of witchcraft. \"",

        "summary": "For the past four years, kids under the age of 6 who had a 5-micrograms-per-deciliter blood lead level warranted a public health response. Now a handful of sources who've received word from the cdc say the agency may lower that level another 30 % — down to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter — in the next few months to help id more kids with lead in their systems, as no level in a child is safe, reuters reports. The cdc estimates about 500,000 us kids are at or above the current threshold level, with children in thousands of areas having lead levels even higher than those found in flint, mich., during its water crisis. The agency changes the threshold periodically to adjust to declining level averages nationwide based on a national survey that examines the health and nutritional status of us citizens. \" the revision in the blood lead reference level is to push local governments to tighten the regulations on lead in the environment, \" a university of hong kong professor tells reuters. But not everyone is thrilled with the new lower threshold. Some states, for example, still haven't put in place programs adjusting to the current 5 micrograms per deciliter, down from the previous level of 10 before the 2012 update. Another technical problem: measurement devices and labs can't easily detect lead levels in the 3-micrograms-per-deciliter range. \" you could get false positives and false negatives, \" a washington state department of health epidemiologist says. But perhaps the biggest concern is that critics say resources and funds will now be spread more evenly among more kids with lead exposure, even though the ones with the highest levels need the most help. \" a lower reference level may actually do harm by masking reality — that significant levels of lead exposure are still a problem throughout the country, \" the ceo of a company that makes blood lead testing machines says.",

In fact, \" pundits may be missing this election's biggest surprise, \" reads a headline on an assessment by heather digby parton at salon. \" covering hillary clinton raised the fascinating question of what feminism means for millennial women, many of whom have been singularly unenthused by the prospect of a first female president, \" writes nick bryant in a wide-ranging analysis of the year, from a foreigner's perspective, at the bbc. Win or lose, democrats face a big identity crisis after the election, writes cathleen decker at the los angeles times. \" the coming redefinition echoes battles in the 1980s between establishment democrats and younger, more liberal ones. \" ignore the prophecies about the destruction of the gop if donald trump loses big, writes adam freelander at quartz. In fact, it could make the party stronger. Trump won the nomination \" even though ( or more likely because ) he was the sole candidate to depart from party orthodoxy on taxes, abortion, and gay rights.... If trump's candidacy leads to a loosening of orthodoxy in the party, it ' ll make it easier, not harder, for republican candidates to win future races. \" sam stein at the huffington post thinks trump has changed american politics for the worse in lasting ways. Among other things, lies big and small are now taken for granted. He lays his reasons out here. Millions of trump supporters are being unfairly demonized, writes dan mclaughlin at the national review. \" for more than a few conservatives, the risks of trump outweigh the certainties of hillary. That's not irrational. \" an editorial at the new york times assesses what the election year has taught us, including: \" the media enable extreme candidates and the parties are too fragile to stop them. \"",

The rates went from 0.5 % to 0.25 %, the lowest they've been since the bank's beginnings in 1694, the atlantic reports. And there may even be another cut coming, bringing rates \" close to, but a little above, zero, \" says mark carney, the head of the uk's central bank, per the ap. Other measures announced thursday to give the british economy a push: a cheap lending program aimed at banks, as well as a bond-buying stimulus initiative. From around the internet: both the express and the guardian lay out what the rate cut means for consumers, including the \" pain \" it will bring for nest-egg builders, the \" good news \" it offers to those holding variable-rate mortgages, and the changes people can expect to their retirement funds. The banks will have their own repercussions to face. The wall street journal takes a look at the pressures in front of them and how they're being \" coy \" on how the rate drop may affect savers. Quartz goes back through the last seven years in the uk, examining the \" signals \" that were sent over that period about future potential rate changes. Local small-business owners talked to elite business right before the rate change was approved to give their take on the decrease. Opposing viewpoints: an opinion piece in the independent that says \" the time is right \" for such a change, while an evening standard commentary notes the dangers of adjusting this \" instrument of social justice. \"",

Government, the head of the fbi's new jersey office said. Wright was convicted of the 1962 murder of a gas station owner in wall, n.j. Authorities say wright and three associates had already committed multiple armed robberies on nov. 23, 1962, when he and another man shot and killed walter patterson, a decorated world war ii veteran and father of two, during a robbery of the collingswood esso gas station in wall. He received a 15- to 30-year sentence and had served eight years when he and three other men escaped from the bayside state prison in leesburg, n.j., on aug. 19, 1970. The fbi says wright became affiliated with an underground militant group, the black liberation army, and in 1972 he and his associates hijacked a delta air lines flight"

        "summary": "First, president trump told the new york times that he regretted making jeff sessions his attorney general because of sessions'decision to recuse himself from the russian investigation. On monday, trump piled on, referring to sessions as \" beleaguered \" in a tweet. \" so why aren't the committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered a.g., looking into crooked hillarys crimes &amp; russia relations? \" he wrote. The insult is \" remarkable, \" observes a post by andrew prokop at vox, and it might suggest that trump is signaling he wants sessions to resign so he doesn't have to fire him. Amid all this palace intrigue, meanwhile, comes a report from the respected mike allen at axios that trump is considering replacing sessions with rudy giuliani, though giuliani quickly denied that. The report, based on anonymous west wing sources, says trump has been floating the idea among his inner circle. But allen adds that the president often \" muses about possible personnel moves that he never makes, sometimes just to gauge the listener's reaction. \" giuliani himself told cnn there's no truth to the report, and added that he believes sessions \" made the right decision under the rules of the justice department \" by recusing himself. At new york, benjamin hart notes that sessions was not only one of trump's earliest backers but has been one of his most aggressive advocates in terms of policy while in office. He seems to have failed the loyalty test, however, something that giuliani routinely aces. So might the former new york city mayor truly end up running the justice department? \" stranger things have happened, \" writes hart.",

Kdb, an australian firm representing australian singer kylie minogue, officially opposed jenner's trademark application last week, citing that such a move would dilute minogue's brand and confuse her fans, the guardian reports. As billboard notes, minogue \" has been performing as ' kylie'since before jenner was born. \" the mirror adds that minogue has also owned kylie.com since 1996, the year before jenner was born. The paperwork filed by the firm also offers a series of jenner slams: she's described as a \" secondary reality television personality \" and a \" supporting character \" on keeping up with the kardashians. The filing notes that \" ms.

The mammal, which was found in a remote western african desert, is a type of elephant shrew or \" round-eared sengi. \" dubbed the macroscelides micus, it's the smallest elephant shrew ever discovered, measuring 7.5 inches long and weighing just an ounce, according to reuters and the california academy of sciences.

In addition to its diminutive size, the macroscelides micus is distinguished from its shrew cousins by its rust-colored fur, a hairless gland on the underside of its tail, and various genetic differences.

Trump plans to announce this week that each state can set its own own coal-emission standards ( pending epa approval ) rather than follow the obama administration's rule that emissions be significantly reduced nationwide. The environmental protection agency estimates that trump's plan, which affects over 300 coal-fired power plants, will lower co2 emissions by up to 1.5 % from 2005 levels by 2030; obama was aiming for a 19 % cut by the same year. But the supreme court had stayed obama's plan, leaving the whole thing in limbo. Now environmental experts and utility-industry honchos are dueling over the value of trump's plan. \" the science is just getting clearer and clearer every day, \" former epa chief janet mccabe tells the new york times. \" i don't know how many times people need to hear that we're having the warmest summer on record or how many storms people need to see.

        "summary": "With an obamacare alternative off the table for now, the white house is turning its attention to a new initiative, the first fundamental overhaul of the tax code in 30 years. Intense lobbying already is underway, with one of the most contentious issues the idea of a \" border adjustment tax, \" or bat. Here's where things stand: the border tax would effectively levy a tax on products coming into the us and give tax breaks to companies sending products abroad. Proponents say it would protect us jobs, while opponents say it would raise prices of everyday goods for many americans. See a primer at cnn. As you might expect, companies such as boeing, merck, and dow chemical that export many of their products are big fans of the bat, while heavy importers such as retailers walmart and target oppose it because they say it would drive up their prices, reports the atlantic. A huge ad war is unfolding. The national retail federation, for example, is running ads against the bat, like this parody of an infomercial. Paul ryan and house republican leaders are pushing for the bat, but their senate counterparts generally oppose it, reports the the washington post. Conservative tom cotton, for instance, called it \" a theory wrapped in a speculation inside a guess, \" in this op-ed at usa today. In a possible hint of compromise, the post notes that treasury chief steven mnuchin has suggested that some products or industries could be exempt, without offering details. President trump himself sounded skeptical of the tax initially but might be warming up. \" anytime i hear border adjustment, i don't love it, \" he told the wall street journal in january. In february, however, he told reuters that it \" could lead to a lot more jobs, \" and on sunday, reince priebus said trump thought a border tax could even \" the playing field between our country \" and others, per fox news. The success of the bat hinges on the economic premise that it would strengthen the us dollar, though there's a fair amount of skepticism about that, notes business insider. A more in-depth analysis, which takes note of \" significant confusion and uncertainty \" about how exchange rates might respond, is at real clear economics. The european union might sue if a border tax goes into effect, reports dw.com. Canada isn't a fan, either, notes fortune. More broadly, the gop's failure to repeal obamacare complicates tax reform, because republicans were relying on savings from the aca's elimination as part of their calculations. The new york",

Republicans can only afford for 22 gop representatives to vote against the bill ( it's assumed no democrat will vote for it ), but 36 are on the record as saying they ' ll vote against it. Another 14 gop reps say they're leaning toward voting against it. But the vote could've still been close, as president trump held a last-second negotiating session with the super-conservative house freedom caucus. At least a dozen representatives said they could switch their vote depending on the results of that negotiation. The freedom caucus — having already gotten trump to agree to removing a required minimum level of \" essential \" benefits from insurance plans — wanted all facets of obama's affordable care act repealed if its members were going to support the ahca, politico reports. That includes two popular parts of the aca that trump has vowed to preserve: allowing adults up to 26 years old to stay on their parents ' insurance plans and prohibiting the denial of insurance due to pre-existing conditions. But following trump's negotiation attempt, the caucus's chairman said there's \" no deal, \" according to the ap, and republican lawmakers emerged saying that the thursday vote might be delayed, notes the hill. The gop's obamacare replacement isn't just unpopular with lawmakers: vox reports a newly released poll shows only 17 % of the public approves of it, while 56 % disapproves.",

        "summary": "More reported brutality in north korea: a source tells the chosun ilbo that 33 north koreans will be executed because they were connected to a south korean missionary who was arrested in the north last year. Kim jung wook made his first public appearance since his arrest on thursday, admitting he tried to establish underground christian churches in north korea and claiming south korea's spy agency helped him — a claim seoul denies. Dozens of pyongyang residents believed to have been in contact with kim disappeared after the press conference, the global post reports, and now 33 who converted to christianity or received money from kim to set up churches are reportedly accused of trying to overthrow the government and set to be executed in a secret cell. In his statement last week — which, the ap notes, could have been coerced — kim said he \" was thinking of turning north korea into a religious country, and destroying its present government and political system. \" some, however, believe pyongyang is behind all of this and is using kim to support its claim that underground churches are actually rebel outposts funded by south korean spies; one south korean intelligence source in china claims kim was kidnapped by north korean agents and brought into north korea against his will, the daily mail reports. Meanwhile, there are also reports that choe ryong hae, who succeeded kim jong un's doomed uncle jang song thaek after jang's execution, has now also been arrested and may be purged, according to the chosun ilbo and other outlets. But seoul urges wariness, noting, \" our official position is that nothing has been confirmed about the report as of now. However, we are keeping a close eye on the situation. \"",

His new show will be based on the nicholson-adam sandler comedy anger management, tmz reports, but sheen's character won't stick strictly to that script: instead, he ' ll play an ex-jock with his own anger issues who becomes an anger management counselor in the criminal justice system. Joe roth, who produced the 2003 film and owns the screenplay, has worked with sheen in the past ( on major league, young guns, and other films ) and is pushing this project forward, but the deal with lionsgate is not quite finalized and no network has agreed to air the show yet.

            "Is it just me, or does a roast of charlie sheen seem totally redundant? ever since the guy trashed his plaza hotel room, chased a naked porn actress around, and went on a crazyfest that got him fired from two and a half men, everyone from jimmy fallon to john stamos has mercilessly mocked him. What else is there to make fun of? i mean, really! do we need to give sheen any more attention than we already have? comedy central says it will air a roast of sheen at the hands of some of its nastiest and most biting comics. Conveniently, the show will run right after the two and a half men premiere -- the first episode without charlie, whose character will be killed off. I ' m just wondering where these comedians are going to get any original material. We've already seen fallon's spoof commercial for an imaginary cologne called \" winning, \" where he does a hilarious impression of sheen in a cloud of cigarette smoke. We've heard denis leary compare him to moammar kaddafi and sarah silverman say she'd think she was a genius too if she hung out with 20-year-old porn stars. Then there was ricky gervais ' line in his golden globes speech: \" get ready for a night of partying and heavy drinking. Or as charlie sheen calls it -- breakfast! \" they could do one-liners about how sheen's new tv show will be based on the movie anger management and his character will be just like jack nicholson's. But that will already have been beaten to a pulp on late-night tv by the time their turn comes. The sheen roast has already happened, people. Actually, it's been done to death.

They hope to prove they've found the stream anchor that was reportedly lost exactly 222 years earlier, on june 9, 1792, from the hms chatham, an 80-foot survey brig that was part of capt. George vancouver's larger exploration of the pacific northwest. But the sea did not relinquish the relic without a fight, according to the south whidbey record and peninsula daily news; even though a trench was built beneath the anchor and a specially constructed cradle made to protect it, the waters were so choppy it took divers some six hours to raise the anchor with the help of a crane. Causing further delays, its tip was stuck fiercely to the sea floor. Still, the divers were able to recover the barnacle-encrusted anchor without breaking it, and it ' ll soon be shipped to texas a&m university, starting an 18-month study of the anchor. \" i ' m pretty overcome, \" amateur historian scott grimm — who has toiled tirelessly for six years to surface it alongside doug monk, the sea cucumber diver who first spotted the anchor — tells the seattle times. Though historians long thought the anchor slumbered in bellingham channel, grimm pored over explorers'diaries and other documents that led him to the conclusion that the anchor's location off whidbey island could be the correct one. It's now up to texas a&m researchers to verify that, and it may not be an easy task: it remains to be seen whether the anchor was stamped with identifying markers. ( this kind of discovery certainly isn't unheard of. One dive last year resulted in the recovery of one mythical treasure from 1592. )",

        "summary": "The biggest nuclear power plant in the world sits idle, as it has for nearly seven years. But that state is set to change, and not without public trepidation. The guardian reports that japan's nuclear watchdog this week gave tokyo electric power ( tepco ) the green light to restart two of the seven reactors at kashiwazaki-kariwa, which fell victim to the country's nuclear power moratorium in the wake of the march 2011 fukushima disaster. That calamity occurred on tepco's watch, and the utility says the money it will generate from kashiwazaki-kariwa's power is key to funding its continuing decommissioning efforts at fukushima. It has poured more than $ 6 billion into kashiwazaki-kariwa in an effort to make it immune to the series of disasters that befell fukushima. A 50-foot seawall provides tsunami protection, for instance, and 22,000 tons of water sit in a nearby reservoir, ready for the taking if reactors need sudden cooling. But locals aren't convinced — the japan times reports some people shouted at the meeting where the restart approval was granted — and that matters: though the restarts are penciled in to occur in spring 2019, the afp reports local authorities need to give their ok, and that process could take years. The plant is located in niigata prefecture, and locals there cite the active seismic faults in the area as a major concern; the guardian notes \" evidence that the ground on which tepco's seawall stands is prone to liquefaction in the event of a major earthquake. \" a second is the fear that should an evacuation be necessary, it would be much less successful than that of fukushima due to the bigger population.",

Found in 2007 and revealed in a new study, the 9,000-year-old skull seems to have been cut off and buried under limestone slabs — which may make it the oldest decapitated skull given a ritualistic burial in the western hemisphere. \" this ritualized decapitation attests to the early sophistication of mortuary rituals among hunter-gatherers in the americas, \" lead researcher andre strauss tells cnn. How so? well, vertebrae found with the skull bear ritualistic v-shaped markings, and two severed hands were positioned over the face with one set of fingers pointing up and the other pointing down, the washington post reports. Plus the skull appears to be from a local man, not an outside warrior whose head served as a trophy, notes livescience. ( that makes it unlike the many trophy skulls and examples of skull worship discovered in the andes mountains going back up to 3,000 years. ) interestingly, this skull also differs from remains at the same archaeological site, called lapa do santo in central brazil, where bodies of the same era have been found mutilated, burned, and defleshed with their teeth pulled out before burial, popular science reports. So what does it signify? \" in the apparent absence of wealth goods or elaborated architecture \" at the time, strauss writes, \" lapa do santo's inhabitants seemed to use the human body to express their cosmological principles regarding death. \" ( at least it's less gruesome than a severed head found on a factory's wire fence. )",

Reached friday, the agreement concludes a state investigation into complaints against barney's; state ag eric schneiderman continues a similar probe at macy's, the new york daily news adds. The investigation began when barney's accused two black shoppers of credit card fraud — trayon christian, 19, who was detained after buying a $ 349 belt, and kayla phillips, 21, who bought a $ 2,500 purse. The state uncovered other incidents — learning that barney's security guards \" exclusively identified minority customers as warranting surveillance \" to help the store stem a jump in shoplifting and credit card fraud. Barney's ceo mark lee tells the times that the terms of the agreement will make the store stronger, insisting the retailer is a \" truly progressive company that has absolutely no tolerance for discrimination. \" the state has ordered barney's to hire an anti-profiling consultant, improve its recordkeeping, change how it deals with shoplifters, and limit access to surveillance video. Al sharpton intends to hold barney's accountable with his own test shoppers, the ap adds.
