The host — and even fellow guest gonzo the muppet — gave ford a pretty rough ride, mocking him for his crack-smoking scandal and plenty of other scandals, reports the toronto sun. Kimmel played several videos of ford that have gone viral, including one of him ranting in jamaican patois. The mayor — who got loud applause and tossed t-shirts into the audience when he arrived on set — used the appearance to take plenty of shots at his critics, including toronto's chief of police, the cbc reports. Kimmel, who said the mayor had \" smoked his way into our national consciousness, \" ended the segment on a serious note, suggesting that if ford is an alcoholic and drinking so much that he ' ll try crack in his 40s \" and you don't remember it, maybe that's something that you might want to think about, like talking to somebody. \" the mayor shook his head and laughed, saying \" i wasn't elected to be perfect. \"",

Ford travelled to hollywood on the weekend ahead of his debut on the show. In his opening monologue, kimmel described ford as \"the greatest gift any talk show host could ask for. \" but laughs aside, ford was grilled on kimmel's late-night show about his crack cocaine smoking, his rants that have been captured on video and the ongoing toronto police investigation. \"a lot of them have more angles than a dog's hind legs, \" ford said. The mayor did use his appearance to fire shots at his critics – including police chief bill blair, councillors and the toronto media – and tout his record. Kimmel questioned why ford had dared blair to arrest him last week. Ford repeated his criticism of the cost of the police investigation into him and the mayor's office and said he wants the world to see his crack video. \"me too, \" kimmel said. \"put the video out, \" ford said. \"look what happened to kim kardashian after her video came",

Left-wing lawmaker lee seok-ki has been sentenced to 12 years in prison over plans he discussed with 130 attendees of a late-night meeting in may, the wall street journal reports; those plans aimed \" to destroy the country's infrastructure and key military facilities \" if war were to break out between the north and south, the court said. Six others in lee's united progressive party received lesser sentences, the ap reports. According to the court, lee's group, dubbed the revolutionary organization, also secretly sang pro-pyongyang songs and distributed north korean literature at some of its meetings. Lee denies the charges. He says south korean intelligence invented the case as a distraction from allegations against its own agency, which was accused of offering illegal support to the campaign of now-president park geun-hye. Lee plans to appeal, the ap notes. \" this was made to fit a predetermined conclusion, \" says a lawyer for the defendants; six others were handed prison sentences of four to seven years.",

        "summary": "President-elect donald trump has promised to make getting rid of obamacare a priority — but he's not going to be able to simply summon the affordable care act to the boardroom and tell the law it's fired. Instead, experts say repealing and replacing the aca is a process that could easily take a year or more, and it's very likely that parts of it will survive. Scientific american reports that with republicans in control of the white house and both houses of congress, but without a supermajority in the senate, the party will likely use the \" budget reconciliation \" process to kill off as much of the health care law as it can, using a method that can't be thwarted by a democratic filibuster. \" through budget reconciliation, it is possible for them to repeal and replace the bill entirely \" by cutting off funding to parts of the system, analyst ana gupte tells nbc news. \" they could choke off the blood supply to obamacare. \" but the process will have to wait until there is a budget, and repeal may not reach trump's desk until late next year, with a replacement coming later still, experts say. In other coverage: analysts tell usa today that popular parts of the law are likely to survive, including the ability to keep children on their parents ' health insurance until they're 26. But bipartisan agreement will be tough, since democrats don't want people to think they're getting rid of obamacare — and republicans don't want people to think they're improving it. The washington post notes that earlier republican efforts to repeal obamacare included a two-year transition period before the law changed, to give health care companies plenty of time to adjust. If they were \" unable to agree in two years on what will take its place, that is the nightmare scenario \" that will leave millions without coverage, says harvard school of public health professor john mcdonough, who helped craft the law. Politico predicts a long and complicated battle ahead, with obamacare advocates promising \" total war \" to defend the law, and gop leaders expected to take \" big and bold \" action. For now, nothing has changed, though confusion about the law's future is growing. \" this administration is going to continue to make a strong case that people should go to healthcare.gov, consider the options that are available to them, and sign up for health care, \" white house press secretary josh earnest said wednesday.",

Lawmakers on friday passed the toughest net neutrality law in the nation, less than a year after the feds did away with such rules, reports the los angeles times. The measure is now on gov. Jerry brown's desk, though he has not taken a public position on it. California wouldn't be the first state to create its own rules requiring that internet service providers such as comcast, at&t, and verizon treat all web traffic equally — instead of, say, slowing down content from a business rival — but it would be the largest. Isps already have vowed to challenge such efforts in federal courts, and california's entry into the fray would make it a good bet that the fight will land in the supreme court, reports the washington post. \"it would have huge implications for the us, because california is so central to all things ' net and is the world's eighth-largest economy, \" says university of richmond law professor carl tobias. Consumers groups back net neutrality, while the industry argues that \" the internet must be governed by a single, uniform and consistent national policy framework, not state-by-state piecemeal approaches, \" as a statement from ustelecom puts it. California's law actually goes further than the net neutrality laws struck down by the fcc, notes the new york times. For example, it would ban what's known as \" zero rating, \" which allows companies to not count certain apps or streaming services against a customer's data limit, as a way to play favorites.

( rich pedroncelli/ap ) california lawmakers rallied enough votes friday to pass the nation's toughest net neutrality law to prevent internet providers from favoring certain websites, setting up a fight with federal regulators who voted last year to erase such rules.

Detectives were trying to verify whether the recovered dress is the same one nyong ' o wore, she said. One of the actress'representatives reported the dress was stolen from her room at the london hotel late wednesday. Authorities placed its value at $ 150,000, although experts say it could have fetched more on the black market. The recovery of the dress was first reported by tmz.com, which said that a person claiming to have taken the gown gave the celebrity website information about where to find the dress. Detectives found it in a black garment bag stashed underneath the bathroom counter. Nyong ' o won an oscar in 2014 for her role in \" twelve years a slave \" and was a presenter at sunday's ceremony. Her publicists declined comment friday evening. The 31-year-old actress has become a darling of hollywood's red carpets in the past two years, with commenters and fans praising her fashion choices. She accessorized the dress with chopard diamond earrings and diamond rings. \" there are a lot of collectors out there who are very private and have private collections of stolen merchandise, \" said style expert and fashion commentator mary alice stephenson. \" some of these dresses have global fame as big as any van gogh. \" ___ tami abdollah can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/latams.",

During the trial, diana guerrero, who had aspired to become a police officer, told the court, \" it had never occurred to me that a person who had earned a badge would do this, \" the ap reports, noting guerrero agreed to be named. According to a justice department press release, former las cruces police detective michael garcia took guerrero, then 17, on a ride-along to visit a crime scene in may 2011. Rather than take her directly back to the station, he \" drove her to a secluded location where he sexually assaulted her. \" the press release notes he was \" assigned to a unit that focused on child abuse and sex crimes investigations \" at the time. Garcia, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to nine years in prison in late 2014. Guerrero reported the assault, which left her feeling \" like a piece of trash \" in 2013, after bumping into a female detective that year who asked why she had ended the internship. \" i just blurted it out, \" guerrero told kvia. \" i am most happy and satisfied that this lawsuit brought to light a cesspool of sexual violence and harassment that exists in police departments across this country, \" guerrero tells the ap. Indeed, an investigation by the news outlet found that, during a six-year period, about 1,000 officers were fired for a range of sex crimes; it calls that number \" unquestionably an undercount. \" the city council still has to approve the settlement, according to krwg, which is expected to happen monday.

            "Sheryl sandberg, billionaire turned iconic crusader for women in the workplace, wants you to stop saying the word bossy. That five-letter adjective, as her new lean in campaign explains, epitomizes a double-standard among men and women pursuing leadership roles and should be stricken from our vocabularies forthwith! but banning words has proved to be a fairly futile pursuit. The best sandberg can reasonably expect — and likely what she does expect — is for people to become slightly more aware of themselves when they continue to use a word that dates back to the 1800s, probably just as much as they did before: \"there was a lady manager, \" wrote harper's in 1882, \"who was dreadfully bossy. \" over the centuries, countless activists and officials have proposed that various permutations of the alphabet be blacklisted because they offend or belie. And it turns out that unless you are, say, the president of the united states deciding which words can be used in government documents during your administration, controlling the language used by others is a tall order.

The pair wrote and produced their album we are family, and soon the women had their first major hit with disco jam \" the greatest dancer, \" which became a top 10 hit in may 1979. ( it would sampled years later for will smith's hit \" getting jiggy wit it. \" ) but their biggest hit would come a month later with the title track, an infectious, grammy-nominated dance anthem that celebrated their familial connection with the refrain, \" we are family, i got all my sisters with me. \" both the song and album sold more than one million copies. While sister kathy left the group for a solo career, the trio of sisters last performed together in concert in october, says warren.

        "summary": "\" progress, but not a panacea. \" so proclaims an editorial in journal jama on aimovig, a first-of-its-kind drug purported to prevent chronic migraines without many side effects that was on thursday approved by the fda. The drug from amgen and novartis, and similar ones in their final stages, \" shake the ground under our feet. They will change the way we treat migraine, \" a neurologist tells the new york times. \" the drugs will have a huge impact, \" another adds. At $ 575 per unit, the self-administered monthly injection known generically as erenumab doesn't eliminate migraines, but it can halve their frequency and cut their intensity by blocking the protein fragment responsible. None of the patients in the trials bowed out due to side effects; constipation and reactions around the injection site were most common, per reuters. Aimovig users experienced up to 2.5 fewer migraine days per month on average than placebo recipients in three separate trials, according to the fda. Now forced to rely on drugs designed to treat other issues — botox is prescribed for some — the roughly 3 million americans who suffer chronic migraines could get their hands on the drug within a week, per the times. Its price tag \" reflects the value it brings to patients … while also factoring in critical issues such as patient affordability, \" amgen says, per nbc news. Reuters reports the $ 6,900 annual cost is below the $ 10,000 estimated by some analysts. ( migraines may be linked to mouth bacteria. )",

        "summary": "No one wants to imagine what went on inside orlando's pulse nightclub in the early morning hours of june 12, but now you can see some of it. The orange county sheriff's office has released a deputy's bodycam video that offers a glimpse into the bloody chaos and confusion that officers walked into that night, cbs news reports. The sun sentinel has also received 20 pages of reports providing new details about the response to the attack, including how deputies had to comb through bodies to look for the living. News 6 aired an edited portion of one bodycam video and noted the \" sense of urgency \" that could be felt as deputies tried to plan how they were going to go in to rescue survivors. The screen sometimes goes completely dark, which means that portion of the clip was redacted as deputies passed by victims who didn't make it, a news 6 reporter explains. At one point, deputies scramble back from the club as they're told over the radio to take \" hard cover, \" the ap notes. \" let's go! let's go! \" one officer can be heard yelling to survivors on the video taken from orange county sheriff's deputy mark rutkoski's bodycam. On rutkoski's video, which the orlando sentinel notes lasted more than an hour, clubgoers can be heard crying, with at least one pleading with deputies to go inside for more people. As the deputies stand around waiting for their next orders, one officer can be heard saying, \" it's pretty bad in there. You don't wanna look. \" after a break in the tape, it picks up again with a radio call informing the officers there are at least 42 dead. \" damn, \" rutkoski can be heard saying. \" that's, like, more than any active shooter i can remember. \" news 6 has more clips.",

Chelsea watrous cook, 32, has been charged with aggravated murder in the shooting of lisa vilate williams, 26, and could face the death penalty, deseret news reports. Police say the teacher lured ex-husband travis cook out of his apartment by saying she had cold medicine for one of their 3-year-twins, reports the ap. Security camera footage captured her hiding in the hallway as he walked out to the parking lot. Police say she then sneaked into the apartment, where she ended up shooting williams, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, who had been making christmas tree ornaments with the twins. Authorities say travis cook managed to get the gun away from his ex-wife and pin her to a wall until police arrived. Williams ' mother and sister tell the ap that they feared for her safety after cook harassed her and bullied her online for months. Public records state that cook was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence last month after arguing with her ex-husband when he tried to pick up the twins. Court records state that she yelled \" disparaging comments \" about williams, who was not present, and grabbed her ex-husband by the hair, causing him to tumble down stairs. Cook, who worked as a health and yoga teacher at a lehi high school, is being held without bail.",

            "Nintendo is facing a storm of criticism over its decision not to allow gamers to play as gay characters and form same-sex relationships in the life-simulation game tomodachi life. There has been disquiet and outrage from a number of quarters despite nintendo's statement that tomodachi life is meant to be a \"whimsical and quirky game�? and not a \"social commentary�?. This defence in fact seems to have only served to fan the flames ahead of the game's release in europe. The reaction is understandable in terms of discrimination, but also because of the deep attachments that gamers develop with their online characters. I have been researching video game play for more than two decades and i've always found issues surrounding character formation, sexuality, and gender in gaming of great psychological interest. In one of our studies we found that 57 % of gamers had gender-swapped their game character at some point. The practice was more common among women than men. Gender swapping enabled gamers to play around and experiment with various aspects of their in-game character in a way that just isn't possible in real life. For others it was just fun to see if they felt any different playing as a different gendered character. In most instances, the gamers had the opportunity to choose a gender and develop other aspects of their character before they began to",
            "The video-game giant nintendo has apologised and promised to be more inclusive, after being criticised for not recognising same-sex relationships in english-language editions of a life-simulator video game. The company said, however, it was too late to change the game. In a statement released on friday, the japanese company said: \"we apologise for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in tomodachi life. \"unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game's design, and such a significant development change can't be accomplished with a post-ship patch. \" nintendo came under fire from fans and gay rights organisations this past week after refusing to add same-sex relationship options to the game tomodachi life. The game was released in japan last year and features a cast of mii characters – nintendo's personalised avatars of real players – living on a virtual island. Gamers can do things like shop, play games, go on dates and get married. Already a hit in japan, tomodachi life is set for release 6 june in north america and europe. The statement continued: \"at nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone. \"we pledge that"

            "Nintendo is facing a storm of criticism over its decision not to allow gamers to play as gay characters and form same-sex relationships in the life-simulation game tomodachi life. There has been disquiet and outrage from a number of quarters despite nintendo's statement that tomodachi life is meant to be a \"whimsical and quirky game�? and not a \"social commentary�?. This defence in fact seems to have only served to fan the flames ahead of the game's release in europe. The reaction is understandable in terms of discrimination, but also because of the deep attachments that gamers develop with their online characters. I have been researching video game play for more than two decades and i've always found issues surrounding character formation, sexuality, and gender in gaming of great psychological interest. In one of our studies we found that 57 % of gamers had gender-swapped their game character at some point. The practice was more common among women than men. Gender swapping enabled gamers to play around and experiment with various aspects of their in-game character in a way that just isn't possible in real life. For others it was just fun to see if they felt any different playing as a different gendered character. In most instances, the gamers had the opportunity to choose a gender and develop other aspects of their character before they began to",
            "The video-game giant nintendo has apologised and promised to be more inclusive, after being criticised for not recognising same-sex relationships in english-language editions of a life-simulator video game. The company said, however, it was too late to change the game. In a statement released on friday, the japanese company said: \"we apologise for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in tomodachi life. \"unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game's design, and such a significant development change can't be accomplished with a post-ship patch. \" nintendo came under fire from fans and gay rights organisations this past week after refusing to add same-sex relationship options to the game tomodachi life. The game was released in japan last year and features a cast of mii characters – nintendo's personalised avatars of real players – living on a virtual island. Gamers can do things like shop, play games, go on dates and get married. Already a hit in japan, tomodachi life is set for release 6 june in north america and europe. The statement continued: \"at nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone. \"we pledge that"

The bad news: three of the new species are already threatened by climate change, feral animals, and loss of habitat as state forests are logged. If that weren't enough, the animals are what phys.org calls \" suicidally-sexed carnivorous marsupials. \" each year, antechinus males spend two to three weeks mating with as many partners as possible, for up to 14 hours per session. \" ultimately, the testosterone triggers a malfunction in the stress hormone shut-off switch; the resulting rise in stress hormones causes the males ' immune systems to collapse and they all drop dead before the females give birth to a single baby, \" researcher andrew baker explains. While mom and baby have plenty to eat as a result, the annual suicide mission puts the animals in danger of population extinctions. The males \" get gastric ulcers, internal bleeding, their fur will fall out in patches, basically any disease that they get or any parasites they've got they've got no ability to fight with their immune system, it completely shuts off, \" baker tells the brisbane times. \" the future of each species is entrusted to the mothers alone. \" researchers have applied for threatened status for three species found in australia: the black-tailed antechinus and silver-headed antechinus, which inhabit just a few square kilometers in southeast queensland, and the tasman peninsula dusky antechinus. Scientists next hope to find more unidentified antechinus species, track their geographical range, and identify protection strategies. \" in one sense it makes you wonder how many species there are to discover but in another sense you wonder if they might go extinct before we actually discover them, \" baker says.

The coroner in the case calls the allergy labeling inadequate, saying natasha ednan-laperouse was \" reassured \" by the fact that sesame seeds, which she was allergic to, were not listed as an ingredient. They weren't visibly present either, as they were apparently baked into the baguette. The bbc reports the coroner's results will be shared with the environment secretary as a means of raising the question of whether companies like pret a manger should continue to be exempt from food labeling regulations when it comes to items prepared in-house. The bbc notes there were six allergic reaction cases involving pret a manger's \" artisan \" baguettes due to their sesame seed content in the year preceding natasha's death in 2016. She boarded her flight from london to france and collapsed during the flight. Though her father administered two epipen injections, she later died. The guardian reports the epipens had a 16mm needle, which may not have been long enough to get the adrenaline into her muscle, per the inquest.

Sgt. 1st class mark leshikar and an unnamed soldier had returned to a house outside fort bragg following a vacation in florida with their families when leshikar was kicked out of the house for an unknown reason. A senior defense official says a child let leshikar back into the house, where he attacked the unidentified soldier with a screwdriver. The soldier then shot the 33-year-old leshikar, the official says. According to wncn, leshikar was pronounced dead at the scene. The unidentified soldier was still on the scene when deputies arrived at the house in fayetteville, a sheriff's office spokesperson tells the fatyetteville observer. No charges have yet been filed against the soldier. An army special operations command spokesperson wouldn't confirm the soldier's identity, but the defense official says the shooter is an active duty soldier on a special missions unit.

Cain still didn't pay up, so four months later the state served him with a tax lien for $ 8,558.46. Still cain didn't pay — his accountant battled the state department of revenue until november 2008, and the lien was finally lifted in december. A cain spokesman confirmed the episode, but said it was an innocent omission that only served \"as an example of how broken our federal and state bureaucracies are \" regarding tax collection. \"the entire process is driven by automated letters generated in response to deadlines. \" the daily beast has the court documents here.",

The 4.6 % drop means jerome powell is unlikely to have much of a honeymoon period as fed chief — analysts say the fall is unlikely to be a direct result of his appointment, though it may have contributed to a general sense of uncertainty, nbc reports. There have been major stock market sell-offs in the early months of many other federal reserve chiefs, including alan greenspan, who started just two months before the crash on oct. 19, 1987. In other coverage: asian markets. Asian markets plunged tuesday, raising fears of a global sell-off that will hit us markets for another day, npr reports.

It is now at less than a third of the peak near $ 20,000 that it reached before christmas. Other cryptocurrencies are also down massively. Economies \" doing too well? \" according to the new york times, one major reason for the drop is that investors are worried world economies are \" doing too well, \" which could cause central banks to take steps including raising interest rates. The times notes that while this was the largest drop in point terms for the dow jones, there have been plenty of other drops the same size or bigger in percentage terms, including in 2011. Disbelief. The wall street journal reports that the major drops, which have wiped out around $ 4 trillion from world markets, have caused disbelief and panic in markets around the world. Some new york traders thought a \" fat finger \" mistake was to blame. \" what we're seeing is bloodshed, \" says strategist jingyi pa in singapore, though she predicts markets will calm down in a couple of days.

The washington post reports that north carolina man edgar maddison welch, 28, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon after the incident, which brought a heavy police response to the northwest dc neighborhood. Cops say welch said he was \" self-investigating \" pizzagate, a theory that has flourished in some of the internet's weirder corners. It claims hillary clinton and aides, including john podesta, have been running a child sex trafficking ring from the eatery. Witnesses say welch walked into the restaurant and pointed an assault rifle at an employee, nbc washington reports. Police believe he fired at least one shot after all workers and customers had fled. The post reports that in the weeks after the election, the restaurant's owner and employees received death threats on social media as the pizzagate theory — which was largely based on mentions of pizza in podesta emails published by wikileaks — spread online. \" let me state unequivocally: these stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them, \" owner james alefantis said in a statement, per the ap. \" what happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences. \" ( reddit's ceo edited abusive posts after the pizzagate-related page was shut down. )",

        "summary": "San francisco residents are heading to the polls tuesday to vote on a number of propositions, but the one getting the most attention is proposition f — essentially a referendum on hometown tech company airbnb. If passed, proposition f would limit short-term rentals through airbnb and other rental sites like homeaway, vrbo, and flipkey to 75 nights per year; force \" hosts \" to submit quarterly reports to the city; and allow neighbors to report violations, us news and wired note. Supporters say property owners are renting mainly to tourists, rather than long-term renters, which is driving up rent. However, airbnb argues short-term rentals provide a source of income for residents dealing with the \" decades-long housing crisis \" and make \" it possible for thousands of middle-class families to make ends meet and stay in the city. \" airbnb and its allies have raised $ 8 million for a \" no on f \" campaign, fearing its operations in other cities around the globe could face similar limits if prop f passes, reports the new york times. Supporters of prop f have raised about $ 1 million. \" we are not concerned about people renting a room in their apartment while they are home for some extra cash, \" says a vp with the american hotel and lodging association. \" we see investors buying up five or 10 condos in san francisco or new york city and renting them through websites, but not playing by the rules of being a hotel. \" the times reports the \" no on f \" side is expected to win by a landslide, but a community organizer in favor of prop f says, \" i think we have moved the argument in a significant way. \" he adds when the issue appears on the ballot next year, \" it will do very well. \"",

But don't underestimate how much unity, momentum, money will now flow to democrats — and how much finger-pointing and funk they avoided. For the first time since election night one year ago today, democrats could smile. On a day that set the opening tone for the midterm elections of 2018, voters rejected president trump, handed democrats a big win in a swing state in a racially charged moment, and provided hope — however fleeting or fanciful — that they can win back power in washington. In the virginia governor's race, democrat ralph northam beat ed gillespie by 9 points — a far bigger margin than either party had foreseen, and far wider than hillary clinton's win over trump. Some empirical data behind the hope: the stunning margin was booked largely in northern virginia, in what msnbc's steve kornacki called \" the revenge of the suburbs \" after a year of trump.

        "summary": "Ancients apparently used various papyrus documents to create mummy masks — including what may be the earliest known fragment of a new testament gospel, livescience reports. Confirming information that leaked in 2012, professor craig evans says he's among the researchers who peeled apart the glued layers of a mummy mask and discovered a gospel of mark fragment dating to 90ad or earlier. That's at least a decade older than any known gospel copy, so the fragment could potentially show how the gospel was changed over time. The find will be published this year, but evans won't say more because he's signed a non-disclosure agreement. In fact, he says, he's only talking now because another researcher already blabbed about it. \" [ we ] have to honor the [ privacy ] request of the museums, universities, private owners, so forth, \" says evans. Other scholars are fuming over the practice of ungluing the ancient papyri, saying it destroys bona fide mummy masks. Evans is \" totally oblivious to the destruction of archaeological material, \" writes an archaeologist in what livescience calls a \" scathing blog post. \" ( but evans says the masks are just ordinary people's \" low-end, \" papyrus-and-glue fare — not the pharaohs ' magnificent gold versions. ) another blogger contends that josh mcdowell, \" a christian evangelical apologist with no scholarly credentials, \" is part of the project and admits in a video \" that he doesn't know what he is doing. \" evans, however, says the team will recover hundreds \" if not thousands \" of papyri from the first three centuries ad, including christian documents, \" classical greek texts, business papers... Personal letters \" and copies of stories by homer. ( see why one historian says homer \" wasn't a person. \" )",

            "This story was updated at 9: 54 a.m. Et on feb. 9. A text that may be the oldest copy of a gospel known to exist — a fragment of the gospel of mark that was written during the first century, before the year 90 — is set to be published. At present, the oldest surviving copies of the gospel texts date to the second century ( the years 101 to 200 ). This first-century gospel fragment was written on a sheet of papyrus that was later reused to create a mask that was worn by a mummy. Although the mummies of egyptian pharaohs wore masks made of gold, ordinary people had to settle for masks made out of papyrus ( or linen ), paint and glue. Given how expensive papyrus was, people often had to reuse sheets that already had writing on them. In recent years scientists have developed a technique that allows the glue of mummy masks to be undone without harming the ink on the paper. The text on the sheets can then be read. The first-century gospel is one of hundreds of new texts that a team of about three-dozen scientists and scholars is working to uncover, and analyze, by using this technique of ungluing the masks, said craig evans, a professor of new testament studies at acadia divinity college in wolfville, nova scotia. \" we're recovering ancient documents from the first, second and third centuries. Not just christian documents, not just biblical documents, but classical greek texts, business papers, various mundane papers, personal letters, \" evans told live science. The documents include philosophical texts and copies of stories by the greek poet homer. [ see images of early christian inscriptions and artifacts ] the business and personal letters sometimes have dates on them, he said. When the glue was dissolved, the researchers dated the first-century gospel in part by analyzing the other documents found in the same mask. One drawback to the process is that the mummy mask is destroyed, and so scholars in the field are debating whether that particular method should be used to reveal the texts they contain. But evans emphasized that the masks that are being destroyed to reveal the new texts are not high quality ones that would be displayed in a museum.

The magazine's offices were raided last month by investigators from the manhattan district attorney's office, and its chief content officer stepped down after sexual harassment allegations. Now, some of its 60 new york-based employees are voicing fears about their long-term job security. The company had recently been the subject of a buzzfeed report that alleged the websites under the newsweek media group had artificially inflated traffic numbers to attract advertisers.

( photo: peter foley, epa ) newsweek, whose iconic history as a news organization has spanned eight decades, is making headlines of a different sort this week: its top editors have been fired amid a maelstrom of controversy in the newsroom. Some of its staffers are wondering whether the magazine will survive. Writers and editors at the publication's new york offices were told they could go home for the day on monday afternoon, although they were notified that a new editor would be in place tuesday"

The last republican standing has applied for a permit to build a sea wall to protect trump international golf links &amp; hotel ireland, his coastal resort in county clare, and politico has read it over. The main reason for the wall: an \" explicit \" reference to global warming via rising sea levels that have led to more erosion and could endanger trump's property. \" it's diabolical, \" ex-south carolina rep. Bob inglis says. \" you have a soft place in your heart for people who are honestly ignorant, but people who are deceitful, that's a different thing. \" politico notes that trump acquired the property in 2014 after an unusually harsh winter, and that just days before he closed the deal, another storm hit and tore away 26 feet of land along the water. In the application for the wall — 200,000 tons of rocks along a few miles of shore — an environmental impact report was included from an irish firm, and that analysis went beyond predicting regular wear and tear. \" if the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct … it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates … around much of the coastline of ireland, \" it reads. The application also includes a scan of a brochure that the hotel company disseminated to local residents to warn them about the \" need for coastal protection. \" trump's rep didn't respond to politico's call; neither did the trump organization's general counsel. Meanwhile, al gore weighed in monday on today, saying, \" [ trump ] has said some things on the climate crisis that i think should concern everyone. \" ( politico outlines each time trump has blasted climate change. )",

A study finds that shorter groups of refs are more likely to call fouls than are their taller counterparts, the wall street journal reports. Researchers examined 4,463 games between 2008 and 2012, deadspin reports. They divided refs into three groups: those under six feet tall, those between six feet and six-foot-three, and those taller than that. The investigators found that the under-six-foot group called.147 more fouls per game than did the tallest group. That's 3.6 % more fouls than the nba average, the journal adds. Still, as deadspin notes, it's not a huge effect: \" an average player would have around one more foul every 480 minutes \" given a short crew. Researchers offer two possible explanations for their findings: maybe shorter refs actually see more of what's going on between players, and they make their calls accordingly. Or maybe the refs are exhibiting \" aggressive, controlling behavior via the napoleon complex. \" but the nba isn't particularly moved by the findings, which, the league says, \" are based on limited information about the average heights of individuals in crews, seemingly arbitrary height groups, and no information about the actual caller. \" ( as for that supposed complex, researchers this year suggested \" short man syndrome \" does exist. )",

The avocado light, launching at a trade fair in spain later this month, has up to 30 % less fat than a typical avocado, per the company. That's apparently a big deal, because despite an abundance of health claims about how wonderful avocados are for you, an average avocado also contains between 20g and 30g of fat. Despite the fact that most of that is monounsaturated fat, which is linked to all sorts of good stuff including reducing cholesterol, the fda has set the serving size in the us at just one-third of a medium avocado; in the uk, one-half is considered a portion size. Even so, the response to isla bonita's announcement can be summed up as \" unimpressed, \" with headlines like \" we don't need diet avocados but they exist anyway \" and \" here's a new low fat avocado, but is it really necessary? \" in abundance. Many are wondering whether diet avocados are even healthy, with one nutritional expert telling today the avocados could still be good for you as long as they still contain \" all of the same nutrient attributes — without any suspect add-ons needed to reduce some of the fat. \" as for how, exactly, the fat is reduced, isla bonita says their avocados are grown under special soil and climate conditions that provide the same nutritional benefits while resulting in a reduced-fat fruit.

Lanford died of complications from pneumonia on the eve of chicago's steppenwolf theater's new production of his hot l baltimore, set in the lobby of a down-at-the-heels hotel. \" lanford was a singular voice in the american theater — an important artist, a gentle soul and a good friend, \" steppenwolf co-founder terry kinney tells ap. \" we will miss him sorely. \"",

The plane sold for $ 430,000 on saturday at a california event featuring celebrity memorabilia — a far cry from gws auctions ' estimate of up to $ 3.5 million. The buyer was not disclosed in the sold note posted on the firm's website, and auctioneer brigitte kruse said she could not immediately release information about the buyer or the buyer's plans for the plane. The auction house says elvis designed the interior, which has gold-tone woodwork, red velvet seats, and red shag carpet. But the red 1962 lockheed jetstar has no engine and needs a restoration of its cockpit. Photos of the plane show seats of the cockpit torn. \" we were contacted by a private seller who has a very large collection and he can't take everything with him, so he contacted us about holding an auction, \" gws told the tennessean of the unidentified seller. The ap notes there's some contention about whether elvis truly designed the interior himself. Roy mckay once owned the plane and told kob-tv he redid what was then a gray, \" casket \" -like interior, but gws disputes mckay's claim and notes federal aviation administration records show no interior changes were ever made to the jet.",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — two of president donald trump's top economic advisers sent mixed signals sunday on the fate of a health care provision in the senate version of a $ 1.5 trillion measure to overhaul business and personal income taxes that is expected to be voted on after thanksgiving. The provision to repeal a requirement that everyone in the u.s. Have insurance has emerged as a major sticking point for republican sen. Susan collins of maine, who has said that issue should be dealt with separately from the push by trump and fellow republicans to overhaul the tax code. Collins ' vote is crucial in a chamber where republicans hold a slim 52-48 edge. Sen. Ron johnson, r-wis., has already declared his opposition to the bill, saying last week that it doesn't cut business taxes enough for partnerships and corporations. Gop sens.

As vulture reports, she was also dangerously close to breaking recording laws — though tmz reports kardashian is actually in the clear. While plenty of states allow you to record a phone call when only one party knows it's being recorded ( i.e. The person recording it ), california is one of 11 states that require every party on the call know that it's being taped if it's a \" confidential communication. \" swift says she was definitely not aware she was being recorded and a source tells tmz that kardashian and west were in a los angeles studio at the time of the call. So why release it and risk up to a year in jail, per the guardian? well, tmz reports swift's lawyer actually sent west a letter threatening legal action if he didn't destroy the audio when she found out about the recording months ago. And it went nowhere because a phone call is only considered \" confidential communication \" if there's no chance of it being overheard. Tmz, which listened to the full call, says west had swift on speakerphone, which she \" no doubt \" knew since producer rick rubin, who was in the room with west, spoke up several times. What does all this mean? a social-branding expert says swift might \" look bad \" now, but kardashian will come off looking like a bully in the end, per us weekly.",

        "summary": "The los angeles reservoir has now turned black, but not from any kind of pollution. Over several months, city officials have been unleashing 96 million black plastic balls into the city's 175-acre reservoir in an effort to fight the effects of california's drought. The final 20,000 were dropped in earlier this week. How is turning the reservoir into what gizmodo calls a \" goth-looking playplace \" going to help? well, the so-called shade balls actually help keep water clear of dust and critters; hinder algae growth; prevent chemical reactions between sunlight and chlorine; and reduce evaporation as they float on the water's surface. At a cost of $ 34.5 million, or 36 cents each, the city says they're a \" cost-effective way to reduce evaporation each year by nearly 300 million gallons, enough to provide drinking water for 8,100 people for a full year. \" the 4-inch balls — treated with a chemical to block uv light and designed to last up to 25 years, reports bloomberg — are also expected to save $ 250 million compared with another method of complying with clean-water laws, the los angeles times reports. As the epa recommends water reservoirs be covered, the alternative would be to build a dam dividing the reservoir and install floating covers for $ 300 million, reports npr. The department of water and power says it's \" the first utility company to use this technology for water quality protection. \" the shade balls have also been used at three other nearby reservoirs, including one since 2008. \" in the midst of california's historic drought, it takes bold ingenuity to maximize my goals for water conservation, \" la mayor eric garcetti says, per the huffington post. This \" is emblematic of the kind of creative thinking we need to meet those challenges. \" ( meet the drought's latest casualty. )",

So what's behind the strange growth? the leading theory: sabotage, courtesy of texas a&m, which confirmed it was indeed the one to breed maroon-bonnet seeds. Says the head of the ut team that handles the school's plantings, it's \" likely these seeds were created at a&m and brought over here. \" an a&m horticulturalist says it probably was an intentional planting, but professes to have no knowledge of any such plot. He notes, however, \" god chose to put a maroon gene in ( the bluebonnet family ), but there ain't no orange one. \" ut can take solace in the fact that when planted with blue ones, white and pink bluebonnets tend to become blue over time, and kxan notes some of the maroon ones have already started to turn pink.

A new study finds that 10 out of 25 remains buried at stonehenge came from over 100 miles away in west wales, near the preseli mountains where the site's stones were quarried. The remains'dates are \" tantalizingly \" close to when those bluestones were used to form the site's initial stone circle, researchers say. Conclusion: \" people from the preseli mountains not only supplied the bluestones used to build the stone circle but moved with the stones and were buried there too, \" study co-author john pouncett tells npr. All scientists had were cremated skull-bits buried in holes around the site. Team leader christophe snoeck calls that \" the perfect challenge, \" because cremation destroys organic matter while leaving inorganic matter behind. As he explains, heavier elements like strontium are \" about seven times heavier than carbon \" and remain unaltered. So they extracted two strontium isotopes from cremated bone — a process considered impossible until recently — to find remnants that had passed from eaten plants into the people's teeth and bones, per the los angeles times. Then they compared the finding to a map of strontium isotope ratios from the surrounding area. \" we expected to see some people that were not local, but so many was a surprise, \" says snoeck.",

The cdc director says 200 people per day die of such illnesses. The good news is that correa and others are testing a simple method that could cut down on such illnesses: copper bed rails. Copper has been known for millennia as a material that can quickly get rid of bacteria, viruses, and more; in correa's words, it \" kills everything. \" a us study found last year that the rails cut infections from 8.1 % to 3.4 % of hospital rooms. Correa's team has been replacing bed rails in chile with copper since last year; so far, they've made the conversion on 150 beds in four hospitals. And \" bed rails are only the first step.

Don't be insulted: it may have to do with the chemicals in your skin, jill richardson explains at salon. There are 346 chemicals involved in the scent of human hands, a study found in 2000, and 277 of them can attract the annoying critters. A key one seems to be l-lactic acid, which, when added to the scent of a less-targeted person, can make certain mosquitoes go after them. It's also been suggested that some people are lucky enough to carry chemicals that actually get in the way when mosquitoes are looking for lunch. And when it comes to malarial mosquitoes — not a big problem in the us — the bacteria in foot odor is tempting. They ' ll even go after limburger cheese, which smells like feet, richardson notes. As for how to deal with them, there's controversy over the use of bug repellent deet, which salon calls mildly neurotoxic. But mother jones notes that the cause of supposedly deet-linked seizures in children in the 1980s remains unclear, and newer studies have shown little in the way of health risks from small amounts of the stuff. Still, if you want to avoid it, a recent study suggested lemon eucalyptus oil could do the trick against mosquitoes.",
