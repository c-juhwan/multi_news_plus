The 26-year-old is a former army ranger from indiana who served in iraq in 2007 before being honorably discharged for medical reasons, reports cnn. He enrolled at butler university upon his return to the us, but traveled to libya on his spring break to learn about the syria crisis. \" i wanted more of a challenge, more of a purpose, \" he told the network in a 2012 interview. Eventually, kassig decided to stay full time to do humanitarian work and founded a relief group called the special emergency response and assistance, reports the washington post. In the last few years, he has been delivering food and medical supplies to refugees from the syrian conflict. Kassig's parents today released a youtube video pleading for his release. They refer to their son as \" abdul-rahman, formerly known as peter. \" the kassigs have previously said that their son converted to islam while in captivity. A few quotes from kassig, from cnn and from an interview last year with time: \"this is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here. People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere. \" \" i am not a doctor. I am not a nurse.

        "summary": "The islamic state may have claimed responsibility for wednesday's twin terror attacks in tehran that killed 12, but iran has a different culprit in mind: regional rival saudi arabia. \" this terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the us president and the ( saudi ) backward leaders who support terrorists, \" says a statement from iran's revolutionary guards, per reuters. It acknowledges that isis was \" involved, \" however, thus insinuating a link between isis and the saudis, notes new york. A look at coverage: potent symbols: the attackers hit not only the parliament building in tehran but the mausoleum with the tomb of founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini — \" the two most potent symbols of the 1979 revolution, \" writes simon tisdall at the guardian. For iranians, this is \" deeply shocking, \" the equivalent of someone attacking the lincoln memorial in the us. The attacks: details on how the coordinated attacks unfolded are at the new york times. A first: assuming the isis claim is legit, this would be the first isis attack in iran, but the militant group has wanted to strike there for years, explains a q&a at pri. Isis is sunni, while iran is a shia nation, and it's no small distinction: isis views shiites as apostates. The backdrop: the new york times notes the attacks come not only after trump's trip ( seen as emboldening the saudis ) but after the saudi move to isolate qatar, which it accuses of supporting terrorism and iran. It all relates to the main issue: \" iran and saudi arabia are the leading nations on opposing sides of the middle east split between shiite and sunni islam. \" morale boost: given isis retreats in iraq and syria, the successful strikes in iran will clearly be a big morale boost to the group, per an analysis at the bbc. As they lose their strongholds in those countries, they want followers to launch attacks elsewhere, and no target is bigger than iran. Trump response: it was notably mixed. \" we grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in iran, and for the iranian people, who are going through such challenging times, \" he said in a statement. But then added: \" we underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote. \" the us does indeed consider iran a state sponsor of terrorism, notes business insider. Ominous threat: just hours before the attacks, the saudi foreign minister had said iran should be punished for supporting groups such as al-qaeda, per al arabiya english.",

The reason for the shorter time? unlike previous calculations, klotz's take into account that the earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes phys.org. \" the way the earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110 % of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center, \" says klotz, as quoted in forbes.

On april 12, after the owners of the lion's gate wild animal sanctuary requested to move to a nearby but more urban location citing safety concerns after recurring flooding on the property, elbert county commissioners voted no, citing safety concerns, reports the denver post. Then on april 20, the sanctuary suddenly euthanized all 11 of its animals — three lions, three tigers, and five bears — and the lion's gate web site went dark, showing only the words, \" this account has been suspended. \" the owner of a nearby, larger sanctuary says he had offered to take the animals, but co-owner dr. Joan laub and a sanctuary volunteer say the senior animals wouldn't have survived a move to a larger sanctuary and that the county commission's vote forced the sanctuary's hand, reports cbs4. On a care2 petition page launched months ago, laub wrote that colorado parks and wildlife had authorized a move to 85 acres the sanctuary also owns in a more urban part of the county, though she listed 18 animals at the time. County chairman danny wilcox, meanwhile, tells huffington post that the commission is \" shocked \" the animals were put down after the owners had said they'd continue to operate if their request was denied. A spokeswoman for colorado parks and wildlife calls the killings unprecedented: \" this has never happened before in our state. \" one of the owners was once accused of smuggling cats, per the denver post in 2006, and the owner of the larger sanctuary theorizes to the huffington post that issues with licensing made it difficult for lion's gate to get funding.

        "summary": "Rep. Aaron schock, an up-and-comer previously best known for baring his six-pack on the cover of men's health, has a new claim to fame in the form of his interior decor: it seems the washington post's style reporter ben terris popped by the illinois rep's digs in the rayburn house office building, and ran into schock's interior decorator, who showed him around. Terris describes the outer office thusly: \" bright red walls. A gold-colored wall sconce with black candles. A federal-style bull's-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top. \" \" it's actually based off the red room in downton abbey, \" an aide helpfully told terris of his outer office. The rest of terris ' piece describes schock's team trying to squash the story. Usa today took the ball and dug back to 2009 and 2010 and found about $ 118,000 in office expenditures — including $ 4,000 on fine-leather furniture and $ 79,061 on other furniture — that schock billed to a taxpayer-funded account. Which is turning into kind of an upstairs-downstairs conundrum: while it's not yet clear how much the downton renovation cost, schock's interior decorator says she worked for free, thus saving the taxpayer — but prompting crew to file an ethics complaint claiming that schock illegally received a gift. \" perhaps it's not totally surprising that the same congressman who spent campaign money on p90x workout dvds wanted to create a more picturesque setting in which to be photographed, but the rules clearly require him to pay for those renovations himself, \" says crew's executive director, per nbc chicago. \" again and again, rep. Schock's seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in ethical manner. \" the other irony being widely noted: downton airs on pbs, which schock has repeatedly voted to de-fund.

More: australian prime minister tony abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the bbc reports. \" how can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community? \" he wondered at a press conference today. \" these are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically. \" just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \" grossly offensive \" letters to the families of australian soldiers killed in afghanistan, reports the sydney morning herald. The country's high court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \" spiritual healer, \" was seen as a \" fringe figure \" in sydney's islamic community, according to a guardian profile. Shia muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to sunni islam and pledged allegiance to isis. The lawyer who represented monis in the murder case tells the australian broadcasting company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \" nothing to lose, \" hence \" participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this. \" he says that while in prison, monis suffered some \" very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell, \" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \" one-off random individual, \" not an organized terrorist group.",

( the background on the feud is here. ) coverage: the new york times explores how it further frays trump's ties with an african-american community already wary of him. \" i don't think we have ever had a president so publicly condescending to what black politics means, \" says a duke professor. A gop county commissioner in georgia's gwinnett county, tommy hunter, is facing calls to resign after he wrote online that lewis is a \" racist pig. \" see the atlanta journal-constitution. In a speech marking mlk day, lewis did not mention trump, instead telling personal stories of his own civil rights battles and preaching non-violence. \" the way of love is a better way, \" he said, per nbc news. Michelle obama tweeted her support of lewis today. Martin luther king iii met with trump monday, and while he praised lewis, he also sought to tamp down the controversy. \"things get said on both sides in the heat of emotion. And at some point in this nation, we've got to move forward. \" see the los angeles times. So far, nearly 28 democratic members of congress vow to skip the inauguration, reports the bbc. A blogger at the liberal daily kos says lewis went too far in saying trump was not a \" legitimate president. \" democrats must admit it or face charges of hypocrisy, reads the post here. Mike pence is \" so disappointed \" in lewis, he tells fox news. Trump slammed lewis ' atlanta district as crime-ridden and \" falling apart, \" and those who live there were surprised to hear it and eager to rebut the charge. See the wall street journal.

Obama, who reacted with emotion to the mass shooting at umpqua community college and will visit roseburg, ore., on friday, is \" seriously considering \" new rules that would force private high-volume dealers to perform background checks on potential buyers, according to the washington post. Private dealers who sell a certain number of guns each year would also need to get a license. Nine days before the umpqua shooting, gun-control activists gabrielle giffords and her husband, mark kelly, visited the white house to repeat their desire to see just such a rule put in place. Officials considered targeting dealers who sell at least 50 guns a year back in 2013, but the plan was ultimately put on ice. The proposed rule change would clarify the federal statute, which notes anyone \" engaged in the business \" of dealing firearms needs to obtain a federal license and conduct background checks, except anyone \" who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. \" earlier this week, hillary clinton said she would take executive action to change the definition of a gun dealer if elected president, per the post. A rep for the nra, however, says the proposed change would \" ensnare \" a widow selling off her late husband's gun collection, for example. \" people who repeatedly sell large volumes of firearms are already covered in the current statute, \" she says.",

How to combat gun violence could become a real issue in the 2016 race: the republican presidential candidates have seemed to adopt the position that there is little the federal government can do about it, and today, in an effort to contrast with that willfully defeatist posture, hillary clinton rolled out some concrete proposals. Clinton's new plan, which she will discuss on the campaign trail today, includes a raft of ideas: closing loopholes in the background check system; more aggressive action to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply so-called \"straw purchasers \"; and repealing a law that protects gun manufacturers from liability for gun violence. But the most controversial aspect of clinton's plan is this: she vowed to take executive action to partly close the loophole that allows private sellers to peddle guns without a background check if congress doesn't. Clinton's campaign says that this could theoretically be accomplished via a new rule by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms that would more clearly define what it means to be \"engaged in the business \" of selling firearms. Gun control advocates point out that under federal law, those \"engaged in the business \" of selling firearms must",

( ap ) speaking at the white house on thursday evening, a visibly frustrated and emotional president obama remarked on the deadly shooting at a community college in oregon. ( ap ) in response to the latest mass shooting during his presidency, president obama is seriously considering circumventing congress with his executive authority and imposing new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers. Under the proposed rule change, dealers who exceed a certain number of sales each year would be required to obtain a license from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives and perform background checks on potential buyers. As the president heads to roseburg, ore., on friday to comfort the survivors and families of those killed in last week's mass shooting at umpqua community college, the political calculus around his most vexing domestic policy issue is shifting once again. After the dec. 14, 2012, shooting at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, conn., claimed the lives of 20 students and six staff members, obama asked vice president biden to devise a list of policy proposals in response, and on jan. 26, 2013, the president announced 23 executive actions ranging from restarting federal research"

        "summary": "The republican-led house benghazi committee released its final report tuesday after two years of investigations. The 800-page report lays out the committee's findings on the 2012 attacks in libya that left four americans dead. Here's what you need to know: benghazi is \" unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening clinton \" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the los angeles times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the washington post lays out its five \" most serious accusations, \" including that the cia \" missed warning signs \" and \" misread how dangerous libya... Was at the time. \" new evidence of \"culpability or wrongdoing \" on clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \"one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, \" according to the new york times. Given a lack of new evidence against clinton, the weekly standard uses the report as a tool for blaming obama. \"the obama administration knowingly provided the american people a false story about the benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences, \" the standard states. How various government agencies responded to the benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the hill, a democratic lawmaker on the house benghazi committee calls it \" one of the saddest exercises i've ever engaged in \" during 20 years in congress. He accuses republicans of hiding the final report from democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \" most revealing paragraph \" in the report, vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \" non-damning facts as damning \" for the obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no us forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the white house. \" i think it's time to move on, \" the ap quotes clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board.",

        "summary": "Workers in japan put in notoriously long hours, and the country appears to be paying a price: stressed out workers and resulting health problems, including suicide. As the japan times notes, there's even a word for it: \" karoshi, \" or \" death by overwork. \" now japan is designating the last friday of every month as \" premium friday, \" with employees encouraged to sign out at 3pm — and maybe do a little shopping to jump-start their weekend and possibly a lagging economy, reports the london times. The move isn't mandatory for companies, but the nation's biggest business lobby is on board and encouraging its members to take part when it launches on feb. 24. It doesn't help that most workers in japan tend to use only half their allotted paid time off, and that an estimated one in eight work 50 hours or more — the highest percentage among g-7 nations. So it remains unclear whether premium friday will be a sufficient break for the overworked, or even attainable for those who must squeeze in their work at other times. Fortune is skeptical, calling it an \" essentially meaningless \" scheme. It quotes a critic who says the bigger issue to focus on is efficiency to cut down on those long work weeks, which are \" still considered a virtue. \" another problem is that japan has lots of small, family-run businesses where shortened hours could be a problem, notes the bbc.

A heat and power station that powers 150,000 homes there has a mandate to stop burning fossil fuels like coal and oil by 2020. Its path to achieving that involves burning \" only renewable and recycled fuels, \" which in its case, includes recycled wood and \" trash \" from an h&m warehouse in the neighboring city of eskilstuna. Bloomberg reports it was only last week that the trash was specified as clothing, and a rep for h&m in sweden explains the company \" does not burn any clothes that are safe to use. \" what's being torched — year to date, about 30,000 pounds ' worth — are ones that may \" contain mold or do not comply with our strict restriction on chemicals. \" the alternative would seemingly be a landfill, which is where a staggering amount of our clothing ends up. The atlantic in 2014 reported that americans toss about 10.5 million tons of clothing a year. That's about 85 % of what we get rid of, with the other 15 % recycled — either ultimately worn by someone else, turned into industrial rags, or \" ground down \" and repurposed as items ranging from insulation and furniture stuffing to pet bedding, per the secondary materials and recycled textiles association. The sourcing journal cites the environmental protection agency's concern over the situation: the agency recorded a 38 % jump in textile waste between 2000 and 2011. Quartz points to a 2016 mckinsey study that found that over that same period, european clothing companies increased their number of annual collections from two to five.",

The suit, which the ap notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85 % reduction at bears ears is an \" extreme overreach in authority \" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and native american artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner yvon chouinard told cnn of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \" this government is evil, and i ' m not going to sit back and let evil win. \" president obama designated bears ears a national monument at the end of 2016; grand staircase-escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from president clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the antiquities act, with native american tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the ap had varying opinions on the matter. Nbc news, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that patagonia has long been active in fighting for utah's public lands.

A criminal case against the officer, who denies wrongdoing, is still pending. It's not clear how many convictions will actually be vacated — some defendants will have been found not guilty, while others could have been convicted on other evidence. State authorities told the top court that the step dennis allegedly skipped is only required in new jersey, the ap reports.

In truth, his application was to simply double the living space by adding a second story. Of course, if you include the additional nonliving space — including a basement and a garage — then you get to the \"quadrupling. \" even so, mcquaid thinks romney should make an official statement to clear the issue up. \"accuracy in media is more than the name of a group.

The cut is a sizable one, dropping the allowable limit by two-thirds from 30 parts per million to 10. Backers say the move will eventually save the us billions in health care costs, but the oil industry disputes that and says the only tangible result will be higher gas prices. Sulfur content already has come down drastically since 1994 from 300 parts per million, and an industry executive says getting the remaining \" little buggers \" out of there isn't worth the cost. Environmental groups pushed for the move, as did the auto industry, which argued that the lower limit will put the us in line with japan and europe, reports the hill. Automakers are big fans of the change because it will make it easier for them to meet emissions standards nationwide. The post quotes the leader of a clean-air group as saying the epa decision will end up being the biggest such move of president obama's second term. \" there is not another air pollution control strategy that we know of that will produce as substantial, cost-effective and expeditious emissions reductions. \"",

Alcohol is believed to have been a factor in adrian simon's death. Simon had been in serious condition since the accident on dec. 21, when he was hit by a train around 4: 30am, severing his legs above the knee. Police are still investigating why simon was on the tracks; abc reports he was asleep. Police are also investigating a group of partygoers from that night who attacked emergency workers and police as they attempted to tend to simon; charges may be pending. \" it was a very unfortunate accident that had happened, but ( the attack ) was definitely unwarranted, and no one will tolerate that, \" hogan says.

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in st.

Before his disappearance, latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself.

For 24 years running, the central asian nation near the caspian sea has been terrorized by its own leader, who has killed thousands of unarmed protesters, forced children to work in slavelike conditions and imprisoned thousands for their religious beliefs. Karimov has even executed prisoners without a trial, according to our reporting, including boiling a couple to death. Read more here.

        "summary": "Far-right candidate marine le pen and independent emmanuel macron have been drawing the lion's share of attention as the french presidential election nears ( the first round is april 23 ), but a leftist candidate who has used a hologram of himself to stump at campaign rallies is now gaining some traction. In what the washington post calls a \" truly unprecedented campaign, \" jean-luc melenchon has seemingly emerged out of thin air as the unbowed france candidate, with added support from the french communist party — and he \" gives shivers to banks, businesspeople, and the bourgeoisie, \" per the new york times. Melenchon, once considered a fringe candidate no one really paid mind to, is running on an anti-capitalism platform, with a mission to dismantle the monarchy-styled governmental system implemented by charles de gaulle in the late ' 50s. Melenchon is now ahead of mainstream conservative francois fillon in the polls and only a couple of points behind macron and le pen. He's been speaking to the younger set with videos on youtube and a video game in which players go after bankers and the head of the imf. What makes this year's election in france notable is that the slightly left-leaning socialists and slightly right-leaning republicans aren't the ones duking it out for the country's top seat. And the showdown between le pen and melenchon, whom the times says is sometimes depicted as a \" french bernie sanders, \" even sounds strikingly like the one witnessed between sanders and donald trump, with both candidates vying for voters who want to decimate the status quo, though with different tactics: le pen is tapping into nationalism, while melenchon is pushing help for the poor.

According to vice, it appeared someone had used a hammer to \" break apart the bones in his face, \" and there was so much blood it seeped through three layers of flooring into an office below. The defense for the beer magnate's 47-year-old son dennis — who has been charged with his murder — rested its case this week, the cbc reports. Money is suspected to have played a part in the killing. According to vice, dennis was hundreds of thousands in debt and owed more than $ 500,000 to his millionaire father alone. After richard's death, dennis inherited leadership positions in three companies and a $ 150,000 payout. The cbc reports dennis continued to maintain his innocence during testimony this week while acknowledging discrepancies between his testimony and a 2011 police statement. For example, dennis — who was the last person to see his father alive — originally told police he was wearing a different jacket than he was when he saw richard the day before his body was found. The jacket he was actually wearing had three bloodstains on it matching richard's dna. He blames the differences on shock and nerves during his interview with police. The oland family, which founded moosehead breweries, has rallied around dennis and says he is innocent. Jurors are scheduled to reconvene on dec. 14 to decide that for themselves.

But they're actually made up of hundreds of tiny animals knit together with tissue into a filter-feeding cylinder. Hilarie sorensen/university of oregon and they're everywhere, filling the waters off the west coast all the way up to alaska, and washing up on beaches. One research boat caught 60,000 of them in five minutes. They're so thick in alaska that fishermen gave up on fishing because their hooks were coming up full of pyrosomes instead of salmon. Jennifer fisher, a research assistant with oregon state university's hatfield marine science center in newport, makes regular research trips to monitor ocean conditions. She started seeing pyrosomes in her research net in february, and a gopro camera on the net revealed an eerie underwater habitat filled with the pickle-shaped creatures. \"basically as far as the eye can see: pyrosomes, \" she said. \"we were dumbfounded. \" pyrosomes are common in the tropics, where they can reach a length of 30 feet and often glow in the dark.

Sources with direct knowledge of keith schiller's testimony in front of the house intelligence committee this week confirmed the account to cnn, nbc news, and abc news. Sources say schiller, who had worked full-time for trump since 2012, testified the offer was made by someone — he doesn't remember who — following a business meeting ahead of the pageant. He reportedly testified that he turned the offer down, believing it to be a joke. Sources say he later told trump about the offer, and they both laughed about it. Committee members asked about the incident because of allegations made in a dossier compiled by christopher steele, a former british agent. Specifically, the dossier alleged a \" salacious \" encounter between trump and prostitutes at his moscow hotel that was secretly recorded. Sources say schiller testified that trump went to bed alone that night and that he waited for a few minutes outside trump's door before going to bed himself. He reportedly said he couldn't be sure what happened after that, but he doubts trump had any guests.

The lake, located in the gale crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones — which form in calm, still water — contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals. The lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the rover's progress. National geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways, including one that's less promising for martian life hunters: curiosity's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal, within a few million years, to anything within several meters of the surface. Though the researchers did note that some classes of bacteria might have been able to survive through long periods of hibernation.",

Ricky jackson, 57, was dismissed from the cuyahoga county jail and walked out of the adjoining courthouse this morning about an hour after a judge dismissed his case. The dismissal came after the key witness — then a 13-year-old boy — at trial against jackson and brothers wiley and ronnie bridgeman recanted last year and said cleveland police detectives coerced him into testifying that the three killed businessman harry franks on the afternoon of may 19, 1975. About two hours later, wiley bridgeman was also dismissed; ronnie bridgeman, who now goes by the name kwame ajamu, got out on parole in 2003, nbc news reports. \" finally, finally, \" jackson said as he left the cleveland justice center complex, the cleveland plain dealer reports. Jackson, who was just 18 when he entered prison, offered gratitude toward the ohio innocence project ( which says that of all exonerated us prisoners, he spent the most time behind bars ) and county prosecutors and absolved eddie vernon, the boy whose testimony helped put him away. \" i don't hate him, \" he tells the plain dealer. \" he's a grown man today, he was just a boy back then.

The probe is looking at whether a doctor was on prince's plane when he made an emergency landing in illinois the week before his death, and whether he overdosed on the plane, a law enforcement official tells the ap, which notes that the development is worryingly reminiscent of michael jackson's death. The source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller percocet is believed to have been involved. Documents released on thursday signal that the investigation is now a criminal probe and charges are a possibility, the star tribune reports. The documents released by the carver county, minn., sheriff's office thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at prince's paisley park the day he died, reuters reports. A judge granted the request, which was made on the grounds that \" intense media scrutiny \" could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people. Carver county chief deputy jason kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at prince's home. He tells the ap that contrary to media reports, investigators have not asked the dea to get involved. \" we might contact them to help us, but that hasn't happened, \" he says. \" we don't have the medical examiner's report yet.

Bob, who was operating disney's miramax with harvey at the time, confirms the payment but says he only agreed because harvey said \" he was fooling around with two women \" who wanted money \" and he didn't want his wife to find out. \" the payment was also hidden from disney, but bob says \" there was nothing to indicate any kind of sexual harassment. \" while bob weinstein remains as head of the weinstein company, a $ 275 million bid for its assets led by maria contreras-sweet, former head of the us small business administration, would see 51 % of the company controlled by women, reports deadline.

Secretary of state jon husted said wednesday the private investor group responsibleohio had collected 320,267 signatures of registered ohio voters, 14,676 more than necessary to qualify for the general-election ballot. Responsibleohio spent more than $ 2 million since march on the petition drive to put its proposed marijuana legalization amendment before voters. Responsibleohio has been tracking the count through daily reports to husted's office. Earlier wedneday, before husted's certification, ian james, the group's executive director, sent out an email crowing that the group had made the ballot. After husted certified the petition result, james issued a statement: \" it's time for marijuana legalization in ohio, and voters will have the opportunity to make it happen this november -- we couldn't be more excited,. Drug dealers don't care about doing what's best for our state and its citizens.

The group's investors pledged to spend at least $ 20 million to convince ohioans to vote for legalization. If the measure passes, however, legalization might take a while: in june, the ohio legislature hurriedly placed a measure, issue 2, that prohibited \" a monopoly, oligopoly or cartel \" in ohio of federally-controlled substances like marijuana. The responsibleohio initiative calls for a limit to pot production by ten farms, which state legislators argue might constitute an oligopoly. Ohio follows ballot initiatives from across the country. Thus far, recreational marijuana is legal in colorado, oregon, washington, alaska, and washington, d.c.; 28 states make exceptions for medical marijuana."

            "Ohioans will vote nov. 3 on whether to legalize marijuana under an oligopoly in which cultivation of the commercial crop will be limited to 10 farms. ( photo: file ) story highlights ohio could become sixth jurisdiction in nation to legalize marijuana ballot clash with legislative initiative could end up in the courts ohio voters will decide nov. 3 whether to legalize marijuana with a constitutional amendment to institute a revolutionary proposal that backers say will create a billion-dollar industry in the next four years. Secretary of state jon husted said wednesday the private investor group responsibleohio had collected 320,267 signatures of registered ohio voters, 14,676 more than necessary to qualify for the general-election ballot. Responsibleohio spent more than $ 2 million since march on the petition drive to put its proposed marijuana legalization amendment before voters. Responsibleohio has been tracking the count through daily reports to husted's office. Earlier wedneday, before husted's certification, ian james, the group's executive director, sent out an email crowing that the group had made the ballot. After husted certified the petition result, james issued a statement: \" it's time for marijuana legalization in ohio, and voters will have the opportunity to make it happen this november -- we couldn't be more excited,. Drug dealers don't care about doing what's best for our state and its citizens. By reforming marijuana laws in november, we ' ll provide compassionate care to sick ohioans, bring money back to our local communities and establish a new industry with limitless economic development opportunities. \" the next step is before the ohio ballot board, which meets aug. 18 to determine responsibleohio's ballot language and",
            "The buckeye state will put pot legalization to the ballot on nov. 3, ohio secretary of state jon husted confirmed. Putting marijuana legalization on the ballot took a couple tries: ohio's first attempt failed, but pro-pot advocate group responsibleohio, a driving force behind the initiative, pulled through with the minimum 305,591 signatures. The group's investors pledged to spend at least $ 20 million to convince ohioans to vote for legalization. If the measure passes, however, legalization might take a while: in june, the ohio legislature hurriedly placed a measure, issue 2, that prohibited \" a monopoly, oligopoly or cartel \" in ohio of federally-controlled substances like marijuana. The responsibleohio initiative calls for a limit to pot production by ten farms, which state legislators argue might constitute an oligopoly. Ohio follows ballot initiatives from across the country. Thus far, recreational marijuana is legal in colorado, oregon, washington, alaska, and washington, d.c.; 28 states make exceptions for medical marijuana."

In a traffic stop last april, billings police officer grant morrison pulled over a car with four people inside and repeatedly told them to raise their hands, the ap reports via mediaite. When backseat passenger richard ramirez didn't raise them, morrison warned he would shoot. Then he did. \" i was getting very scared, \" morrison told the jury, the billings gazette reports. \" he shoved his hand down to his side and started jiggling it up and down. \" methamphetamine and a syringe were later discovered near ramirez's seat, and a toxicology test found a strong dose of meth in his system. Mediate has a police dashcam video of the shooting ( warning: graphic content ); another dashcam shows morrison breaking down afterward. \" i thought he was going to pull a gun, \" says a visibly distraught morrison, the independent reports. \" i don't know what's going on. \" but ramirez's mother betty says she still doesn't see why morrison shot her 38-year-old son. \" he was just a good person, and they didn't have to do that to him, \" she tells the gazette. \" i ' m going to fight it.... I ' m not going to give up. \" a family friend says they saw the hearing as one-sided. The ruling is only a recommendation, but the yellowstone county attorney's office says it likely won't seek charges. It wasn't morrison's first such incident, either: in 2013, he fatally shot a man who ignored his orders and reached for what turned out to be a replica bb gun.",

The global chemical weapons watchdog has been testing the nerve agent used to poison the skripals in the uk. Cbs news reports the four suspects, which included an it expert, were caught \" in flagrante \" on april 13 and immediately removed from the country. The men were allegedly trying to hack into the opcw via its wifi network, reports the guardian, supposedly after a spear-phishing attack launched from russia failed. The trunk of their rental car, which was parked outside the opcw's hq, reportedly contained computer equipment designed to intercept log-ins. One of the men allegedly tried to trash his cell phone upon being confronted by authorities, reports the bbc, but officials say plenty of damning evidence was recovered, including an antenna concealed under a coat and a taxi receipt for a trip from a street near the gru's moscow location to the airport. British ambassador to the netherlands peter wilson, who was present for the announcement, said a seized laptop's history indicated it was part of previous hacks: in malaysia in association with the investigation into the downing of flight mh-17 over the ukraine in 2014, and in lausanne, switzerland, in connection with the world anti-doping agency, which has investigated doping by russian athletes. Wilson's take: that the gru was trying to \" clean up russia's own mess. \" russia's take, per a foreign ministry rep quoted by the guardian: \" big fantasies. \"",

Why so much time between the discovery and its reporting? the team couldn't even dig up the bones until 2010, because of the need for permits, and it took 1,300 hours of cleaning and chiseling to unearth the fossil — the completeness of which is \" pretty spectacular, \" according to the paleontologist.

A harvard university junior lost his facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's messenger system. Aran khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in harvard's technology science journal. \" from 2011 to the start of this study in may 2015, facebook messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the android mobile app, \" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so khanna developed a browser app called marauder's map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his chrome extension and posted about it on medium on may 26. By the 28th, cnn, the washington post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, facebook asked khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a june 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew khanna's internship, which was to start on june 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \" high ethical standards expected of interns, \" according to boston.com. \" this mapping tool scraped facebook data in a way that violated our terms, \" a facebook rep tells the site. Khanna says his app was created using his own messenger history, not data scraping. \" i didn't write the program to be malicious, \" he says. Khanna ended up securing an internship with another silicon valley firm. ( this alleged intern tale of woe involves the olsen twins. )",

            "Barack obama came to washington just six years ago, having spent his professional life as a part-time lawyer, part-time law professor, and part-time state legislator in illinois. As an undergraduate, he took courses in history and international relations, but neither his academic life nor his work in springfield gave him an especially profound grasp of foreign affairs. As he coasted toward winning a seat in the u.s. Senate, in 2004, he began to reach out to a broad range of foreign-policy experts – – politicians, diplomats, academics, and journalists. As a student during the reagan years, obama gravitated toward conventionally left-leaning positions. At occidental, he demonstrated in favor of divesting from apartheid south africa. At columbia, he wrote a forgettable essay in sundial, a campus publication, in favor of the nuclear-freeze movement. As a professor at the university of chicago, he focussed on civil-rights",

Thank you for so boldly and visibly injecting into our politics the phrase \"leading from behind. \" thank you for associating it with your boss. Thanks for confirming that our current president believes his task is to accommodate american decline. Thanks for reminding us how high a priority he places on appeasing those who revile us. And thanks for explaining that our leader from behind sees his role as \"shepherding us through this phase \" of appeasement and decline. Nonetheless, obama may be moving toward something resembling a doctrine. One of his advisers described the president's actions in libya as \"leading from behind. \" that's not a slogan designed for signs at the 2012 democratic convention, but it does accurately describe the balance that obama now seems to be finding. It's a different definition of leadership",

Doctrines involve ideas, but since there are no discernible ones that make sense of obama foreign policy — lizza's painstaking two-year chronicle shows it to be as ad hoc, erratic and confused as it appears — this will have to do. And it surely is an accurate description, from president obama's shocking passivity during iran's 2009 green revolution to his dithering on libya, acting at the very last moment, then handing off to a bickering coalition, yielding the current bloody stalemate. It's been a foreign policy of hesitation, delay and indecision, marked by plaintive appeals"
