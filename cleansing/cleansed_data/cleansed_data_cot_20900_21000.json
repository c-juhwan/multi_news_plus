This weight bias works the other way, too — a 130-pound person sees that same distance as just 15 yards. Participants also performed worse at tasks when targets appeared smaller, and better when larger. \" we think that these perceptual biases can create a vicious circle for people with obesity where they see the world as impossible to navigate, \" says witt. \" they will be less likely to choose to be active — and that's going to continue in this unhealthy lifestyle. \" ( obesity is on the rise in every single country around the world. )",

Elite troops learned to use the bombs — called b54 special atomic demolition munitions ( sadms ) — in case communists attacked us-friendly countries like former west germany. Although heavy, sadms could fit in a backpack and be transported by parachute-drop, scuba mission, or even on skis. The trick was setting the timer ( which was unreliable ) and getting far enough away before they went off ( although some commanders wanted men to stay behind and protect them ). Luckily they were never used, and units trained in sadms kept a grim sense of humor about it. \" those who were to conduct the mission were sure that whomever thought this up was using bad hemp, \" said an sadm team commander. But backpack nukes served a strategic need: to destroy bridges, roads, and mountain passes in case russian forces invaded countries where they could easily overwhelm us troops. The only downside: utter devastation. As cold war tensions faded, the us recalled sadms from storage depots around the world and eventually retired the project in 1989. \" the idea that the world came this close to the use of nuclear weapons on battlefields across the world is entirely unreal, \" says business insider. \" at least we can all be thankful that cooler heads prevailed. \"",

Us policy makers, aware of their numerical inferiority compared to the combined military strength of the warsaw pact countries, desperately looked for options that would level the playing field while halting a soviet advance. D.b. Grady and adam rawnsley, writing for foreign policy, went through a treasure trove of recently declassified information and revealed the pure insanity of backpack sized nukes. We have summarized some of the most interesting details from their report: 1. After president eisenhower, the us embraced the idea of limited nuclear war. The idea was not to lead to an all out nuclear apocalypse. Instead, \" small \" weapons, still more powerful than hiroshima in most cases, were embraced. These weapons would obliterate a battlefield and irradiate much of the surrounding area. 2. Elite soldiers from the army, navy, and marines were trained to use these nukes in a variety of battlefields.

            "The 1950s and ' 60s were a golden age of nuclear weapons design. Scientists and technicians at the los alamos and sandia nuclear weapons laboratories succeeded in miniaturizing the so-called \" physics packages \" at the core of atomic bombs from the nearly 10,000-plus-pound behemoth used in the first-ever nuclear test to smaller warheads that could fit atop a missile. And their colleagues in rocketry surged ahead in developing land- and submarine-launched ballistic missiles that, together with bombers, soon made up the nuclear \" triad \" supporting strategic deterrence against the soviets. From the army's perspective, the problem was that bombers and missiles were managed by the air force and the navy, leaving the ground force out of arguably the most significant development in the history of war, even as its soldiers would be chiefly responsible for stopping a soviet invasion of western europe. Fortunately for the army, many u.s. Strategists still saw nukes simply as bigger conventional bombs, and america's post-hiroshima mastery of the cutting-edge science of atomic destruction had filled weapons designers more with a sense of the possible than the prudent. The result was a series of odd creations that made their way into the army's arsenal, from atomic artillery to nuclear-tipped air-defense missiles. In a 1969 study, the u.s. Army tows an m-60 tank from a crater created by a simulated half-kiloton adm blast to",
            "Department of defense / wikipedia at the height of the cold war, the united states was seriously considering the use of backpack sized nuclear weapons for tactical strikes. Us policy makers, aware of their numerical inferiority compared to the combined military strength of the warsaw pact countries, desperately looked for options that would level the playing field while halting a soviet advance. D.b. Grady and adam rawnsley, writing for foreign policy, went through a treasure trove of recently declassified information and revealed the pure insanity of backpack sized nukes. We have summarized some of the most interesting details from their report: 1. After president eisenhower, the us embraced the idea of limited nuclear war. The idea was not to lead to an all out nuclear apocalypse. Instead, \" small \" weapons, still more powerful than hiroshima in most cases, were embraced. These weapons would obliterate a battlefield and irradiate much of the surrounding area. 2. Elite soldiers from the army, navy, and marines were trained to use these nukes in a variety of battlefields. Advertisement the battlefronts for the use of these weapons stretched from eastern europe to iran and all the way over to korea. Backpack nukes were meant to be part of the us military's effort to ensure the containment of communist forces. 3. Many in the defense industry at the time just"

According to the times, the holigost — or holy ghost — fought in two major battles that helped henry conquer parts of france during the hundred years ' war. And henry himself may have sailed in it. At the end of its life, the holigost sat unused with a single crew member charged with bailing out water every day to keep it from sinking, the guardian reports. The great ship likely sank when its dock collapsed. Historic england hopes to use drone photography, sonar, and wood dating to verify the wreckage found in the river hamble as the holigost. It says further research on the ship could provide valuable information on 15th-century shipbuilding, ship life, naval strategies, and more, according to the bbc.

        "summary": "It was an iphone bonanza on tuesday, with apple announcing not one, not two, but three new iphones during its annual conference, abc news reports. The iphone 8 and iphone 8 plus — starting at $ 699 and $ 799 respectively — are a continuation of the iphone as we know it and feature improvements in durability, speed, cameras, and more. But the real star of the show was the iphone x, a celebration of the iphone's 10th anniversary that ceo tim cook calls the \" biggest leap forward since the original iphone. \" the iphone x will start at $ 999 and be released nov. 3. Here's everything you need to know about apple's big day: wired has a whole lot more on the iphone x. It has a screen that takes up the entire front of the phone, the home button is gone, it can shoot in 4k, and face id will let users unlock the phone, make purchases, and more just by looking at it. But is face id safe? apple says there's only a one in a million chance someone could access your phone using face id, but bustle reports other companies have run into problems before and worries about the privacy implications of apple having detailed scans of its customers ' faces. Cnet calls the iphone x a \" badly needed makeover \" for the iphone, one that in many ways is simply playing catch-up with samsung's newest models. But with iphone sales slumping for the first time last year, innovation was necessary. Apple announced more than just iphones on tuesday, and cnbc looks at all of the new products, including apple tv 4k and the apple watch series 3. The verge reports one of those new products is a charging mat called airpower, which apple says will be able to wirelessly charge iphones, ipads, and airpods simultaneously. Apple is releasing ios 11 to the public on sept. 19, ars technica reports. The update will feature a number of changes, including options to type instead of speak to siri and to disable notifications while driving. Tuesday also served as the public debut of apple's new california headquarters, apple park, the telegraph reports. The new campus is estimated to have cost $ 5 billion, will house more than 14,000 employees, runs on 100 % renewable energy, and features a main building that looks like a flying saucer.

        "summary": "During the period known as the last glacial maximum some 21,000 years ago, mammoth lakes spread out across large swaths of the west, and scientists have long wondered why the now-dry lakes used to be so big. Mystery solved: a new study finds that the reason has nothing to do with higher precipitation — a long-running theory unraveled by recent analysis that found rain and snowfall levels were relatively low at the time — but rather slower evaporation. Analyzing limestone samples taken from the edges of lake surprise, a fossil lake in california, geologists found more amounts of the isotope known as oxygen-18 than oxygen-16, which is slightly lighter. Oxygen-18 water evaporates more slowly, and the ratio of the two isotopes indicates that evaporation rates during the last glacial maximum were a whopping 40 % lower than what we experience today. \" lake surprise is located in a closed basin, \" lead author daniel ibarra at stanford tells physorg. \" all streams flow into the lake, but there is no outflow. The only way for water to escape is through evaporation. \" because precipitation rates in the region appear to have gone up for a brief period 15,000 years ago, right around when lake surprise reached its largest size ( 530 square miles ), the giant lakes in the west probably grew large initially due to lower evaporation, and then reached what would be their maximum sizes when rain and snowfall increased several thousand years later.

To better constrain these climatic forcing factors, we present a new lacustrine paleoclimate record and precipitation estimates for lake surprise, a closed basin lake in northeastern california. We combine a detailed analysis of lake hydrography and constitutive relationships describing the water balance to determine the influence of precipitation, evaporation, temperature, and seasonal insolation on past lake levels. At its maximum extent, during the last deglaciation, lake surprise covered 1366 km2 ( 36 % ) of the terminally draining surprise valley watershed. Using paired radiocarbon and 230th-u analyses, we dated shoreline tufa deposits from wave-cut lake terraces in surprise valley, california, to determine the hydrography of the most recent lake cycle. This new lake hydrograph places the highest lake level 176 m above the present-day playa at 15.19 ± 0.18 calibrated ka ( 14c age ).

The research, published in the journal geological society of america bulletin, found that the lakes were able to grow large – rivaling the great lakes – during the peak of the last ice age 21,000 years ago, a period known as the \" last glacial maximum, \" because evaporation rates were significantly lower than today. \" it was previously thought that the lakes grew because there was more rain and snowfall during this period of the earth's history, \" said daniel ibarra, a graduate student in stanford's department of environmental earth system science and the first author of the study. More quantitative studies of past climate could help refine the computer models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) to simulate earth's atmospheric conditions under changing atmospheric conditions, said kate maher, assistant professor of geological and environmental sciences, who headed the project. \" the ipcc uses climate models to simulate past and future climate, so knowing that some of the models do a better job of simulating"

        "summary": "A texas school has gone to the dark side, at least according to the father of a student who attends it. School officials at george junior high in rosenberg made the first move last thursday when they forced 7th grader colton southern to cover up his t-shirt depicting a stormtrooper ( of the star wars variety ) wielding a ( fictional ) blaster, ktrk reports. A district rep explains the dress code prohibits \" symbols oriented toward violence, \" and school officials point out they went easy on colton, who could have been hit with an in-school suspension for the violation. In response, colton's dad, joe southern, has lobbed accusations of \" political correctness run amok, \" saying that colton being forced to zip up his jacket over the shirt constitutes a violation of the first amendment. As far as guns go, the telegraph notes texas has pretty lenient gun laws, and some 850,000 residents of the lone star state have concealed carry permits ( that's about 1 in every 32 residents ). But southern tells ktrk colton's wearing of the shirt \" has nothing to do with guns or making a stand. \" ultimately, \" it's just a star wars shirt, \" southern says, adding that his son had worn it to school several times previously. Star wars: the force awakens opens friday. In november, lucasfilm contacted cosplay groups and told them to leave their blasters at home when they go to see the film, ign reports. Many theaters, ign notes, already prohibit masks and replica weapons. ( some have said that this chinese poster for the force awakens is racist. )",

Furious fanboys reports groups such as the 501st and rebel legion have been contacted by lucasfilm and asked to abstain from bringing the fake weapons as a precautionary measure. Being that the force awakens is expected to have a massive opening, theater owners and others attached to the film are taking precautions to prevent a tragedy similar to the aurora shootings during the debut the dark knight rises.

So long, in fact, that experts had believed they spread across the supercontinent pangaea before it split into the continents we know today. But new research on the long-bodied, segmented creatures — most of which, though not all, lack legs — suggests that's not the case: the creatures actually fanned out across the world after the continents split apart, according to a post at eureka alert. So how did the burrowing animals manage to get across the water? that's where the study really gets interesting: it seems that the animals got their start in north america, newsweek reports, then rafted elsewhere – via \" floating vegetation. \" it happened shortly after an asteroid hit the earth some 65 million years ago, likely killing off the dinosaurs. \" continental breakup was about 95 million years ago, and these animals only become widespread 30 million years later, \" a researcher says. It might seem unlikely that the animals \" could have survived a flood clinging to the roots of a fallen tree and then traveled hundreds of miles across an ocean … but having looked at the data, it is the only explanation for the remarkable diversity and spread of not just worm lizards, but nearly every other living thing as well. \" indeed, he adds, \" once you eliminate the impossible, whatever you're left with, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. \" ( in other prehistoric news, dinosaur remains were recently discovered — by a 4-year-old. )",

The only other person present for the conversation was the russian president's translator, the hill reports. According to the washington post, trump had his first face-to-face meeting with putin during the summit july 7; later that same day he attended a couples-only dinner with other world leaders. Halfway through the meal, trump left his seat and took one next to putin. Their hour-long conversation was held just outside listening distance of other diners. Ian bremmer of the think tank eurasia group says other leaders have said they were \" bemused, nonplussed, befuddled \" by the private conversation. The meeting was not disclosed to reporters traveling with trump, and reuters reports the white house isn't giving details about what was discussed during trump's second meeting with putin. National security council spokesperson michael anton tells cnn he can't say what was discussed as no staff were present. He says the dinner was attended by only leaders, spouses, and translators. Other white house officials say the only version of the meeting they have is trump's own. Bremmer says trump breached national security protocol by not having his own translator present for the conversation with putin. Trump reportedly only brought a japanese translator to the dinner to facilitate conversation with japanese president shinzo abe.",

            "It's dangerous being a zebra. These ungulates, which graze on the plains ( as well as mountains and grasslands ) of africa, face many existential threats. For instance, the very act of eating grass can be lethal, as anthrax spores reside in the soil. Ingesting these spores can lead to a deadly gastrointestinal infection. Zebras must also avoid human hunters. And they need lots of water, so they must never wander very far away from waterholes. However, the waterhole is deceptively tranquil; simply taking a quick drink can result in being eaten by a lion. Fortunately for the zebras, they have evolved white and black stripes as camouflage to confuse lions. That's the conventional wisdom, anyway. But, as is so often the case, the conventional wisdom appears to be wrong. New research in nature communications concludes that zebras'stripes are actually for preventing bites from nasty insects, such as tabanids ( horse flies ). For some reason, these flies avoid landing on black and white striped surfaces. For their study, the authors collected stripe pattern data on seven wild equids: plains zebra, grévy's zebra, mountain zebra, african wild ass, przewalski's horse, kiang, and asiatic wild ass.

            "Washington — robyn j. Skrebes of minneapolis said she was able to sign up for health insurance in about two hours on monday using the web site of the state-run insurance exchange in minnesota, known as mnsure. Ms. Skrebes, who is 32 and uninsured, said she had selected a policy costing $ 179 a month, before tax credit subsidies, and also had obtained medicaid coverage for her 2-year-old daughter, emma. \"i am thrilled, \" ms. Skrebes said, referring to her policy. \"it's affordable, good coverage. And the web site of the minnesota exchange was pretty simple to use, pretty straightforward. The language was really clear. \" the experience described by ms.

In all, 106 people were indicted by the manhattan da's office, including 72 former cops and eight firefighters. The new york times calls it \" one of the largest social security disability frauds ever. \" many were caught working second jobs upon retirement, a no-no for those getting disability benefits. \" it's a particularly cynical part of the charged scheme that approximately half the defendants falsely claimed that their psychiatric disabilities were caused by the 9/11 attacks, \" says manhattan da cyrus vance jr.",

The radio host attacked president obama for sending troops to track down the militia's leader, slamming the president for \" targeting christians, \" the new york times reports. Limbaugh, overlooking the lra's well-documented history of atrocities against civilians over the last 20 years, read a list of lra objectives presented by one of its leaders 14 years ago, which he had apparently found on wikipedia. Later in the broadcast, he promised to do \" due diligence research \" on the group. The lra was declared a terrorist organization by george w. Bush in 2001, and the editor of conservative website redstate.com says \" lots of people who should know better \" have been asking him about the militia. \" people hearing the name assume it is a christian group fighting radical islamists in the sudan or some such.

Metes and bounds exist for this exact reason, \" said barlow in an email to the observer. \"i was on the point last saturday and used my hand held gps and my trucks gps to confirm my land is above the water line and was blending with the point just as i predicted.

Monday's 56-26 vote makes yellen the first woman to lead the central bank in its century-long history. It puts an economist in the post who has long focused on fighting unemployment and who backed the fed's recent efforts to spur the economy with low interest rates and huge bond purchases. Yellen, 67, begins her four-year term as chair on feb. 1. She replaces ben bernanke, who has held the job for eight years dominated by the great recession and his efforts to fight it. In debating yellen's confirmation, senators in both parties criticized the fed for doing too much and too little to boost the us economy, the new york times reports. But yellen's confirmation still passed easily, with 11 republicans on board, making her the first democratic nominee to lead the central bank since 1979. The bookish and meticulous economist will face several challenges in her new post, the wall street journal notes, including slowing down the fed's asset purchases as the economy improves and finding consensus on a divided policy committee.",

        "summary": "Hours after israel rejected john kerry's proposed ceasefire, israel and hamas have agreed to a 12-hour humanitarian truce starting at 7am israeli time, a us official told the jerusalem post. Prime minister benjamin netanyahu told kerry about the new arrangement, cnn reports. In rebuffing his earlier proposal, officials said the israeli defense forces had to keep destroying hamas-built tunnels running from gaza into israel. The officials also seemed to bristle at a call for israel and hamas to discuss opening the blockaded gaza border: members of israel's security cabinet were quoted as saying kerry's offer was \" a qatari proposal with ornaments \" — a reference to israeli accusations that qatar has given hamas political and financial backing. Israel said it would, however, accept a seven-day ceasefire if it could keep destroying the tunnels, an israeli official said. ( the idf will apparently keep looking for tunnels during the current ceasefire but won't destroy them, ynet news reports. ) meanwhile, france is bringing together foreign ministers tomorrow from several countries — including the us, qatar, turkey, germany, and italy — in an attempt to forge another ceasefire. \" our objective is to converge all international efforts so that the conditions of a ceasefire can emerge as quickly as possible, \" said a french diplomatic source. On the war front, the guardian reports that at least six palestinians died and scores were wounded during clashes in the west bank.",

The details: big payday: in the scam that worked, branson writes that somebody called up a rich associate pretending to be branson himself and asked for an emergency loan of $ 2 million. The associate \" incredibly graciously \" agreed, and the money is now gone. The trick? the conman took advantage of the news that branson was stuck on his private island in the wake of hurricane irma, and claimed to be unable to reach his bank. Almost: in the scam that failed, a conman ( branson suspects it's the same person ) called up branson and did a spot-on impersonation of british defense chief michael fallon. The fake fallon told an elaborate story about needing $ 5 million to pay the secret ransom of a kidnapped british diplomat. Branson smelled a rat, however, and subsequently got in touch with fallon's office, which made clear no such call was ever placed. ( reuters reports that the conman tried the fallon-impersonating scam with at least one other person. ) branson says he is now spreading the word to prevent future scams and, with any luck, to get his friend's money back, per the guardian.",

Here are 25, in chronological order, who have spoken with cnn, spoken on camera about their allegations or been the subject of responses from cosby's attorneys. Read more on the allegations and cosby's denials. Hide caption 1 of 26 photos: who are cosby's accusers? in january 2004, andrea constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at temple university -- cosby's alma mater -- was at the comedian's cheltenham, pennsylvania, home when cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the next year. She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of ontario, canada, in january 2005. She was the first person to publicly allege sexual assault by cosby. The comedian settled a civil suit with constand that alleged 13 jane does had similar stories of sexual abuse. On december 30, 2015, cosby was charged with sexual assault in relation to the 2004 accusation, costand's attorney dolores troiani confirmed to cnn. That ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked in june 2017, but prosecutors",
            "An email from a former district attorney in pennsylvania could derail the one criminal case against bill cosby — a claim countered by current prosecutors, according to reports. Former montgomery county district attorney bruce castor sent the email to his successor last year, detailing an agreement he had with cosby's attorneys in 2005. The reported pact says if cosby testified in a civil case brought against him by accuser andrea constand then that testimony would never be used against cosby in a criminal case. \"i can see no possibility that cosby's deposition could be used in a state criminal case, because i would have to testify as to what happened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression, \" castor wrote to then-da risa vetri ferman. \"i cannot believe any state court judge would allow that deposition into evidence. \" the current district attorney argued that castor's claim is bogus. \"there is a specific legal method to grant immunity.

Researchers at johns hopkins university set up a series of experiments in which babies were exposed to objects whose behavior did and did not \" violate expectations, \" per the study, published in science. In one case, for instance, 11-month-olds witnessed a ball rolling along a ramp until it hit a pair of parallel walls blocked by a screen. In some cases, when researchers lifted the screen, the ball had been placed between the two walls — creating the illusion that it had moved through the first, the los angeles times reports. \" infants who saw the surprising event — the ball that passed through the wall — learned this new information very efficiently, \" researcher aimee stahl tells the times. Indeed, when an object behaved in a seemingly odd way, babies showed special interest in it. In another experiment, babies saw a ball that looked as if it were hovering in midair. Babies who later played with that ball tended to drop it more often than they hit it, whereas babies who played with the ball that had seemed to go through a wall were more interested in hitting it than dropping it, the times notes. \" this raises some exciting, intriguing questions about whether surprise could be used by parents and teachers to shape how babies learn, \" stahl tells the baltimore sun.

The researchers took babies, who could not yet talk, through four experiments to prove their theory. They presented the babies with situations they could predict, as well as some that were unexpected, and gauged their reactions. The unexpected roused the babies ' curiosity. As they tried to figure out what happened, learning was taking place.

            "Want to make your baby smarter? new research by the johns hopkins university has found that it may be as simple as throwing some surprises his or her way. All babies are born with some natural smarts, but youngsters learn more about the world when this innate intelligence is challenged, cognitive psychologists aimee e. Stahl and lisa feigenson discovered in a study that will be published friday in the journal science. The researchers took babies, who could not yet talk, through four experiments to prove their theory. They presented the babies with situations they could predict, as well as some that were unexpected, and gauged their reactions. The unexpected roused the babies ' curiosity. As they tried to figure out what happened, learning was taking place.

            "As the us debates expanding its campaign against the islamic state beyond iraq and syria, the leading us civil liberties group is intensifying its efforts to force transparency about lethal us counterterrorism strikes and authorities. On monday, the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) will file a disclosure lawsuit for secret obama administration documents specifying, among other things, the criteria for placement on the so-called \"kill list \" for drone strikes and other deadly force. Information sought by the aclu includes long-secret analyses establishing the legal basis for what the administration terms its \"targeted killing program \" and the process by which the administration determines that civilians are unlikely to be killed before launching a strike, as well as verification mechanisms afterward to establish if the strike in fact has caused civilian deaths. The suit, to be filed in a new york federal court, also seeks basic data the obama administration has withheld about \"the",
            "Targeted killings have been a central part of u.s. National security strategy for more than a decade, but the american public still knows scandalously little about who the government kills, and why. Today we're filing a new lawsuit in our continuing fight to fix that. The cia and the military use drones to target suspected \" militants, \" \" insurgents, \" and \" terrorists \" in at least half a dozen countries. American drone strikes have killed thousands of people abroad, many of them children. The program has engendered pervasive fear and anger against the united states in countries where the attacks frequently occur. Our government's deliberative and premeditated killings – and the many more civilian deaths from the strikes – raise profound legal and ethical questions that ought to be the subject of public debate. The obama administration has made numerous promises of greater transparency and oversight on drones.",
            "The president: mr. Speaker, mr. Vice president, members of congress, fellow citizens: fifty-one years ago, john f kennedy declared to this chamber that \"the constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress. \" \"it is my task, \" he said, \"to report the state of the union -- to improve it is the task of us all. \" tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the american people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more american cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections"

' \" john kerry was also making the rounds this morning; elsewhere on your sunday dial, as per politico: sen. Rand paul: \" it's a mistake to get involved in the syrian civil war. The one thing i would say, that i ' m proud of the president for, is that he's coming to congress in a constitutional manner and asking for our authorization. That's what he ran on. But you ask john kerry whether or not he ' ll stick by the decision of congress, and i believe he waffled on that and wobbled and wasn't exactly concrete that they would. \" rep. Mike rogers: \" we better send a very clear message, in a unified way, that we're not going to tolerate proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let alone their use. And if you don't send that message, that has real-world consequences. This is not a reality tv show. At the end of the day, something will actually happen. People will lose their lives. \" rep. Pete king: \"if ( obama ) says this is as important as it is and sending so many mixed signals over really the last year and certainly over the last ten days, this is a clear failure of leadership. And if you feel so strongly about it and he doesn't want to take the action himself, then he should call us back into session tomorrow. We can't be waiting nine, 10 days, and allowing syria to prepare for this and sending such a mixed signal to the world and particularly to iran. \"",

They've developed a thin membrane capable of blocking low-frequency noise that tends to bounce around the cabin. The honeycomb-like material typically used on a plane's floor and ceiling — hollow cells sandwiched between two thin walls — is strong and lightweight, but it does nothing to protect passengers from outside noise. This new membrane, however, could be applied to one side of the existing structure to essentially make the plane soundproof, while adding just 6 % to the weight of the honeycomb panel, which should have a minimal effect on fuel efficiency, a press release from mit and north carolina state university notes. In a study in applied physics letters, the researchers explain that low frequencies are able to penetrate porous materials or acoustic blankets often used in soundproofing. But \" at low frequencies — sounds below 500 hertz — the honeycomb panel with the membrane blocks 100 to 1,000 times more sound energy than the panel without a membrane, \" a study author says. Plus, the rubber material, which is just 0.25 millimeters thick, \" is relatively inexpensive to produce, and can be made of any material that does not impact the structural integrity of the honeycomb panel, \" a researcher adds. \" it could make flying much more pleasant for passengers — particularly in helicopters. \" ( too bad it can't block out all those farts. )",

            "Close usa today supreme court reporter richard wolf discussing supreme court facebook ' rapper'decision facebook's new gender option: fill in the blank. ( photo: paul sakuma, ap ) washington — the supreme court defended free speech on the internet monday, even when it comes to an angry, self-styled rapper whose rants made his wife, co-workers and others fear for their lives. Language such as \" hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class \" is only criminal, the justices ruled, if it's intended as a threat -- not if it's merely negligent. But the 8-1 decision, written with several references to rap lyrics by chief justice john roberts, came with caveats that made it just a temporary reprieve for the pennsylvania man who served 44 months in prison for his postings. And it did not apply more broadly to other",
            "Analysis the supreme court moved into the new realm of violent speech on the internet with the aim of clarifying the legal risk. It insisted monday that it had done so, at least part of the way, but two justices argued that instead only confusion had resulted. It is not even clear, at this point, what happens next to the man at the center of the case: anthony douglas elonis, a former amusement park worker from pennsylvania's lehigh valley. Future prosecutions under the 1939 law prohibiting the communication of threats — including cases, like this one, involving digital-age expression — no doubt will move forward. But they likely will be surrounded by questions left unanswered by the decision.

        "summary": "A gunman opened fire today on several young people outside an alternative high school in portland, oregon, wounding four and fleeing on foot with two other people, police tell the ap. The victims are all students at rosemary anderson high school or in affiliated job programs: a 16-year-old girl in critical condition; two males, 17 and 20, in serious condition; a 20-year-old male in serious condition; and a 19-year-old female who was lightly grazed and treated on the scene. The father of a fifth victim, a 16-year-old girl, tells the oregonian that his daughter is in surgery. Police suspect the shooting is gang-related and say a dispute may have erupted before the bullets started flying. Eye-witness accounts are piecemeal so far, with one student saying she saw a male victim lying on the ground with \" blood coming out of his stomach. It was scary. \" another says a male student ran into the school holding open his coat and yelling, \" oh my god, did i just get shot? \" friends and family waiting outside the legacy emanuel health center, where victims are in surgery, are talking about the shock of gun violence. \" it doesn't make any sense, \" says the 40-year-old aunt of a victim. \" it's not like it was when we were kids. \" portland police say gang violence rose over the summer but law enforcement lacks resources to deal with it. Rosemary anderson high school serves students from troubled backgrounds, including those who are homeless, have single parents, dropped out, or were expelled.",

        "summary": "A netherlands church service that started before halloween is still going on — all to keep police away from a family of armenian refugees who have sought sanctuary there. Sasun and anousche tamrazyan and their three children, ages 14, 19, and 21, recently lost an appeal to stay in the country after almost nine years there, which means they're set to be deported. But per dutch law, cops can't enter places of worship while services are taking place, the australian broadcasting corporation notes, and so the tamrazyans have been holed up in bethel church in the hague since oct. 26, where what the new york times calls a \" worship marathon \" has been going on since to protect the family. \" we do all this by continuously praying, singing, [ and ] listening to sermons, \" pastor axel wicke tweeted sunday, adding to the times that nearly 500 clergy of all denominations, and from around the world, have signed up \" to be put on the rotation. \" the tamrazyans were forced to flee armenia due to death threats because of sasun tamrazyan's political activism, wicke tells the abc, which notes this is all happening against the backdrop of a growing far-right movement in europe that doesn't look kindly on refugees. Even though the family initially won asylum, the government tried for the past six years to appeal that ruling, and it recently won on its third try. The family even lost its appeal for a \" children's pardon, \" which under dutch law offers asylum to refugee kids and their families if they've been in the country for at least five years; less than 8 % of those appeals were granted in the netherlands between may 2013 and april 2016. In the meantime, what the protestant church calls on its website a \" continuous celebration \" for the tamrazyans continues, with all welcome to attend, the washington post reports.

They range from a back to the future prop made real to a tablet system translating sign language to spoken words. Hendo hoverboard: yes, it really looks like marty mcfly's transportation device, though it won't fly higher than about an inch and its battery lasts just 15 minutes. Still, the board heralds technology that could improve earthquake safety. 94fifty smart sensor: it's your own personal basketball coach, and it lives in the ball. The device tracks how well you're moving the ball, and it even shouts tips. Blackphone: the android-based phone offers far more powerful encryption than what's standard for calls and texts, and it avoids features that involve the sharing of information. Coolest cooler: this thing does a lot more than keep your drinks and food cool. It also sports a blender, a usb charger, and a bluetooth speaker, among other features. It's essentially a party in a box. Ringly: call it smart jewelry. This ring does more than just look pretty: it alerts purse-carrying wearers to communications on their phones, so that they don't have to hunt inside their bags all the time. Super bananas: kids in sub-saharan africa often don't get enough vitamin a, putting them at risk of blindness. So a researcher decided to use his bioengineering skills to turn one of their most-eaten foods, bananas, into a vehicle delivering the vitamin. Motionsavvy uni: a tablet-based system allows deaf people to turn sign language into spoken language and back again. Click for the full list.",

He especially likes lily tomlin as the mother of fey's character, calling her \" brashly cutting and funny. \" given that the director has made films like about a boy and in good company, clearly \" weitz can do better than a lazy, rote, vaguely classist space-filler like admission, \" writes joe neumaier in the new york daily news.

Stringer adds that someone burning books from a public library is akin to \" deciding that they're the gatekeeper of ideas for the rest of the public. \" the register notes that three of the books dorr set on fire were on a petition that circulated earlier this year asking the library to either ban or separate lgbt books from all the others.

The second annual oc pride kicked off last friday with a story time for kids, a schedule shows. About an hour before the event, paul dorr started a live facebook video, during which he threw at least four books with lgbtq themes that he claimed he rented from the public library into a burning trash can. Dorr is the director of rescue the perishing, a religious group and website he calls a \" crisis center and pro-life, pro-family movement. \" the majority of the live video shows dorr reading a blog post from the site titled \" may god and the homosexuals of oc pride please forgive us! \" dorr declined to be interviewed. Amanda vazquez, the library's director, said she learned of the video on saturday. The library \" alerted the board \" and spoke with authorities to determine \" next steps, \" including possible legal action, vazquez said. The orange city police chief confirmed that parties were discussing legal action, but declined to comment further.",
            "A library in northwest iowa is considering its next steps after a religious activist burned several books. Paul dorr from religious group rescue the perishing on friday recorded a facebook live video outside of the orange city public library prior to an event where drag queens would be reading to children as part of the orange city pride festival. \"continuing my 25-year stand for christ i cannot stand by and let the shameful adults at the orange city library board bring the next group of little children into their foul sexual reality without a firm resistance, \" said dorr in the video. He then reads aloud from four lgbtq-related childrens books that he checked out from the orange city library, before burning each on tape. The books include \"two boys kissing \", \"families, families, families \", \"this day in june \" and \"morris micklewhite and the tangerine dress. \" he calls the concepts in the books things like \"filthy \", \"disgusting \" and \"shameful \". After burning the books, he burns a tangerine dress to make a statement. \"with that let us all repent, let us turn back to christ, \" said dorr after burning the dress. \"we've lost our way so bad. Cry out to god. Join us. Call your elders, your pastors, plead with them. Call them to repent on the silences"

The judge said he rendered his verdict \" with the heaviest of hearts \" but that it was in \" charlie's best interests \" to transition him to palliative care and allow him to \" die with dignity. \" the judge went on to praise the \" absolute dedication \" of chris gard and connie yates to their child — they raised $ 1.5 million on gofundme for experimental treatment in the us — but gard and yates had left the courtroom by the time the judge was finished explaining his verdict, according to the bbc.

Police and family say the 41-year-old kentucky woman was beaten, then kidnapped along with her son on friday in response to a money dispute, per wlex. Her sister says a family friend arrived at durham's home, repeatedly struck her in the head in an attempt to knock her out, then forced durham into a car with her son, per the lexington herald-leader. The man drove until he reached an 80-foot cliff in jackson county and pushed durham over the edge, the state police commissioner says. That was the last time durham — discovered by hikers the next day — saw her son alive, per whas. Though her alleged assailant was located hours after durham was found with a broken ankle, shattered pelvis, internal bleeding, and a head injury, 5-year-old james spoonamore seemed to have disappeared. In what police are now calling a \" tragic \" turn, however, james ' body was found monday in a national forest, a little over half a mile from the spot where durham was discovered saturday. \" it's horrible anytime you have a death. But when you have the death of a young child, it hurts even more, \" says the commissioner. An autopsy is scheduled.

The new court order comes after akhmedova says she never received any money from the settlement, with cave noting it appeared the 62-year-old akhmedov had taken \" elaborate steps to conceal his wealth and evade enforcement of the judgment, \" per the london times. Akhmedov said he'd sold the yacht back in 2014, but it turned out the firm he'd sold it to was simply one of his own offshore companies, and akhmedova's attorneys eventually tracked the yacht down in dry dock in dubai, where it remains under court order. Akhmedov, meanwhile, says the british court system is exploiting dubai courts, and he blames the luna seizure on recent bad blood between the uk and russian president vladimir putin. \" can it really be a coincidence?, \" akhmedov said in an email to the scmp.

Some highlights from the slideshow-packed debate at kentucky's creation museum, as per time, usa today, and the courier-journal: ham opened by arguing that \" science has been hijacked by secularists, \" and the teaching of evolution is \" imposing the religion of atheism on generations of students. \" his interpretation of science, he said, supports his view that the bible is a literal account of the earth's creation. Nye — who repeatedly stressed that the us will be left behind by other countries if it doesn't teach real science in schools — said ham's assertion that \" there is some difference between the natural laws that i observe today and the natural laws of 4,000 years ago \" was \" extraordinary and unsettling. \" ham focused heavily on what he called \" observational science, \" wondering how nye could be so sure about events and processes he didn't witness. \" i challenge the evolutionists to admit the belief aspects of their particular worldview, \" he said. As part of his critique of creationism, nye explained the \" kangaroo conundrum, \" wondering why, if kangaroos hopped from where noah's ark landed to australia, no kangaroo bones have been found along the way. He also grabbed the attention of the 800-strong audience with a discussion of \" traditional fish sex. \" the final question was \" what is the one thing more than anything else upon which you base your belief? \" ham and nye predictably answered \" the bible \" and \" science \" respectively. After the debate, the pair met again on cnn's piers morgan live, where climate change was discussed along with evolution, mediaite reports. Ham blamed this week's snowstorms on the world \" winding down, \" while nye said he is \" very skeptical \" of supernatural explanations for the weather.",

When madonna finally arrived onstage, she joked that she's rarely late, and added, \" it's you people that get here early that's the problem. Stay home, do your hair and makeup, have a tequila. Roll yourself a fat one... Just come late and i won't have to come early. \" fans were not amused, noted nathanael cooper in his review in the brisbane times — which dubbed her madgesty's lateness \" breathtakingly arrogant. \" sample tweet: \" so was the 22 year and three hour wait worth it? simple answer.. No. \" cbs news, which notes that madonna started a melbourne concert last week more than four hours late, reports that hundreds of fans had already left before madonna showed up in brisbane — and that by the time the concert finished, the last train had already departed the venue. \" how do we get money back after waiting two hrs for madonna? \" one fan wrote on the ticket agency's facebook page, per the bbc. \" just disgusting. \" it's possible madonna is a bit preoccupied with her custody battle — in melbourne last week, she emotionally dedicated a \" bizarre \" performance to son rocco.",

        "summary": "You can now feast your eyes on the real-life inspiration for winnie-the-pooh — or her skull anyway. Winnie, a female black bear named after the canadian city of winnipeg, was a star attraction at london zoo in the 1920s and a favorite of christopher robin, who named his own teddy bear after her, explains the bbc. The stuffed animal eventually inspired his father, aa milne, to write the winnie-the-pooh books. When winnie died in 1934, her skull was kept by the royal college of surgeons, which recently uncovered it during a collection review, and it's now on display at london's hunterian museum, reports cnn. The skull shows that winnie lost most of her teeth with age, \" and we think being fed sticky sweets by children for 20 years probably didn't help, \" says the museum director. \" people would come to the zoo specifically to meet winnie, to watch her playing, to have photographs taken with her, feed her honey, \" says a professor at london's king's college. Winnie didn't get her start at the london zoo, though. She arrived in the uk from canada, alongside canadian soldier and veterinarian harry colebourn, who had bought her for $ 20, per the huffington post. She became the regimental mascot of the canadian army veterinary corps during world war i, but was sent to the zoo when colebourn shipped off to france. \" he had no idea that this one very simple action would go on to have such amazing consequence, \" colebourn's great granddaughter says. Winnie's skull, last seen in a 1930s text book, will appear in an exhibit focusing on the link between the health of humans and animals.

The transport route would include roadways, as well as a high-speed rail from europe to asia, oil and gas pipelines, and electrical and water facilities, the siberian times reported this week. The project would hook up 6,000 miles of russian bridges and roads; it would then link up to european roads in the west and stretch east from siberia's chukotka area ( right across the bering strait from alaska ) into north america. Of course, no one is saying yet how anyone would span the 55-mile bering strait ( bridge, tunnel, ferry, floating dogsled? ), which fox describes as \" a major obstacle except in the context of yakunin's massive proposed undertaking. \" of course, because russia's often all about russia, yakunin also mentioned in the meeting that the route would make russia top dog in a new, high-tech world, slamming ( as the times puts it ) \" western-style globalization … [ which ] is no longer seen as an incentive but as a hindrance on the economic, scientific, moral, and spiritual development of society. \" ( so how's that underwater tunnel crossing the strait going? )",

        "summary": "Amendment 13 needed just 60 % of tuesday's votes to pass in florida, but more than 5.3 million voters, or 69 %, cast their ballots in favor of it — meaning by the end of 2020, legal dog racing in the sunshine state will be no more, nbc news reports. It's a \" knockout blow to a cruel industry that has been hurting and killing dogs for nearly a century, \" says the committee to protect dogs, one of the lobbyists for the statewide ban, per the orlando sentinel. State records note that more than 460 dogs have died at florida tracks just since 2013, the first year such data started being gathered, the miami herald notes. The news is sure to make national waves as well, considering florida hosts 11 of the country's remaining 17 active dog tracks. The industry will essentially be \" swept away in the night, \" says the director of greyhound advocacy group grey2k usa. The issue now: what to do with the 5,000 to 7,000 greyhounds that will soon be forced into early retirement. A rep for the national greyhound association says \" 98 % \" of dogs who leave racing are adopted, and most of the rest head to farms to breed. But the head of a greyhound adoption group says not only will homes need to be found for the still-racing dogs, but also for the young dogs on breeding farms that haven't found their way to the track yet. \" some of these dogs might end up at shelters, and they're not all no-kill, \" she tells nbc. \" that's the scary part. \" other states where dog racing remains legal include iowa, arkansas, alabama, west virginia, and texas. ( at least a dozen greyhounds tested positive for cocaine in florida last year. )",

Amendment 13, which needed 60-percent approval to become law, got more than 5.3 million votes on tuesday, good for 69 percent. Passage of the sweeping measure means dog racing at 11 florida tracks, with anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 greyhounds, will be out of business by dec. 31, 2020. Officials on both sides of the ballot measure on wednesday promised they ' ll find these unemployed greyhounds new homes. Jim gartland, executive director of the dog racing industry's umbrella group national greyhound association, said 98 percent of retired racers are regularly adopted to families. And an overwhelming majority of the remaining 2 percent live out their days on farms, working as breeders, he added. \"we will do everything we can do to make sure that every one of them gets adopted, �? gartland told nbc news on wednesday.

            "Florida voters wrapped their arms around greyhounds on election night, overwhelmingly supporting an amendment that bans commercial dog racing. Amendment 13 won approval from roughly 5.4 million floridians with a 69-31 percent victory — well above the 60 percent approval needed to pass. The committee to protect dogs, which lobbied for the racing ban, called it \"a knock-out blow to a cruel industry that has been hurting and killing dogs for nearly a century. \" since florida has 11 of the nation's 17 remaining active dog tracks, amendment 13's passage appears to mean that the industry will be all but \"swept away in the night, \" said carey theil, executive director of grey2k usa, one of the leading backers of the ban. \"the historical consequences of this are incredibly significant, \" theil said. \"we're seeing one of the highest approvals of any animal welfare measure in the nation. \" the tracks — including the sanford orlando kennel club in longwood — will have until january 2021 to phase out greyhound racing. \"because of the decisions of millions of florida voters, thousands of dogs will be spared the pain and suffering that is inherent in the greyhound racing industry, \" said kitty block, acting president and ceo of the humane society of the united states."

        "summary": "\" the third world war is at our gate, and it will be about water, if we don't do something about this crisis \" of dwindling global water supplies, says rajendra singh, last year's recipient of \" the nobel prize for water \" for his water restoration efforts in rural india, per the bbc. In an interview with policy innovations, per quartz, singh says water scarcity is already forcing people to flee parts of the middle east and africa. \" after forced migration comes tension, conflict, and terrorism, \" he says. \" if we want a safe future, we need to start conserving water. \" that's something singh knows a thing or two about. By using check dams and other barriers in the district of rajasthan, singh has helped transform an arid, semi-desert area into one with enough food and water for each resident. The dams help water reach aquifers before it can be evaporated. \" when moisture enters the soil, greenery comes up. And that greenery takes carbon from the atmosphere, puts carbon in the soil, reduces temperatures by 1-2 degrees, \" singh says. \" now in my region we have no floods, no droughts. \" singh adds the water conservation efforts are all community-funded: a \" river parliament \" makes decisions regarding water allocations with a preference for poor farmers who own the driest land. Elsewhere, corporations are \" making the rules, \" forcing people to pay for water, singh says. But \" sustainable community-led water management has existed for thousands of years without anyone putting a price on water. So why do we need it today? \" click for the full interview.",
