Sahray astina barber, a 22-year-old who studies and works at the art institute of california-inland empire, lives across the street from the university and was last seen around 6am monday. The university emailed students about her disappearance, saying that her roommates found her belongings, including her phone and laptop, scattered on the lawn outside her apartment building and called police after discovering that she hadn't turned up to work that day, the san bernardino sun reports. \" we're covering every road, every trail, and every rabbit path, \" one of the searchers scouring the hills tells the press-enterprise. Police say they haven't found firm evidence of foul play or established a connection between the disappearance and the wave of attacks at cal state in the last few weeks, which include a carjacking, an attempted rape, and — the day before barber vanished — an incident in which a female student fought off a man who tried to kidnap her, nbc reports. Police have released a composite sketch of a suspect in two of the cal state attacks, who is described as a hispanic male around 20 years old, according to the press-enterprise. The university says it has more than doubled its police presence, and barber's father says, \" we just want her back, \" the sun reports.

Just a few days remain to give to charity in 2012, and ken stern would prefer you not make your decision \" hastily, based on poor information. \" writing for the washington post, the former npr exec and author of this upcoming book dispels five myths clouding the topic: it's not all about the poor: there are 1.1 million charities in america... Including oregon's renegade roller derby team, the all colorado beer festival, and countless hospitals. Stern explains it's \" astonishingly easy \" to form a charity, with the irs oking 99.5 % of applications from would-be charities. Low overhead is a sign of greatness: a number of charity raters favor those who put upward of 85 % of their income toward services, with those using just a sliver of cash on expenses often seen as the best. But investing in things like research and training can make for stronger charities. To wit, stern reminds us that the red cross ' hurricane katrina and sandy issues stemmed in part from inadequate investment \" in the infrastructure necessary to handle complex emergency relief. \" picking a great charity to give to is easy: \" in fact, it is enormously difficult, \" writes stern who, as example, points out that more than 60,000 charities have the word \" veteran \" in their names. His solution isn't the easiest: work at it. \" on average, americans spend more time watching television in one day than they do researching charities in an entire year. \" put the time in, review studies published by givewell, and look beyond famous leaders or catchy stories.

            "Format: hardcover after a decade at national public radio, ken stern learned a few things about the weird world of the american nonprofit sector. In his new book, with charity for all: why charities are failing and a better way to give, stern bemoans the state of charitable activity today, arguing that most of the nonprofit sector is financially inept at best, and downright unsavory at worst. Some charities obviously are fraudulent. Every now and then we read about them. When the salary of the ceo and money spent on phone banks dwarf the tiny percentage of revenues, if any, that go to the supposed beneficiaries of a charity, it's easy to call foul. But it's not always so easy to identify this type of non-charity. Getting charitable status from the irs is a breeze, state oversight is weak to non-existent, and plenty of donors are swayed by words like \" veteran, \" \" children, \" \" hope, \" \" beneficial, \" \" cancer, \" and other key words. Investigating the financials of charities can be time-consuming, frustrating, and near impossible. Other charities, while more above-board about their financials and activities, probably should not be classified as charities. Two examples stern explores are non-profit hospitals and college football bowl games. In terms of treating needy patients, non-profit hospitals as a whole are no more charitable, and in some cases less, than their for-profit competitors. Yet they enjoy a variety of tax benefits that give them a competitive advantage.

Trying to develop alternative fuels of the future is a waste of time and resources. \" drilling is the single most important thing we can do to spur growth at home while strengthening our hand abroad, \" writes krauthammer.

America is already in a \" hydrocarbon boom, \" with oil and natural gas production on the rise, but that has not stopped oil prices from soaring. That's because increasing demand from developing countries and mideast war worries \" easily outweigh any downward pressure on prices from rising us production. \" the hydrocarbon boom has also had little effect on jobs — the 70,000 jobs gained since the middle of the last decade represent just.05 % of total us employment.

Named after presbyterian minister and mathematician thomas bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: for example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? how far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? what was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? it's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on — except that experts hunting for airbus a330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the atlantic, five thirty-eight notes. It was so hard that the us team of statisticians invited by france gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90 % of the time.

The fossil was found on an english beach in 2004, but its unique trait — mineralized pieces of brain tissue — was announced in a study thursday. \" the chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small, so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing, \" phys.org quotes study coauthor alex liu as saying. Researchers believe the dinosaur, a relative of the iguanodon, sank upside down into a pond after it died. The pond water \" essentially pickled \" the dinosaur's brain, and the pickled tissue was eventually replaced by minerals. The outer millimeter of the fossil seems to include mineralized blood vessels and bits of the membrane that covered the brain, npr reports. Researchers believe it may also contain mineralized pieces of the brain itself. \"that is the nearest i suspect we're ever going to get to the whole [ brain ], \" paleontologist david norman tells natgeo. One result of the new discovery: researchers say it may show dinosaurs were smarter than we've been giving them credit for. In modern reptiles, the brain doesn't take up the entire brain case in the skull. That appears not to have been the case in this dinosaur, meaning it may have had a larger brain than previously believed. Norman says it appears the dino was at least as smart as a modern crocodile.

            "Image of specimen. Credit: jamie hiscocks an unassuming brown pebble, found more than a decade ago by a fossil hunter in sussex, has been confirmed as the first example of fossilised brain tissue from a dinosaur. The fossil, most likely from a species closely related to iguanodon, displays distinct similarities to the brains of modern-day crocodiles and birds. Meninges - the tough tissues surrounding the actual brain - as well as tiny capillaries and portions of adjacent cortical tissues have been preserved as mineralised ' ghosts '. The results are reported in a special publication of the geological society of london, published in tribute to professor martin brasier of the university of oxford, who died in 2014. Brasier and dr david norman from the university of cambridge co-ordinated the research into this particular fossil during the years prior to brasier's untimely death in a road traffic accident.

            "Image of specimen. Credit: jamie hiscocks an unassuming brown pebble, found more than a decade ago by a fossil hunter in sussex, has been confirmed as the first example of fossilised brain tissue from a dinosaur. The fossil, most likely from a species closely related to iguanodon, displays distinct similarities to the brains of modern-day crocodiles and birds. Meninges - the tough tissues surrounding the actual brain - as well as tiny capillaries and portions of adjacent cortical tissues have been preserved as mineralised ' ghosts '. The results are reported in a special publication of the geological society of london, published in tribute to professor martin brasier of the university of oxford, who died in 2014. Brasier and dr david norman from the university of cambridge co-ordinated the research into this particular fossil during the years prior to brasier's untimely death in a road traffic accident.

In a conference call last week, ray blanchette, ceo of parent company ignite restaurant group, told investors that 18 of its 131 units are trying out the no-tipping policy that began in august, making up for lost tips by upping servers'starting minimum wage to $ 14 an hour from $ 2.13 ( exact pay depends on work performance ), restaurant business online reports. The goal: to prevent staff turnover and improve service. \" i personally believe tipping is an antiquated model, \" blanchette said in the call, per the oc register. \" the no-tipping service model gets us above the fray with regards to the increased minimum wage conversations that seem to be happening all over the country. \" blanchette explained that, in addition to servers being more likely to stick around for the long haul with a higher hourly wage, they'd also be guaranteed the same pay whether they worked a dead shift on a monday afternoon or a busy friday night, per national restaurant news. And service would likely improve, too, he noted, especially when servers start sharing table duties for large parties ( instead of getting territorial over a table for an anticipated big tip ). The wage increase is paid for by raising menu prices 12 % to 15 % — which could still save customers money if they usually tip 18 % or more. Results so far have been positive. \" what makes us optimistic is the restaurant that has been in test the longest is gaining the most traction, \" blanchette tells nrn. Consumerist notes that the parent company of 13 well-known nyc restaurants has been testing its own no-tipping policy since october, leveling wages between front-house and kitchen staff.

        "summary": "A pittsburgh hospital says it is in the midst of \" a very active investigation \" after two patients died in its cardiothoracic intensive care unit, which was later found to contain mold. Upmc presbyterian hospital's quality control chief tami minnier says a fungal infection first appeared on the leg of a heart transplant patient last october. A second infection was found on the buttocks of another transplant patient this past june, reports the ap; both patients died, though doctors aren't sure whether the infections caused the deaths. Hospital officials didn't connect the two cases because they occurred so far apart and the molds in each case were different, but related. Only when a third type of fungal infection was discovered in a lung transplant patient two weeks ago did hospital workers connect the dots and the icu was closed on sept. 3, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. Though investigators found mold in toilets and behind the walls of the unit, per wtae, experts aren't sure if it played a role in the deaths as it was a different type than those found in patients. \" it's just heartbreaking, \" minnier says. \" i can't tell you how many hours we have already spent trying to understand it. \" minnier says a total of 56 patients have stayed in the icu over the past year. The three patients infected were among eight transplant patients. The unit's remaining 18 patients have been removed to another part of the hospital while a remediation company clears up the mold, per the gazette. \" it's a hospital, and you bring people here to get well, not to get sick and die, \" says the wife of a patient. A mold expert says it's \" very unusual \" to see the types of fungi found in the patients in a hospital, but it's possible recent construction projects at upmc caused an outbreak.",

It \" frequently \" took flight and grabbed prey \" with strong short spines developed on its extremely long feet, \" he adds. Called manipulator modificaputis, it also had an extra set of eyes on top of its head, probably to spot predators like feathered dinosaurs. On the stomach-settling side, it measured less than half an inch long. So it's not as scary as other insect predators back then, like the raphidiomimidae — which were \" especially drastic and brutal, \" vršanský says. They were bug-eating roaches \" with a wingspan up to 20cm [ nearly 8 inches ] and eyes divided into two parts. \" but compare that to aegirocassis benmoulae, a 7-foot \" bizarre sea creature \" 480 million years ago that is an ancient cockroach relative and caught plankton like a whale, the la times reports.

Here's what the pundits are taking away from it all: if people — or markets — were looking for reassurance, \"they were out of luck, \" observes politico. Instead, obama and boehner \"treated viewers to the unsettling spectacle of two leaders talking past, not to, each other, \" with obama even issuing a \"stunning \" plea for people to call their representatives. Obama's speech proved this isn't a left vs. Right debate. \"it's center vs. Right, \" argues ej dionne of the washington post. \"there was nothing remotely 'left ' in this speech. \" with some deft rhetorical touches — like quoting ronald reagan — \"my hunch is that obama's speech spoke more to middle-of-the-road americans. \" but william kristol of the weekly standard thought obama came across as condescending — especially when he said most americans had probably never heard of the debt ceiling. \"it would be nice to have a president who spoke candidly to his fellow citizens as adults, \" he writes. Boehner, meanwhile, went \"full-tilt tea party crazy, \" writes joan walsh of salon. He acted as though he and obama had never discussed a deal at all, while demanding a balanced budget amendment — which is \"extraordinarily apocalyptic and insane, \" because boehner knows that can't pass. \"hell, he probably doesn't even want it. \" he's just moving the goal posts on obama again.",

Because of the way earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \" a super blue blood moon eclipse, \" according to the miami herald.

As the third-largest barrier reef in the world, the 360-mile stretch of vitally important sea life provides a buffet of nutrients for plants and animals along the state's atlantic coast. Now, scientists are racing to find a cure, as detailed in a piece by npr. To be sure, reefs are struggling worldwide, and coral diseases have been rising over the last decade, per noaa, probably caused by pollution and rising ocean temperatures, which provide a warm home for pathogens. But growing swathes of coral from as far north as pompano beach in broward county to as far south as biscayne national park are turning into watery graveyards, the florida department of environmental protection says in a report. Since 2015 the department has been working with a team of federal, state, and local groups to identify the likely pathogen, find a treatment, and address underlying problems — but that identification hasn't yet happened. Scientist william precht, who was hired by the state to monitor the health of reefs off the port of miami, has watched the disease move from one patch of coral to another. He says that whatever is killing the coral is especially deadly for brain and star coral, which create the underlying structure for many reefs. The death of the coral, he tells npr, is having a lasting impact. \" when you go out and swim on the reefs of miami-dade county today, it would be a very rare chance encounter that you'd see some of these three or four species. \" ( there's bad news about the great barrier reef, too. )",

            "Corals coral diseases coral diseases generally occur in response to biological stresses, such as bacteria, fungi and viruses, and nonbiological stresses, such as increased sea surface temperatures, ultraviolet radiation and pollutants. One type of stress may exacerbate the other ( nmfs, 2001 ). The frequency of coral diseases has increased significantly over the last 10 years, causing widespread mortality among reef-building corals. Many scientists believe the increase is related to deteriorating water quality associated with human-made pollutants and increased sea surface temperatures. These factors may allow for the proliferation and colonization of microbes. However, exact causes for coral diseases remain elusive. The onset of most diseases likely is a response to multiple factors ( nmfs, 2001 ). While the pathologies, or mechanisms by which many diseases act upon the coral polyp are not well known, the effects that these diseases have on corals has been well documented.",

A rundown of the deal's specifics, and how it's being reported: read ceo marissa mayer's lengthy letter to yahooers about the \" amazing opportunities [ yahoo will realize ] in its next chapter \" here. Bloomberg explains what verizon is and isn't getting: yes to yahoo's real estate, no to yahoo's cash and its shares in alibaba group holding. Business insider reports aol head tim armstrong will likely emerge as ceo of an aol-yahoo combo ( verizon bought aol for $ 4.4 billion in 2015 ). It issues a warning: \" the siren song of yahoo has lured others before him. And armstrong's desire to revive the struggling internet business may leave him blinded to the same trap as his predecessors. \" the washington post points out the mayer turned down a deal to buy yahoo two years ago — a deal armstrong offered. It looks at what armstrong, and verizon, want with yahoo. In her letter, mayer writes, \" for me personally, i ' m planning to stay. \" it's unclear how long she ' ll stay for, or in what capacity. In a piece heralding the \" saddest $ 5 billion deal in tech history, \" forbes reports mayer is expected to be handed a $ 50 million-plus severance package when she does go.

Parents now face big penalties if they don't report the disappearance or death of a child within one day. Abortion: partial-birth abortions are now banned in new hampshire. In montana, minors wanting an abortion must notify their parents. Illegal immigration: employers in some states are now required to use the e-verify system to confirm citizenship of their employees. Facebook: employers can no longer ask job applicants for facebook or twitter passwords. Food safety: in maryland, it's now illegal to use chicken feed that includes arsenic. Though it's the first state to pass such a ban, the practice is already illegal in canada and the eu. Driverless cars: are now legal on california roads, though a human must always be in the passenger seat. Weirder laws: no releasing feral hogs in kentucky, and no using a dog to chase a bear or a bobcat in california. Strip clubs in illinois must now charge $ 3 at the door and donate it to rape crisis centers. Also in illinois, motorcycle wheelies are now banned.

Doug ford, older brother of the notorious former toronto mayor, was elected premier of ontario, canada's most populous province, the ap reports. Ford, who was narrowly elected leader of the provincial progressive conservative party in march after former leader patrick brown stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct, won a resounding victory over current premier kathleen wynne, whose liberal party had been in power for 15 years. Ford — who, unlike his brother, isn't known for drinking heavily or smoking crack — campaigned on a populist platform that led to comparisons to president trump. Ford's campaign promises included cutting gasoline taxes, lowering the minimum price of beer to $ 1, and making marijuana more widely available after it is legalized this year, reports the toronto star. \" he had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc., \" political science professor myer siemiatycki tells the cbc. Days before the election, rob ford's widow, renata ford, filed a $ 12.6 million lawsuit against doug ford and randy ford, another ford brother, accusing them of mismanaging the family business and cheating her and her children out of her husband's inheritance.",

The recall was issued after health officials identified jbs as the common supplier of raw ground beef products found to be the \" probable source \" of reported salmonella illnesses. Fifty-seven cases of salmonella illness linked to this outbreak were reported in 16 states between august 5 and september 6. The food safety and inspection service was first notified of the possible outbreak in september. Receipts and shopper cards from eight patients helped investigators identify the source of the outbreak. Read more",

Later, asger juhl of radio24syv ate it for dinner. Angry listeners have since called for a boycott of the station, and much worse for juhl himself, reports the bbc. \" i did it to show the hypocrisy in the debate, \" he says. \" many people are outraged by what i did, at the same time many of these people will eat meat. And when they eat meat, an animal will die. \" juhl says he consulted with aalborg zoo on a humane way to kill rabbits and was told it used an \" iron stick. \" the zookeeper \" hits several baby rabbits every week [ to feed ] the snakes, \" juhl explains, per the local. His employer is unapologetic. The new york times quotes station editor-in-chief jorgen ramskov as saying the rabbit \" was taken good care of, it had a nice life, and it was killed in a decent way. \" animals endure \" horrific suffering on their way to our dinner tables … without it invoking any strong reactions or calls for boycott, \" a station rep tells sky news. Perhaps fueling the outcry on social media, per the times: the station posted two videos on its facebook page: a 20-second clip showing juhl cradling and petting a very-alive allan, and a 10-second clip showing what the station described as pieces of allan, cooking in a pan. Those two parts are important, argued the station in a facebook post yesterday. \" we knew that we would be accused of provocation. But it is not an empty provocation; the presenters of the program ate the animal after killing it. \" ( it's not the first controversial animal killing in denmark. )",

Drone strike on suspected islamist militants in northwest pakistan killed 10 people on thursday, pakistani intelligence officials said, an attack likely to raise tensions in a standoff with washington over nato supply routes to afghanistan. The pilotless drone aircraft attacked a compound in a village in north waziristan, a day after a similar attack killed four suspected militants in the same region. \" the drone fired two missiles at the compound. We believe it was being used by militants, \" one of the pakistani officials said. The united states has been urging pakistan to mount an offensive in north waziristan to pursue members of the haqqani militant network, one of washington's most feared foes in neighboring afghanistan. That looks more unlikely than ever, as a result of a crisis in relations between washington and islamabad over a range of issues. The united states has been pushing pakistan to re-open supply routes to nato forces in afghanistan in difficult talks that show no signs of a breakthrough any time soon. Pakistan closed the routes, which are seen as vital to the planned withdrawal of most foreign troops from afghanistan before the end of 2014, in protest against last november's killing of 24 pakistani soldiers in a nato air attack along the afghan border.

            "Us senators warn pakistan on aid over bin laden washington — key us senators wednesday demanded that pakistan pardon a surgeon handed 33 years in prison for helping in the hunt for osama bin laden, warning that the decision could put us assistance at risk. A tribal court in khyber, a lawless district and extremist hotbed, sentenced surgeon shakeel afridi for treason after he agreed to collect dna for us intelligence to verify the presence of the most-wanted al-qaeda leader. Carl levin and john mccain, the top senators from the two major us parties on the senate armed services committee, in a joint statement called afridi's sentence \" shocking and outrageous. \" \" what dr. Afridi did is the furthest thing from treason. It was a courageous, heroic and patriotic act which helped to locate the most wanted terrorist in the world -- a mass murderer who had the blood of many innocent pakistanis on his hands, \" the two senators said. Mccain and levin urged pakistan to pardon and free afridi \" immediately. \" \" dr. Afridi's continuing imprisonment and treatment as a criminal will only do further harm to us-pakistani relations, including diminishing congress's willingness to provide financial assistance to pakistan, \" they said. The united states has provided pakistan with more than $ 18 billion since it joined the war in afghanistan following the september",
            "Miranshah, pakistan ( reuters ) - a u.s. Drone strike on suspected islamist militants in northwest pakistan killed 10 people on thursday, pakistani intelligence officials said, an attack likely to raise tensions in a standoff with washington over nato supply routes to afghanistan. The pilotless drone aircraft attacked a compound in a village in north waziristan, a day after a similar attack killed four suspected militants in the same region. \" the drone fired two missiles at the compound. We believe it was being used by militants, \" one of the pakistani officials said. The united states has been urging pakistan to mount an offensive in north waziristan to pursue members of the haqqani militant network, one of washington's most feared foes in neighboring afghanistan. That looks more unlikely than ever, as a result of a crisis in relations between washington and islamabad over a range of issues. The united states has been pushing pakistan to re-open supply routes to nato forces in afghanistan in difficult talks that show no signs of a breakthrough any time soon. Pakistan closed the routes, which are seen as vital to the planned withdrawal of most foreign troops from afghanistan before the end of 2014, in protest against last november's killing of 24 pakistani soldiers in a nato air attack along the afghan border.

Yesterday, dutro's 8-year-old daughter testified that facing the wall was a common punishment, the oregonian reports. Dutro would make the children stand holding their arms in the air, and hit them if they relaxed, she said, adding that dutro and canady also often gave her and her brother \" lickins. \" she described the night her brother \" got dead \" this way, according to inquisitr: \" jessica and brian, they kept hitting him and punching him. He didn't listen to them, so they kicked him and punched him and stuff and they kept doing it and doing it. \" that beating allegedly tore the boy's bowels. Zachary dutro-boggess was brought to the hospital on aug. 14, 2012, and was taken off life support two days later. Canady has already pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault.",

But the 20-something singer, whose star turn showed her stripped down to her skivvies and provocatively eating fruit, lives in egypt, and the conservative powers-that-be there have sentenced her to prison, the bbc reports. Shyma ( real name: shaimaa ahmed ) was arrested in november, and on tuesday she was handed a two-year sentence on charges of debauchery and publishing an indecent film, per local media. The new york daily news says mohamed gamal, the director of the video, called \" i have issues, \" was also sentenced to two years in prison in absentia. The telegraph offers more details, explaining that in the video, shyma appears in her underwear, then noshes on a milk-drizzled banana, licks an apple, and samples cake icing in front of a classroom of beguiled men. The video got her more than 1 million followers, but then came her arrest. The debauchery charge isn't an uncommon one in egypt, with media reports citing instances of women being thrown behind bars for dancing in music videos ( that recently earned belly dancers six months each in prison ) and, in the case of a singer who proclaimed on film that sipping nile river water could get people sick, \" spreading provocative publicity. \" as for shyma, she noted before her arrest in a facebook post that's since disappeared that she was sorry for her \" inappropriate \" behavior and \" didn't imagine... That i would be subjected to such a strong attack from everyone. \" the south china morning post, which says shyma can appeal the verdict, notes that after her arrest, she blamed gamal for including the provocative scenes without her consent.

And i cracked my knee, \" she says still, she tried to climb out, but just couldn't manage it. \"because i don't have the agility or the upper body strength that i used to, \" she said. Now what? \"i was thinking i might be here a while because my tenants were out, nobody was home. My phone was inside, \" she says. But her old ipad was on a chair on the small pool deck, but it was out of reach. Then, ingenuity. \"so then i grab the pole. Hooked the leg of the chair. Dragged it over, and got online, \" she says. She posted her 911 on \"epping squawks, \" a community facebook group. \"only a few minutes to start getting a response, \" leslie says. Offers of help poured in, and people came to leslie's house. They tried to fix the ladder, no dice. They tried putting a chair in the water, but it was too tippy. \"every idea we thought of didn't work, \" she says. Finally they tried a step ladder"

Per the telegraph, a mandate just handed down by a brussels appeals court will force king albert ii, who gave up his crown in 2013 so his son philippe could sit on the throne, to have his saliva tested to see if he's the father of 50-year-old multimedia artist delphine boel. The ex-monarch has denied for more than 10 years that he's boel's dad, but a 1999 biography on albert's wife, queen paola, tells a different story. That tome alleges albert had a long-time affair with aristocrat sybille de selys longchamps, a relationship that allegedly resulted in the birth of boel in the late ' 60s; the affair reportedly ended in 1976, when albert chose to stay with paola so he wouldn't have to abdicate. Albert has admitted his marriage to paola, which produced three children of their own ( all older than boel ), wasn't always smooth, per reuters. The man boel grew up believing was her father, jacques boel, has already been determined via dna testing to not be her biological father. The court order, which overturned an earlier ruling and can't be appealed, says albert has three months to comply with the testing. If he refuses, he ' ll be legally deemed boel's father.

King albert ii, who has refused to recognise ms boël as his daughter for more than a decade, must submit to the test within three months or be legally presumed to be the multi-media artist's father. An earlier court-ordered dna test proved that jacques boël, scion of one of belgium's richest industrial dynasties, was not her biological father. Since that 2013 test, ms boël, who has two children, has tried to prove that albert is her father. The former monarch, 83, abdicated in 2013 in favour of his son philippe after 20 years on the throne. The decision also cost him his immunity to court judgments such as the paternity test, which would be a saliva test carried out on albert, ms boël and her mother at a brussels hospital. Ms boël's lawyers said in their statement that they were pleased with the \" strong affirmation of the principle of acting in the interests of the child \" as she seeks legal confirmation of her true identity.",

Reuters/fred sierakowski/pool/file photo brussels ( reuters ) - the brussels appeals court has ordered the retired king of belgium to take a dna paternity test, overturning an earlier ruling in a suit brought by 50-year-old artist delphine boel. Under the judgment, reported by boel's lawyers on monday, king albert ii must take the test within three months or risk being presumed to be her father — although his lawyers could seek to challenge the court's legal argument. The 84-year-old monarch, who in 2013 abdicated in favor of his son philippe after 20 years on the throne, has contested boel's claim for more than a decade. Court-ordered dna tests have proved that she is not the daughter of jacques boel, scion of one of belgium's richest industrial dynasties. The court could not be reached, and there was no immediate comment from the royal house.

            "The retired king of the belgians has been ordered to take a dna paternity test by a brussels court, raising the prospect of finally resolving whether he is the real father of delphine boël, a 50-year-old aristocrat artist. King albert ii, who has refused to recognise ms boël as his daughter for more than a decade, must submit to the test within three months or be legally presumed to be the multi-media artist's father. An earlier court-ordered dna test proved that jacques boël, scion of one of belgium's richest industrial dynasties, was not her biological father. Since that 2013 test, ms boël, who has two children, has tried to prove that albert is her father. The former monarch, 83, abdicated in 2013 in favour of his son philippe after 20 years on the throne. The decision also cost him his immunity to court judgments such as the paternity test, which would be a saliva test carried out on albert, ms boël and her mother at a brussels hospital. Ms boël's lawyers said in their statement that they were pleased with the \" strong affirmation of the principle of acting in the interests of the child \" as she seeks legal confirmation of her true identity.",
            "File photo: belgium's king albert and queen paola attend a tribute to the victims of brussels suicide attacks, at the royal palace in brussels, belgium, may 22, 2016. Reuters/fred sierakowski/pool/file photo brussels ( reuters ) - the brussels appeals court has ordered the retired king of belgium to take a dna paternity test, overturning an earlier ruling in a suit brought by 50-year-old artist delphine boel. Under the judgment, reported by boel's lawyers on monday, king albert ii must take the test within three months or risk being presumed to be her father — although his lawyers could seek to challenge the court's legal argument. The 84-year-old monarch, who in 2013 abdicated in favor of his son philippe after 20 years on the throne, has contested boel's claim for more than a decade. Court-ordered dna tests have proved that she is not the daughter of jacques boel, scion of one of belgium's richest industrial dynasties. The court could not be reached, and there was no immediate comment from the royal house. Boel's lawyers said in their statement that they were pleased with the \"strong affirmation of the principle of acting in the interests of the child \" as she seeks legal confirmation of her true identity. That identity became a topic of public debate after the publication in 1999 of a biography of queen paola, albert's italian wife, which alleged that he had had a"

So far, everything's coming up blue; democrats have extended their senate majority to 53, not counting the two independents expected to poll with them, after winning a pair of nail biters. In north dakota, former attorney general heidi heitkamp has scored what politico terms an \" upset \" win over rep. Rick berg to claim the last unsettled senate seat of the election. Heitkamp won with fewer than 3,000 votes, the ap reports, a margin so small that berg could have demanded a recount, but he instead conceded late this afternoon. Earlier, democrat sen. Jon tester won an excruciatingly close re-election battle over rep. Denny rehberg, after a bitter campaign that dominated montana politics for two years, the missoulian reports. Tester likely benefited from a strong performance by libertarian dan cox, who managed 6 % of the vote — most of it likely at rehberg's expense.",

        "summary": "The islamic state has \" distributed \" about 300 yazidi women to its jihadist fighters as spoils of war, cnn reports. The islamic state, or isis, kidnapped the women when it attacked yazidi villages and forced tens of thousands to flee earlier this month, according to a british group monitoring the crisis. The group says the sunni extremists sold off at least 27 of the women to other isis members in syria for $ 1,000 each. Some of the women converted to islam for the marriages. In other isis news: john kerry today called for a \" world coalition \" to defeat isis in a variety of ways: \" to confront its nihilistic vision and genocidal agenda, \" the coalition would have to use \" political, humanitarian, economic, law enforcement and intelligence tools to support military force, \" he wrote in a new york times op-ed. Isis militants beheaded a soldier in lebanon and posted the beheading on social media, the new york times reports. The soldier, also a sunni, was captured when isis temporarily took over a lebanese border town. Isis is threatening to kill more captives if lebanon doesn't release jihadist prisoners. Saudi arabia's king warns that islamist extremists are close to attacking europe and the us. King abdullah didn't mention isis by name, but his words \" appeared aimed at drawing washington and nato forces into a wider fight \" against the militant group, cbs news reports. Foreign policy says it acquired an isis fighter's laptop that contains plans to create biological weapons, including one that spreads the bubonic plague. \" the human casualties can be huge, \" said a 19-page instruction manual. But there was no evidence that isis already has such weapons. For more, read about an american woman being held by isis.",

She adds she tearfully accepted an offer from target — which sells the circo-brand item and heard about the story — to make larger versions of the shirt so cami can wear it even when she's an adult. \" it's been very, very touching, \" skouson tells kutv. \" these are all total strangers, \" she wrote on facebook. \" people are inherently good and kind, and i ' m glad i've been able to be a recipient of that kindness. \" ( a photo of a cake decorated by someone with autism also went viral. )",

        "summary": "Life sentences are unusual in denmark, even when the crime is murder, but that's what danish inventor peter madsen was handed on wednesday. Judge anette burkoe at the copenhagen city court said she and the two jurors — whose opinions all held equal weight in the case — found swedish journalist kim wall was murdered, telling madsen he hadn't given \" a trustworthy \" explanation for her death and that \" there is clear evidence that the accused has shown an interest in killing and dismembering people. \" the 47-year-old stood quietly listening as the verdict was read, reports the ap, with the guardian describing him as \" visibly nervous. \" the paper notes life sentences in denmark typically average 16 years; madsen has two weeks to decide whether he will appeal. Madsen had maintained that he did not murder wall, but did admit to cutting up her body and disposing of it in the sea after what he said was an accidental death. The new york times reports prosecutor jakob buch-jepsen had argued madsen was fixated on murdering a woman after a rocket launch was scrapped on aug. 8, two days before wall died. Buch-jepsen said madsen texted three women an invitation to meet him on the sub but was turned down. Wall boarded the sub on aug. 10 for an interview that she had tried to secure for months; madsen had texted her that day with the invite. \" it was random chance that it turned out to be kim wall, \" buch-jepsen said. Wall skipped her own going away party to head to the interview. More on that here.",

Kelly tousley, ' 11, and curtiss o ' rorke stedman joined the tiny house movement in june after purchasing a utility trailer and outfitting it for adventure.

They're hitting the road, but that doesn't come without sacrifice. Download audio: on the curb in front of a brown house sits a bookshelf, a suitcase and empty picture frames. Passersby might think the tenants are moving out or spring cleaning. \"we don't really have enough time to do a true yard sale so this is our, like, piecemeal please-everybody-come-take-our-stuff-so-we-can-move-into-98-square-feet, \" kelly tousley says with a laugh. There's also a sign: \"knock on the door for more items for sale in the house. \" kelly and her boyfriend are getting rid of nearly everything they own to fit into a tiny house on wheels parked outside their rental. From the outside, it looks like a glossy white travel trailer. \"i mean, picture opening up the back of a u-haul and that's what we started with, \" she says. But the inside is more like a home with vinyl hardwood floors and lime green walls. They ' ll pull the trailer with a truck for a yearlong trip through the alaska road system and down to the lower 48. For such a small space, it's remarkably plush. A bench folds out into a queen-sized bed. \"we had the conversation of, if we're living in this and this is our house, we don't want to be sitting on milk crates with cushions on top of them and feeling"

Some 265 people died and 1,140 were injured in the 7.2 magnitude quake, according to interior minister idris naim sahin. Nearly 1,000 buildings have been destroyed in the disaster zone, with the town of ercis the worst hit. The death toll is expected to rise as outlying areas are reached. Rescuers pulled out several survivors from beneath the ruins of collapsed buildings in ercis on monday - including one man who called for help on his mobile phone, anatolia news agency said. Cranes and heavy equipment are lifting slabs of concrete in ercis and the larger city of van as rescue crews cut through steel reinforcing bars and shift rubble in the search for more survivors. The interior minister said he believed dozens of people were trapped in buildings in ercis but not as many as initially feared. At the scene ercis occupies a beautiful site overlooking lake van, surrounded by snow-capped peaks. It is a beautiful setting, but today it is a scene of great sadness, shock and mourning. At one collapsed building we found four men delicately passing saucepans full of rubble that was being removed",

The state hospital reported 59 people had died and more than 400 injured were being treated four hours after the quake struck. The area was also hit by a series of aftershocks. Many patients are being treated in the garden of the hospital because it lacks sufficient capacity for all the wounded. Based on the magnitude of the quake and the state of infrastructure in the region however, turkey's seismology institute estimated the casualty count between 500 and 1,000. \" we estimate around 1,000 buildings are damaged and our estimate is for hundreds of lives lost.

Is planning no fewer than 10 dc comics movies in the next six years is great news for superhero fans, yes? no, writes stephanie merry at the washington post. In fact, the announcement might just herald the end of the genre. \" decades from now, cinephiles will look back on the early 2000s as the superhero era — and they ' ll be able to pinpoint the moment when the bubble burst, \" she writes of the studio's announcement. This kind of bubble-bursting happens with any film trend, from film noir to westerns to spy movies, and the move by warner bros. Seems likely to speed things up. The studio is desperately trying to overtake marvel ( iron man, guardians of the galaxy ) as king of the superhero flicks, but in doing so it will only worsen the glut of such movies, writes merry. People are going to get bored. \" it looks like warner bros. Is running hard to catch up when it might be smarter to focus on the next big thing, \" she concludes. Those looking for antidote to the skepticism can check out graeme mcmillan at wired, who loves most of the new dc comics lineup. With wonder woman, for example, \" warner bros. Has beaten marvel to the punch of not only a solo female-led superhero movie, but also superhero movies with non-white leads: aquaman and shazam. \" taken as a whole, the 10-movie schedule is, in a word, \" super, \" and the heightened competition could lead to bigger, better movies from both studios.

The fugitives, however, remain at large. When announcing the arrests wednesday, sheriff sandra hutchens did not identify the men or say what charges they face, the los angeles times reports. She did say, according to the orange county register, that more arrests were expected overnight and into thursday, adding that there's a possibility guards or other jail employees may have provided \" inside help \" to the escapees. Since the friday escape, deputies have served some 30 warrants, abc7 reports. A $ 200,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the escapees. More from hutchens ' press conference: those arrested in connection to the escape were affiliated with the same street gang as 20-year-old fugitive jonathan tieu, knew the escaped inmates, or were arrested on probation violations. Hutchens believes hossein nayeri, 37, was the \" mastermind \" of the escape. Authorities have not recovered the tools used, and hutchens believes the escapees would have needed help getting their hands on them. ( \" it's not something we think could have occurred with a jail-made shank, if you will. \" ) \" it's every sheriff's nightmare, \" hutchens said of the escape, which has sparked criticism over how inmates are housed at the nearly 50-year-old jail. Nayeri, tieu, and bac duong, 43, were not noticed missing for some 16 hours. Hutchens says she has made changes to the way inmates are counted throughout the day, per the register. She also defended the decision to house the escapees in a dormitory instead of individual cells, the times reports. \" we house based on behavior, and there were no issues … while they were in our custody, \" she says.",

They found that tides from the nearby north sea caused the land underneath the lake to shift ever so slightly, resulting in a change in depth of 0.06 inches at either end, depending on whether the tide was in or out. One professor likened it to a carpenter's bubble level, notes the bbc. \" i have described loch ness as the largest spirit level in the world, \" he says. \" if you were on a boat in the middle of the loch, you certainly wouldn't notice it, \" adds another. \" but a tide like this has never been observed in a western european lake before. \" the scientists used underwater pressure sensors at various spots in the lake to get the astonishing accuracy, explains discovery. The hope is that the method can be used at other lakes to shed more light on how oceans affect the earth's crust.

            "The loch ness monster lives in a giant carpenter's level. Just as the bubble in a carpenter's level moves back and forth depending on the surface it rests upon, scotland's loch ness tilts back and forth according to the movement of the ground beneath it caused by the tides on the nearby north sea. The motion is so subtle gps couldn't even track it. When the tide comes in on the north sea, 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) to the east of loch ness, the increased pressure on the seafloor deforms the earth, a process called ocean tidal loading. And while the moon controls the tides of the north sea, and affects the loch as well, the wobbly movement of the land from the pressure of the changing tides is what really determines the loch's levels.

            "The loch ness monster lives in a giant carpenter's level. Just as the bubble in a carpenter's level moves back and forth depending on the surface it rests upon, scotland's loch ness tilts back and forth according to the movement of the ground beneath it caused by the tides on the nearby north sea. The motion is so subtle gps couldn't even track it. When the tide comes in on the north sea, 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) to the east of loch ness, the increased pressure on the seafloor deforms the earth, a process called ocean tidal loading. And while the moon controls the tides of the north sea, and affects the loch as well, the wobbly movement of the land from the pressure of the changing tides is what really determines the loch's levels. The water in the loch acts like a bowl of water on a wobbly table, sloshing according to the movement of the land it rests upon. The depth of the loch changed by 1.5 millimeters ( 0.06 inches ) at its different ends depending on whether the north sea tide was in or not, according to researchers at the national oceanography center in the uk and the university of porto, portugal.

        "summary": "Former obama national security adviser susan rice is back in the news again, this time regarding president trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \" unmask, \" for political advantage, the names of trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the white house of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: a key story comes from eli lake at bloomberg news. He reported monday that rice requested the identities of trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in us intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the trump transition, but sometimes between trump associates and foreign officials. ( the national security council logs of rice's requests are apparently what rep. Devin nunes went to the white house to view. ) lake's piece raises questions about why rice wanted those names revealed — she didn't respond to the story — but he also notes that her requests \" were likely within the law. \" he adds that the story doesn't \" vindicate \" trump's unsupported accusation that obama wiretapped trump tower. Adam housley of fox news also reported on rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \" such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.'spied on before nomination.'the real story. \" a post at slate notes that trump associates are under fbi investigation over allegedly improper communications with russians, \" so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific trump-related figures and foreign individuals. \" but the editorial page at the wall street journal accuses the media and democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any trump-russia ties investigated, but complains that the \" media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the obama administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both. \" on cnn, don lemon accused the \" right-wing media \" of helping the white house try to divert attention from the controversy over trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \" aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the american people, by creating a diversion, \" he said, per mediaite.

When she does notice, ana quickly pats her head free of flames. Although she seems pretty shocked by her burning hair, she doesn't look hurt — she laughs off the fact that she lit her head on fire in front of a bunch of people. Life, like a video game, is unpredictable."

Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the hill digs into the political logistics in the senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are sens. Susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: at vox, ezra klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \" insane \" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the white house and the other the senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: the washington post picks out five times kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions.",

A new american study of south korea's ramen consumption examined the diets of 10,700 people aged 19 to 64. They found both healthy ( fish and rice ) and unhealthy ( meat and fast food ) diet trends, but neither was linked to metabolic syndrome and ultimately heart disease, the new york times explains. When instant noodles were thrown in the mix, researchers saw trouble. Women who ate a cup of them more than twice a week saw a 68 % jump in cardiometabolic syndrome. It didn't matter what else they ate. Some south koreans are a little steamed — and defensive — about the study's findings. After all, south koreans eat more ramen than anyone else; the sodium-rich 80-cent cup is found everywhere there, from comic book stores to libraries and train stations. One man tells the ap, while guzzling ramen: \" there's no way any study is going to stop me from eating this. \" love for the instant noodle spans generations — it reminds the elderly of post-korean war recovery and for the young and busy, it's quick and cheap. For others, \" the smell and taste create an instant sense of home, \" says one seoul resident. ( here's how ramen got its start )",

During the dispute, bonds stabbed johns in the upper body with a three-inch pocket knife, police tell nbc washington. She was pronounced dead at a hospital, while bonds, of clifton, md., was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. Earlier, around 9: 20pm, bonds had called police to report disorderly conduct and a noise violation, officers say. A friend of johns says bonds had cut power to the wedding reception before the bride and groom shared their first dance, possibly because the event extended beyond the park's usual operating hours. It isn't clear how johns was involved in the dispute, but police say it was resolved when they arrived. Johns was stabbed around 10: 50pm. She \" was a dedicated friend with a genuine zest for life, \" a friend writes on a gofundme page.

            "The massive dragnet for a fugitive ex-cop continued friday, with more than 100 officers conducting a fruitless search in the snowy, forested mountains around big bear lake for an armed gunman who police say is on a vengeful rampage. As the falling snow piled up, authorities pledged to continue the manhunt until they find christopher jordan dorner, the 33-year-old former los angeles police officer suspected of killing three people, or stumble on definitive evidence that he is no longer in the area. The trail has gone cold since dorner's nissan titan pickup was found thursday morning engulfed in flames on a u.s. Forest service dirt road between the bear mountain and snow summit ski resorts. A set of footprints in the snow led away from the burned truck. It took more than five hours for experts to confirm that it was dorner's vehicle and search parties to begin a methodical sweep of an area stretching across eight square miles. While ski-masked swat teams went door-to-door checking hundreds of homes and shuttered cabins, other authorities fanned out on foot, slogging through fresh snow with search dogs.

            "The massive dragnet for a fugitive ex-cop continued friday, with more than 100 officers conducting a fruitless search in the snowy, forested mountains around big bear lake for an armed gunman who police say is on a vengeful rampage. As the falling snow piled up, authorities pledged to continue the manhunt until they find christopher jordan dorner, the 33-year-old former los angeles police officer suspected of killing three people, or stumble on definitive evidence that he is no longer in the area. The trail has gone cold since dorner's nissan titan pickup was found thursday morning engulfed in flames on a u.s. Forest service dirt road between the bear mountain and snow summit ski resorts. A set of footprints in the snow led away from the burned truck. It took more than five hours for experts to confirm that it was dorner's vehicle and search parties to begin a methodical sweep of an area stretching across eight square miles. While ski-masked swat teams went door-to-door checking hundreds of homes and shuttered cabins, other authorities fanned out on foot, slogging through fresh snow with search dogs. The teams combed backcountry and checked every shed, trash bin and barrel where the fugitive could hide. Dorner is described as african american, 6 feet tall and 270 pounds.
