            "In 2009, the coen brothers ' \" a serious man \" introduced audiences to an uptight, uncertain man spiraling through a midlife crisis in 1960s minnesota. For their next film, the oscar-winning pair will head back to the pivotal decade, but shift over to the big city, to explore a history-changing music scene. According to variety, joel and ethan coen will next direct a film called \" llewyn davis, \" which will follow the struggles of a small time folk musician who tries to make it in greenwich village. Back in july, the la times reported that the film -- then without a known working title -- would be based on the life of seminal jazz musician and coffee house artist/politico/writer/legend, dave van ronk, drawing inspiration from his post-humous novel, \" the mayor of macdougal street. \" whether that is true remains to be seen, though van ronk certainly provides an interesting character study should the filmmakers decide to use him for the film. The pair is in the midst of one of their greatest critical runs. Their period western \" true grit \" garnered 10 oscar nominations and became their highest grossing film yet, while \" a serious man \" garnered two nods. Their spy spoof \" burn after reading \" was nominated for two golden globes, while \" no country for old men \" scored them oscar wins for best director, best picture and best adapted screenplay. They are currently working on \" gambit, \" a crime caper starring last year's best actor oscar winner, colin firth. For more, click over to variety.",

        "summary": "Taking on starbucks and its mermaid logo: an iced coffee drink featuring grumpy cat. That was the plan, anyway, per the owners of a beverage company who say they teamed up with the famous feline's owners to start the brand, then say they were let down by the grumpy cat team's efforts to promote it. But courthouse news reports those tied to the frowning feline ( real name: tardar sauce ) pushed back on the accusations and ultimately prevailed, with a jury awarding the cat's owners $ 710,000 for copyright and trademark infringement and a token $ 1 for breach of contract. On the other side: nick and paul sandford, owners of grenade beverage, who'd originally worked up a licensing deal with grumpy cat limited to create an iced coffee line called \" grumpy cat grumppuccino, \" but who then engaged in \" despicable misconduct, \" per a gcl complaint, cited by the washington post. Among those allegedly unseemly acts, per grumpy cat limited: launching an additional, unauthorized ground coffee attached to grumpy cat's likeness, selling grumpy cat t-shirts without permission, and not paying out the proper percentage of profits. A grenade countersuit claims, among other things, that the grumpy cat team didn't post enough about the iced coffee on social media, didn't say an agreed-upon slogan during a tv appearance, and misrepresented that the cat would gain further brand prominence by starring in a movie with will ferrell and jack black ( a movie that never came to be ). The eight-member jury sided with grumpy cat, who was apparently home sulking when the verdict was read. The cat's lawyer, however, noted that \" grumpy cat feels vindicated and feels the jury reached a just verdict. \" ( grumpy cat was once rumored to make more money than nicole kidman. )",

Business insider reports on the \" real-estate bliss \" being offered to the city's \" desperate renters \" by startup homeshare, which has since 2016 leased apartments in luxury buildings that it then carves up to squeeze out an additional bedroom, lowering the per-person cost: what is originally a 2-bedroom, for instance, gets an \" upholstered partition \" in the living room that creates bedroom no. 3, which is sized to hold a queen-sized bed and goes for as low as $ 1,125. ( opt for the unit's bedroom with private bath, and you ' ll pay a minimum of $ 1,700 ). So how big a deal is that? curbed sf points out a renter can pay homeshare $ 1,300 for a converted room in sf's lseven building — or lease a 472-square-foot studio from the building directly for $ 3,080. The company also operates in silicon valley and new york city, and while it's tight-fisted on usage numbers, ceo jeff pang did tell business insider that since its 2016 founding it has gotten 30,000 applications from would-be bay area residents. Homeshare takes a slice of the rent, and the residents gain entry to amenities-rich buildings they otherwise couldn't financially swing. As san francisco magazine puts it, \" it's a fit for the kind of person who needs to scrounge cash and will tolerate roommates, but craves panoramic views and glistening new plumbing fixtures. \" as for those roommates, buzzbuzznews explains that after completing a questionnaire, homeshare matches you with \" homies, \" though those looking to live with friends have the option of doing so.

The rules are expected to go into place in another month or two, but there's no use for soldiers to rush out and get soon-to-be-outlawed tattoos in the interim: once the regulations are set, soldiers will have to \" self-identify \" their existing tattoos and pay to remove any in violation of the new policy, says the newspaper. Tats deemed racist, sexist, or extremist also are off limits. The changes — only for the army, not the other military branches — are part of broader grooming and uniform rules expected to cover everything from fingernail length to makeup to body piercings. But so far, it's the tattoos drawing the heavy attention, reports business insider. Lydia dallett writes that the army let things get relatively lax over the last decade as it struggled to fill quotas, but now that the afghan war is winding down, it can afford to tighten up again. A common sentiment is voiced by james joyner at defense one: \" the goal here, which i share, is for soldiers to project a professional image. But there's a fine line between enforcing ' professionalism ' and pushing one generation's pet peeves on another. \"",

            "Syrian rebels claim to have shot down a government warplane in the east of the country, in a significant propaganda boost after devastating aerial attacks. Free syrian army fighters in deir ezzor said they had downed the mig-23 fighter jet early on monday morning as it flew low on a bombing mission over the town's mohassan district. Video footage shows part of a jet bursting into flames, followed by ecstatic rebel cries of \" god is great \". Syria's state news agency, sana, said the jet had suffered a technical failure during a training mission and that the pilot had ejected. The rebels said they had shot the mig down using a heavy machine gun and captured the pilot, col mufeed muhammed salman, who appears in the video. Ziyad al-ameer, a local activist and resident, said warplanes had been flying over the mohassan district and neighbouring villages for several days.

Since she was 14 weeks old, layla had been battling \" one of the most aggressive forms \" of acute lymphoblastic leukemia her doctors had seen; chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant didn't work. Unwilling to accept palliative care, layla's parents pleaded with doctors at britain's great ormond street hospital to try anything that might help their daughter, reports the washington post. Then, a \" lucky coincidence, \" reports the new york times: the hospital was manufacturing \" designer immune cells \" that had never been used on humans and were to be tested in a clinical trial. They decided to use the cells on her — and they may have cured her. The hospital explains the science: cancer patients ' immune cells, or t-cells, can be modified to target and kill cancer cells, but leukemia typically destroys the healthy t-cells such that there aren't enough to harvest. In this case, new genes were added to donor t-cells to \" arm them against leukemia. \" \" molecular scissors \" then cut certain genes to force two behaviors: the t-cells became \" invisible to a powerful leukemia drug that would usually kill them \" and were \" reprogrammed to only target and fight against leukemia cells. \" for two weeks, nothing happened. Then layla developed a rash, which showed her body was responding. A few weeks later, she was cancer-free and has been in the months since. \" we thought that the little bit of liquid in the syringe was nothing \" compared to the \" bags and bags of chemo, \" says layla's father of the 1ml infusion. Though it's apparently worked in only one patient who hasn't been in remission long, the times frames the potential significance: \" cell therapies, which represent an exciting new front in the battle against cancer, might not have to be customized for each patient, saving time and money. \" ( elsewhere, researchers discovered a \" one-two punch \" against skin cancer. )",

The book has been the no.1 bestseller on amazon since its release earlier this week, although bissonnette has been accused of violating a non-disclosure agreement, and the us government may be able to seize funds paid to him and his publisher. The director of another seal charity, the all in, all the time foundation, says its board has yet to make a decision about accepting funds from bissonnette, and she wants to read the book before commenting.",

The gist of most: trump is still expected to win, but it's going to be close. Some coverage: trump is up by just 3 points in the latest poll from the university of texas and the texas tribune. The breakdown is here. One of his biggest problems this year in the state? suburban republican women. Npr takes a look. Another trump problem? latino voters. \" trump's potential effect on hispanic turnout is at the heart of republican worries, \" observes politico. A story at cnn may cheer republicans looking at the big picture. It suggests the closeness is a \" one-time phenomenon \" that can be blamed on trump's alienation of large swaths of voters. And a lengthy assessment from the texas politics project crunches a slew of factors to conclude: \" there is good reason to believe that polling is finding texas leaning republican rather than the solid republican state it has been in presidential elections for most of the last three decades. But the change in its tilt doesn't necessarily mean it's ready to fall the other direction without still more shaking at the foundations. \" the new york times sums up: yes, \" there is widespread disenchantment with mr. Trump among texas republicans, but mrs. Clinton remains unpopular in parts of the state.

Here's a look at what the pundits are saying: andrew sullivan calls last night \" obama's debate, \" though romney \" made no massive mistakes. \" still, sullivan noted mid-debate at the dish, \" obama is wiping the floor with him on substance, and romney has basically fled neoconservatism as quickly as he would a liquor store. \" what's more, \" obama's closing statement was his best few minutes in all three debates. \" at the weekly standard, bill kristol feels very differently. \" mitt romney is more than holding his own with barack obama tonight, \" he writes. \" tonight, romney seems as fully capable as — probably more capable than — barack obama of being the next president. He probably will be. \" chris cillizza dubs obama the winner in the washington post. The president \" controlled the third presidential debate in a way not all that dissimilar from the way romney controlled the first one. He was \" the more confident and commanding presence — by a lot, \" and his \" horses and bayonets \" and \" 1980s \" zingers should keep the press going for a while. As for the numbers: a cnn poll finds obama won, 48 % to 40 %. At cbs, it was 53 % obama, 23 % romney — a bigger margin than romney enjoyed after the first debate, notes nate silver at fivethirtyeight. And a public policy polling survey of swing-state voters saw obama winning, 53 % to 42 %. If obama can translate his success into a small overall poll bounce, it could make a big difference, silver writes. Cnn's john king and david gergen both give the debate to obama, but tom cohen wonders if it will make any difference. Indeed, former white house press secretary ari fleischer says not much has changed: cnn's poll finds that 24 % of respondents were now more likely to vote obama, compared to 25 % for romney, while 50 % said the debate didn't inspire them to back either man.",

A british columbia company has filed a lawsuit against a building council that refuses to let it lease a unit it owns to a moby dick restaurant fish-and-chips franchise in part because the second word in the eatery's name was deemed \" offensive, \" courthouse news reports. The plaintiff, mengfa international, has owned the unit since 2010, and it had initially leased the space to an asian-fusion restaurant. But after that restaurant started having money troubles, moby dick restaurant came onto the scene in may and agreed to a lease-and-purchase arrangement that would seemingly solve everyone's problems. However, that arrangement was rejected by the building in july. It said the \" word 'dick ' in moby dick was an offensive term, \" per the lawsuit. The building council alleges that signs and other markers with the name and logo would sully the brands of other properties in the building and lower property values. The council also worried about litter and restaurant odors. The lawsuit, however, scoffs at claims that the name would somehow cause nearby property values to plummet, noting that it's a seafood restaurant in a waterfront community — right up the name's alley. Mengfa adds it would do its part to keep litter under control and points out it would be using the same kitchen ventilation system as the previous restaurant. As for the name fracas overall: \" moby dick \" is \" not offensive to the public, given its literary significance and fame, \" the suit says. The building council has not filed its defense statement, notes the cbc. ( an odd question about moby dick answered. )",

Rather, it was meant to parody trump's \" blood coming out of her wherever \" comment about megyn kelly; indeed, griffin captioned the photo, \" there was blood coming out of his wherever. \" more on the photo fallout: click here for the full video of the press conference, in which griffin went from crying and worrying aloud her career is over to proclaiming, \" he wants to mess with me? he picked the wrong redhead! \" not everyone is calling griffin out: both jim carrey ( who called comedians the \" last line of defense \" against trump ) and jamie foxx ( who said the world needs comedians ) are defending her. But the gop is milking anti-griffin sentiment for all its worth. The hollywood reporter has video of an attack ad from a republican super pac using griffin in its argument against a democratic congressional candidate. One of the early critics of griffin was first lady melania trump; the washington post notes that it's a rare public rebuke from melania, who doesn't often issue statements of any sort. The post also explains why this stunt shouldn't surprise us, based on griffin's career and history in the spotlight. Over at the huffington post, jack moline says we shouldn't make excuses for what griffin did, but argues that trump himself is partially responsible for the overarching problem — \" the normalization of bad behavior \" in today's society, which now reaches all the way up to the white house. For anyone keeping count, griffin has now lost her cnn gig, a squatty potty deal, a promotional gig for sen. Al franken, and at least five upcoming performances.",

Phillip garrido was on parole for kidnapping and forcible rape when he and his wife, nancy, abducted 11-year-old dugard in 1991 and held her captive for 18 years, reports the ap. In a 2-1 decision, the court found parole officials did their jobs since it was impossible to know that dugard would eventually become garrido's victim. The ruling upheld a lower court decision in 2013 to dismiss the case. Dugard argued parole officials failed to properly supervise garrido — later sentenced to 431 years to life — and should have revoked his parole for violations including drug use. If that had been the case, dugard said she would never have been abducted. Judges richard clifton and john owens said \" parole officials can be sued for failing to carry out their duties only by people who were identifiable victims at the time of the alleged failure, \" reports bay city news. Judge william smith said the government should be liable for foreseeable victims. It isn't clear if dugard will appeal again. ( she's now writing a second memoir. )",

        "summary": "A big shift in the syrian conflict: saudi arabia is arming the opposition. It's a decidedly more activist approach than had previously been taken by regional and western powers, the new york times reports, and it signals an attempt to counter the weapons iran is sending to bashar al-assad's forces. Saudi arabia bought the weapons from croatia, officials say, and they started arriving in december, leading to some minor tactical gains for the rebels over the winter. It's not clear whether the us played any role in the shipments. The weapons have been funneled to nationalist and secular groups, in an attempt to keep them out of the hands of terrorists. Recent concerns about jihadist groups and their role in the opposition also sparked the weapons transfer; those groups are often better-equipped and more influential than the nationalist and secular groups, so this is an attempt to even the playing field — as well as to speed up the opposition's successes. The syrian opposition has agreed to attend an international summit in rome, which it had previously threatened to boycott, after us secretary of state john kerry and his uk counterpart guaranteed increased aid, the bbc reports. Meanwhile, lives continue to be lost: last week, human rights watch says, four missiles fired by the syrian military into residential areas killed 141 in aleppo, half of them children, the ap reports.",

Anthony levandowski bolted from google in january of last year after nine years with the company and launched otto trucking, another self-driving company, which uber then scooped up later in 2016 for a reported $ 680 million. \" we did not steal any google [ intellectual property ], \" levandowski insisted to the magazine in october. Levandowski — described by the guardian as a \" brilliant engineer [ who ] has a history of skirting the rules \" and by bloomberg as \" google's enemy number one \" — isn't listed as a defendant in the suit, but the complaint alleges that he downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files, including those on lidar technology, a laser-based technology both companies have now incorporated into their systems. Not only that, the suit states levandowski \" took extraordinary efforts \" to cover up what he'd taken. Recode notes that industry pundits had once speculated that google and uber could work together to develop a ride-sharing fleet, but uber effectively broke away to do its own thing and positioned itself as a google rival.

In sweden and israel, vast numbers of jellyfish have caused trouble at nuclear and coal power plants this year. The populations of all kinds of jellyfish are growing, mother jones reports, and it may be due in part to climate change; jellyfish like warm water. What's more, they could be helping the oceans get even warmer, since carbon-releasing bacteria feast on their droppings. Meanwhile, overfishing is killing jellyfish predators. About 150 million people suffer jellyfish stings yearly; hundreds of thousands of those are in the chesapeake bay and florida. Fortunately, most aren't going to kill you. But about 50 people per year may die from the stings, an expert notes. Brushing against a \" trigger hair \" on a jellyfish cell prompts a venom sac to shoot out. Even a broken-off tentacle can sting you. If you get stung, try removing leftover pieces of tentacle with tweezers or a stick — not your fingers — and then washing the area with seawater. The un has called on scientists to help fight the jellyfish scourge, haaretz notes. Most efforts thus far haven't been fruitful, but an israeli scientist may be onto something: their proteins, he says, could help make bandages and other medical products. Another option? robots.",

Hundreds of work orders for the white house were submitted in 2017, and news4 got its hands on them, calling them a \" rare glimpse into the granular work \" needed for the upkeep. The requests were sent to the general services office's public buildings service, and they include everything from mundane heating repairs and installation of new furniture and electronics equipment to what appears to be an ongoing pest-control mission. Over the past couple of years, maintenance staff has dealt with roaches, ants in the chief of staff's office, and mice in the navy's white house mess dining facility, located right next to the situation room ( which also has a mouse problem ). Other standout items among the orders: a decorator for national security adviser hr mcmaster, a replacement toilet seat for the oval office ( to be done \" after hours, please \" ), new pictures for ex-press secretary sean spicer's office, and new drapes in melania trump's east wing office, with the mandate of the \" overall effect of the room being taller. \" former gsa officials note some of the work orders can be complicated to complete, as the building is a historic one. And those work orders are constant, leading to costs of up to $ 100,000 per year for repairs and other general maintenance, which ex-gsa inspector general brian miller says isn't terribly surprising. \" any of us who have old houses know old houses need a lot of work, \" he says.

But that's not the story its inmates were telling friday. \" save me jesus, \" a 30-year-old man locked up at fci beaumont for cocaine and gun possession said in an email. \" i never thought nothing like this would happen in prison. \" the man said inmates hadn't had a warm meal in nearly six days and one inmate passed out thursday from malnutrition. He said the water shortages have forced inmates at the 1,800-person, low-security facility to use four portable toilets, which are already full. \" we are getting two bottles of water a day thus far, \" says a 50-year-old beaumont inmate serving time for fraud. \" we are getting three brown bags of peanut butter and bologna a day. \" he calls the situation \" obscene. \" in response to the inmates ' complaints, the federal bureau of prisons stated: \" there is ample food and bottled water for inmates and staff. \" the city has already suffered major shortages of clean running water and power due to flooding, and more flooding is expected, cnn reports. A thousand people have been evacuated from the city's shelters, and the city's baptist hospital was also evacuated. A number of other prisons in the area have relocated their prisoners. Texas gov.

            "( cnn ) houston's mayor saturday ordered nearly 300 people to leave their flooded homes, and another large city scrambled to restore water service as president donald trump visited flood victims and relief workers in texas and louisiana eight days after hurricane harvey struck. In houston, mayor sylvester turner said people who had chosen to stay in inundated homes in the western part of the city must depart by 7 a.m. Ct sunday, after which the centerpoint energy utility will turn off power to those residences. Turner said he's ordering the evacuation in part out of concern for the safety of firefighters, who would have trouble responding to emergencies in inundated areas. President donald trump and first lady melania trump talk with people impacted by hurricane harvey in a houston neighborhood on saturday. Public safety personnel will be in the area -- south of interstate 10 and north of briar forest drive -- to help people depart, he said. Emergency workers scouted the area friday to learn how many people had not left their flooded homes. Parts of western houston have seen sustained flooding in part because the army corps of engineers has intentionally released water from two swollen reservoirs -- and the flooding there won't recede soon, turner said. \" i have to balance the interest of those who choose to stay \" against the safety concerns for emergency personnel",

The family has given vast sums to several us politicians, including new jersey sen. Robert menendez, who fought to overturn the ban. Meanwhile, the us has rejected calls to extradite estefania's father and uncle, roberto and william isaias, who have been sentenced to prison in ecuador in what the country calls a $ 400 million case involving fraud by their bank. Menendez pushed hard with the state department on behalf of estefania after the travel ban was enforced. He announced the ban's reversal a day after her mother donated $ 40,000 to the obama victory fund in 2012. The family also gave menendez's 2012 campaign more than $ 11,000, nbc new york reports. Menendez's office says the senator \" handled this case no differently than we have thousands of other immigration-related requests over the years, \" and that he often works on out-of-state cases. But the ecuadorian ambassador calls the move on behalf of a foreign national \" quite unusual. \" as for the brothers, the criminal case against them was questionable, the times notes, and the us says extradition requests haven't fulfilled legal requirements.

A rundown of what the pundits are saying: santorum seemed \" nervous, tired, and uncomfortable \" in the spotlight, writes maggie haberman at politico. He stumbled while discussing earmarks, and, worse, admitted voting for no child left behind despite not believing in it — undermining his claim to be the most solid conservative in the race and practically writing mitt romney's attack ads for him. It wasn't a good night for santorum, agrees jonathan bernstein at the washington post. \" he can't seem to avoid getting bogged down in senate-speak and unnecessary defenses of stuff that no one cares about. \" but the real losers, he decides, were gop voters, \" because their candidates are showing no ability to actually talk about things that would be central to their presidencies in any kind of substantive, realistic way. \" romney \" won \" by keeping santorum on the defensive, writes amy walter at abc, \" but he didn't make a strong case for himself or his own record. He didn't put to rest concerns about his lack of a bigger, broader vision for november. \" an upbeat newt gingrich had a reasonably good debate and \" looked like the voice of reason after the endless earmarks battle, speaking clearly after romney and santorum babbled on interminably, \" writes brian montopoli at cbs.

        "summary": "The internet has set its sights on a 19-year-old texas tech cheerleader who posted photos to her facebook page documenting her big-game hunting exploits in africa. Kendall jones ' bio recounts her hunting experience — a trip to zimbabwe at age 9 where she was \" just too small to hold the guns \" followed by a south africa trip at 13 where \" the first animal i ever shot was a white rhino with a.416 remington!! \" a year after that she bagged an elephant, \" a charging cape buffalo and a huge maned lion, \" and a leopard. The photos of her with her kills aren't going over well, with a 104,000-signature-strong petition asking mark zuckerberg to take down the photos, which the petition charges promote animal cruelty. A second petition is seeking to deny her access to african states. The cleburne resident talked to the cleburne times-review — via email from africa, where she's been hunting for weeks — and explained that she knew when she posted the photos there would be some backlash. But \" i really am shocked \" at the severity of it. \" i have actually had several death threats. \" jones maintains that hunters care about conservation more than most, and noted one experience in zimbabwe, where leopards had taken out 107 cattle; \" instead of the villagers killing the leopards to prevent livestock damage, permits are sold to hunters to do this for them, \" with the permit money benefiting the village. A facebook rep tells nbc news some photos were removed, though they didn't get into specifics beyond a general statement that \" we remove reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for organized fight, or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse. \" in the meantime, plenty more remain.",

Today, however, he is taking flak over comments he made to fox business suggesting that his anti-drone stance isn't quite as anti-drone as some thought. Foreign policy, for instance, says dad ron paul's libertarian fan base is in \" open rebellion \" online. Here's the line from the younger paul that's catching much of the criticism: \" i've never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on. If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and $ 50 in cash, i don't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him. \" contrast that with a statement in the filibuster: \" i will speak as long as it takes, until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our constitution is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no american should be killed by a drone on american soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court. \" the huffington post calls it an \" abrupt shift, \" a sentiment echoed by a disappointed columnist at forbes. But jordan bloom of the american conservative says that while paul \" wasn't as clear as he should have been, \" he didn't actually change his position. \" it seems like he's trying to describe a standoff or firefight in which the cops are forced to neutralize a thief robbing a liquor store, but the way he actually describes it sounds far more innocuous, \" he writes. \" the senator has always been open to the idea of drones being used, with a warrant, in the process of a police investigation. \"",

The kentucky senator, whose famous 13-hour senate floor filibuster did much to strengthen his ties with his father's hardcore following, told fox business network on tuesday he's ok with drone strikes on american citizens who, for instance, rob a liquor store. \" i've never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on, \" paul said. \" if someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and fifty dollars in cash.

            "I knew it was too good to be true. On march 7, i wrote a column entitled \"a kind word for senator rand paul from a typically unkind critic \". In that article, i complimented senator paul — someone with whom i am typically at odds on most issues — for his stance on domestic use of drones and his willingness to filibuster the ' old fashioned ' way. The senator's filibuster was a response to his displeasure with the attorney general who had failed to answer a direct question regarding whether the ag thought it acceptable to use drones on american soil against american citizens. To get his answer, paul resolved to stage a filibuster until mr. Holder gave him an answer to the question — a move by senator paul that i found to be more than appropriate and, frankly, pretty darn cool. As i wrote the column, there was a nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach that the piece might come back to bite me in the proverbial backside.

The kentucky senator, whose famous 13-hour senate floor filibuster did much to strengthen his ties with his father's hardcore following, told fox business network on tuesday he's ok with drone strikes on american citizens who, for instance, rob a liquor store. \" i've never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on, \" paul said. \" if someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and fifty dollars in cash. I don't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him. \" while it's true that paul has always made an exception for \" imminent threats \" -- a 9/11-like moment -- the liquor store scenario struck many libertarians as a very low threshold for domestic drone strikes, especially considering paul's senate floor remarks, which if you recall, took a more anti-drone stance.

In general, furries are people who sexually enjoy cartoon animals and occasionally dress up in animal costumes for sex. \" if the suave disney version of robin hood — who is a literal fox — spoke to you on a romantic level, you may appreciate where they're coming from, \" the guardian explains. In november, gawker noted that \" pretty much any of tony's tweets \" were being met with immediate come-ons from furries. One furry tells the huffington post that lavishing sexual attention on the tony the tiger twitter account was a bit of an \" inside joke. \" but the account started blocking massive numbers of furries — even ones who hadn't tweeted at it — this week, the guardian reports. The move wasn't taken well. \" tony, stop blocking random furries, \" one fan tweeted. \" we're not all after your frost. \" then came the wave of cartoon animal porn. \" let's keep things gr-r-reat — &amp; family-friendly if you could, \" a fed-up tony tweeted wednesday. \" cubs could be watching. \" while it appears many of tony's devotees have listened — with some moving on to cheetos ' chester cheetah, who is \" straight-up flirting with them, \" the guardian notes — the inappropriate tweets are still trickling in.

In a monday facebook post, president jonathan lash explained that the college has a policy of \" periodically flying the flag at half-staff to mourn deaths from violence around the world, \" and that in \" the current environment of escalating hate-based violence, \" the lengthier half-staff decision was made. \" this was meant as an expression of grief over the violent deaths being suffered in this country and globally, including the many us service members who have lost their lives. \" the school was trying to create dialogue, he says, while noting a move that was intended to \" inclusively convey respect and sorrow have had the opposite effect, \" hence the decision to leave the flagpole empty. State rep. John velis, however, says total removal of the flag \" is baseless, cowardly, a disgrace, \" a sentiment seconded by many on social media.",

        "summary": "It's not likely to be the last word on the subject, but researchers at vanderbilt university have come up with an answer to the age-old question of whether dogs or cats are smarter. And it's a win for dog lovers. Study author suzana herculano-houzel explains neurons in the cerebral cortex of the brain are linked to complex behavior like thinking and planning. More specifically, their number \" determines the richness of [ an animal's ] internal mental state and their ability to predict what is about to happen in their environment based on past experience, \" per a release. By counting these cells in carnivoran species including cats, dogs, raccoons, hyenas, lions, and brown bears, herculano-houzel says she determined which of dogs and cats are mentally superior: dogs have about 530 million cortical neurons, while cats have about 250 million. This means \" dogs have the biological capability of doing much more complex and flexible things with their lives than cats can, \" says herculano-houzel, whose research is published in frontiers in neuroanatomy. Interestingly, a golden retriever was actually found to have more cortical neurons than a hyena, lion, or brown bear ( which has a similar number of neurons as a cat ), even though the latter animals have bigger brains. Herculano-houzel suggests this is because predator animals spend most of their time resting, saving energy for hunts, so their brains don't get as much opportunity to develop. One animal whose brain does appear well-developed: the raccoon. Raccoons, with a brain size similar to cats, have a neuronal density similar to that of a dog, reports new atlas. Humans still reign supreme, however, with about 16 billion cortical neurons.",

        "summary": "Don't tell the swarms of tourists paying nearly $ 15 to pose with one leg on either side of the prime meridian at the royal observatory in greenwich, england, but earth's true prime meridian actually passes through a park approximately 334 feet to the east near a trash can. And admission is free. Phys.org reports the prime meridian — \" the north-south line marking zero degrees longitude \" that serves as the starting point from which time zones are measured — is not quite where international representatives placed it in 1884. That's the conclusion of gps-armed researchers, who published their conclusions in the journal of geodesy. To arrive at the now-incorrect meridian, scientists used a bowl of liquid mercury to position a telescope exactly vertical to the \" clock stars \" above. The independent explains that the telescope determined local time \" by marking the exact moment a clock star \" passed — and achieving exactness meant the telescope had to be \" absolutely perpendicular to the earth. \" but the earth is not uniformly round, and gravitational effects vary. A subtle gravitational \" deflection \" affected things in greenwich, reports phys.org, something the researchers determined by way of gps, which is essentially able to take measurements unaffected by gravity and terrain. The conclusion won't have a ripple effect: the researchers analyzed other coordinates across the globe to verify the effect is specific to greenwich. Further, \" the orientation of the meridian plane used to measure universal time has remained essentially unchanged, \" they write.",

Now scientists have explained why – and it all comes down to advances in technology. According to a newly published paper on the discrepancy, which has existed for many years, tourists who visit the observatory at greenwich often discover that they \"must walk east approximately 102 metres before their satellite navigation receivers indicate zero longitude \". The reason, the researchers at the us naval observatory and the national geospatial-intelligence agency concluded, is simply that modern devices rely on satellite gps technology introduced in 1984, which is better at calculating longitude than the one previously relied upon by earth-bound astronomers. The location of the original greenwich meridian was agreed upon at a meeting in washington in 1884, after a vote involving 25 nations. Creating a universally recognised position of 0 degrees longitude allowed accurate global navigation, standardised maps and the creation of time zones. The line, which is used to define greenwich mean time, was calculated by pointing a telescope straight up at a so-called \"clock star \".

The \" dogesled \" campaign has raised nearly $ 34,000 so far. \" as someone who grew up in the ' 90s, cool runnings was the ultimate feel-good movie about underdogs out of their element achieving their dreams, \" the fundraiser organizer explains to the guardian. \" when i was about 7 years old, my best friend and i had a billy-cart that his dad built.

        "summary": "In october 2006, amara ou's father dropped the 2-year-old off at her babysitter's florida home. A few hours later, after the girl wouldn't wake up from a nap, babysitter syna lim, now 48, tried for two hours to reach amara's parents before getting hold of the father. When amara finally arrived at the hospital, she was brain dead. Three years later, a jury found lim guilty of the girl's murder, convicting her of beating the toddler with the handle of a flyswatter and hitting her on the head. She was sentenced to life in prison. But last week, the conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered, the florida times-union reports. New evidence has found that amara may not have been beaten to death after all, but may have died due to undiagnosed juvenile diabetes and another condition that causes uncontrolled internal bleeding. A pathologist and a pediatrician re-examined the case years later and testified that amara had very high blood sugar levels at the time of her death, which caused the internal bleeding. That bleeding, in turn, would have led to the bruises found on amara that could be mistaken as coming from a beating. The doctors told the court that not enough medical testing was done on amara at the hospital, news 4 jax reports. The case brings up questions about the medical examiner who performed amara's autopsy, the times-union notes: she resigned in 2010, and allegations have swirled that she was experiencing early symptoms of alzheimer's before she resigned.

            "Youtube has announced more than one billion people are now visiting its online video site each month. The milestone marks another step in youtube's evolution from a quirky start-up launched in 2005 to one of the most influential forces in today's media landscape. Youtube crossed the one billion threshold five months after facebook said its online social network had reached that figure. The vast audience has given youtube's owner, google inc, another lucrative channel for selling online adverts beyond its dominant internet search engine. Google bought youtube for $ 1.76bn in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50 million users worldwide.",
            "We all know youtube is the biggest video sharing site around, but how big is it, exactly, when compared to sites such as facebook or twitter? here's a hint: youtube has just hit one billion monthly unique users. For comparison, facebook hit that milestone in october 2012. It took the social network eight years to reach one billion active users — almost the exact amount of time as youtube, which was founded in february 2005. Twitter, which has been around since march 2006, has more than 200 million monthly active users.

        "summary": "It's going to be the most-watched presidential debate in american history — and possibly the most controversial. Hillary clinton and donald trump have their first debate monday night, and it's expected to draw a super bowl-sized audience of around 100 million. The stakes will be even higher than in the wrestlemania event where trump shaved his vanquished opponent's head: polls show clinton and trump neck and neck, and according to the latest reuters poll, around 50 % of voters say the debate will help them choose. A roundup of coverage: usa today, which has details such as viewing tips, nicknames the event being held at hofstra university's david s. Mack sports and exhibition complex on long island \" smackdown at the mack. \" it starts at 9pm edt and will last 90 minutes. The boston globe looks at what makes this debate different from any other. Among other things, it involves a woman versus a man for the first time, and it features two of the most disliked candidates in american history. The washington post's debate preview looks at clinton's preparations — sources say there has been a lot of focus on trump's personality — and notes that much will depend on whether the \" freewheeling showman \" trump shows up or the \" sober and scripted \" version. Either way, this will be his first one-on-one debate. Jim newell at slate lists three ways that he thinks trump can be beaten in a debate. One tip: \" ask him to explain anything. \" kimberley strassel at the wall street journal has some do's and don'ts for trump. She believes this debate could \" give him new momentum toward the white house \" if he stays calm — and stays positive. Politico notes that the pressure on both candidates will be at its fiercest in the first 30 minutes, a time in which most debates are won and lost — and when candidates tend to roll out their best one-liners.",

Three sources tell bloomberg that although equifax learned of the intrusion in late july, the company knew of another breach as early as march, and one source says the same hackers were responsible ( equifax says the two breaches aren't related ). Equifax reportedly hired security firm mandiant to handle the first breach, then brought mandiant back when the second breach was found. Equifax says the breach it found in july, which was revealed to the public on sept. 7, happened in mid-may, per mandiant investigators. As for the march breach to a business-services unit, \" the incident was reported to customers, affected individuals, and regulators, \" equifax says, per cbs news. Security experts tell bloomberg the march breach may not have been publicized because, if an inquiry found that data wasn't accessed, disclosure laws may not have required it. One source says it appears the investigation was completed in may — right around the time the second hack is said to have taken place. How thorough that initial probe was, and how well equifax protected against future breaches in its wake, will now likely be examined. Bloomberg notes this new development could worsen matters for the three execs who dumped equifax shares, especially if it's determined they did so with knowledge that either breach could hurt the company. The revelation could also serve as new ammunition for the multiple lawsuits filed against equifax on the first breach, which exposed information such as consumers'social security and driver's license numbers.",

A new study out of oregon state university lays out the microplastic problem in our oceans, freshwater lakes, and rivers, which it partly blames on tiny microbeads — the tiny plastic balls in products like face washes and toothpaste that make their way into waterways and may be lethal to animals. Researchers say some 8 trillion microbeads, enough to cover 300 tennis courts, enter water habitats in the us every day. But that's just 1 % of the microbeads floating around. The other 99 %, or 800 trillion microbeads, end up in sewage plants and are spread on land before reaching streams and oceans via runoff, according to a release. There is some good news: there are nontoxic and biodegradable alternatives for microbeads, but companies need to start using them. \" we've demonstrated in previous studies that microplastic of the same type, size, and shape as many microbeads can transfer contaminants to animals and cause toxic effects, \" says a study author who calls for an outright ban on microbeads. The international business times notes that illinois, michigan, minnesota, washington, oregon, and california regulate or ban their use conditionally, but in some cases, microbeads are only prohibited in \" rinse off \" products, which don't include deodorants and cleaners. \" biodegradable \" microbeads are also allowed, though they may break down only slightly. Recent studies show 90 % of seabirds and half of sea turtles have eaten plastic, adds the washington post. ( a 20-year-old thinks he can fix the plastic problem. )",

Selling in mega-cap tech stocks also put pressure on major indexes. The dow jones industrial average slid more than 2.5 %, or 620 points, while the benchmark s&p; 500 dropped as much as 2 %. The comparatively tech-heavy nasdaq 100 saw deeper weakness, falling more than 2.8 % at its intraday low. Perhaps the biggest overhang on investor sentiment on tuesday was the 10-year's breach of 3 %, which market experts had pinpointed as a worrisome threshold. The fear is that higher yields will dampen spending as consumers and companies allocate more to repaying debt. The 10-year is a benchmark for mortgage rates. Stock investors in particular are keenly aware of where the 10-year is trading, as it helps inform the federal reserve's monetary-tightening schedule. Any sign the central bank will raise interest rates faster than expected is viewed as negative",

Four orders of nuns that invest with goldman sachs have all signed on to a proposal demanding the bank review its compensation policy, the guardian reports. The nuns are pushing the board to review and report on whether compensation is \"excessive, \" and on how it relates to \"sizable layoffs and the level of pay of our lowest paid workers. \" goldman says it ' ll fight the proposal, saying shareholders already have access to plenty of data on the company's compensation practices. \"our board believes that the preparation of the requested report would be a distraction, \" it says. Goldman paid out $ 69.5 million to its top five executives last year, including blankfein's aforementioned $ 19 million payday. Goldman's shareprice was relatively flat on the year, bloomberg notes, but pay shot up because executives resumed paying themselves cash bonuses, after a two-year hiatus.
