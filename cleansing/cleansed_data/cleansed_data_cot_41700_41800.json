Lucas jackson/reuters the shooting of unarmed black teenager michael brown by a white police officer in ferguson, missouri, and the anger poured out in response by ferguson's mostly black population, has snapped the issue of race into national focus. The incident has precipitated a much larger conversation, causing many americans to question just how far racial equality and race relations have come, even in an era of a black president and a black attorney general. Polls since the incident demonstrate that black and white americans see this incident very differently. A huffington post/yougov poll finds that while americans overall are divided over whether brown's shooting was an isolated incident ( 35 percent ) or part of a broader pattern in the way police treat black men ( 39 percent ), this balance of opinion dissipates when broken down by race. More than three-quarters ( 76 percent ) of black respondents say that the shooting is part of a broader pattern, nearly double the number of whites who agree ( 40 percent ). Similarly, a pew research center poll found that overall the country is divided over whether brown's shooting \"raises important issues about race that need to be discussed \" ( 44 percent ) or whether"

Arlington fire chief tory gallante says the firefighters ' union recently asked to put flags on their trucks and gallante approved the plan after the flags were properly secured and \" checked by our mechanics. \" but then the board of fire commissioners got word. During a monday meeting — in which the board approved out-of-state training for firefighters, two new engines or pumpers, and new patches for uniforms — three of five board members objected to the flags \" citing liability and distraction to other motorists, \" board chairman jim beretta tells the poughkeepsie journal. The trucks already carry american flag stickers and \" we were clear that we had no problem with them or with flags being mounted … for parades and ceremonies, \" says beretta. But union president joseph tarquinio says the board's decision is \" next to flag-burning in my mind, \" adding support for the firefighters has poured in from across the country. Beretta says he has offered to meet with gallante and other firefighters to discuss \" how we might come to a compromise, some solution, \" possibly wednesday. Last month, firefighters in california were asked to remove an american flag in honor of fallen police officers from a truck for fear it would block its lights or make firefighters targets of violence, reports nbc los angeles.",

Now, a proposed ordinance wants him to videotape each sale and give police weekly reports on ammunition sales, reports fox news. \" i ' m not doing that to our customers. Enough is enough, \" alcairo tells the ap. \" next year will probably be something else. Buying a gun is a constitutionally protected right. Our customers shouldn't be treated like they're doing something wrong. \" alcairo says he sells thousands of guns each year, but customers stopped coming after the proposed laws were announced, believing they had already been put on the books, per the san francisco examiner.

        "summary": "They didn't want cheese on their quarter pounders. They claim they had to pay for it anyway — a cost of up to $ 1 — and now want $ 5 million for the trouble. That's according to a new lawsuit filed by two florida residents against mcdonald's, which should be used to such fights by now. It came after leonard werner says he realized mcdonald's was repeatedly charging him for a quarter pounder with cheese, but giving him a cheese-less sandwich, as he requested. \" i started talking with some lawyer friends, saying, ' what's the deal? they can charge for something i didn't get? ' it's not right, \" werner says, per the south florida sun-sentinel. According to werner, mcdonald's restaurant menus no longer feature a cheese-less quarter pounder, but its app menu does, at a reduced cost of 30 cents to $ 1. Restaurant customers are therefore \" being forced to pay for two slices of cheese, which they do not want, order, or receive, to be able to purchase their desired product, \" the suit says. One of the attorneys who filed the suit, which is seeking class-action status, explains people who order a big mac with items left off \" are not entitled to a credit against the purchase price \" because the burger is trademarked according to its ingredients, per the miami herald. He says that's not the case with the quarter pounder, since a cheese-less option is sold. Another lawyer involved says up to 25 million customers may have been overcharged and could be eligible to receive $ 10 and a free sandwich should a judge side with the plaintiffs. Mcdonald's doesn't expect that to happen, claiming the suit is without legal merit. ( read about another person who had a problem with mcdonald's. )",

A lawsuit by cynthia kissner of broward county and leonard werner of miami-dade county was filed earlier this month in u.s district court in fort lauderdale and seeks class action status. Werner says he decided to cut down on the amount of dairy in his diet awhile back and started ordering quarter pounders without cheese. After a couple of visits to mcdonald's, he started noticing he was still being charged for the cheesy versions. \"i started talking with some lawyer friends, saying, 'what's the deal? they can charge for something i didn't get?

But the cheese-less sandwiches are still available at reduced prices for customers who order them via mcdonald's mobile app or through a third-party delivery services, says the suit, which was filed by andrew t. Lavin of miami-based lavin law group p.a. \"notwithstanding the availability of quarter pounders and double quarter pounders, customers have been forced, and continue to be overcharged for these products, by being forced to pay for two slices of cheese, which they do not want, order, or receive, to be able to purchase their desired product, \" the suit says. The lawsuit accuses the company of unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment. It states that mcdonald's typically charges between 20 cents and 40 cents to add cheese to one of their standard products. On its mobile app, a plain quarter pounder is priced between 30 cents and 90 cents less than the quarter pounder with cheese, while a double quarter pounder is 80 cents less without cheese, the suit says. Attorney russell b. Adler of adler law center in fort lauderdale, a member of the legal team that filed the suit, said he estimates as many as 25 million consumers might have been overcharged.

Thirty-three years ago in june, argentina surrendered to great britain, ending the falklands war. I was covering the conflict from argentina and uruguay for cbs news. After learning of the surrender, angry mobs in buenos aires stormed the presidential palace — the casa rosada — trying to overthrow the government of general leopoldo galtieri. I was there on the street with my camera crews. The violence was horrific, as argentine soldiers fired into the crowd, who were responding with violent acts of their own. My video of the combat led the cbs evening news with dan rather that evening and, later on, i filed a report that ran nationwide. That's what happened. I never said i was on the falkland islands, as corn purports. I said i covered the falklands war, which i did. \" corn begs to differ, citing examples including o'reilly's own 2001 book in which he writes, \" i've reported on the ground in active war zones from el salvador to the falklands. \" you can read the transcript of o'reilly's remarks here, and corn's annotated response here.",

        "summary": "Donald trump made it official friday: indiana gov. Mike pence will be his running mate when he attempts to stop another clinton from sitting in the white house this november. Here's what you need to know about the vice presidential candidate: nbc news explains some of the key disagreements between trump and pence, including pence calling plans to ban muslims from the us \" offensive, \" his recent reluctance to support trump's border wall, and him saying trump's attacks on a judge over his \" mexican heritage \" were \" inappropriate. \" as governor, pence signed an anti-abortion bill that \" would have basically forced women to seek funerary services for a fetus \" following abortions or even miscarriages, vox reports. The law, which was blocked by a federal judge, called for women to bury or cremate any and all fetal tissue. The washington post looks into one of the most controversial moments of pence's political career — a religious freedom bill he signed in 2015 allowing businesses to refuse service to gay people. Before he modified it, the measure nearly resulted in the ncaa leaving indiana and taking the final four with it. Pence is \" really conservative and mostly unknown, \" fivethirtyeight concludes. And many of those who do know of him have an unfavorable view of him, as he's relatively unpopular compared to vice presidential picks dating back to 1976. The new york times has a helpful list of pence's positions on the issues, including his opposition to gay rights, gun control, and amnesty for illegal immigrants and his support for increased military spending. Se cupp writes for cnn that pence, of whom she was once a big fan, agreeing to be trump's running mate will wreck his political future. He will either \"wither in irrelevance \" under an \"unpredictable, egomaniacal political neophyte \" or he, along with trump, \"will crash in spectacular fashion \" while losing the election. An editorial at the new york post calls pence a great pick for trump. \"skeptics believe trump has still to prove himself as worthy of being president. With pence as his vice-presidential pick, he has proved himself yet again. \" finally, the week just tries to make sense of the whole thing, arguing that pence doesn't really help trump much and is likely to \" excite more hatred from the left than affection from the right. \"",

The unnamed guy ( police, amusingly, describe him as \" an angry landscaper, \" per news.com.au ), apparently angry at the pm's group for cutting ahead in line at the bar during a \" meet the locals \" event near brisbane thursday night, was photographed flipping the bird behind turnbull's head. He allegedly \" became abusive to a group at the bar due to the group being served before him, \" police say, per the guardian. According to news.com.au, turnbull's security detail pushed the man away from the pm; shopping center security guards detained him; and ultimately police were called. The man, who's reportedly 26 or 27 years old, was fined for \" failing to leave a licensed premises. \" former aussie pol sam dastyari decided to help the guy out: \" i found the bloke who got fined $ 250 for telling the pm to piss off.

While parents with big families did have issues — like people asking if the kids had multiple fathers — they were still the most satisfied. Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but \" they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate, \" she says. Second-happiest ( by a razor-thin margin of 0.25 % ) were lgbt parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, ivf, or adoption. \" these children are not accidents... So the child is very much desired, \" says harmon. The least happy in her still-unpublished study were single dads, who she says are often seen as lesser parents and struggle to play a role in their childrens ' lives. \" there is this perception that mothers are the real parents and fathers just sort of help, \" harmon tells the sydney morning herald.

Ocean maritime management was last year blacklisted by the un security council following a 2013 discovery of two fighter jets ( among other things ) hidden under a cargo of sugar on one of its ships; it was a violation of the un arms embargo imposed in response to north korea's nuclear and missile programs. Omm has since renamed all but one of its vessels in an attempt to evade the sanctions, along with transferring ownership to shell companies, reports the bbc and reuters. Us ambassador samantha power said that imposing a global asset freeze on omm meant that the company would no longer be able to operate internationally. But the new report says 12 of the ships \" reportedly stayed, visited, or were sighted near ports in foreign countries, \" and none were frozen by member states as the panel of experts recommended. The report describes omm's global reach as a broad one, encompassing brazil, china, egypt, greece, japan, malaysia, peru, russia, singapore, and thailand. The panel recommends blacklisting 34 omm shell companies and five shipping executives. The un security council will hold consultations on the new report today, the ap notes.",

Trump offered a hesitant \" yes, but go ahead, give me a little, go ahead, tell me. \" when hewitt continued with, \" he runs the quds forces, \" trump replied, \" yes, ok, right, \" before then jumping into how \" the kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated by us. \" hewitt had to point out he meant the quds, not the middle eastern ethnic group, then pressed trump on the names of those who run hezbollah, al-qaeda, the nusra front, and isis. Trump seemed dismissive, telling hewitt, \" i knew you were going to ask me things like this \" and adding it didn't matter who was in charge of these groups since he'd get rid of them as president. He also said he considered these \" gotcha \" questions and that it would be \" ridiculous \" if hewitt brings them up again when he moderates the next gop debate later this month. Who did answer many of hewitt's questions with more accuracy: carly fiorina, whom the host interviewed in the same episode, the paper notes. Trump seemed to recover his confidence midway through the spot, however, telling hewitt that if he becomes president, \" i will be so good at the military, your head will spin, \" the new york times notes.",

Dustin hinkle tells kcnc-tv ( https://goo.gl/djszvb ) that he and a couple of friends were making a parkour video on the roof of the denver city lofts on thursday when he fell through a chimney cover. Parkour involves moving from point to point using obstacles along the way. Hinkle plummeted down the old incineration chimney until a cable caught his fall. He was stuck for nearly two hours until firefighters broke through a brick wall to get him out. Hinkle, who along with his friends is facing a trespassing charge, says he thought he was going to die and he didn't believe in god until he survived the fall. The denver post reports that jail records show hinkle is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 170 pounds. Denver fire department spokeswoman melissa taylor told the post: \" it appeared to me to be a pretty small chimney. \" ___ information from: kcnc-tv, http://www.cbsdenver.com",

            "The trump interior department announced thursday plans to offer blocks in the arctic, atlantic and pacific oceans for oil and gas exploration in an ambitious new five-year offshore lease plan. Interior secretary ryan zinke said the draft proposal for offshore leasing between 2019 and 2024 would offer about 90 percent of the u.s. Outer continental shelf, the largest lease sale ever. The only area that will not be included is the north aleutian basin in alaska. The plan would open the door for drilling in areas far beyond the u.s.

But the move also sets up a battle with environmental groups and coastal governors opposed to drilling off the shores of states from california to north carolina. Additionally, it comes at a time when oil prices are on the rise, but stuck in a range that makes multibillion-dollar projects in new offshore areas unattractive for many drillers.

The judge said sforza seemed \" heartfelt and credible \" as she described receiving harassing calls in the middle of the night after she quit working for day — who runs a witch shop in salem — and opened one of her own, per the boston globe. \" he called me the c-word, \" she testified. \" on everything that is holy, i did not make those calls, \" day said, then stormed out of the courtroom and promised to file an appeal. Earlier, he asked the judge to delay the hearing because his lawyer was sick and \" throwing up on his suit. \" he said he found a lawyer in a courtroom hallway, though the man had just two hours to prepare. The lawyer argued sforza was like donald trump — a public figure who could be ridiculed online. The judge agreed online comments are protected speech but said he was concerned by the calls. Day later admitted he'd been ordered to stop harassing other women in the past, but said there was no evidence linking him to the calls made to sforza. \" this is a business dispute and everything she said about me is a lie, \" he said. \" when i have something to say, i say it to your face. \"",

            "The video above – from greg hogan of kathleen, georgia – shows the fast movement over 28 minutes of green comet 45p/honda-mrkos-pajdušáková – which swept closest to earth on february 11, 2017, temporarily becoming the most famous comet that practically nobody saw. Its closest point was around 8 utc on saturday, at which time the comet was 0.08 au ( 7.4 million miles, about 12 million km, or some 30 times the moon's distance ) from the earth. Experienced observers and astrophotographers, used to finding faint objects in the sky, had a shot at seeing it, although they had to contend with this weekend's bright moon. The estimated brightness of comet 45p/honda-mrkos-pajdušáková at its closest and brightest was magnitude +7. That's well outside the limit for visibility with the unaided eye. What's more, a diffuse object, like a comet, is even tougher to see at that magnitude, or any magnitude. The comet is still around, but an extremely dark sky and optical aid ( at least binoculars, probably a telescope ) are needed to see it. On the other hand, we are beginning to see a few photographs of comet 45p, and we're hoping we ' ll see more in the days ahead.

Yet there's nothing to make law enforcement use the higher setting. Rekognition drew attention in may when the aclu revealed that several law enforcement agencies were using it. Privacy and civil rights groups cried foul, but police liked the price tag ( around $ 12 a month ), and at least one police force kept using it after a trial run, per usa today. Some are concerned about racial bias: 39 % of false positives in the aclu test are people of color, including civil-rights leader john lewis, while people of color comprise only 20 % of congress. Another test of facial-recognition software found higher false positives among blacks and women.

Some prehistoric vessels, however, resemble modern cheesemaking equipment. Thirty years ago, archeologists proposed that sieve-like pots were used to separate the chunky curds from the liquid whey. Those curds could then be worked into cheese. But others thought these sieves may have been used for beer making or to strain honey.

The ap reports that italy's interior minister, marco minniti, says the man killed in a shootout with police is \" without a shadow of a doubt \" anis amri, the 24-year-old tunisian fugitive who was the subject of a europe-wide manhunt. Minniti says amri pulled out a gun when police officers on patrol decided he looked suspicious and asked for his papers, the guardian reports. The minister says one officer was shot by amri and suffered non-life-threatening injuries. He says he called the officer in the hospital to thank him for his service and wish him a merry christmas. A police source tells reuters that fingerprints were used to confirm that the dead man was amri. Reuters'sources say extra police patrols were sent out after a tip that amri might be in the area. The sources say a train ticket found on the body suggests he took a high-speed train from france to turin before taking a local train to the milan area. Paolo gentiloni, who became italy's new prime minister earlier this month, said he called german chancellor angela merkel to tell her amri had been killed. A german interior ministry spokesman said written confirmation hasn't been received yet, but \" should this turn out to be true then the interior ministry is relieved that this person doesn't pose a threat anymore. \"",

He also built off earlier crowdsourced work to solve what's known as the erdos discrepancy problem, which, as new scientist explains, involves \" the properties of an infinite, random sequence of +1s and -1s. \" for the technical minded, nature presents it this way: \" ( paul ) erdos, who died in 1996, speculated that any infinite string of the numbers 1 and −1 could add up to an arbitrarily large ( positive or negative ) value by counting only the numbers at a fixed interval for a finite number of steps. \" for the non-technical minded, the important thing to know is that \" terry tao just dropped a bomb, \" as iowa state university mathematician derrick stolee tweeted the day tao's paper was published on the new open-access journal discrete analysis. Tao, who met and worked with erdos when he was a kid in the 1980s, joined a few dozen mathematicians in 2010 as part of the fifth polymath project to harness the power of many human brains working on blogs and wikis to try to finally crack the code. While they made progress, they ultimately gave up. Then earlier this year, uwe stroinski, a mathematician out of germany, commented on tao's blog that the problem might be linked to what is called the elliott conjecture, which tao at first dismissed as being only superficially similar. But after careful review, \" i realized there was a link, \" tao wrote. He produced the proof less than two weeks later. It still must undergo peer review, but most think that will wrap up quickly. And yes, tao has thanked stroinski for his contribution. ( this billionaire will pay $ 1 million if you solve his 20-year-old conjecture. )",

There have been increasing whispers about that long-anticipated 2016 bush-hillary clinton battle as jeb's advisers are reportedly asking supporters to hold tight and not start backing other candidates just yet, reports the wall street journal. \" he is seriously considering the race and will make a decision sometime after november, \" an adviser says. This despite the fact that his own mom, former first lady barbara bush, told c-span earlier this year that she didn't want him to run, reports forbes. \" if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly, \" she said. His son, jeb bush jr., tells the journal the topic is \" the 800-pound gorilla in the room, \" but it hasn't been discussed by the family. But jeb has been putting out signs that the idea is still viable. Although he hasn't been visiting early-primary states as much as potential competitors have, he's been active on the fundraising trail, with significant events for other gop candidates coming up in florida and chicago over the next few weeks, notes the journal — usually a clue that you're a serious candidate. And it doesn't matter that he's been relatively under the radar: in fact, jennifer rubin writes at the washington post, that's probably intentional.

I wasn't into sexcapades but i did try it once. I had three people in one day. It was a political campaign where everyone was doing the same thing, so i didn't want to be left out. The crowd went wild and oprah looked a little bit frazzled... Or jealous, not sure which. Of her open marriage ( which ended in divorce in 1982 ), maclaine said: i had affairs and so did he, but we were very good friends. I loved the freedom and so did he. I've had an awful lot of lovers... And a lot of awful lovers. Wow, hollywood today seems downright prudish in comparison to what was going on in maclaine's heyday. She did say as a rule, she was into monogamy. She also gave oprah a tour of her new mexico home, which is gorgeous, and showed the balcony from which she watches ufos. And just when she had me wondering why she gets such a bad rap for being crazy... The book covers a host of random topics that she's gotten over, and things she's not. One thing she says she ' ll never get over: good lighting. At night, choose a restaurant with candlelit tables. Even ask for another candle. Claim you can't see the menu. Never sit where there is an overhead light. It makes you look like grandma moses. And never sit where you can feel a cross-light splash across your face. A 2-year-old looks haggard in that condition. She is over the paparazzi, but says she has no solution \" except perhaps murder. But then, even paparazzi can be reincarnated. \" as for all the criticism her views"

        "summary": "$ 889 million could buy a good-sized private island or several fighter jets, but can it buy an american election? the billionaire koch brothers appear to believe so. The brothers and a network of hundreds of other wealthy right-wing donors announced the mammoth spending target at a meeting of the freedom partners business lobby group yesterday, reports the washington post. The kochs and their allies are now \" essentially their own political party, \" writes andy kroll at mother jones, noting that $ 889 million, or close to $ 4 for every american of voting age, is around as much as each nominee is expected to spend in 2016. It's also $ 250 million more than the gop spent in 2012, and more than the combined spend of george w. Bush and john kerry's campaigns in 2004. Freedom partners says its goal is to promote free-market ideals in american society, and politics is just one of several ways of doing so. It's not clear whether the group plans to spend any of the cash on the gop primaries. Three potential 2016 contenders, sens. Rand paul, marco rubio, and ted cruz, took part in a panel discussion at the conference where they shrugged off a question about the influence of money on politics, the post reports. Cruz called it \" grotesque and offensive \" that some democrats apparently consider the kochs \" the nexus of all evil in the world. \" ( the deep-pocketed brothers are also funding an initiative to win hispanic voters over to the conservative cause. )",

Pier luigi bersani's center-left bloc has narrowly beaten silvio berlusconi's right-wing coalition to win control of the lower house, but failed to win a majority in the senate — leaving italy likely to face a hung parliament for the first time in its history, reuters reports. Comedian-turned-politician beppe grillo's anti-establishment 5-star movement captured around a quarter of the vote, a stunning result that makes it the single largest party in the lower house. Control of both houses is needed to form a stable government and although bersani's coalition won the most seats in the senate, it looks as if it will be unable to pass laws without the consent of grillo's anti-eu, anti-austerity movement, der spiegel reports.

Activists, however, are calling attention to a \" pivotal moment for el salvador's abortion law reform \" after a welcome move tuesday. After serving 15 years of a 30-year sentence for the aggravated murder of her child, who she says was stillborn, maira verónica figueroa marroquín had her sentence commuted by the supreme court and was released from prison, reports reuters. The 34-year-old maintains she suffered a late-term miscarriage in 2003 while working as a maid, per the bbc. \" i ' m going to start again and make up for lost time, \" she's quoted as saying. \" i want to study law to understand what happened to me and help other women. \" and there are many more to be helped. Figueroa's release follows that of 34-year-old teodora del carmen vásquez, whose own 30-year sentence for aggravated murder was commuted a month ago after she served 10 years for what she claimed was a stillbirth experienced while working as a school cafeteria cook in the last month of her pregnancy, reports the new york times. But at least 27 women remain in prison in el salvador for violating the abortion ban, according to the center for reproductive rights. In an op-ed at reuters, crr rep catalina martínez coral notes el salvador is now \" at a pivot point, \" with congress entertaining two bills that would allow abortion in limited cases, including where pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health or results from rape.",

Dr. Bhaskar bora, 41, faces misconduct charges for failing to conduct a proper examination before inserting the coil. The woman, who is in her 30s and was not identified, told a medical tribunal on wednesday that she went to see bora in august 2011 when she was experiencing an extended period and severe pains. She says bora asked her \" if i had any stress in my life \" and \" if i ate spicy food, \" but didn't ask for her medical history. She never heard back after an ultrasound. She returned in march 2012 with heavy bleeding, and bora told her she suffered from fibroids and suggested she try the coil to stop the bleeding. She says he never asked if she was pregnant. The bleeding didn't ease and the woman later miscarried in stages. Bora says, per the sun, that he took a medical history from the patient but admits he didn't do a pregnancy test. Millions of women use the mirena coil, which is more than 99 % effective in preventing pregnancy, per britain's national health service.

            "A woman can get pregnant if a man's sperm reaches one of her eggs ( ova ). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the ius, or intrauterine system ( sometimes called the hormonal coil ). An ius is a small, t-shaped plastic device that is inserted into your womb ( uterus ) by a specially trained doctor or nurse. The ius releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This thickens the mucus from your cervix, making it difficult for sperm to move through and reach an egg. It also thins the womb lining so that it's less likely to accept a fertilised egg. It may also stop ovulation ( the release of an egg ) in some women. The ius is a long-acting reversible contraceptive ( larc ) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of ius are used in the uk – mirena and jaydess. You can use an ius whether or not you've had children. At a glance: facts about the ius it's more than 99 % effective.

It reveals just 3 % of american adults own half of the country's 265 million firearms. These 7.7 million \" super-owners \" own an average of 17 guns each, though some have up to 140, according to the online survey of 4,000 out of harvard and northeastern universities, to be published next year. However, the majority of america's 55 million gun owners — who tend to be white, male, conservative, and living in rural areas — own between one and three guns, per the guardian, and it's these individuals who researchers believe could limit the number of gun deaths each year. If they change \" the ways in which they store [ guns ], or their decision-making, we could have a really big impact on suicide, \" which accounts for two-thirds of gun deaths annually, the lead author explains. Gun owners have actually decreased from 25 % to 22 % since the last major study in 1994; male gun owners are down 10 %, while female owners are up about 3 %. However, the number of guns in the country has risen by 70 million. Handgun ownership has increased in particular, especially among women, suggesting the motivation is self-defense. The weird part: researchers blame an \" increasing fearfulness \" that isn't quite justified since gun violence rates are falling and the country is generally getting safer.",

        "summary": "Bernie sanders and donald trump won big in new hampshire on tuesday, putting their parties in uncharted territory, which the gop establishment in particular could find tricky to navigate. Here's what analysts expect to see in the days leading up to the nevada caucuses — which are on feb. 20 for democrats and feb. 23 for republicans — and the south carolina primary, which happens on feb. 20 for republicans and feb. 27 for democrats. Race will become a big issue for the democrats. Outside iowa and new hampshire, \" the democratic party is 44 % non-white, \" and sanders has yet to show that he can take those votes away from hillary clinton, analyst joe trippi tells politico. But the senator from vermont is trying: his first campaign stop on wednesday is breakfast with the rev. Al sharpton in harlem. The gop \" establishment lane \" will remain crowded. Even if chris christie's \" hard thinking \" leads to him dropping out, jeb bush, marco rubio, and john kasich are expected to keep jostling for the votes of republicans turned off by trump and ted cruz. Jeb bush, who came close to a third-place finish in new hampshire, told supporters tuesday night that they had \" reset things, \" the hill reports. Trump will have to answer questions on the military. With eight military bases in south carolina, military issues are big, meaning trump can expect rivals to target his opposition to increasing military spending and his vietnam-era draft deferments, the new york times reports. \" the commander-in-chief question is going to be a big one, \" senior bush adviser jim dyke says. \" if you look at exit polls from 2008 and 2012, in both elections about 25 % identified as active military or had served in the military. \" john kasich will come under attack. The ohio governor, who said he would drop out if he performed poorly in new hampshire, is now a target because of his second-place finish, which could test his resolve to keep his campaign positive, predicts the washington post. His rivals are expected to lay into his moderate positions on immigration and health care. There will be some gop last stands. South carolina is expected to finish off a few campaigns, probably including that of carly fiorina, who won't qualify for saturday's republican debate, cnn reports. Ben carson campaign director bob dees, however, says there is zero chance of his guy dropping out in the weeks to come, reports the guardian, which notes that carson's support has nosedived amid concerns over his foreign policy knowledge and \" latterly, availability of laundered clothing and",

Investigators say they have \" significant \" video from a home security system believed to show the three suspects that gliniewicz described only as two white men and one black man before he was killed, reports the chicago tribune. The lead investigator says the video has been turned over to homeland security, which has the proper equipment to view it. A gun has also been recovered from the crime scene in the chicago suburb of fox lake, and sources tell cnn that it belongs to the slain officer and it was fired the morning he was killed. The manhunt, the biggest illinois has seen in years, was sidetracked yesterday by a woman in the nearby community of volo who claimed three men — two white, one black — had tried to steal her car, abc7 reports. Authorities say that after 100 officers spent five hours searching the area, 30-year-old nanny kristin kiefer admitted making the whole thing up for attention and was charged with disorderly conduct and falsifying a police report.

            "On sunday, the country marked 100 days since a man wielding a semiautomatic bushmaster assault rifle killed 20 young children and 6 faculty members at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, conn. Just days earlier, on march 19, senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev., announced that he would not include a ban on military-style assault weapons - like the rifle used by the killer at sandy hook - in the senate's upcoming gun bill and would focus instead on other gun laws that stood a better chance of passage. Disappointed supporters of the ban mostly moved on, fixing their sights on lower-hanging fruit. The proposal most likely to make its way to the president's desk is a bill strengthening penalties for illegal gun trafficking. Beyond that, the lift gets much heavier.

The brick chemical hearth — one of the only remaining in the world — had been accidentally preserved since being walled off in the 1840s. \" just because of luck and geometry of the building, because it was bricked up, it survived the major fire in 1895, \" project manager matt schiedt says. \" it survived the major renovation in the 1970s, mostly because people didn't know it was there. \" according to the christian science monitor, the hearth could give new insight into how chemistry was taught when it was built in the 1820s. One university of virginia official thinks jefferson, who founded the school, built the lab for john emmet, its first professor of natural history, the dispatch tribunal reports. According to the monitor, jefferson specified the size and location of the lab and worked with emmet to equip it. The main chemical hearth had two fireboxes, one for wood and one for coal, where the professor would do his demonstrations. Students would work at five stations cut into stone countertops, the dispatch tribunal reports. \" for the professor of chemistry, such experiments as require the use of furnaces, cannot be exhibited in his ordinary lecturing room, \" jefferson wrote in an 1823 letter. \" we therefore prepare the rooms... For furnaces, stoves, etc. \" the hearth will be preserved in the university's visitor center. ( thomas jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers really liked to drink. )",

But the surveillance instrument used by the tallahassee pd since 2007 is worrying the aclu, judges, and citizens who say it's a violation of civil rights and the fourth amendment, the washington post reports. These so-called cell-site or cell-tower simulators ( also known as imsi catchers and often sold under the stingray brand ) trick cellphones within range into connecting to them as they would to an actual cellphone tower; police may then potentially access location and communication data from any of the \" fooled \" phones, as per the post. However, when the device is flicked on, service to other phones may be disrupted, batteries drain more quickly, and info is culled from not just the suspect, but also other phones in range. The aclu reports that florida law enforcement agencies have spent more than $ 3 million on this equipment since 2008, and it's spread beyond the sunshine state: the organization has been able to id 48 agencies in 20 states and dc that own the simulators. Although the tallahassee pd and fbi say the unit can only be used with a court order ( and they don't collect call content or text messages with it ), judges, attorneys, and the public are creeped out by the secrecy: cops often cite an fbi \" nondisclosure agreement \" and refuse to explain how the technology works, saying it will compromise the device's efficacy, the post notes. However, a public defender who took on the case of an 18-year-old busted via the device for robbery called the \" scooping up [ of ] all manner of information from a target cellphone, as well as nearly all cellphones in the general area \" nothing more than \" exploratory rummaging. \" click for the full report.",

Now, not one but two guilty verdicts in the case. The bbc reports two of the girl's uncles were on tuesday convicted of raping the girl and will be sentenced thursday; they could be handed life sentences, reports the hindustan times. The girl had named her rapist, an uncle in his 40s, in testimony given via video. That uncle reportedly confessed to his crimes to both the police and the girl's father. But the dna ultimately showed he hadn't fathered the child. That of his younger brother, who was arrested in september, did. The hindustan times reports she reportedly didn't provide the name of the younger uncle because he allegedly threatened to kill her parents if she did so. The 10-year-old was told she had a large stone in her stomach that required surgery and was unaware she gave birth to a baby girl, who is in the custody of child welfare officials who will arrange her adoption.",

        "summary": "The us has budgeted $ 52.6 billion on its intelligence operations this year, according to classified documents edward snowden leaked to the washington post. Yet those operations are, by their own assessment, doing a less-than-spectacular job on a host of critical intelligence questions. Here are some highlights of the post's analysis of the so-called \" black budget. \" if you add in another $ 23 billion devoted to military intelligence programs, the us now spends more on intelligence than it is estimated to have spent at the height of the cold war. The cia has surged past the nsa to become the priciest agency, requesting $ 14.7 billion in 2013 compared to the nsa's $ 10.8 billion. That's in part because the cia has reinvented itself since 9/11 into a paramilitary organization. Of the $ 4.9 billion spy agencies spent in iraq and afghanistan, half came from the cia. The intelligence committee rates itself in the budget, saying that in 2011 it made \" moderate progress \" on only 38 of its 50 top counterterrorism gaps. It acknowledged a host of other critical gaps in us knowledge as well, including the security surrounding pakistan and north korea's nuclear programs, the capabilities of china's new aircraft, and biological and chemical weapons in russia, pakistan, and in general. Us intelligence is particularly perplexed by the threat of home-grown terrorists. The report, written a year before the boston marathon bombings, calls it one of \" the more challenging intelligence gaps. \" israel appears on the list of countries that counterintelligence operations are \" strategically focused against, \" alongside more expected names like iran, china, russia, and cuba. The nsa and cia are expanding aggressively into \" offensive cyber operations \" designed to steal information from and sabotage foreign computer networks. Indeed, the budget details so many sensitive methods and cutting-edge techniques that the post has posted only a general overview of it, which you can see here. Former house intelligence committee chairman lee hamilton praised the leak as important, saying it represents the public's first real look at the cost of the post-9/11 intelligence buildup. \" much of the work that the intelligence community does has a profound impact on the life of ordinary americans, and they ought not to be excluded from the process, \" hamilton argues.",

The mid-19th-century replica was sold last wednesday in an auction that lasted just 2 minutes, with a french multimillionaire named christophe février snapping it up for $ 9,300. That's a relative bargain, per the new york times, which reports that the same 10-foot-tall guillotine was purchased by an unnamed russian in 2011. His winning € 223,000 bid is about $ 260,000 at today's rates, and exceeded the offer made by rival bidder lady gaga, reports the times of london, which notes experts at the time held that the guillotine had actually been used in executions. Subsequent tests showed that was not the case. But the russian's purchase came with a problem: france doesn't permit the import or export of instruments of torture, so the guillotine remained in a paris jazz club until the club's recent bankruptcy. ( the bbc fills in the timeline, explaining the jazz club took over a space formerly occupied by a museum of torture. ) france's auction watchdog was not pleased, with a rep saying the sale shouldn't have occurred: \" objects like the clothes of people who were deported to the ( nazi death ) camps and instruments of torture are sensitive. \" but it was unable to stop the court-ordered auction. Février himself is sensitive about where he will display what he describes \" as a historic symbol tied to the common heritage of humanity \": \" as a father of four, i don't want to exhibit it in a family setting, \" he tells the times.

Seeley is the co-author of a study published in the european journal of applied physiology that may upend what we thought we knew about running's effect on knees. Conventional wisdom says running is hard on the knee joints, deteriorating cartilage and causing arthritis, the new york times reports. While recent studies have shown that runners tend to be less likely to develop arthritis in the knees as they age, scientists have largely chalked that up to the fact that runners also tend to weigh less than the rest of the population. But the new study out of brigham young university gives evidence that running may actually change the biochemistry of the knee to protect against inflammation and arthritis. In an admittedly small study of six runners, researchers looked at proteins and cells in knee fluid associated with inflammation after 30 minutes of running, sitting, or non-knee-intensive exercise, canadian running magazine reports. They found that just half an hour of running was enough to reduce the risk factors of inflammation in knees. On the flip side, sitting around for half an hour increased risk factors for inflammation. ( non-knee-intensive exercise — elliptical, cycling, etc. — had no effect. ) it also appears that the longer a person runs, the less risk they're at for inflammation of the knees.

The crew \" told the passengers to stay put, but they themselves became the first to escape, after deserting the passengers, \" park said. \" legally and ethically, this is an unimaginable act. \" four more crew members have been detained in the incident, fox news reports. Meanwhile, a transcript is revealing a more complete story of the tragedy: half an hour after the ship sent out a distress call, emergency personnel radioed that the coast guard would be on the scene \" in 15 minutes \" and the crew should ensure passengers were wearing life jackets, the new york times reports. \" if our passengers evacuate, will they be immediately rescued? \" the ship replied. \" let them float even with life rings. Hurry! \" dispatchers said. But they added that the \" final decision \" on evacuation was the captain's. It remains unclear what caused the disaster, but the final steering shift went to a 26-year-old shipmate who'd never taken on the dangerous path before. Park han-gyeol had only been with the company for six months. Another potential problem: some of the cargo had apparently come loose, said a helmsman. That helmsman, oh yong-seok, 58, headed to the pilothouse after being awakened at 8: 48am when he was thrown into a wall by the tilting ship. \" the ship was already listing so heavily everyone was hanging onto whatever they could grab, \" he said. As for the question of evacuation, a communications officer says he didn't receive orders to tell passengers to leave; a crew member says the order was given, but he never heard it broadcast to those on board, the times reports. One announcement, however, told passengers to stay in place. \" i didn't have time to look at the manual but i thought i should calm people down first, \" he said.

In some cases, their quite tepid support: the deal \" isn't everything i'd hoped it would be, and it isn't what i would have written, \" reads orrin hatch's statement, per the washington post. \" but sometimes the answer has to be yes. \" along with the backing of john mccain and at least five other republicans, the senate advanced the measure over a filibuster threshold on a 67-33 vote, the ap reports. That means it will pass the senate no later than tomorrow and head to the white house for president obama's signature. The bipartisan paul ryan-patty murray deal ran into trouble with the senate despite easily passing the house, thanks to what the post refers to as \" a slew of tea party heroes \" raising issues with it. Even many democrats have problems with the bill, particularly because it doesn't renew unemployment benefits for more than a million people, cnn reports. But the deal means two blissful years of no government shutdown threats, the guardian reports. Even so, don't get comfortable: the next battle will be over the debt ceiling, the wall street journal reports. The treasury says it should be raised by early march in order to avoid a government default, and conservatives want to try and get whatever they can in return. Then again, some think it may not be worth the potential bad press; plus, obama has repeatedly said he won't negotiate.",

He said he had never met mr. Kushner. In negotiating the deal with kushner companies, mr. Markman said, he worked with laurent morali, the firm's president.

        "summary": "Last year, mitsubishi confessed it had fudged fuel tests for the past 25 years. Now a new admission adds to japan's list of corporate controversies, not just from mitsubishi, but also from other major manufacturers. Cnnmoney reports mitsubishi materials admitted in a statement thursday at least two of its subsidiaries — mitsubishi cable industries and mitsubishi shindoh — finagled data for cars, aircraft, and industrial machinery to meet client specs. Reuters notes a third subsidiary, mitsubishi aluminum co., was also included. And mitsubishi cable, which faked data for about 270 million rubber sealant units sold to more than 220 clients, may have continued to falsify info even after it had been uncovered. The parent company says it hasn't found any legal or safety issues in regard to the first two subsidiaries mentioned; it's unclear if the same applies to mitsubishi aluminum. The country's economy and trade minister calls the development \" a betrayal of trust in japanese manufacturing. \" the wall street journal reports mitsubishi cable found out in february that factory workers had messed with the data, but it kept shipping products until the end of october as it investigated. Mitsubushi materials says affected parts were mostly distributed in japan, but some customers were located in china, and others may have been in the us. Other recent manufacturer scandals in japan include kobe steel getting busted for manipulating inspection data on metals, as well as nissan and subaru taking heat for conducting improper vehicle inspections. All of this has led to what the journal calls real \" soul-searching \" in japan about how corporations are overseen by the government. Meanwhile, mitsubishi shares fell by as much as 11 % friday, per the bbc.",
