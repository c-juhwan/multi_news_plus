But when the leader of caldwell's \" information operations \" unit tried to oppose the plan, he later found himself the subject of a military investigation accusing him of unrelated inappropriate conduct. \" my job in psy-ops is to play with people's heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave, \" said io leader lt. Colonel michael holmes. \" i ' m prohibited from doing that to our own people. \" ( rolling stone notes that federal law explicitly prohibits the military from practicing psy-ops on its own citizens, and every defense authorization bill features a \" propaganda rider \" that bars such manipulation. ) holmes says caldwell wanted his team to provide a \" deeper analysis of pressure points we could use to leverage the delegation for more funds. \" he says the general's chief of staff wanted to know how caldwell could secretly manipulate lawmakers without them knowing, asking him, \" how do we get these guys to give us more people? what do i have to plant inside their heads? \" caldwell \" categorically denies \" the claim, says a rep.

Castro forced michelle knight to deliver berry's child in a kiddie pool inside the house and threatened to kill knight if the baby died, said the police report. Knight told police that castro impregnated her five times. But each time, she said he gave her little food and punched her in the stomach repeatedly until she miscarried. Castro got all three young women to his home by offering them rides in his car, according to the police report. For instance, he told berry, who was walking home from work in her burger king uniform, that he had a son who worked there. The women were kept in separate rooms but were aware of each other's presence, said tomba. Castro has waived his rights and is cooperating with police, reports cnn.",

        "summary": "David axelrod has been among those dismissing donald trump's candidacy as a joke all these months — until now. In a new york times op-ed, axelrod writes that it's dawned on him that trump's run is very much like barack obama's 2008 campaign in one vital respect. He sums it up thusly: \" open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent, \" he writes. \" voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing executive. \" a decade ago, obama's deliberate, cerebral approach proved to be just the right antidote to george w. Bush, writes axelrod. But now those same qualities are viewed as \" hesitancy, \" \" weakness, \" and \" appeasement. \" so who better to play the role of this election's anti-incumbent than trump? \" relentlessly edgy, confrontational and contemptuous of the niceties of governance and policy making, mr. Trump is the perfect counterpoint to a president whose preternatural cool and deliberate nature drive his critics mad, \" axelrod writes. What's interesting is that in 2006, then-sen. Obama asked axelrod to assess his chances if he were to run, and axelrod laid out the broad strokes of this theory in a \" bullish \" analysis for the long-shot candidate. He just failed to apply it anew to trump. \" it's so obvious, i ' m embarrassed i missed it, \" he notes. Click for the full column.",

            "The gender gap is narrowing across the globe, with large parts of the world moving towards greater equality between the sexes in terms of pay, education, health and political representation, according to a report by the world economic forum. Nordic nations, longtime champions of an equal society, topped the list with iceland, norway, finland and sweden demonstrating \" great equality between men and women \" in the forum's global gender gap index. Of the countries surveyed, 59 % narrowed the gap in the past year. Denmark, the philippines, the uk and sri lanka stayed at the same ranks as in 2009, keeping them in the top 20. Although iceland, rated the best nation for gender equality in the world, has seen its economic wealth shattered by recession, the government is committed to levelling society further and introduced laws this year to force companies with more than 50 staff to ensure their management is made up of at least 40 % women by september 2013. In nordic nations, women live longer, have high employment rates and often enjoy generous maternity and paternity schemes. There are more than 1.5 women for every man enrolled in tertiary education. Gender equality, claim the report's authors, boosts growth in both rich and poor countries.

            "The gender gap is narrowing across the globe, with large parts of the world moving towards greater equality between the sexes in terms of pay, education, health and political representation, according to a report by the world economic forum. Nordic nations, longtime champions of an equal society, topped the list with iceland, norway, finland and sweden demonstrating \" great equality between men and women \" in the forum's global gender gap index. Of the countries surveyed, 59 % narrowed the gap in the past year. Denmark, the philippines, the uk and sri lanka stayed at the same ranks as in 2009, keeping them in the top 20. Although iceland, rated the best nation for gender equality in the world, has seen its economic wealth shattered by recession, the government is committed to levelling society further and introduced laws this year to force companies with more than 50 staff to ensure their management is made up of at least 40 % women by september 2013. In nordic nations, women live longer, have high employment rates and often enjoy generous maternity and paternity schemes. There are more than 1.5 women for every man enrolled in tertiary education. Gender equality, claim the report's authors, boosts growth in both rich and poor countries. The report warned that while gaps were narrowing between men's and women's health and education, women were still left out of the labour market – including salaried and skilled jobs.

        "summary": "On sept. 14, 2001, a 20something man calling himself lyle stevik got a room at the lake quinault inn, a rundown motel on washington's olympic peninsula. Three days later, the inn's maid discovered the man dead in his room. He had used a leather belt to hang himself from a metal coat rack attached to the wall in an alcove in the room. And so began the mystery of lyle stevik — a man who, as far as the system goes, did not exist. In a lengthy account in online magazine mel, kirk pepi walks us through the \" strange case \" of stevik, who \" in death … became a 9/11 terrorist, a ghostly apparition, and an internet superstar. \" when law enforcement arrived at room 5 at the lake quinault inn, they discovered a folded comment card with \" for the room \" written on it. Inside there was $ 160. They also found a crumpled piece of paper on which \" suicide \" was written in all caps. A gideon bible was bookmarked to john 12: 33: this he said, signifying what death he should die. But what police didn't find is where the mystery lies. Stevik left no id. Running his dna, dental information, and fingerprints through law enforcement databases yielded nothing. Stevik appeared in no phone directory, search engine, electoral roll, or census. All roads led to dead ends. Eventually, the stevik case went cold. But, years later, would-be detectives have again begun to attempt to unravel the mystery. Theories include: the name lyle stevik was a pseudonym based on a character from a joyce carol oates novel. Stevik became suicidal after losing a loved one on 9/11 ( which occurred three days before he checked in at the motel ). Stevik feared wwiii was about to break out and decided to end it all. Or, stevik was actually a 9/11 terrorist. Stevik was driven to suicide by bulimia. Whoever he was, at least two people have reported seeing his ghost at the quinault inn.

        "summary": "Last month brought the news that the wreck of a ship that changed the course of history may have been found after more than 500 years: barry clifford announced that he believed he'd uncovered the wreck of christopher columbus ' flagship, the santa maria, off haiti. Now, a portuguese-american historian is saying such a feat just isn't possible — because the santa maria never met a watery grave. Manuel rosa explains his theory to the telegraph: that the ship was actually pulled ashore in haiti, where it was occupied by sailors and later burned by the natives. And as for columbus ' journal about the sinking that clifford relied on? rosa says columbus intentionally lied. Rosa's take is that columbus, whose expedition bill was footed by spain, was spying on behalf of portugal ( rosa goes so far as to call him \" the james bond of his day \" ), and that he used his diary as a way to throw people off. \" columbus'diary was written in spanish, as he knew that it would be read by the court of his patrons, the king and queen of spain, \" says rosa. In his read of the journal, which describes a cannonball being fired at the ship during a weapons demo, the ship was hit while it was on land, not offshore, and was done on columbus ' orders so that many of his men would be marooned on the island — including three envoys for ferdinand and isabella. The maritime executive notes rosa also claims columbus left behind no pilots, as a way to ensure that even a repaired ship wouldn't make its way back to spain. Of course, rosa has his own motivations: he's written a book on the topic, columbus — the untold story. ( meanwhile, has a long-sought relic been found in the puget sound? )",

In his book that details allegedly how columbus continuously lied to queen isabella, including detailed evidence from columbus's logbook of how the santa maria never sank off the coast of haiti, rosa gives three reasons why columbus allegedly had to maroon the santa maria: so that those left behind could not follow him home.

It depends on whether you're in your bedroom or kitchen. Anthony hilton and his biology students looked at two types of bacteria ( e. Coli and staphylococcus aureus ) on three flooring options: carpet, laminate, tile. Toast, pasta, a cookie, and a \" sticky sweet \" were dropped on the various surfaces and rested there for 3 to 30 seconds. When it came to the transfer of bacteria, both time and flooring type played a role. Bacteria were least likely to hop aboard the fallen bite if carpet was involved; when \" moist \" foods hit laminate and tiled surfaces, bacteria was more likely to transfer when contact was made for more than 5 seconds. The upshot, per hilton: \" we have found evidence that transfer from indoor flooring surfaces is incredibly poor. \" that's likely welcome news to the 87 % of people the students surveyed who reported a willingness to adhere to the five-second rule. Writing for forbes, alice walton notes that the findings should be taken with a grain of salt — preferably one not dropped on the floor. She points out that the study doesn't seem to have been peer-reviewed or accepted for publication anywhere.

The problem with the iraq tablets is that, as museum head cary summers puts it, there was \" incomplete paperwork \" attached, though the daily beast points out that a simple logistical issue wouldn't have dragged on so long. Instead, someone looking to bring in artifacts that should never have left their country of origin may have purposely undervalued the antiquities so they could be smuggled into the us. Hobby lobby denies knowingly doing anything illegal. A depaul law professor tells the guardian that she advised hobby lobby about the potential risks and \" read them the riot act \" back in 2010, because \" i was concerned they might be doing something they shouldn't, even out of ignorance of the law. \"",

The american and european coalitions came to ask iran to reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium to below the amount needed for weapons, in exchange for relaxed sanctions on the country's gold and petrochemical trade. Instead, an anonymous diplomat says, iran surprised them by stating it has its own proposal. The terms are not yet clear, but tehran will likely ask for a much broader sanction reprieve and fixed limits on any concessions it does make. Both sides want the other to blink first. The iranian negotiator says it wants the world powers to \" accept the inalienable rights \" of iran to enrich uranium, reports the new york times. But the six countries say iran must first relinquish its stash and cut production as a sign of good faith. Talks resume tomorrow. In other nuclear-powered news, enough uranium for two nuclear weapons has been removed from the czech republic in order to keep it from falling into dangerous hands, reports reuters. The material has been taken to russia, where it will be blended down for use in nuclear reactors.",

The medical charity known by french initials msf did not go quietly, reports the new york times, saying in a statement that \" kabul and washington were clearly informed of the ( gps coordinates ) of the msf facilities, \" and that bombing continued for 30 minutes anyway. The us, which initially acknowledged \" collateral damage \" may have occurred, appeared to dig in on its self-defense, with the top american general in the country saying the military action \" was conducted against insurgents who were directly firing upon us service members. \" the acting governor of kunduz province took that a step further, reports the washington post, saying the hospital was \" a taliban base \" from which various attacks across kunduz had been staged. \" the hospital campus was 100 percent used by the taliban, \" he said, adding that \" we tolerated their firing for some time \" before the strikes were ordered. Msf dismissed that claim — though the wall street journal notes that it treats all who require treatment, even militants — saying that \" bombing a fully functioning hospital can never be justified \" and that \" the gates of the hospital were all closed so no one that is not a staff, a patient or a caretaker was inside the hospital when the bombing happened. \" an investigation is likely coming, with the un high commissioner for human rights calling the attack \" utterly tragic, inexcusable and, possibly, even criminal, \" suggesting that if the us knew it was striking a hospital, war crimes charges could result.",

The statistic getting the most attention out of the new study in nature plants is that eight of the continent's 13 oldest baobabs have died since 2005 and five of the six largest have suffered significant collapses. The scientists can't say for sure what's going on, but they suspect that climate change — as in, higher temperatures and drought — is the primary culprit in the deaths throughout zimbabwe, namibia, south africa, botswana, and zambia, reports the bbc. Baobabs grow in unusual ways, often with hollows, making it difficult to gauge precise ages, but the research team says the trees in the survey range in age from 1,000 to 2,500 years, reports npr. \"it is very surprising to visit monumental baobabs, with ages greater than a thousand to two thousand years, which seem to be in a good state of health, and to find them after several years fallen to the ground and dead, \" study co-author adrian patrut of babes-bolyai university in romania tells national geographic. And it's no fluke, he adds. \" statistically, it is practically impossible that such a high number of large old baobabs die in such a short time frame due to natural causes. \" the stories note baobabs ' iconic place in african history. In south africa, one legendary baobab more than 1,000 years old grew to 111 feet and had a hollow so large that it functioned as a pub for two decades.

For two decades, the sunland baobab attracted tourists wanting to knock back a pint in a tree. But in august 2016, one of the monster stems forming the interior wall cracked and collapsed. Eight months later, another huge chunk toppled over, and now, five of the giant sunland stems have collapsed and died, leaving only half of the tree standing.

Norman barwin, who ran a fertility clinic in canada, secretly used his own sperm to father at least 11 of his clients ' children. \" we are now aware of 11 individuals whose parents went to dr. Barwin for assistance with fertility, and dna investigation discloses that he is their biological father, \" says the law firm that filed the suit. The cases date from the 1970s to the early 2000s, cnn reports; barwin, who no longer practices, was once well-respected and known as \" the baby god, \" per ctv news. The suit began in 2016, when rebecca dixon learned through dna testing that the man she thought was her biological father actually was not. Her parents had gone to barwin's clinic for help conceiving in 1989, and when her family started researching the doctor, \" they could not help but notice that rebecca bore an uncanny physical resemblance to dr. Barwin, \" per the lawsuit. Dixon connected with another woman whose story was similar; the suit alleges that barwin actually admitted to that woman he was her biological father. The two women then discovered through dna testing that their fathers were one and the same. Others later joined the suit, which also alleges 16 children of barwin's clients were not biological matches to the men believed to be their fathers and another 35 children may not have been conceived using the anonymous donor sperm their mothers chose. In those cases, the fathers are not known. \" when people have discovered that their children are not as what was intended, it's a very distressing discovery, \" one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs says. Though dixon, who was raised as an only child, does see a \" bright side of what's a really difficult and emotional situation, \" she tells the cbc: \" i now have 10 siblings.... I definitely now see the siblings i have as relationships i ' ll have for the rest of my life. \" ( similar stories here, here, here, and here. )",

According to krpc, xavier alvarez, former director of military affairs at the psychiatric hospital, said in a police report at the time that kelley \" was a danger to himself and others. \" prior to hopping a fence to escape, alvarez tells nbc news that kelley was caught using the hospital's computers to order weapons and tactical gear, which he was having shipped to a po box. In the police report, he said kelley \" was attempting to carry out death threats \" against \" his military chain of command. \" following his escape, kelley was apprehended at a bus station in el paso. Alvarez says he told the arresting officers he would go for their guns if he got the chance. \" this kid — he was hollow, \" alvarez says. \" i could never reach him. \" meanwhile, authorities are still trying to piece together a motivation for sunday's shooting at the first baptist church of sutherland springs, hampered by an inability to unlock kelley's cellphone.",

Patty and jerry wetterling of minnesota have known this interminable passing of time since their 11-year-old son, jacob, was abducted on oct. 22, 1989. But as the 25th anniversary of his disappearance approaches, the wetterlings still refuse to give up their search, the st. Cloud times reports. Six new billboards have been placed around st. Cloud with jacob's picture as an 11-year-old, an age-enhanced photo showing what he could look like now at age 36, and the 1-800-the-lost phone number for tips, the star tribune reports. Jacob was riding his bike with his brother and a friend when they were reportedly approached by a masked gunman, who ordered the boys to get down, then took off with jacob. More than 50,000 leads have poured in since 1989, the times notes, including the discovery in may that six unsolved sexual assaults in the area were never examined after jacob disappeared, wcco reports. And keeping jacob's case ( recently featured on john walsh's the hunt ) in the public eye is key: the national center for missing and exploited children says 42 children gone more than 20 years were found between 2009 and 2013 — a fact that's not lost on those looking for jacob. \" we ' ll treat [ a new tip ] with the same energy and enthusiasm as if it was one day old, not 25 years old, \" the stearns county sheriff tells the times. Jacob's dad implores the public: \" listen to something that is said innocently at a cafe.... Something you hear that … inside of your gut didn't feel right. \" the billboards will stay up through the end of october.",

        "summary": "President trump said it had to happen — but it isn't going to happen. The republican plan to repeal and replace obamacare collapsed monday night after two more gop senators announced their opposition, leaving senate majority leader mitch mcconnell without enough votes to move the legislation forward, and leaving the party with no clear path toward what it has been trying to achieve for seven years. A roundup of coverage: sens. Mike lee and jerry moran sealed the bill's fate by declaring their opposition, joining sens. Rand paul and susan collins. Aides tell cnn that the two men, who opposed the legislation for different reasons, decided to announce their opposition together so that neither would be seen as the deciding third republican vote against the plan. While lee and moran were working on their statement, trump was dining on steak, succotash, and \" farm stand peach cobbler \" at the white house with eight other senators while discussing health care reform. An insider tells politico that trump \" made an impassioned pitch on why republicans needed to do it now. \" \" he basically said, if we don't do this, we're in trouble, \" the source says. \" that we have the senate, house, and white house and we have to do it or we're going to look terrible. \" according to the new york times, the bill failed because the gop has failed to learn this lesson: \" an american entitlement, once established, can almost never be retracted. \" conservative senators demanding full repeal of obamacare were unable to reach a deal with senators whose states accepted, and now rely on, obamacare's expansion of medicaid. Mcconnell now plans to hold a fresh vote on repeal legislation passed by the house and senate in 2015, which gives congress two years to come up with a replacement for obamacare. But that strategy was abandoned by the gop earlier this year because of concerns about chaos in the marketplace, and it may be a struggle to pass repeal-only legislation now, the ap reports. Trump tweeted in support of repeal after mcconnell said it had become clear that the replacement bill wouldn't succeed. The washington post reports that in what appears to be a fifth nail in the legislation's coffin, sen. John mccain issued a statement late monday urging fellow lawmakers to not \" repeat the original mistakes that led to obamacare's failure, \" including crafting the legislation on a \" strict party-line basis. \" he called for congress to \" return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our",

So far there have been no reports of fatalities or major injuries, per cnn, with just two people suffering minor burns, including one of 29 hikers rescued in sevier county.

They spread easily as the area is suffering a drought; many parts of the south have seen 10 to 15 inches less rainfall than usual over the last three months.

        "summary": "Her \" hips don't lie, \" but her lips might. Spanish prosecutors are charging pop music star shakira with tax evasion, alleging she failed to pay more than $ 16.3 million in tax on her worldwide income between 2012 and 2014, reports the ap. The charges published friday allege shakira listed the bahamas as her official residence for tax purposes during those years but was in fact living in spain with her partner, spanish soccer player gerard pique. Prosecutors in barcelona say her travel abroad was for short periods because of professional commitments, while most of the year she stayed in spain, where tax rates are much higher than in the bahamas. The colombian singer moved to spain in 2015, after having two children by pique. A magistrate will assess whether there is enough evidence to put shakira on trial. Shakira's representatives said they had no immediate comment. Prosecutors want shakira to pay a bond of $ 21.9 million — the amount they say she owes in tax, plus 33 %, in accordance with spanish law. Otherwise, they recommend a court freeze of her assets to that amount. Shakira was named in the \" paradise papers \" leaks that detailed the offshore tax arrangements of numerous high-profile individuals, including musical celebrities like madonna and u2's bono. Spain's tax authorities referred their probe to the barcelona prosecutor's office a year ago. ( shakira reportedly owns an island north of the bahamas. )",

            "Versions of the secret, broadcast on hundreds of web sites ( usually under headlines like, \" third secret revealed! \" ) range from worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the roman catholic church that lead to rival papacies. Fatima fanatics have held hunger strikes -- one even hijacked a plane -- to try to force the vatican to disclose the secret. During john paul's first visit to the shrine in 1982, on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt, a knife-wielding spanish priest tried to kill the pope, but was wrestled to the ground by security officers. John paul has always credited the virgin of fatima with saving his life. After he visited the shrine in 1982 to give thanks for his survival, a bullet extracted from his body was placed alongside diamonds in a gold crown worn by a statue of the virgin. In 1991, on the"

The 73-year-old is now coming forward with what he believes to be the story of the ships, and it's a tale of native americans battling colonists — on the water. Demers ' own story begins with some dropped air tanks. He accidentally lost them in the water during a dive off salamander point in new castle ( it's near portsmouth, and just south of the maine border ) decades ago, and when he dove to retrieve them some 16 feet below the surface, he came across two cannons. \" i put my hand on one of them and i said, ' ray, you are going to spend the rest of your life studying this site '... And, you know what? \" he tells foster's daily democrat. \" i did. \" though not a trained archaeologist, he tried to approach the scene as a professional would, with great care to avoid contamination. Using the cannons as a starting point, he discovered a shipwreck about 75 feet away, then a second wreck in deeper water. He also found a number of artifacts, including an onion bottle whose seal featured the name of w. Darracott and the date 1723, reports the union leader. By relying on a 1959 book, input from colonial willamsburg's then-chief archaeologist, and the name darracott, demers was led to george jackson and sylvester lakeman, men he believes commanded privateers and attempted to \" engage \" native americans who had themselves seized hold of a privateer and were attacking fishing ships in the area. The \" unique naval engagement... Could have resulted in the salamander point wrecks, \" notes foster's. ( another shipwreck was recently uncovered in upstate new york. )",

How invasive? \" all snails in europe could be wiped out, \" says jean-lou justine of the national museum of history in france. In other words, goodbye, escargot. The culprit is the new guinea flatworm, known formally as platydemus manokwari, which has the distinction of being on the list of the world's 100 most invasive species.

Now a new report in the journal peerj warns that all of europe could be next, unless authorities somehow stop the spread early. The researchers suggest aggressive quarantines wherever the worm is spotted; it first showed up at a botanical gardens in normandy. \" it may seem ironic, but it's worth pointing out the effect that this will have on french cooking, \" says lead author justine. \" if the worms do manage to gain a foothold, \" adds a blogger at mother nature network, \" they could radically transform ecosystems and menus in europe forever. \" ( the worms don't do so well in cold temperatures, so maybe europe needs a pest-destroying blast of our polar vortex? )",

        "summary": "In a sign that he is willing to fight for transgender people in certain areas, attorney general jeff sessions has tasked the justice department with sending an experienced federal hate crimes lawyer to iowa to assist in prosecuting a man charged with murdering a transgender 16-year-old, sources tell the new york times. Kedarie johnson, a high school junior, was shot to death in march of last year; two men, jaron narelle purham and jorge luis sanders-galvez, have been charged with first-degree murder in the case, the des moines register reported in march. Christopher j. Perras of the justice department civil rights division's criminal section will serve as a county prosecutor in the trial for sanders-galvez, the register reports. It's a rare move that, per the times, sends a clear message on sessions ' part. The attorney general has rolled back legal protections for transgender people as a group and has spoken out against same-sex marriage in the past, but he he has also brought several hate crime cases and has spoken out forcefully against those who commit them. \" no person should have to fear being violently attacked because of who they are, what they believe, or how they worship, \" he said in june. As for his assignment of perras to the johnson murder case, \" this is just one example of the attorney general's commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals, \" a justice department spokesperson says. Critics and supporters alike say sessions is more likely to tackle civil rights matters individually, rather than systemically. State hate crime charges were not filed against sanders-galvez, per the hill, but the des moines county attorney says the federal government is considering filing federal hate crimes charges in the case.",

        "summary": "If you're set on doing some heavy pouring to ring in the new year, you've probably already resigned yourself to a recovery hangover tomorrow. But binge drinking — defined by the cdc as having five or more drinks in two hours if you're a guy, four or more if you're a woman — can also \" significantly disrupt \" the immune system, cbs philadelphia reports. In a small study published in the journal alcohol, researchers gave either four or five 1.5-ounce vodka shots ( depending on the subject's weight ) to eight women and seven men with a median age of 27. At 20 minutes after \" peak intoxication, \" immune system activity ramped up, but that effect was temporary. At the two-hour and five-hour marks, the immune system slowed, with blood samples showing a reduction in two types of white blood cells key to immunity; there was also an increase in proteins that tell the immune system to cool it. Choosing two hours and five hours after peak intoxication wasn't a haphazard decision: those are the typical times when patients arrive in the er or other trauma centers for alcohol-related injuries, according to the study, which was funded by the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism and the university of maryland. The research is a new clue into the effects of binge drinking, which is already known to keep wounds from healing as quickly, increase blood loss, and up the risk of contracting an illness or an infection from catheters. The loyola university researcher leading the team next wants to examine burn-unit patients with alcohol in their blood to check their immune systems and see if they're more at risk for lung injury, organ failure, or even dying compared with their teetotaling counterparts.

Earlier this month, \" institutionalized cheating \" finally caught up to the san francisco-based firm that has raised more than $ 500 million at a $ 4.5 billion valuation, and hard-partying co-founder and ceo parker conrad, 35, was forced to resign, buzzfeed reports. Now zenefits is laying off 250 employees ( 17 % ), tech crunch reports. So how did a silicon valley darling go so wrong? buzzfeed and business insider take a look at some of the risky ( and risqué ) things that have happened at zenefits. Zenefits, which also has an office in arizona, offers free hr software, and then makes money through commissions selling health insurance. To close insurance deals, sales reps reportedly threatened customers with an imaginary implementation fee. Zenefits reportedly used a program, called a macro, which helped sales reps skirt california requirements that health insurance brokers must have 52 hours of pre-licensing training. The macro allowed reps to stay logged into an online course, \" even while they were sleeping or doing something else. \" while zenefits'software seemed slick on the front end, it was glitchy. Much of the actual work was done manually. Mistakes and carelessness led to some clients unknowingly going without insurance for stretches of time. Health insurance brokers in california must score at least a 60 % on a state exam to get a license. Anyone at zenefits who scored much higher than that was branded a nerd. The closer to 60 % the better — after all, \" d is for done, \" managers would say. Boozing and raucous behavior were mainstays at zenefits ( the new ceo has since banned drinking at work ). On a conference stage in 2015, 30-year-old sales executive sam blond ( aka agent blond or 007 ) recalled being \" over-served \" at bobo's steakhouse and engaging in a wrestling match with conrad. In general, as the wall street journal puts it, there was a \" frat-house \" atmosphere at the company that included partying in vegas and celebratory shots.

Jarosik, 37, says when she got to his home, simmons asked her to have sex, and when she refused, he pushed her down on a bed, then knocked her off of it and \" pounced on her while she was still in shock and fear, and proceeded to rape her, \" per the complaint. The blast, which first reported the lawsuit, notes jarosik says she told some friends about what had happened, but she \" felt somehow it was partially her fault since she was not strong enough to resist. \" the complaint says jarosik and simmons met in 2006 and bonded over a shared \" love and passion for meditation, yoga, and a vegan diet, \" per usa today. Jarosik's lawyer calls out the \" hypocrisy \" of simmons, who has stepped down from his businesses, for his peace-promoting lifestyle. \" mr. Simmons … is a longtime vegan practicing nonviolence against animals. So basically he treats animals better than women, \" perry wander said in a statement; the lawsuit references the \" #timesup \" movement several times.

An employee of wynn las vegas'salon in the mid-2000s says such complaints were to be directed to doreen whennen, the hotel's then-vp, or then-chief operating officer marc schorr, whom employees say gave lingerie to female workers and made comments about women's breasts. Neither seemed to take action, while whennen sometimes said \" to look in the employees ' files to see if there were any past problems that could be a pretext to get rid of them, \" the journal reports. \" it was always the person's fault, \" the salon employee says. \" nobody really looked into it. \" a lawyer for wynn — who just sold all of his remaining stake in wynn resorts, per reuters — calls the latest allegations \" salacious. \" wynn resorts says an internal investigation is underway.",

It actually happened multiple times, with the flyers trying to send a message about tampa's reviled \"trap \" system. The trap is a defensive scheme apparently designed to bore the opponent ( and spectators ) to death: instead of forechecking, tampa players keep back, then clog the center of the rink when the other team begins skating up ice. It's effective, but it makes for a dull game mostly devoid of free skating. With control of the puck in their own zone, the flyers decided to wait for tampa to come get them, sometimes for as long as 45 seconds. Tampa players never did. Finally the refs would blow the whistle and penalize philly with a faceoff in its zone, reports the inquirer. \" that's not hockey in my book, \" said philadelphia's chris pronger. \" but whatever, the league's letting them do it.

Oxycontin, an opioid painkiller, is an extended-release version of oxycodone; extended-release versions contain a higher dose of the active ingredients, which can make them ripe for abuse as some versions can be crushed or melted in order to get the full dose immediately. \" our focus is on helping customers get the most value from their medications — this means obtaining effective pain relief while also guarding against opioid misuse, \" cigna's chief pharmacy officer said in a statement wednesday. He said that cigna would review individual prescriptions deemed \" medically necessary \" by doctors, cnbc reports. The insurance giant has a goal of reducing its customers ' opioid use by 25 % over the next three years, cnn reports. Instead of oxycontin, cigna has signed a contract with collegium pharmaceutical for the drug xtampza er, which is equivalent to oxycodone but is able to \" maintain its extended release profile even when cut, crushed, chewed, or otherwise manipulated, \" cigna says. However, it's not clear whether xtampza er is meaningfully more difficult to abuse than oxycontin ( one study says yes, but it was conducted by the drug's manufacturer ) and experts say even if a drug is hard to abuse, it can still be quite addictive. \" people still get addicted to oral pills. They can still take too much. They can still overdose, \" says one doctor. Some are also raising questions about the financial agreement between cigna and collegium, and in its response to the news, the maker of oxycontin claimed cigna's move is \" more about pharmaceutical rebates \" than keeping customers safe.",

        "summary": "It's been more than three weeks since that first new york times story opened the floodgates on the harvey weinstein sexual harassment and assault scandal, and since that exposé, dozens of women have come forward with related stories to tell about the disgraced producer. A new story in the times monday is not only expanding the number of women making allegations, but also the timeline: two women now say they were sexually assaulted by weinstein in the 1970s, stretching the accusations out over four decades. Hope exiner d ' amore, 62, says weinstein raped her in a new york city hotel in the late ' 70s, while cynthia burr, also 62, says weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway, also in nyc during the same period. \" this has haunted me my entire life, \" exiner d ' amore tells the times, which also reveals other new allegations from two other women. In other weinstein-related news, vulture notes that \" seeds of fresh chaos have been sewn \" regarding the future of the weinstein company, and harvey's brother, bob, \" is facing serious troubles of his own. \" per two sources who claim they're tight with twc execs, bob is increasingly being pegged a \" liability \" by the company's board of directors. Although bob has said he's \" mortified and disgusted \" at his older brother's behavior, there have been whispers that at heart he's simply harvey's enabler. \" blood is thicker than water, and maybe that's what the board is thinking as well, \" notes a studio exec who's worked for both brothers. Not helping matters for bob: sexual harassment allegations against him by an executive producer on a twc tv series.",

        "summary": "Israel's attack on gaza — which has reportedly killed more than 1,500 civilians — was indeed a war crime that flagrantly violated rules of international law, writes manal tellawi at salon. Three of his main arguments: while article 51 of the un charter allows for self-defense, israel can't make that case regarding an occupied territory. Israel's supporters say the country doesn't occupy gaza — it pulled out 8,000 settlers in 2005 — but tellawi notes that israel \" maintains control over its borders, water sources, electricity, [ and ] population registry. \" a protocol of international humanitarian law states that a military can only fire on military targets, or occasionally civilian establishments being used by the military. \" in violation of this article, \" israel has attacked churches, mosques, homes, and residential buildings in the gaza strip, \" one of the most densely populated places on earth. \" as per a geneva convention protocol, warnings to civilians \" must be clear, credible and allow [ a ] reasonable amount of time, \" writes tellawi, but witnesses to one gaza attack say people who fled were at times arrested or blocked by idf tanks. Among those who disagree are israel's former un ambassador dore gold, who argues in the la times that the shajaiya neighborhood targeted by the idf is full of underground bunkers and tunnels that \" allow hamas to cross under the border fence and penetrate israeli territory to carry out attacks on civilians. \" meanwhile, human-rights defenders are gathering information in gaza for a possible war-crimes case at the international criminal court — but the us and israel will oppose such a move, and the ap notes that if palestinian president mahmoud abbas makes the case, he could \" expose hamas...

        "summary": "On sunday, ani difranco bowed to an overwhelming tide of internet outrage and canceled her \" righteous retreat, \" a planned four-day creative getaway at nottoway plantation. The problem, of course, being that nottoway was one of the largest slave plantations in the south, a fact its website positively boasts about — while asserting that the slaves \" were probably well treated, \" and referring to them as a \" willing workforce. \" difranco has since apologized, but she's still taking heat online from the kind of liberals who would normally be the feminist icon's fans. Here's a taste of it: \" it's easy to say that people are being too sensitive, and assume that this is an overreaction, \" writes mikki kendall at the guardian. But it's not. This is an important issue, because the people who were bought and sold under chattel slavery \" are an abstract idea to much of america. \" nottoway perpetuates that, failing to mention, say, how slaves were punished — because \" it is much easier to enjoy plantation-based resorts if you ignore the horrors that took place there. \" difranco is an accessory to that. \" her decision, at first, to proceed with the retreat falls in line with an american habit of divorcing painful symbols and events from their historical contexts, \" writes brentin mock at grist. \" she knew better, but decided not to do better. \" difranco's apology — which jezebel described as \" remarkably unapologetic \" — didn't help either. Difranco argued that all of america is built on slavery. \" i believe that one cannot draw a line around the nottoway plantation and say ' racism reached its depths of wrongness here, ' \" she wrote ( lack of capitalization hers ). \" there's built by slaves, and then there are plantations, \" writes liz dwyer at xojane. \" those of us who call ourselves allies, as difranco does, have to remember that we aren't suddenly in possession of a magic wand that inoculates us from what is the norm in america. \" it's indicative, sadly, of \" the continual divide between white women and black women. … how can we forget that collectively we have the same boot on our necks? \"",

He gives a timeline of the intense efforts made to free warmbier, from meetings with the \" new york channel \" ( north korea's reps at united nations headquarters ) to a proposal to have then-president-elect trump pick warmbier up in his plane. After learning in june 2017 warmbier was unconscious, north korea was \" unilaterally informed \" that a us plane would arrive to collect him. \" intense negotiations \" followed on the ground, and michael flueckiger, the medical director for phoenix air, whose gulfstream g-iii jet was being used in the mission, was finally allowed to see warmbier. He knew immediately that \" the otto of old was already gone, \" though he noted the hospital care had been of quality ( warmbier had no bedsores, for instance, which is difficult in the case of a comatose patient ). Flueckiger tells clark that the hospital staff told him warmbier had been admitted unresponsive the morning after he was sentenced to 15 years, a timeline detail that hadn't been made public. But only two weeks prior, warmbier appeared on tv and seemed healthy. The narrow window between the two suggests to clark that the theory that warmbier was continually beaten doesn't hold up, and he provides other evidence in support of that. So what happened? clark presents one theory: that it was a suicide attempt gone wrong. Read his full piece here.",

Lee bailey, whose legion of high-profile cases includes the oj simpson murder trial, has filed for bankruptcy in maine in an effort to discharge an irs debt of more than $ 5 million, the ap reports. Debts to the irs aren't normally discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, but the 83-year-old bailey said friday that they can be if one abides by certain conditions, such as filing and paying his taxes on time since the original taxes and penalties were assessed. The debt stems from a dispute of his reportable income from 1993 to 2001, according to the portland press herald. Bailey served as one of simpson's attorneys during the former nfl star's 1995 trial, which ended in his acquittal in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, nicole brown simpson, and her friend ronald goldman. Bailey in the 1960s secured a reversal of dr. Sam sheppard's conviction in the murder of his pregnant wife, and an acquittal at his second trial. He also represented albert desalvo, who claimed to be the boston strangler. Bailey was disbarred in florida in 2001 over mishandling client assets, and massachusetts issued a reciprocal disbarment in 2003. Bailey's bid to gain admission to the maine bar failed in 2014, when the maine supreme judicial court reversed a judge's ruling that would have allowed him to practice law in maine. Bailey told the press herald he wants to discharge what he owes to the irs. \" at 83, it's a little late to raise that kind of money overnight. It's been a long battle, \" he said.",

Jay darshane says he was \" trying to help the police with their investigation \" when officers showed up right after the oct. 20, 2014, shooting at his restaurant, which wgn notes is located about 50 yards from where the fatal shots were fired. Darshane says the bk's assistant district manager called him that night to tell him there were \" four or five \" officers asking to review the eatery's surveillance video. Darshane gave the ok, and cops holed up with the tape for nearly two hours, he says — but when they left, there was an \" inexplicable 86-minute gap, \" from 9: 13pm to 10: 39pm, that included when laquan was shot, the tribune notes. \" i didn't know they were going to delete it, \" darshane says, adding that he testified about the missing video earlier this year in front of a grand jury. But state's attorney anita alvarez has said there's no forensic evidence to back up claims the tape was erased on purpose, and chicago police superintendent garry mccarthy says those claims are \" absolutely untrue \" and that there were \" apparently technical difficulties. \" the tribune notes that the surveillance camera probably wouldn't have had the vantage point to show laquan's shooting, but it may have depicted some of the teen's movements right before. And an attorney for laquan's family poses a question. \" it is curious, \" he says. \" if [ the officers ] got there and turned it on and found that there was no video, what were they looking at for two hours? \" ( a protest against laquan's shooting tried to halt black friday shopping. )",

Back in 2010, the mammalogist was exploring the solomon islands when he heard locals describe \" vika, \" a giant tree-dwelling rat with teeth powerful enough to break open coconuts. Reports of such a rat had circulated for decades. But though he searched for years, lavery only managed to find some rather large rat poop, reports the guardian. In 2016, however, lavery was able to examine a rat that had died after falling from a tree downed by loggers and knew immediately his quest for \" vika \" was over. Uromys vika, as it has now been named, is the first new rat species discovered in the solomon islands in 80 years. At 18 inches long and 2.2 pounds, the specimen within the family of mosaic-tailed rats is about four times the size of a common rat. It's \" pretty spectacular, \" says lavery, per a release. And though \" it was just so hard to find, \" the researcher is happy his persistence paid off. \" if we hadn't discovered it now, it might never have gotten discovered \" due to the logging of the rainforest canopy the rat inhabits through use of its scaly tail and clawed back feet, lavery says, per national geographic. He also describes the rat's ability to chew holes in tree nuts. Given that lavery believes the species'total habitat is 31 square miles, his paper in the journal of mammalogy requests that the rat be immediately classified as critically endangered.

        "summary": "Scientists think they've found one of the world's biggest impact craters, but confirmation is tricky given its location — under a glacier in greenland. In the journal science advances, researchers make the case that a meteorite perhaps a mile wide slammed into greenland somewhere between 12,000 and 3 million years ago, reports the guardian. The resulting crater, first spotted by a plane using ice-penetrating radar, is 19.3 miles wide and would rank among the 25 biggest on earth. The city of paris could fit inside it, notes space.com. After spotting the indentation in the radar images, the researchers set about getting samples to confirm their hunch. Because the crater lies under the giant hiawatha glacier, they had to settle for examining sediment meltwater — and that sediment included \" shocked quartz grains, \" pointing toward a meteor strike. \" you have to go back 40 million years to find a crater of the same size, so this is a rare, rare occurrence in earth's history, \" says kurt kjaer of the natural history museum of denmark, one of the researchers in the discovery. However, an expert at the lunar and planetary institute in houston tells space.com that he is \" intrigued \" but not wholly sold yet on a meteor strike. The researchers would have to drill through a half-mile of ice to settle the debate, and it's not clear when, or whether, that might happen. Assuming the crater is from a meteor strike, the big question is exactly when that strike occurred. If it's on the recent end of the scale, around 12,800 years ago, astronomy.com notes that this could be the missing crater that would explain a mysterious 1,000-year cooling period known as the younger dryas.

The researchers said a giant iron meteorite likely created the mark by slamming into earth sometime in the past 3 million years.

            "We report the discovery of a large impact crater beneath hiawatha glacier in northwest greenland. From airborne radar surveys, we identify a 31-kilometer-wide, circular bedrock depression beneath up to a kilometer of ice.

H.

Ayers says the doctor approved, and that he followed through in a visit to her home. According to veronica kennedy, this was no isolated incident. Kennedy tells the alabama political reporter she was working in the star newsroom in february 1975 when ayers referred to her as \" a bad girl, \" adding, \" you know what i do to bad girls? i spank them.

Researchers at king's college london monitored the weight of 278,982 brits, including 176,000 who were obese, from 2004 to 2014. Excluding those who had weight loss surgery, just 1,283 obese men and 2,245 women returned to a normal body weight during that time, reports the bbc. That means obese men had just a 0.5 % chance of getting back to a healthy weight level each year. For women, the rate of success was 0.8 %, or \" almost impossible, \" a researcher tells healthday. For those morbidly obese, the figure was even less encouraging: less than 0.15 % for women and much less for men. While 8 % of men and 10 % of women were able to lose at least 5 % of their body weight within a year, more than half had regained the weight two years later, while 78 % had after five years, according to a press release. The fact that this yo-yo effect — the cycle of people losing weight, only to gain it back again — was so prevalent shows weight loss strategies for the obese are simply inadequate, researchers say. \" current strategies that focus on cutting calories and boosting physical activity aren't working for most patients to achieve weight loss and maintain that, \" says alison fildes, lead author of the study, published in the american journal of public health ( researchers didn't monitor how the study participants attempted to lose weight, however ). While cutting 5 % to 10 % of body weight has significant health benefits for the obese — including lowered blood pressure and blood sugar, reports healthday — \" priority needs to be placed on preventing weight gain in the first place, \" says fildes.
