        "summary": "A photo album featuring candid shots of some of the most evil people ever to walk the earth has been snapped up for $ 41,000 by an anonymous buyer at an auction in england. The album, found in the bunker bedroom of eva braun, adolf hitler's mistress, features hitler and henchmen including heinrich himmler and josef goebbels in lighter moments, the telegraph reports. Some of the 73 photos can be seen on the auction site, including one of hitler relaxing in the alps. C&t auctioneers says the photo album was taken in april 1945 from the bunker as a souvenir by british wartime photographer edward \" dixie \" dean, who sold it to a collector in 1983. Per the auction house, \" very few significant artifacts liberated from the fuhrer bunker in 1945 exist today in the open market, especially with such concrete provenance. \" auction house owner matthew tredwen tells the new york times that it is clear that the photos were taken by a member of hitler's inner circle, though the book gives no indication of who that might be. \" the photographs had to be taken by someone who was very close, \" he says. \" all photographs of adolf hitler were very much controlled \" to show him in the best light. These \" would not have been made for the general public. \" tredwen adds that in his years of dealing in nazi memorabilia and other military history items, he has never met anybody who actually supports nazi ideology. \" people are fascinated by how evil the third reich were, \" he says. ( there is a dispute over whether \" hitler's personal phone \" is the real thing. )",

The other report adds that women afflicted with breast cancer alone could nearly double from 1.7 million diagnosed last year to 3.2 million by 2030, the guardian reports. The first report, compiled by merck and the american cancer society and released at the world cancer congress in paris on tuesday, says the predicted surge in cancer deaths would amount to a 57 % increase, per a press release. The same report notes all four top cancers — breast, lung, colorectal, and cervical — are mostly preventable or easily detected early on, aiding treatment. The second report, based on three papers in the lancet, adds cervical cancer may rise by as much as 25 % by 2030, leading to 700,000 diagnoses. That report also notes women in low- and middle-income countries carry much of the burden of breast and cervical cancers, with less access to quality care and a greater likelihood of dying from their illnesses than women in richer nations. Perhaps a bit ironically, some of the cancers in the lower-income countries used to be prevalent only in higher-income ones, but as the poorer countries started going through \" rapid economic transition, \" the women there began experiencing risk factors like their more affluent counterparts, including \" physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors \" like putting off having kids, per an acs vp. \" the global community cannot continue to ignore the problem — hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year, \" richard sullivan, co-author of the lancet report, says in the release.

            "Some movies just don't draw the crowds. Unfortunately for the film studios, that means major losses when the movies they've produced bring in a worldwide gross significantly lower than it cost to make them. What are biggest film flops? titles like cowboys &amp; aliens, the lone ranger, final fantasy: the spirits within, and the adventures of pluto nash. Have all been huge box office busts. Movies have the ability to make us feel. They make us want to believe, be inspired, and live vicariously through the stories we see on screen. But often movies that studios bet on to make us feel some sort of connection fail... Big time. These biggest film flops provide the kind of escapism that studios hope people seek in entertainment. But often times it is simply the wrong property, or the wrong mix of actors, and the movie falls flat and fails to draw an audience. Or, the movie's budget is so large, it simply can not make back its money. These movies may vary in their genre but they are all equally terrible and failed to earn big at the box office. Source",

Universal's the fate of the furious left the competition in the dust at the north american box office, grossing $ 38.7 million in its second weekend for a 10-day domestic total of $ 163.6 million and $ 908.4 million globally. The action movie fell 61 percent in north america, a fairly good hold for the front-loaded franchise. Fate of the furious is also doing massive business overseas, where it earned another $ 163.4 million for a foreign total of $ 744.8 million — led by china with an astounding $ 318 million.

        "summary": "New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in denmark and germany. Writing in the journal of pediatrics, psychologists at the university of warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic — a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition — by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in canada, reports the guardian, where 34.1 % of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the uk, the tally was 28 % and in italy 20.9 %. Relatively blissful danish babes scored 5.5 %, with germany at 6.7 %. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher dieter wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. \" they don't get all worried about it, \" wolke tells the telegraph. Then again, he notes, danish babies may enjoy a bit of \" genetic bias \" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. \" if you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby, \" wolke says. ( crying saved this baby's life. )",

Many assumed this was evidence of innate altruism, but new research out of stanford and published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests that these kids were actually primed by the playful researchers, if subtly, to display generosity — which means that altruistic behavior may be dictated by our experiences, however brief, instead of mere instinct, reports stanford news. \" people often call something ' innate ' because they don't understand the kinds of subtle experiences that can make something, like altruism, flourish, \" says the lead author, admitting that \" the findings will stir up some controversy, but in a good way. \" to investigate the effect of the original study's priming, researchers mimicked it with a group of 34 toddlers, rolling a ball back and forth with the child while chatting, then knocking over an object to see if the child would pick it up. They split the group in two; in the second group, the adult and child played with their own ball independently while talking. Turns out the kids who played with the adult were three times as likely to help out and pick up the dropped object. \" kids are always on the lookout for social cues, and this is a very prominent one, \" says another researcher. \" does the person's play indicate that they ' ll care for me? these actions communicate a mutuality, and the child responds in kind. \" to foster altruism at home, the researchers suggest, model it, reports yahoo.

More comments and context as the dust settles: the los angeles times spoke with mike weber, whose weber-madgwick inc. Construction company demolished the brentwood mansion in 1998. \" i think it's a joke. No one on my crew found anything. I had instructed my people, ' if you find anything, don't keep it, ' \" he said, though he does concede, \" hundreds and hundreds of people were there after me. \" tmz keeps its story going by speaking to dr. Irwin golden, the deputy medical examiner who examined nicole brown simpson and ron goldman's bodies. He believes a knife with a 4-inch blade could have been the murder weapon; the newly found knife has a 5-inch blade. Nbc news'report throws plenty of water on the story. Its law enforcement sources tell it the knife is not consistent with the murder weapon but is akin to a small utility knife a gardener might carry, was given to now-retired lapd officer in 2001 or 2002, and didn't have the appearance of having long-been buried. Former prosecutor marcia clark weighed in, too, with comments to entertainment tonight. \" it might be a hoax... But, of course, i ' m glad the lapd is taking it seriously and subjecting it to testing so we can find out. \" as far as those tests go, the verge explains exactly how the forensic analysis will be carried out. And should the knife actually check out? the washington post asks and answers a slew of \" tricky legal questions. \" read more on the newly found knife here.",

There's barely a whiff of volatility or investor anxiety, so much so that there's now a debate underway about whether that's healthy.

It seems to be working. The kodiak walmart had more than 35,000 \" likes \" monday, more than five times the town's population. Kodiak has a significant lead in the contest to land pitbull, but actual numbers weren't immediately available, walmart spokeswoman sarah spencer said. She says other walmart shoppers have until july 16 to like their local stores and pull ahead of kodiak. \" i know pitbull is hoping his miami walmart shoppers start liking their facebook page, \" she said. That would require some heavy lifting, with one miami location sitting tight with 45 \" likes \" monday. \" he '",

However, david thorpe, a writer for the boston phoenix and the popular humor website somethingawful.com, found it entertaining to campaign to send pitbull to the most isolated store possible by pushing the kodiak location and rallying the internet to swarm its facebook page with \" likes. \" as of today, it had surpassed 35,000 \" likes \" and spawned a rather successful twitter campaign called #exilepitbull. For his part, pitbull remains a good sport, tweeting, \" i hear there's bear repellant at kodiak, alaska \" and adding the #exilepitbull hashtag. \" wherever the fans want to have a party, i will be there, \" he added in an emailed statement."

In fact, he was once called the \" baron of botox, \" and he boasted such celebrity clients as madonna and kelly ripa. But on sunday the 65-year-old died of an apparent suicide at his florida home; a publicist tells the new york times that he'd not only been struggling with depression, but was \" devastated \" by an apparent parody of him on unbreakable kimmy schimdt. Martin short played a character on the netflix series who looks similar to brandt, with features that make it seem the fictional doctor has been using botox to excess on himself. Brandt was known for experimenting on himself before trying a new treatment on patients. Brandt was found hanged in his garage, the miami herald reports. Multiple sources who talked to people agree the show hurt him, but one says not to blame short's character ( dr. Grant, pronounced franff ) for brandt's death. \" did the show upset him? yes. He was a human being, no one would like that. It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying, \" the source says. But \" it wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help. \" the source blames the \" illness \" of depression. Meanwhile, allure's editor remembers brandt's contributions: \" when he came into dermatology it was people treating sunspots and removing moles.

Crystal mason, who is black, was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a ballot in tarrant county, texas, in 2016 while being a felon under supervision. Terri lynn rote, who is white, was sentenced to two years ' probation and a $ 750 fine for trying to vote for president trump twice in iowa. On monday, the judge who sentenced mason turned down her request for a new trial. \"prison is a lot closer for her today, \" mason's lawyer told the new york times. Mason, 43, had been sentenced to 60 months for tax fraud. She served part of her sentence and was released in 2016. She says she didn't know that being a felon meant she was ineligible to vote. Her name had been purged from the voter rolls, and she was given a provisional ballot, which should have alerted her to her ineligibility, the prosecutor said. The judge had the option of sentencing mason to anything from probation to 20 years, reported the dallas morning news in march. Whether a felon can vote varies by state. For example, as the new york times notes, in vermont, a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote, even while in prison. But in mississippi, a conviction for perjury is enough to void the right to vote. Mason told the star-telegram that she was originally sent to jail for inflating returns and took responsibility for her actions. \"i would never do that again. I was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate. My son is about to graduate. Why would i jeopardize that? not to vote.... I didn't even want to go vote. \" mason's attorney is appealing the decision. Mason's case is juxtaposed with rote's in an online petition calling for charges against mason to be dropped.",

        "summary": "Ufo enthusiasts last week got a gander of an alien allegedly recovered from roswell — oversized head and all — but experts say the evidence likely originated on planet earth, tech times reports. Attendees at a ufo conference in mexico city paid $ 350 for the chance to see an old kodachrome color slide said to capture an alien that crashed in new mexico in 1947 ( ufo lovers call it the \" roswell incident \" ). A journalist apparently dated the film stock to the 1940s, discovery reports, saying it was recovered in arizona from an oil geologist's photo collection. The slide shows a small figure with a big head in a display case; discovery argues that the skeleton belonged to a child ( with typically oversized head ) or the body of a mummified child with a deformed head. Such bodies have been turning up for years in the americas and identified as extraterrestrials, discovery reported last year. What's more, no eyewitness at roswell in 1947 described aliens or even a flying saucer; the first one there talked about something \" made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks \" ( the us air force put it down to air balloons and radar detectors that crashed there ). Yet ufo proponents at the mexico city event stood firm: \" analysis of the body... Suggested this is not a mummy and not a human, not a mammal and not a model, \" says enthusiast richard dolan, reuters reports. A british defense official was less enthused, telling the mirror that \" it could be a model, or it could simply be a fake image, dressed up to look like a forties slide. \" ( read about air force ufo files now available online. )",

The planet holds 117 million lakes, researchers find in what livescience calls the \" best count yet. \" and while they may be fewer in number, they take up more of the earth's surface than scientists had thought: some 3.7 % of it, it turns out. Experts used computers to count the bodies of water using high-resolution satellite images. \" this is something one would have assumed had been done long ago, and was in a textbook somewhere, \" says a researcher. One reason it wasn't: most lakes are far from human residences, and millions are so small they haven't appeared on maps, livescience reports. Indeed, 90 million of the lakes counted were between 0.5 to 2.5 acres, or less than two football fields. The new figure measures the lakes around today, a number that can easily change; indeed, the aral sea, once the fourth-biggest lake on earth, is now almost dry, the independent reports. So what's the point of all this counting? \" if we are to be able to make realistic estimates of the collected effects of the different processes in lakes, for example their contribution to global warming, we first need a good map, \" a researcher says in a press release.

The lake was at one time fed by the syr darya and amu darya rivers which flow down from the mountains before making their way through the kyzylkum desert where they pooled together at the lowest part of the basin.

While the massive diversion of water allowed the desert to thrive, it had a devastating effect on the aral sea.

And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into western europe through slovenia and croatia, as well as through hungary's border with romania. Issues remain: hungary's poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the balkan wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a vienna train station, per the times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the aegean sea, the post notes — a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: the eu border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at eu nations ' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the bbc reports.

The 83-year-old announced the move on twitter. \"every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves, \" he says in a video. \" and for me, that time is soon approaching. That's why after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, i've decided to retire at the end of this term. \" the move paves the way for mitt romney, a frequent critic of president trump, to run for his seat. Details and developments: unpopular at home: hatch has been in the senate for four decades and currently chairs the powerful finance committee, a post that allowed him to play a big role in the gop's recent tax overhaul. But his clout doesn't seem to matter in utah, where polls show that about 75 % of residents wanted him to retire, reports the salt lake tribune. ( the newspaper itself issued a scathing editorial calling for him to do just that. ) trump unhappy: the president is \" very sad \" upon hearing the news, says spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders. The new york times reports that the president, pleased with hatch's work on the tax plan, had been encouraging him to run again. If nothing else, that would keep romney — who has been vocal in his criticism of trump — out of the senate. ( still, trump reportedly considered romney for secretary of state. )",

And it just prompted one citizen's tweet, \" this is awesome! // #vt is one step closer to offering a third gender on driver's licenses. \" but finley, who came to the free press from virginia in 2016 after a long stint as norfolk virginian-pilot editor ( and, briefly, as publicist for a norfolk museum ), felt compelled to respond: \" awesome! that makes us one step closer to the apocalypse. \" if winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, finley fumbled in recognizing his. The vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage, and claims of canceling subscriptions. In fact, it was only the third in a succession of curious tweets by finley. They underscored the tempting perils of journalists, even newsroom bosses, who feel compelled to opine on, well, just about anything.thus, finley saw an associated press tweet on how fans of frank lloyd wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of a montana office building designed in 1958. This inspired a response: \"",

The hill reports that around 200,000 signed up for health care coverage on the first day of this year's enrollment period, compared to 100,000 last year. Such early enthusiasm is good news for fans of obamacare, many of whom assumed enrollment would be down this year due to actions by the trump administration, including slicing the advertising budget by 90 % and cutting the length of the enrollment period by half. Still, despite the early high numbers, analysts say early enrollees tend to be renewing coverage, not getting it for the first time. Last week standard &amp; poor's said enrollment could drop by as much as 1.6 million this year. With the government's advertising budget just $ 10 million, some insurance companies are spending their own money to spread the word about the enrollment period, reuters reports. These companies are using advertising both to bring in the young, healthy customers whose coverage keeps premiums down and to clear up any confusion about the cessation of subsidies under trump. The obamacare numbers come as reports have surfaced that the trump administration is preparing an executive order that would effectively wipe out the mandate that most americans have health insurance. The order would state that the administration will not collect the tax penalties from people who fail to get coverage, cnbc reports.",

Trump cut $ 90 million in advertising and outreach spending for the 2018 enrollment period, which opened on nov. 1, part of his promise to let democratic president barack obama's signature healthcare law \"implode \" until congress can repeal it.

The twins ' gender was not revealed, and the only identifying details given by vietnam's state-run news agency vns is that the children have very different hair ( thick and wavy vs. Thin and straight ) and live in hoa binh province with their 34-year-old father and mother, whose age wasn't given. Le dinh luong, president of the genetic association of vietnam, says he's unaware of any case like this in his country. That hasn't stopped paranoid fathers from phoning the hanoi center over fears about their twins, reports the tuoi tre paper. It's rare, but certainly not unheard of in the us. Last year, a new jersey judge ruled a man is father to one twin while another man is father to the other, in a case that had child-support implications. The judge in that case cited two other similar court cases, and a 1997 article by identity testing expert karl-hans wurzinger, who testified in the case, put the number of reported paternity cases involving superfecundation ( the fathering of fraternal twins by two males ) at one in every 13,000.

These calls came in the aftermath of the first recorded case of heteropaternal twins in northern vietnam, covered by tuoi tre ( youth ) newspaper on wednesday. Heteropaternal twins are born when two ova ( egg cells ) from the same menstrual cycle are fertilized by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse with two different males.

            "Numerous fathers called a genetic analysis center in hanoi this week raising concerns about their newborn twins whom they doubted might not biologically be theirs, following a rare case of twins born of different fathers. Nguyen thi nga, director at the center for genetic analysis and technologies ( cgat ), said she received incessant phone calls from one father after another on thursday morning, requesting consultancy on cases where their twins look nothing alike. These calls came in the aftermath of the first recorded case of heteropaternal twins in northern vietnam, covered by tuoi tre ( youth ) newspaper on wednesday. Heteropaternal twins are born when two ova ( egg cells ) from the same menstrual cycle are fertilized by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse with two different males. The phenomenon is also known scientifically as heteropaternal superfecundation. The twins in question were brought in for a dna test at cgat by their father",

A vietnamese couple recently brought their fraternal twins to the center for genetic analysis and technologies, in the country's capital of hanoi, to have dna tests, after pressure from extended family members who noticed the children did not look alike, said le dinh luong, president of the genetic association of vietnam. The tests showed there was no mix-up in the hospital: the twins have the same mother, but different fathers. Luong said the family was surprised by the revelation, and looking for the best way to deal with the situation.

That's because cat poop often contains a parasite called toxoplasmosa gondii, and when sewage and polluted runoff carry the infected feces to the ocean, it can prove lethal, reports scientific american. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimates that eight hawaiian monk seals have succumbed to the disease since 2001, which is a sizable number given that 1,100 are estimated to be alive today in the wild. The same bacteria have also killed california sea otters and helped send the hawaiian crow into extinction, reports the christian science monitor. But while conservationists call for the \" humane euthanization \" of some feral cats, animal welfare advocates oppose a \" hierarchy in which the protection of certain animals comes at the suffering of others, \" as the president of the hawaiian human society puts it. Monk seals are considered the most endangered pinniped in the country, and their numbers are expected to dip below 1,000 soon, with starvation among the young the largest known problem. Meanwhile, hawaii's division of forestry and wildlife estimates that 300,000 feral cats live on oahu and as many as 400,000 on maui, which is roughly two cats per human resident. Noaa is working with california's marine mammal center on a monk seal hospital in kona to try to care for the sick ones before they die. ( humans have hunted caribbean monk seals to extinction. )",

Three dogs chased him off one of his resting beaches, and he battled a minor tsunami that left him wedged between a pair of boulders in a lava field far from shore. Observers noticed him looking thin in the few months before fishermen found him dead on a beach near the east kaua ` i town of kapa ` a. In the end, disease took him. Nicknamed \"star \" in hawaiian for the small white spot on his forehead, hoku was a large, 10-year-old hawaiian monk seal, an endangered species. Hoku may likely have been the second hawaiian monk seal to die this year from toxoplasmosa gondii, a parasite transmitted primarily through cat feces and carried to the ocean in polluted runoff and sewage. The first suspected toxoplasmosis case of the year came in january. While conducting his weekly seal search along the coastline of moloka ` i's kalaupapa national historical park, marine ecologist eric brown discovered a stillborn pup in a tide pool.

Now, a new study has found that being scared can, indeed, cause your blood to thicken, nbc news reports. Dutch researchers found that a frightening situation — in this case, watching a horror movie — can increase levels of factor viii, a blood-clotting agent. \" we hypothesized that acute fear activates the coagulation system and that this poses an important evolutionary benefit, by preparing the body for blood loss during life-threatening situations, \" write the leiden university medical center researchers in the study, which was published in the december issue of the british medical journal. The study used 24 healthy volunteers ages 30 and under. Upi reports 14 of the subjects watched the horror movie insidious and then, a week later, watched the documentary a year in champagne at the same time of day. The order of the movies was reversed for the other volunteers. Blood samples were taken before and after participants viewed the movies. Levels of factor viii increased in 57 % of subjects during the horror movie, while they decreased in 86 % of participants during the documentary. No one in the study suffered a blood clot, nbc notes. While the researchers outline some study limitations ( sample size, \" the magnitude of fear induced by the movie genre \" ), they conclude that \" after centuries the term ' bloodcurdling ' in literature is justified. \" ( speaking of fear, here's how to cure a spider phobia in 2 minutes. )",

Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow lasseter to return, but deadline reports on a \" gathering sense \" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief bob iger issued a statement that praised lasseter for \" reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever, \" and lasseter issued one of his own thanking disney and saying he's \" extremely proud \" of his work but that it's time to move on. Despite the positive public comments, the move amounts to what the los angeles times describes as \" a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation. \" the story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem, with female employees at pixar alleging that lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching.

The news comes after yet another bad day for asian stocks, with japan's nikkei falling into bear territory — roughly defined as 20 % below a recent high, reports the wall street journal. One huge, familiar factor: oil prices continue to fall, with the price of a barrel now under $ 27 a barrel. \" obviously we're in the throes of an environment where sentiment is not positive about risk assets, so it takes very little to put pressure... Pressure coming from falling oil prices continues to serve as a cues for equities to follow suit, \" a strategist at janney montgomery scott tells cnbc.

Michael rogan, 42, was driving a van with his wife and seven children aboard when another car hit a deer, sending the animal into the van's windshield. Wife niki was able to steer the van into a shallow ditch, the ap reports. Rogan died of his injuries later at a marathon county hospital; everyone else received only minor injuries, and niki gave birth to a son named blaise that afternoon — the new baby was baptized, as planned, sunday at the family's church, the wausau daily herald reports. A friend explains to wsaw that she doesn't think niki has ever missed a mass due to a child's birth: \" she wanted to go. \" \" it was a very teary morning, \" says the reverend, who notes that about 100 people came together at a nearby home after the baptism. Faith was important to rogan, and the former marine could typically be found at st. Mary's oratory in wausau, which he had attended for at least 15 years, about three times a week, the reverend says. Friends have stepped forward to help with rogan's organic seed and fertilizer business, and a gofundme campaign has so far raised more than $ 270,000 for the family he left behind. Niki is a stay-at-home mom and homeschools the kids — who, besides the newborn, range in age from 2 to 15 — and the money raised will be used to allow her to continue to do that as well as cover the costs of a new van, medical expenses, and the funeral this weekend.",

Fogle apparently sees this as an example of how the case against him was unfair. He also says he was pressured into pleading guilty and wants to withdraw his pleas to charges of distribution and receipt of child pornography and traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. Tmz points out that fogle is serving a 15-year sentence, while nassar has no hope of ever leaving prison, raising the question of why fogle would take the risk of withdrawing his pleas to get a new trial.

After meeting north korea's top diplomat, chinese foreign minister wang yi urged north korea to make the \" smart decision \" and stop testing nuclear weapons and launching missiles, the washington post reports. \"do not violate the un's decision or provoke international society's goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests, \" wang said. China's warning came a little more than a week after north korea tested a ballistic missile that experts say could hit major cities in the united states. On saturday, the un security council unanimously approved new sanctions on north korea, banning the country's largest exports, coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore, and seafood, the los angeles times reports. The resolution also freezes the assets of a north korean art studio that makes communist-style statues and monuments for dictatorships around the world. All told the sanctions would cut north korean annual exports by a third, from $ 3 billion to $ 2 billion. In response to the un vote, north korea's state-run newspaper, rodong sinmun, condemned the united states on sunday, cnn reports. \" the us mainland will sink into an unimaginable sea of fire on the day when it dares to touch our country by stupidly causing mischief and brandishing its nuclear and sanctions clubs, \" the article warned.",

        "summary": "The exact nature of the relationship between schizophrenia and cannabis still isn't clear to scientists, but a new study offers additional clues. Researchers studied genetic data on 2,082 people, about half of whom had used cannabis, reuters reports; they focused on the number of schizophrenia-linked genes in the subjects. The experts found that those with a predisposition to the illness were more likely to use cannabis — and to use more of it — than were those without schizophrenia-linked genes, regardless of mental health history. In other words, says a researcher, the study suggests \" a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use. \" the verge explains the complexities of the possible relationship between schizophrenia and marijuana: in the 1960s, for instance, scientists thought that smoking marijuana could cause psychosis in most people; these days, researchers believe using the drug may spur schizophrenia in those who are predisposed to it. The new study effectively turns the idea around, suggesting that those who are predisposed to the illness may also be predisposed to using marijuana. But that doesn't mean weed use doesn't increase schizophrenia risk, an outside expert notes: \" both ( theories ) may be true. \"",

            "London genes that increase the risk of a person developing schizophrenia may also increase the chance they will use cannabis, researchers said on tuesday after studying more than 1,000 users of the drug. The results chime with previous studies linking schizophrenia and cannabis, but suggest the association may be due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, and its use is higher among people with schizophrenia than in the general population. \" we know that cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia. Our study certainly does not rule this out, but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well – that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use, \" said robert power, who led the study at the institute of psychiatry at king's college london. Schizophrenia is a common and severe psychiatric disorder that affects around one in 100 people. People who use cannabis are about twice as likely as those who do not to develop it. The disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and its most common symptoms are disruptions in thinking, language and perception. It often includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. While the exact cause is unknown, research",
            "The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is historically fraught. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists thought that smoking weed could trigger psychosis in just about anyone. Today, these findings are more nuanced, but researchers still think that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to the disease — meaning those with family histories of the disorder. Yet, in the last decade, some scientists have actually started to look at the effect in reverse. The resulting studies suggest that the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia might also put people affected by the disorder at increased risk for smoking pot. But these results haven't garnered nearly as much attention as studies suggesting the opposite. Part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap now, a new study, published today in molecular psychiatry, lends further support to the idea that schizophrenia plays a role in an individual's likelihood of smoking weed, by showing that the genetic variants predicting schizophrenia can also be used to predict a person's tendency to smoke pot, regardless of their mental health history. This, researchers say, demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut, and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap, where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others"

First, republican sen. Johnny isakson was called in to the procedural vote, despite the fact that he's recovering from back surgery. He walked in with a walker but did cast his vote, bringing the total to 50-50. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the senate, but republican sens. Susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska voted with democrats on this issue, forcing republicans to keep the vote open for just over an hour to get their win, fox news reports.

That's a prohibition that i personally support, but i ' m a strong supporter of family planning funds. \" now that the procedural vote has passed, the senate can hold a final vote later thursday to officially repeal an obama-era regulation that kept states from blocking planned parenthood from receiving funding from title x family planning grants. The house already voted to reverse the regulation in february, usa today reports. This is the second time pence has had to break a tie since becoming vp; the last time a vp had to do it prior to pence was in 2005, the washington post reports.",

        "summary": "Willy wonka may have been on to something. Regularly eating chocolate could possibly help prevent a type of irregular heartbeat that can increase the risk of heart failure, strokes, and cognitive impairment, according to a study published tuesday in heart. Live science reports between 2.7 million and 6.1 million americans have atrial fibrillation, in which the upper chambers of the heart beat at a different pace than the lower chambers. But a study of 55,000 adults in denmark found that those who ate chocolate at least once a month had rates of atrial fibrillation 10 % to 20 % lower than those who ate it less than once a month. The best results came from eating an ounce of chocolate two to six times per week. It's impossible to say based on the study whether chocolate consumption was directly responsible for lower rates of atrial fibrillation. Researchers also aren't clear how chocolate could even affect the development of the condition, but it may have something to do with things called flavanols, the los angeles times reports. Atrial fibrillation is thought to be caused by molecules damaging heart tissue. The flavanols in chocolate can stop inflammation that leads to tissue damage. \" as part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice, \" reuters quotes the study's lead author as saying. Though it's important to choose chocolate with a higher cocoa content. ( and you should probably also take it easy on the ibuprofen. )",

Brazil has released data showing that roughly 3,050 square miles ( or nearly 1.5 million football fields ) of earth's biggest rainforest was chopped down between august 2017 and july 2018, a 13.7 % increase over the year before. Opinions differ on the cause, with environment minister edson duarte blaming illegal loggers: \" an upsurge in organized crime \" is behind it, says duarte, who calls for a broader battle against \" environmental violations and in defense of sustainable development of the biome. \" then there's a 2012 forest code that still gives amnesty to anyone who deforests on small properties, notes the guardian. After declining for years, deforestation began rising in 2013 and increased in four of the following years. Now brazil is welcoming a new, openly anti-environmentalist president, jair bolsonaro, whose foreign minister calls global warming a marxist plot. Environmentalists say the amazon rainforest could suffer a 300 % deforestation surge under the new regime: \" we are already in a very critical situation in terms of climate change, \" an environmental researcher tells national geographic. \" if we mess up with the amazon, carbon dioxide emissions will increase so massively that everyone will suffer. \" bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former military officer, wants more roads and mines in the rainforest and fewer penalties for chopping down trees.

        "summary": "When harold hayes said he had one helluva war story to tell, he wasn't kidding. The 94-year-old, who died on sunday, was the last survivor of 30 intrepid americans who crash-landed behind nazi lines during world war ii, plunging them into a surreal odyssey that included german attacks, blizzards, illness, and near starvation as they trekked 600 miles until their eventual rescue 63 days later. Details of their saga was a \" long-held-secret \" for decades, the new york times reports. It all began on a clear day in november 1943 when a cargo plane carrying nurses and medics from sicily to bari, italy, was blown off course by a major storm and fired on by german flak guns. After ditching in a remote area, the group learned they were in albania from locals. Under constant threat of capture, hayes, then 21, and the others bunked with peasants with little to share except lice-infested blankets. They boiled tea from straw and ate berries. Their limbs froze as autumn gave way to white-out blizzards. \" when you're hungry, cold, and tired, you forget about almost everything else and are only thinking about surviving, \" hayes said, per national geographic. A british spy found them too sick to go on, and arranged a us air rescue that failed. Crushed, the group managed to continue moving west and reached the adriatic coast on jan. 9. To protect their albanian saviors, they stayed mum during the war and for years after during the communist years. Hayes \" rarely talked about his ordeal, \" author cate lineberry tells the times.

        "summary": "Researchers say they've found fossilized bacteria that may date back to shortly after the formation of the earth ( geologically speaking, anyway ), the new york times reports. They published their findings wednesday in nature. The rocks were collected in 2008 from the nuvvuagittuq geological formation in canada. The rocks are estimated to have formed near a hydrothermal vent on the seafloor between 3.77 billion and 4.22 billion years ago. They contain tiny filaments and tubes, some connected by knobs, that resemble younger bacteria fossils created near hydrothermal vents. They also contain a level of carbon indicative of a living organism. If the fossils are what researchers say they are — and not everyone is convinced they are — they would push the date of earliest known life back billions of years. Currently the oldest fossilized bacteria widely accepted as legitimate are 3.5 billion years old and come from australia, ars technica reports. And if these canadian fossils are closer to 4.22 billion years old, it means the bacteria would have been alive just 340 million years after the formation of the earth. Still, every new claim of finding the world's oldest fossilized life is met with skepticism, and this discovery is no different. One expert calls the rocks \" dubiofossils, \" fossil-like but not clearly evidence of an organism. In response, researchers argue there's too much evidence in favor of their conclusion to ignore. ( this dinosaur fossil is one of the \" saddest \" ever found. )",

If so, they offer evidence that life here got off to a very early start. But many experts in the field were skeptical of the new study — or downright unconvinced. Martin j. Van kranendonk, a geologist at the university of new south wales, called the patterns in the rocks \"dubiofossils \" — fossil-like structures, perhaps, but without clear proof that they started out as something alive. Heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on earth. In 1993 j. William schopf, a paleontologist at the university of california, los angeles, and his colleagues found what that they, too, argued were the world's oldest fossils: chainlike blobs in 3.46 billion-year-old rocks made, they said, by bacteria. Other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals."

            "The study of life's history on earth is an ongoing effort to follow the thread further and further back in time. As amazing and fascinating as a few billion years ' worth of fossils are, we still ultimately want that holy grail that illuminates the origins of life on earth. Unfortunately, that goal collides with the fact that the earliest evidence stands the least chance of being preserved through the eons for us to find. Each new find that purports to supplant the earliest known signs of life is virtually guaranteed to be controversial, subject to poking and prodding from skeptical scientists uncertain that every competing ( non-living ) explanation can be ruled out. Last august, for example, a paper claimed to show the remnants of stromatolites ( small mounds built by communities of shallow water microorganisms ) in 3.7 billion-year-old rocks in greenland. Similar fossils from australia that come in at about 3.5 billion years old are generally accepted as legit, but anything older is still subject to scientific debate. Now, a new study led by university college london phd student matthew dodd describes evidence of what the researchers believe to be seafloor bacteria that lived at least 3.7 billion years ago. That evidence comes from rocks that are part of quebec's nuvvuagittuq belt, which contain some of the oldest rocks on the planet. They comprised an ancient seafloor made of volcanic rock, but there are also layers of iron minerals that precipitated out of the seawater. Those are believed to have formed near hydrothermal vents that gushed super-hot water laden with minerals. The"

They now know that they're related to a suspected serial killer. Police say they tracked the suspected golden state killer by comparing dna from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online, the sacramento bee reports. They traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out deangelo, a 72-year-old ex-cop, last thursday. Sacramento county district attorney anne marie schubert says deangelo was placed under surveillance, and dna collected from discarded items provided \" astronomical evidence \" that he was the killer. Schubert tells the bee that when she was informed of the dna test results, \" i probably used a few words i wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, ' you'd better not be lying to me. ' \" she adds: \" there were a lot of holy s --- moments. \" deangelo was arrested outside his home tuesday. The san jose mercury news reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website gedmatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986. Other genealogy websites, including ancestry.com and 23andme, say they weren't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they're legally compelled to.

        "summary": "Now that former nazi prison guard jakiw palij is out of the us, the new york times explores how he got in, and it wasn't through his efforts alone. As nazi records of his ss membership weren't uncovered until the 1990s, palij successfully applied for a visa under the displaced persons act at the american consular office in schweinfurt, germany, in june 1949 alongside jaroslaw bilaniuk, whose ss identification number turned out to be only one digit away from palij's, says peter black, a former justice department historian who worked on nazi deportation cases. Both claimed to have worked in germany during the war — palij as a factory worker, bilaniuk as a farmhand. Mykola wasylyk, who also served with the men at the trawniki labor camp and who'd already arrived in the us after securing a visa, vouched for both. The records suggest palij and bilaniuk weren't coerced into joining the ss as palij later claimed, but volunteered together in february 1943. Together with wasylyk, they guarded prisoners who made uniforms and brushes at trawniki, says black, a camp known for having executed 6,000 jews in a single day in november 1943. Upon their arrival in the us, palij and bilaniuk settled 100 miles from wasylyk in queens, ny. Bilaniuk and wasylyk would each die in the us, even after officials uncovered their true past. Deported to germany this week at president trump's direction, per reuters, palij is unlikely to face charges.",

The white house said jakiw palij had served as a guard at the trawniki labor camp, where about 6,000 jewish men, women and children were shot dead on nov. 3, 1943, in one of the single largest massacres of the holocaust. The united states had been trying to get palij out of the country since the issue of a 2004 deportation order, but after talks with top members of chancellor angela merkel's government germany agreed to take him in. Palij was taken to a home for the elderly in the western town of ahlen, some 130 kilometers northeast of dusseldorf. Born in what was then poland but is now ukraine, palij emigrated to the united states in 1949, becoming a united states citizen eight years later, the white house said. But, it added, he had concealed his nazi service and involvement in human rights abuses, saying he had spent world war two working on a farm and in a factory.

Now many of those restrictions are about to be dismissed, with a reversal of the state mandate for a 25 % drop in city water use, the new york times reports. Instead, thanks to the hard work of everyday californians and a precipitation-filled winter that partly restocked the area's reservoirs and mountain snowpacks, the state water resources control board is rolling back its rules on keeping tabs on how long people shower or water their lawns, allowing local communities to come up with their own conservation methods. \" we are still in a drought, but we are no longer in the-worst-snow-pack-in-500-years drought, \" says felicia marcus, the head of the swrcb. By putting the conservation power back into the hands of each community as of june 1, those areas can come up with the best plan based on their particular area's water supply, which varies greatly from place to place. But a climate manager on the water board warns this is still just a trial run, with the national drought mitigation center noting in the sacramento bee that 70 % of the state is still in \" severe, \" \" extreme, \" or \" exceptional \" drought.

        "summary": "It was his job to take care of the swans, and it was a swan that ended up ending his life. Now the wife of a des plaines, ill., man who died in 2012 after a swan attack in a condo complex's retention pond is suing the companies that own and operate the complex, the chicago tribune reports. In her complaint, amy hensley says the property management companies, as well as the condo and homeowners associations at the bay colony complex, were negligent in keeping the swans on the premises. Geese are fearful of swans, so swans or swan decoys are sometimes brought in to keep the goose population in check. But swans can act aggressively while trying to protect their young, and it was a swan's unchecked aggressiveness, hensley says, that led to the death of her husband, anthony hensley. The 37-year-old dad of two worked for knox swan and dog, a local company that rents out swans as a goose control remedy, and he was often seen at bay colony taking care of the hired-out birds, typically in his kayak and with his dog. But on the day in question in april 2012, a nesting swan attacked hensley's kayak and tipped him out of it. The bird continued to go after hensley, who fox news says was wearing heavy clothes and boots. He tried to make it to land but ended up drowning. His death was ruled accidental, but his wife's complaint notes the defendants in her suit \" should have known the swans are strongly territorial with a dangerous propensity to attack. \" the suit adds he didn't do anything to agitate the swan before it attacked. Hensley's wife is asking for at least $ 50,000 in damages. ( an indianapolis man got ticketed for trying to protect his young son from a goose. )",

China's legislature ruled that candidates must be backed by a nominating committee, a move that means voters are likely to have just two or three candidates to choose from — all of them nominated by a pro-beijing committee. At a protest last night, one of the pro-democracy movement's leaders called it the \" darkest day in the history of hong kong's democratic development \" and warned that the former british colony's people \" are no longer willing to be docile subjects, \" reports reuters. Activists in the \" occupy central \" movement plan to paralyze hong kong's central business district to protest beijing's decision. Analysts say beijing feared that granting hong kong's demand for greater democracy would have led to similar demands on the mainland. \" in the territory controlled by the chinese communist party, only hong kong has some space for free speech, some judicial independence, so it is a mirror for people on the mainland, \" a dissident in beijing who was placed under house arrest ahead of the government announcement tells the new york times. \" the outcome of this battle for democracy will also determine future battles for democracy for all of china. \" in nearby macau, meanwhile, chief executive fernando chui was \" re-elected \" to another five-year term yesterday by a 400-strong pro-beijing committee that didn't have any other candidates to choose from, the south china morning post reports.

            "Dr fernando chui sai-on was re-elected uncontested as macau's chief executive yesterday in a choreographed exercise that prompted thousands of residents to demand universal suffrage. Chui was selected by a 400-strong election committee made up mainly of pro-beijing elites and politicians. They gave him 95.96 per cent support, or 380 of the 396 votes cast, up from 95.3 per cent in 2009. There were a record 16 blank or invalid votes, however, due partly to an expansion of the election committee from 300 in 2009. The election took place a day after the end of an unofficial seven-day \" civil referendum \" in which 95 per cent of 8,688 residents voted in favour of universal suffrage for the 2019 election. There were complaints of rights violations last week after police arrested several organisers of the referendum for allegedly breaching personal data laws. Unlike hong kong's basic law, macau's mini-constitution makes no mention of universal suffrage as a goal. But calls for democracy have been growing. Chui was reluctant to talk about his re-election result. \" the statistics are out now, but i will not comment on it, \" he said. \" i am thankful … for the chance to serve the macau public. \" he did acknowledge shortfalls in his first term - culminating in a may rally against a proposed bill that would have lavished benefits on"

        "summary": "The families of hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by boko haram two years ago have been given fresh hope by what the nigerian military says is another rescue. A military spokesman says that \" miss serah luka, who is number 157 on the list of the abducted schoolgirls, \" was among 97 women and children rescued in a raid that killed at least 35 militants, reports the bbc, although a spokesman for the families of the girls kidnapped in the town of chibok denies that she is on the list. The military says luka, a pastor's daughter who joined the chibok school just two months before the mass kidnapping, is receiving medical treatment, the guardian reports. On tuesday, the military announced that it had rescued missing schoolgirl amina ali nkeki from the militants. Since then, she has met with president muhammadu buhari and so many other dignitaries that critics are accusing the government of putting a traumatized girl on parade in an effort to score political points. Nkeki was found by vigilantes in the sambisa forest after she ran away from a boko haram camp with a 4-month-old baby and a man she said was her husband. But while she was meeting the president, the husband was being interrogated as a suspected boko haram fighter, cnn reports. Some 217 schoolgirls are still missing, and nkeki has reportedly said that they are all still in forest camps, apart from six killed in a recent attack.",

It soon turned into the unluckiest break of his life: an hour into his accidental freedom, he got fatally attacked, reports abc30 in fresno. The strange chain of events began when jurors couldn't reach a unanimous verdict about pearson. Eight thought he was guilty and four didn't, and at that point — as the judge had explained to them — they should have sent a note saying they were deadlocked. Instead, they signed a not-guilty form. Judge w. Kent hamlin learned of the mistake only after the verdict had been read into the public record and had to release the career criminal, reports the fresno bee. Otherwise, hamlin would have declared a mistrial and ordered pearson held for a second trial. \" i can't believe it, \" he said in court. \" i can't change it because double jeopardy has already attached. This has never happened to me in more than 100 jury trials that i have done. \" upon being released at 11: 57pm wednesday, pearson went to his mother's house to collect some belongings and got into a fight with his sister's boyfriend, say police. He was stabbed, with a steak knife found next to his body, and was pronounced dead around 1: 25am. \" there's not a death penalty on a burglary, \" the prosecutor in pearson's case tells ap. \" i ' m not sitting here thinking he got what he deserved. \" ( click for another unusual courtroom story. )",

        "summary": "An illinois woman with five kids was arrested july 7 and briefly thrown in jail for an offense that the town of cahokia obviously feels strongly about: not mowing her lawn, the week reports. Single mom ebony conner tells kmov she was verbally warned by a municipal code-enforcement officer back in june and also told to get rid of garbage and broken-down cars from her driveway — but she thought she had more time to fix things, and she definitely didn't think she'd be hauled off to jail. \" i understand i violated a code, but … give me a ticket first, make me appear in court, \" she says. \" i know there's gotta be channels other than, ' if you don't cut your grass, we're arresting you right now. ' \" conner says she hails from wisconsin and has spent time in st. Louis, mo., and she'd never heard of such a thing in either place. While she was detained ( cops say she was held for about a half-hour in jail ), her five children remained at home, with just a code enforcement officer patrolling the outside of her house, conner says, adding, \" i said ' i don't trust him. I don't know him at all. ' … and they still hauled me off. \" she says she would've cut her grass by hand if she had known her long grass was an arrestable offense. The institute for justice lists similar cases that some consider to be an abuse of municipal code enforcement, including those in the town of pagedale, mo., where residents can be slammed with fines and tickets for such offenses as barbecuing in front of one's house, having mismatched curtains, and walking on the left-hand side of a crosswalk.

Many find themselves in a never-ending cycle of being fined because they have not kept their homes up to the city's standards and then are unable to fix their homes to fit the city's instructions because they are spending so much money paying off their fines. This leads to more fines, which prevents residents from making the changes the city demands, resulting in more fines, and so on. While a resident cannot be arrested for not having the ability to pay a fine, those who cannot pay often do not come to court. They, like those who choose their jobs or child care over attending municipal court, then become the subject of arrest warrants and fines for failure to appear. The perpetual governmental harassment of innocent americans for absurd violations has to stop. Ij has",

Business insider examines some of wikileaks ' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the cia was able to crack the encryption of apps like signal and whatsapp. Ben wizner, director of the aclu's speech, privacy, and technology project, tells the new york times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \" those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world, \" wizner says. \" patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer. \" forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the cia's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \" people need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions, \" says ajay arora, ceo of vera. \" at the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you — people can't even trust their own government anymore.

        "summary": "In a potentially unprecedented move for the state, a minnesota man is being charged with murder for allegedly driving his partner to suicide. According to the olmsted county attorney, long vang and jessica haban were together for 10 years. During that time, haban was subject to increasing levels of domestic violence. She was thrown into a wall by her hair and had a knife held to her throat, the huffington post reports. According to the minnesota star tribune, vang allegedly knocked haban unconscious multiple times and poured vegetable oil on her because she \" had bad in her. \" in may 2015, vang allegedly punched haban in the head, causing a traumatic brain injury, which led to depression. Despite a court order, vang repeatedly called and texted haban. She told a social worker she felt like vang had killed her. Haban sought mental health treatment, but vang threatened her, telling her she would lose custody of their two kids if she didn't stop getting medical care. Three days after leaving treatment in december 2015, haban killed herself. She was 28. Vang was arrested this month and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The county attorney believes haban killed herself to escape vang. It's extremely rare to be charged with murder for someone else's suicide. In what is called a \" depraved heart murder, \" prosecutors must prove vang \" did something that was very likely to kill \" while displaying \" complete disregard for human life, \" huffpo explains. The county attorney believes they can do so. Haban's mother tells the star tribune the charges mean \" there is finally going to be some justice for jessica. \"",

Operations against undocumented people. The lawsuit filed late tuesday in federal court in sacramento, calif., points out that the constitution gives the u.s. Government sweeping authority over immigration. Justice department lawyers argue that california is blocking enforcement efforts by the department of homeland security and imposing other, impermissible obligations on the federal government. Federal authorities said that evades common sense and has the potential to endanger communities in california and beyond. The new federal case represents an escalation of the long-running battle between the trump administration and california, whose democratic governor, jerry brown, and attorney general, xavier becerra, have positioned themselves as ideological opponents to the white house on matters from immigration and climate change to criminal justice. Echoing the tone and favored language of president trump on twitter, gov. Brown issued a statement tuesday night that called the federal lawsuit \" sad!!! \" and a political stunt. Last year, california lawmakers passed three immigration-related laws that feature prominently in the new lawsuit. One bars private employers from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials and requires businesses to notify workers in advance of a federal raid. A second law restricts state and local law enforcement from voluntarily sharing information with the feds about the release dates of undocumented people in their custody. That law also bars the transfer of undocumented people into federal custody. The third law under federal challenge covers state inspections of detention facilities that hold noncitizens in federal custody. The justice department is asking for a preliminary injunction to block those three laws. To advance their cause, federal lawyers cite a 2012 supreme court dispute, in which the obama administration sued arizona over its punitive law meant to crack down on immigrants there. A divided supreme court eventually ruled parts of the state law were \" pre-empted \" under the supremacy clause of the constitution.",
            "The case will test the power of the trump administration to force california police departments and local governments to cooperate with deportations and other aggressive enforcement actions targeting people who entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas. It reflects the administration's limited tolerance for state's rights when states want to go in a sharply different direction than the administration."

Richards iv, who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago, the daily mail reports. In a 2009 case that's only now coming to light, the news journal reports that delaware judge jan jurden sentenced richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation, plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program, because richards \" will not fare well \" in prison and \" treatment needs exceed need for punishment. \" the news journal calls it \" a rare and puzzling rationale \" from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing, especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers, and the mentally ill. While some attorneys say such a sentence isn't unheard of, a public defender notes that the case raises questions about \" how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system. \" a defense lawyer adds, \" i've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well... Who thrives in jail? \" a suit recently filed against richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple's two children. Initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, richards took a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory minimum prison sentence, the daily mail notes.",

Cbs news notes that the style — also known as the pussycat bow — was popular in the mid-1900s and a favorite of margaret thatcher. Quartz reports that this \" sartorial reverberation \" of donald trump's 2005 comments — which melania called \" unacceptable and offensive \" — wasn't any kind of jab or joke on her part, per cbs journalist sopan deb, who tweeted, \" campaign spokeswoman says this was not intentional. \" but the internet is a cynical bunch, with the cut's stella bugbee wistfully noting, \" i really want to believe the pussy bow was an artful act of silent rebellion, \" while george takei is simply incredulous: \" you can't make this stuff up. \" ( here's who won and lost the debate. )",

He says jones threatened both police and kameron's family, who didn't know her, just before deputies opened fire.
