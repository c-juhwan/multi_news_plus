            "Update, tuesday, 5: 07 p.m. Eastern: hugo chavez is dead. Click here for more updates. Original post: venezuela's vice president went on tv thursday evening to bat back rumors that hugo chávez has died. He didn't do much to encourage the venezuelan people about their president's health, either. Quite specifically, nicolás maduro said that chávez \" is battling there for his health, for his life, and we're accompanying him. \" besides implying that chávez is still alive, this does not actually offer any news of progress, since over two months ago maduro said the venezuelan president \" is fighting a great battle... For his life, for his health. \" two months of fighting for one's life is not encouraging. No worries. A recent poll says that nearly 60 percent of venezuelans believe chávez will recover and return to power. Maduro's latest however repetitive report about chávez's health came less than 24 hours after cnn chile falsely reported that the leader had died. The network attributed the news to panamanian diplomat guillermo cochez who said, \" i challenge the venezuelan government to prove me wrong, and to present president chávez so that it's known whether what i say is the truth or a lie. \" and so it appears"

The missoulian reports that in whitefish, where sherry spencer, mother of national policy institute head richard spencer — described by the southern poverty law center as \" a kind of professional racist in khakis \" — owns a building that, per the washington post, holds \" luxury vacation apartments and commercial office space. \" in a friday post on the daily stormer site, the headline blares \" jews targeting richard spencer's mother for harassment and extortion — take action! \" while the story calls jews \" a vicious, evil race of hate-filled psychopaths \" who \" will call you names and … go after your money [ and ] if all of that fails, they will attack your mother. \" the post references a recent daily mail piece in which sherry spencer says her business has been suffering because of backlash against her son, who's been publicly celebrating donald trump's win. To get back at community activists who've criticized sherry spencer for not denouncing her son's views, the daily stormer posted names, email addresses, phone numbers, and pictures of three local female activists, along with those of spouses and even an image and twitter handle for one of the women's young sons. The post notes local human-rights groups, as well as these three women and a few others, have been getting death threats. Sherry spencer penned a medium post friday noting: \" in what moral universe is it right for the'sins ' of the son to be visited upon the mother? \" richard spencer decried the \" vicious \" attacks to the post and said the daily stormer's posting of activists ' personal info is \" not really my style, \" though he didn't disavow it.

But rather than wake the neighbors in a search, morton left the house door open, hoping the dog would slip back inside. Nikita didn't return, and as morton later learned, the neighbors were already up. Trip kiss, who operates a petting zoo for kids with disabilities, had spotted the husky chewing on some of his animals, left scattered across a 2-block radius. In all, the dog attacked \" two rabbits, two ducks, five chickens, a turkey, [ and ] a goose, \" kiss tells fox 13, while police say another neighbor reported the loss of more than a dozen chickens. \" i didn't think she was going to go on a killing spree, \" says morton, who's vowed to pay $ 1,350 in damages. She just \" doesn't do that kind of stuff, \" she tells buzzfeed. Still, morton is facing one charge of an animal running at large and 27 misdemeanor counts for each animal attacked by the dog, captured hours later and taken to an animal shelter. Police will decide if nikita should be released back into morton's care, taken to a rescue, or euthanized, fox 13 reports. Despite the loss of a specially trained goose \" so friendly … it would follow us around, \" kiss doesn't think the dog should be killed since morton is the one who \" could have prevented this \" ( in a facebook comment, he also suggests there might have been an intentional angle to all this ).

        "summary": "Do people learn better by being rewarded for the right behavior — or punished for doing wrong? a new study offers a harsh answer: the stick beats the carrot. Researchers at washington university of st. Louis had 88 students perform a challenging task. Some listened to a randomized bunch of clicks in each ear and had to say which side heard more; others saw flashing lights on the left and right of a screen and had to make a similar judgment. Each time they made a decision, they either got a reward — a token worth a randomized amount from 5 to 25 cents — or a punishment, in the form of losing such a token, science daily reports. When subjects received a reward, they were more likely to repeat the same answer the next time around, and the bigger the reward, the more likely they were to stick with the same answer. But when subjects were punished, they were careful to avoid repeating the same answer, and the amount of the sum lost didn't seem to matter. Ultimately, punishments had two to three times the effect on behavior seen with rewards, researchers found. The findings run counter to much current practice in education and management, the telegraph notes. \" negative feedback may be more effective than positive feedback at modifying behavior, \" says a researcher. But \"such feedback does not have to be harsh, since it appears that we tend to react in the same manner to any amount of negative feedback. \" in other words, the stick doesn't have to be so big.

And when her baby needed it, she didn't hesitate to feed her. Afterwards, she wrote on twitter: \" so proud that my daughter alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal parliament! we need more #women &amp; parents in parli. \"",
            "The australian senate is used to childish behaviour but next week could deliver a legitimate outcry from an actual child. Just 10 weeks after giving birth, queensland senator larissa waters is returning to work with her daughter, alia joy, in tow – and she plans to breastfeed her in the senate chamber. Media_camera senator larissa waters at work with partner jeremy gates, who has scaled back his digital marketing agency to be a full-time dad. Picture: jono searle breastfeeding has been permitted in the chamber since 2003, but alia will be the first. \"if she's hungry, that's what you do, you feed your baby, \" senator waters said. The 40-year-old greens senator last year successfully extended breastfeeding rules in the senate to include caring for an infant. Media_camera kelly o'dwyer – with then four-month-old olivia – managed to survive a push to unseat her as a cabinet minister after she gave birth. Media_camera greens senator sarah hanson-young in 2009, around the time that two-year-old kora was infamously ejected from the senate. She will be joined in canberra by her partner, jeremy gates, who has scaled back his digital marketing agency to be a full-time dad. He can bring alia into the chamber when she needs some mother time. \"i hope she doesn't squawk her head off too much, but she's probably going to be better behaved than many of the people in that room, \" senator waters said. In 2009, senator sarah ­hanson-young's two-year-old daughter, kora, was infamously ejected from the senate. Senator waters said the rule changes were designed to encourage more parenting australians to enter parliament to ensure it is representative of the community. \"it is important we make all workplaces more family friendly, not just parliament, \" she said. Senator waters said the recent unsuccessful push to unseat cabinet minister and fellow new mum kelly o'dwyer shows how women still face workplace discrimination. \"that was atrocious, but sadly, it's not that uncommon, \""

        "summary": "The jokes of a \" trump-kim \" summit came flying fast after kim kardashian met with the president wednesday at the white house, but one snarky headline isn't going over so well. Per huffpost, kardashian was there to talk to trump about criminal justice reform and to press for a pardon for 63-year-old alice marie johnson, who's serving a life sentence for a non-violent drug offense. The new york post tweeted out an advance look at its thursday morning cover about the meeting: a photo of kim k and trump posing in the oval office along with a headline that read: \" the other big ass summit: trump meets rump. \" kardashian is also referred to as \" kim thong un \" on the cover. It's a riff on both the canceled summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un, as well as on a part of kardashian's body, which doesn't have anything to do with prison reform — and many aren't happy about it. Cnn calls the cover \" appalling, \" while mashable's own headline reads \" wildly sexist new york post front page refers to kim kardashian's butt 3 times. \" even those who aren't fans of either kim k or trump say the cover is out of line. One big name in particular was miffed. \" disgusting headline, @nypost, \" alyssa milano tweeted. \" @kimkardashian was meeting with president trump about a critical issue and you lead with her ass? this is unacceptable sexism. No woman deserves this. \" the daily beast dives into a related take: trump's own \" ugly history of misogynistic comments \" on kardashian's appearance.",

The news journal reports investment group fe partners will acquire the uss sequoia for $ 0. The 104-foot yacht was built in 1926, according to reuters.

The sequoia changed hands multiple times before being acquired by lawyer gary silversmith in 2000. He used it for private charters before borrowing multiple millions from fe partners for repairs in 2012. That kicked off a years-long legal battle between the two parties. This week, judge sam glasscock found silversmith fell down on his part of the loan agreement to keep \" america's most famous boat \" in good condition. \" the sequoia... Is sitting on an inadequate cradle on an undersized marine railway in a moribund boatyard... Deteriorating and, lately, home to raccoons, \" glasscock writes. The loan agreement allowed fe partners to buy the sequoia back, and after deducting a number of costs — including repairs estimated at potentially more than $ 4 million — glasscock ruled \" free \" to be a fair price. Silversmith says he's concerned fe partners, which is backed by a wealthy indian family, will move the sequoia overseas. But the investment group says it plans to restore it \" so that future generations of americans will be able to enjoy the storied past of this magnificent yacht. \" ( eva braun's things, found in an abandoned bunker, have been sold. )",

In his lifetime, washington bested smallpox, malaria, infections, abscesses, tuberculosis, dysentery, and a boil \" the size of two fists. \" and that's not even mentioning the battles he survived. Washington claimed that during the french and indian war, four bullets ripped through his coat and two horses were shot while he rode them. He apparently had so many close calls he was rumored to be dead. Yet somehow he managed to live to 67. Washington's resilience was all the more impressive as he was living at time with, as the new england journal of medicine puts it, \" no well-defined concept of infection... No vaccines, almost no specific or effective treatments for infections diseases. \" as an illustration of this point, washington finally died in 1799 when he came down with a sore throat and chills after riding around his property in the snow, according to the washington papers. Doctors tried everything to cure him — from molasses mixed with butter, to vinegar mixed with sage tea, to removing five pints of blood from the former president. None of it worked. A friend described washington's \" dignified \" final words, which were — frankly — a long time coming: \" i am just going... Tis well. \" ( thomas jefferson's home is getting a renovation with slave sally hemings in mind. )",

That's because those sites, and dozens of others, experienced annoying disruptions ( or were down completely for some ) as a large distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attack took place on a major domain host company, gizmodo reports. Then, just a couple of hours after host dyn announced it had restored everything to normal, a second strike against its infrastructure came through. Downdetector.com's outage map showed huge red blotches across the parts of the us, with the east coast getting slammed the hardest. Gizmodo lays out the technical explainer, labeling dns ( domain name server ) hosts as the \" internet's phone book, \" serving as a conduit to bring users to certain websites. If a dns host like dyn goes down or is otherwise adversely affected, it can have repercussions for all of the sites under its umbrella. The krebs on security blog, meanwhile, describes a ddos attack, defining it as \" when crooks use a large number of hacked or ill-configured systems to flood a target site with so much junk traffic that it can no longer serve legitimate visitors. \" gizmodo lists all of the sites apparently plagued with issues friday, while the atlantic ponders an even more dire situation: what would happen if something like this took place on election day.

On friday, an appeals court upheld the september 2015 decision to hold him in contempt of court, leaving rawls locked up without charge, almost entirely in solitary confinement. The man, suspected of possessing hundreds of images of children being sexually abused in part due to his own sister's testimony that she had seen some of them, has said he doesn't remember the passwords; his sister disputes that, reports the guardian. \" he holds the key to his own cell, \" one attorney says. Regardless, organizations like the electronic frontier foundation and american civil liberties union argue it is rawls ' fifth amendment right to not incriminate himself. The ap explains the counter-argument: something called a \" foregone conclusion exception \" to the fifth amendment. What that means is because evidence of a crime exists ( his sister's testimony, provocative photos of a 6-year-old on an iphone he did unlock, and electronic fingerprints — \" hash \" values — that suggest he downloaded thousands of child abuse files ), his rights regarding self-incrimination aren't being breached. The eff and aclu counter that prosecutors can't show with \" reasonable particularity \" that it knows the images exist. Ars technica reports that the supreme court has never ruled on a forced decryption issue.

Several high-profile cases involving unarmed black men being killed by police or while in police custody have reignited a national conversation on race and the criminal justice system. Why the prosecutorial makeup matters, per the release: prosecutors decide whether a case is worth pursuing, whether a crime is a misdemeanor or felony, and how much jail time the defendant may face, if any. \" elected prosecutors have an enormous influence on the pursuit of justice in america, yet four out of five of them are white men whose life experiences do not reflect those of most americans, \" the wdn's website states. The president of the national black prosecutors association agrees, telling the times: \" when you walk into a courtroom and no one looks like you, do you think you are going to get a fair shake? \" and it might not be that easy to shake things up, the founder of the equal justice initiative nonprofit tells the times, noting most prosecutors, once elected, serve for a long time. \" i think what these numbers dramatize is that the reality is much worse than most people imagine and that we are making almost no progress, \" he says.

That disease is acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ), a cancer that the american cancer society estimates will kill more than 10,000 people in 2015 — roughly half the number of newly diagnosed cases. Now canadian professor paul spagnuolo says a lipid in avocados called avocatin b targets leukemia stem cells without damaging healthy cells. \" it's an exciting time for our lab, \" he says. \" not only does avocatin b eliminate the source of aml, but its targeted, selective effects make it less toxic to the body, too. \" don't hold your breath, though: spagnuolo says the drug he's designing is still years away. There aren't many drugs on the market for aml, a cancer that turns blood stem cells into abnormal ones, which then proliferate in the bone marrow, push out healthy cells, and cause infections that are often fatal. Among seniors older than 65, the disease kills in more than 90 % of cases within five years; the average age of an aml patient is 67. \" the stem cell is really the cell that drives the disease, \" says spagnuolo, whose new work appears in cancer research. \" the stem cell is largely responsible for the disease developing and it's the reason why so many patients with leukemia relapse. \" the university of waterloo professor is now seeking a commercial partnership so he can conduct clinical trials, where aml patients would take his drug for the first time.

Most will be in adults. About 10,430 deaths from aml. Almost all will be in adults. Acute myeloid leukemia is generally a disease of older people and is uncommon before the age of 45.

Millions of fannie mae and freddie mac loans — about half of america's mortgages — aren't part of the plan, either. Economists have mixed expectations regarding the settlement's effects. In the long term, it should help the housing market recover, bloomberg notes, though economists tell the times they don't expect this to be a huge win for the economy because banks have three years to dole out the money. And in the immediate future, things could get harder for struggling homeowners. Foreclosures slowed as banks and officials negotiated the deal; now that it's done, we may see another rash of home seizures. \" it is frankly a headline victory for both banks and attorneys general with a modest impact on the housing market, \" an analyst tells the wall street journal.",

Tyson traveled to suriname as part of the new fusion tv documentary series outpost, and was soundly beaten when he entered a bird in a songbird contest, a cherished local tradition. Cameras captured iron mike as he learned about the contest, located a bird to enter — he dubbed the tiny guy \" little mike \" — but then suffered a tko when a competing champion cheeped and peeped more than his bird did in the same 15-minute period. \" little mike let us down, man. I was in his corner, though, \" said tyson. \" it was just amazing meeting the people, meeting the culture — i had a great time. \" the series, kicking off on sunday with tyson's episode, mixes travel adventure, history, and journalism to shine a light on global stories. The first season focuses on latin america and includes as hosts the late show with stephen colbert bandleader jon batiste, brain games star jason silva, and transgender model carmen carrera. Spanish versions air on unimas. Tyson was lured onto the show by the chance to visit a country he'd never heard of and his love of birds. The former boxer has loved pigeons and kept them since he was a kid in brooklyn. ( sunday's show recorded the moment tyson lovingly released his bird in suriname. ) \" my wife always says the reason i keep my pigeons is they connect me to my childhood, \" tyson said. \" once it's in your blood, it never leaves.

They're reportedly \" free-climbing \" the building; part of its exterior is built like a ladder, the bbc reports. The shard is between the three headquarters of shell, greenpeace says, and it resembles a piece of ice. At the top, says a climber, \" we ' ll try to hang a huge art installation... That will make shell think twice before sending their rigs into the arctic. \" the climbers, who have been live-streaming the event via head-mounted cameras, are all highly trained, says a rep.

A video of the hoopla — uploaded to youtube by a school district staffer — has now gone viral, with more than half a million views in two days. \" i didn't think it would take off the way it did, \" said becchio, who arrived to school the day before to find his possessions had been shrink-wrapped. \" it was kind of a special send-off. \" the school district added, per kltv, \" it was a senior prank that delighted students and staff. \" apparently becchio should be thankful the entertainment lasted only a short time. Last year, students of west linn high school in oregon pulled the same trick on their principal, only the music lasted three hours, today reports. ( officials at this new jersey high school weren't as impressed with their school's senior prank, which ended in 62 arrests. )",

        "summary": "Both parties agree that america's infrastructure is in need of some serious work after decades of under-investment, but the $ 1.5 trillion plan president trump plans to roll out monday is still expected to be controversial — especially because of disagreements over where the $ 1.5 trillion is supposed to come from. The plan involves around $ 200 billion in federal funding over 10 years, to be taken from cuts to other programs, including $ 100 billion in incentives to state and local governments to stimulate spending on infrastructure such as highways, ports, and airports, reports reuters. Democrats had sought greater federal funding and new revenue, possibly through a hike in the gas tax, though white house aides say the trump plan is just the starting point for negotiations. The proposal requires cities, counties, and states to put up at least 80 % of a project's cost themselves before they can get 20 % federal funding, which reverses the 80-20 federal-state funding split in place for many highways, npr reports. The federal funding to be announced monday also includes around $ 50 billion toward rural infrastructure projects. Jay timmons, president of the national association of manufacturers, praised the proposals, the ap reports. \" when ports are clogged, trucks are delayed, power is down, water is shut off, or the internet has a lapse, modern manufacturers ' ability to compete is threatened and jobs are put at risk, \" he said. \" there is no excuse for inaction. \" critics, however, said the plan needs more federal investment — and called moves to speed the approval process, including reducing environmental reviews, a \" corporate giveaway. \"",

For one thing, the traditional \" male breadwinner \" household is being obliterated as an \" alpha wife \" emerges, particularly in working and middle class families. Female wages are rising as men's fall, and women are nabbing 60 % of college degrees. Pair that with the fact that women are becoming more sexually confident, aggressive, and violent, and you're left with men that are simply \" outmoded, \" rosin writes. So what does that mean? well, basically it's \" the end of men \" as we've known them for 40,000 years, rosin argues, but never fear, guys: \" obsolete does not mean worthless. We don't have to turn men into eunuchs. We can keep whatever we like about manhood but adjust the parts of the definition that are keeping men back, \" she explains. And if you're wondering what the world looks like after \" the end of men, \" rosin imagines something like this: \" if [ my son ] chooses to take his kids to a playground at 3 in the afternoon on a tuesday, no one will look at him funny...

        "summary": "It's crunch time for brexit, and investors are on high alert. British lawmakers were — maybe — set to vote tuesday on prime minister theresa may's brexit deal with the european union, reports the ap. All indications are that she would suffer a major defeat, opening up a dizzying array of consequences that could increase volatility in global financial markets. On monday, however, the bbc quoted two government sources who said the vote will be canceled. May was expected to clear things up in a speech monday afternoon. That wasn't the only wrinkle: europe's top court boosted the hopes of people who want to stay in the eu by ruling monday that britain could change its mind about leaving. When an eu member country has notified its intent to leave, \" that member state is free to revoke unilaterally that notification, \" said the european court of justice, per the ap. Britain voted in 2016 to leave the 28-nation bloc and invoked article 50 of the eu's lisbon treaty in march 2017, triggering a two-year exit process. May has worked out a deal with the eu to make that happen, and britain's parliament was to vote on it tuesday. Defeat of may's deal could suggest that britain is one step closer to dropping out of the eu in march with no deal at all, a worst-case scenario that most economic commentators, including the bank of england, say would lead to a savage recession. Another possibility: after a defeat of may's deal, parliament could vote again on a revised version and back it. Or it could coalesce around another brexit deal that would see britain retain very close links to the european single market. There could even be a second referendum on britain's exit from the eu.",

The consensus? it was all a bit weird: \" scripts, it turns out, were invented for a reason, \" writes jessica gelt in the los angeles times.

And what was up with eminem winning artist of the year? sure, 60 million youtube viewers voted, so the result was democratic — but \" youtube is famous largely thanks to its rich landscape of unknown creators who post videos of themselves singing eminem songs or put their own oddball visions up onscreen and cross their fingers that they ' ll be discovered, \" writes gelt in a separate times article. \" shouldn't youtube try harder to honor its own? \" \" unfortunately, [ the show ] got distracted by its own gimmick, and the chaos overwhelmed the otherwise inspired performances and subsequent dance parties, \" writes hilary hughes for usa today.

The remote enclave of 2,000 people has reportedly experienced suicides for decades, but the latest string is so worrisome that the attawapiskat community is pleading for help. Resident jackie hookimaw says the latest string of deaths was spurred by the fall suicide of her 13-year-old great-niece. Chief bruce shisheesh tells the cbc that 101 people between the ages of 11 and 71 have attempted suicide since september; one has died. \" i ' m asking friends, government, that we need help in our community, \" shisheesh says. \" i have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives. \" members of the attawapiskat community say citizens suffering from drug abuse, overcrowding, and bullying — as well as intense poverty, per the bbc — don't receive enough government help. \" when a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team, \" the area's mp tells the post, calling the problem a \" rolling nightmare \" often left to untrained teachers, cops, and parents to handle. \" the northern communities are left on their own. \" there are four health-care workers, but they lack training and are \" burned out \" and \" backlogged, \" says the deputy grand chief of the mushkegowuk council, representing eight ontario first nations.

        "summary": "Nearly a century ago, historian sidney perley identified the place in salem, mass., where 19 accused witches met their end in 1692; now, finally, confirmation. The salem news reports that the seven scholars who compose the gallows hill project have after a five-year effort definitively determined that proctor's ledge was where the executions took place. One of those scholars, emerson baker, writes in the oxford university press blog that the hangings had \" broadly \" been considered to have taken place on gallows hill, which comprises many acres. Perley had zeroed in on the proctor's ledge location near the hill's base, with the city in 1936 even dubbing a small part of the area there \" witch memorial land. \" but baker explains that land went unmarked, and the belief that the hill's summit was the infamous spot returned. Though there is a dearth of eyewitness accounts of the hangings, one big clue came via the witch trials court record dated aug. 19 of that fateful year. Accused witch rebecca eames traveled to the court via the boston road; when asked whether she'd passed an execution that morning, she answered that she saw some \" folks \" there while at the \" house below the hill, \" which the scholars ultimately identified as one of a few homes on boston street. A \" view-shed analysis \" revealed it was possible to plainly see the top of proctor's ledge, but not the top of gallows hill, from this location. Today the wooded area overlooks a walgreens, notes the boston globe, which adds the city plans to mark the location with a \" modest \" memorial.

            "We now know the precise location where 19 innocent victims were hanged for witchcraft in salem in 1692. I am honored to be a member of the gallows hill project team who has worked with the city of salem to confirm the location on a lower section of gallows hill known as proctor's ledge. And i am pleased too that the city has already begun planning to properly memorialize the site. The executions on gallows hill were the climax of one of the most famous events in american history, but the hangings themselves are poorly documented. The precise location and events surrounding the executions have been, until this point, generally lost to history. Tradition has simply placed it broadly on gallows hill, which covers many acres of land. In the seventeenth century, gallows hill was common land located just outside the boundary of the city of salem, then defined by a protective palisade ( a fortified wall ). Most people have traditionally placed the execution site at the top of gallows hill. In the early twentieth century, the eminent salem historian sidney perley studied the issue and settled on the proctor's ledge location, an area bounded today by proctor and pope streets, near the",
            "Salem's witch trials were a memory by the time artist thomas satterwhite noble painted \"the salem martyr \" in 1869. He portrays a young girl found guilty of witchcraft walking to the gallows with the hangman and her stern judges. Salem — the wooded spot overlooking walgreens on boston street is unremarkable. The rocky ledge of knotted trees is surrounded by houses, and the path to the top is unpaved. But the days of anonymity for the site known as proctor's ledge are over. Researchers announced this week they have confirmed the plot is where 19 people accused of witchcraft were hanged in a wave of hysteria that swept this seaside city in 1692.

            "We now know the precise location where 19 innocent victims were hanged for witchcraft in salem in 1692. I am honored to be a member of the gallows hill project team who has worked with the city of salem to confirm the location on a lower section of gallows hill known as proctor's ledge. And i am pleased too that the city has already begun planning to properly memorialize the site. The executions on gallows hill were the climax of one of the most famous events in american history, but the hangings themselves are poorly documented. The precise location and events surrounding the executions have been, until this point, generally lost to history. Tradition has simply placed it broadly on gallows hill, which covers many acres of land. In the seventeenth century, gallows hill was common land located just outside the boundary of the city of salem, then defined by a protective palisade ( a fortified wall ). Most people have traditionally placed the execution site at the top of gallows hill. In the early twentieth century, the eminent salem historian sidney perley studied the issue and settled on the proctor's ledge location, an area bounded today by proctor and pope streets, near the",

            "Salem's witch trials were a memory by the time artist thomas satterwhite noble painted \"the salem martyr \" in 1869. He portrays a young girl found guilty of witchcraft walking to the gallows with the hangman and her stern judges. Salem — the wooded spot overlooking walgreens on boston street is unremarkable. The rocky ledge of knotted trees is surrounded by houses, and the path to the top is unpaved. But the days of anonymity for the site known as proctor's ledge are over. Researchers announced this week they have confirmed the plot is where 19 people accused of witchcraft were hanged in a wave of hysteria that swept this seaside city in 1692.

After making a smooth landing in san juan at 12: 01pm despite strengthening winds and decreasing visibility, it was able to take off again after a mere 40 minutes on the ground with 173 passengers and crew. As the last commercial flight out of san juan before the airport closed, it had to make its way to safety between the outer bands of the hurricane, wired reports. Aviation analyst jason rabinowitz was among those closely watching the flight. \" now dl302 has to climb out of sju, and they're doing so between the outer band of #irma and the core of the storm, \" he tweeted. \" amazing stuff. \" delta says flight and ground crews made an incredible effort to turn the aircraft around in the face of the hurricane. \" our meteorology team is the best in the business, \" says a delta vp, per usa today. \" they took a hard look at the weather data and the track of the storm and worked with the flight crew and dispatcher to agree it was safe to operate the flight. \"",

        "summary": "Looks like walmart stores blew past their competition in mexico by doling out millions of dollars in bribes — and, when the scandal came to light, sweeping it deftly under the rug, the new york times reports. Former walmart de mexico executive sergio cicero zapata revealed the payoffs in 2005, triggering alarm bells at walmart's headquarters in bentonville, ark. ( $ 27 million in foreign bribes would, after all, violate us law ). But records show that walmart execs handed off the investigation to their mexican general counsel — himself accused of authorizing bribes. In his hands, the probe slowly died. Top executives at walmart de mexico had allegedly kept the bribery system hidden from bentonville for years while payoffs continued to buy zoning approvals, lower environmental impact fees, and the support of local leaders. In particular, cicero blames walmart's highly ambitious former chief executive in mexico, eduardo castro-wright, for keeping the bribery system alive ( even though walmart promoted him to vice-chairman in 2008 ). As for walmart, it posted a press release today saying it has met with us authorities and is \" deeply concerned by these allegations. \"",

Among other things, they gobble up insects and are themselves a food source for larger predators. \" this is the hot bed in the world for diversity of amphibians, and if that fungus gets here, it's going to be devastating, \" says study author vance vredenburg of san francisco state university. The culprit is batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, or bsal, the cousin of a fungus lethal to frogs. \" this fungus is much worse, \" says a berkeley researcher, per the la times. \" bsal is an acute infection that just turns them into little masses of slime in three to four days. \" researchers think it originated in asia and has since spread to europe via the pet trade. Given that thousands of salamanders are imported to the us yearly from asia, the researchers say it's only a matter of time before catastrophe strikes here — unless something is done. Two environmental groups have petitioned the us fish and wildlife service to take action, but the christian science monitor quotes a spokesperson who says that probably won't happen anytime soon because the conservation law in question isn't set up for use \" on an emergency basis. \" ( a much older fungus may have gotten dinosaurs high. )",

While he didn't strike down the state's entire 2011 voter id law, judge james peterson did repeal big chunks of it, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. Limits on early voting have been removed, as has a requirement that voters must live in wisconsin for 28 days prior to the election. According to the ap, expired student ids will also once again be valid at the polls. Wisconsin's voter id law had been accused of unfairly targeting african-americans, latinos, and other people likely to vote democrat. However, an appeal of friday's ruling could keep the restrictions in place for november's election.",

( ap ) — a federal judge threw out multiple aspects of wisconsin's voter id law on friday, leaving the law itself intact but ruling unconstitutional many restrictions on voting passed by the gop-controlled legislature and republican gov. Scott walker. Two liberal groups filed a lawsuit in may challenging the laws, including a requirement that voters show photo identification. U.s. District judge james peterson agreed with arguments that the laws were enacted to benefit republicans and make it harder for democratic supporters to vote, and ordered a range of changes. He ordered the state to quickly issue credentials valid for voting to anyone trying to obtain a free photo id for voting. He struck down a restriction limiting municipalities to one location for in-person absentee voting, time limits on in-person absentee voting, an increase in residency requirements from 10 to 28 days, and a prohibition on using expired but otherwise qualifying student ids to vote. Earlier friday, a federal appeals court blocked a north carolina law that required voters to produce photo identification and included other provisions disproportionately affecting black voters.

        "summary": "A uk wine bar is in the hole for a $ 155,000 fine after a teen ingested a liquid nitrogen shot given to her on the house, became instantly ill, and had to have her stomach removed, the guardian reports. Gaby scanlon, now 20, was with friends at oscar's wine bar and bistro in lancaster in october 2012 to celebrate her 18th birthday when one of the staff handed her a free \" nitro-jagermeister \" shot. \" i turned to the man and asked if it was ok to drink, \" scanlon told a preston crown court yesterday. \" he said ' yes.'smoke was coming from my nose and mouth. Straight away i knew something was not right. \" it wasn't: internal tissue was destroyed and her stomach lining perforated, and she had to undergo emergency surgery to remove her stomach and have her small bowel attached to her esophagus. The bar's director was said to have been \" intrigued by the dramatic effect \" of a similar drink at a london hotel, so he decided to bring it to oscar's. But a local health inspector had been concerned about the offering when he checked out the bar in may 2012 and had sent the bar a letter with notes on the safe way for liquid nitrogen drinks — which the bbc says aren't illegal — to be consumed; he says he never heard back from the bar. Scientists say the drink has to completely settle down and the liquid must evaporate before it's consumed, the broadcaster notes. The lawyer for the family that owns the bar says they're \" mortified \" and that \" at no time did they see anything warning them of the risks of ingestion, \" though they blamed the incident on their own \" ignorance. \" scanlon, meanwhile, now experiences \" episodes of agonizing pain \" and has a limited diet, per the bbc.

But the funding deadline is friday, and obama has warned that states will feel the economic pain if dhs shuts down and tens of thousands of workers are furloughed. Meanwhile, republicans are divided over the effect of a texas judge blocking obama's immigration order: some say it supports their fight in congress, while others say the courts should handle it. \" leave it to the courts, \" says sen.

The site at the qumran cliffs, an israeli-controlled site in the west bank, has yielded artifacts including pieces of pottery, broken scroll storage jars, and even an unbroken jar containing a scroll, though researchers later found it was blank, cnn reports. Clues including old pickaxes have led the hebrew university team to believe that the site was ransacked in the 1940s or 1950s by looters who made off with ancient scrolls. There is \" no doubt we have a new scroll cave, \" oren gutfeld, chief archaeologist on the dig, tells the times of israel. \" only the scrolls themselves are not there. \" researchers believe the scrolls looted from the cave were sold on the black market many years ago, possibly as long ago as 1947. Gutfeld says the discovery of the cave upends the theory that the scrolls were held in only 11 caves, because this was definitely a 12th. His team plans to survey more of the hundreds of caves in the area in the hope of finding more of the scrolls, which held ancient religious and historical writings.

        "summary": "A 51-year-old woman was found guilty thursday of kidnapping a newborn in 1997 as the girl's mother slept in a hospital in cape town, south africa. The unnamed defendant had pleaded not guilty, insisting she adopted the infant and \" didn't know the baby was stolen. \" incredibly, the girl was reunited with her biological parents, celeste and morne nurse, last year after befriending a girl at school who resembled her — and who ended up being her younger sister. The nurses cried as the verdict was read; the defendant had also cried in court while testifying about being barred from seeing the girl she'd raised as her daughter. She testified that she had miscarried a baby in 1996 without telling her husband, then paid a woman to find her an infant to adopt, and that when the woman did so, the defendant told her husband the baby was theirs. The judge rejected that story as \" a fairytale, \" the guardian reports, adding, \" you must have been the person who removed the child from [ the ] hospital. \" she was convicted of kidnapping, fraud ( she registered the child as her own daughter in 2003 and changed her birthdate ), and contravening child protection laws; the judge said she faces 10 years in prison when she's sentenced on may 30. As for the abducted girl, news24 says that she's still living with the husband of the defendant, who raised her as his daughter. The now-18-year-old issued a statement sunday in which she ripped media portrayal of the case and seemed to imply she still considers the couple who raised her to be her family: \" how would your daughter or son feel when their skin feels ripped [ off ] their face? because of you.

While many cases are believed to be hoaxes or copycat events stemming from original cases in queensland, sewing needles and pins have been found in strawberries from various brands in all six australian states, while two other cases involve an apple and banana, reports cnn.

As forensic experts begin the task of identifying victims, the ap takes a haunting look at some of their last days and hours. These are their stories: an 11-year-old plagued by thoughts of death couldn't stop hugging his mom the night before he boarded flight 17. Ahead of his trip to visit his grandmother in bali with his brother, miguel panduwinata kept asking his mother questions like: \"how would you choose to die? what would happen to my body if i was buried? would i not feel anything because our souls go back to god? \" a poignant kiss at the airport was the last contact an indonesian woman had with her dutch fiance. Christine had met 53-year-old willem grootscholten last year in indonesia and they quickly clicked. Her two kids had started to call him \" daddy \" and they all ate long-distance meals together via skype. Right before he boarded flight 17, he told christine he \" wanted to spend the rest of his life beside her. \" an australian couple who made an annual monthlong trip with friends almost backed out of this year's vacation, but their schedule changed and they opted back in — with a return flight on mh17 ( the couple they traveled with booked a different flight ). Friends of albert and maree rizk asked them if they were spooked flying the airline after flight 370 disappeared. Albert's response: \" lightning never strikes twice. \" the full ap story about flight 17's victims is here.",

His contractor has taken out five construction permits that add up to more than $ 1.6 million in remodel costs, and workers at the house tell the san francisco chronicle they think the construction will actually cost a few million more than that — and will take an entire year to complete. The chronicle describes the 5,542-square-foot dolores heights house as \" pretty well stripped to the studs \" at this point. Zuck and wife priscilla chan bought the home for $ 9.9 million in november, according to mission local, but they have yet to confirm they actually own it, nor have they shown their faces to workers. Among other expenditures, the zuckerbergs will spend $ 720,000 to add a number of new rooms, including an office, media room, laundry room, wine room, mud room, and wet bar, plus $ 60,000 on a greenhouse. Workers are also currently putting in a new basement garage with a turntable for cars.

Since 2001, the number of new infections per year has decreased 33 %, a number that's even more substantial among children: that category saw a 52 % drop. In the span of a year, the number of new infections sank by 200,000, to 2.3 million last year. The caribbean claims the biggest drop in new infections since 2001: 49 %. In sub-saharan africa, that figure is 34 %. Antiretroviral drugs now reach 9.7 million people in low- and middle-income countries. And the afp notes that on wednesday, a top un official noted that the hiv epidemic — though not hiv itself — could be kaput by 2030. But the guardian flags some problem spots, particularly in africa, where some countries have seen a decrease in condom use ( niger, senegal, uganda ), a rise in the number of sexual partners ( uganda as well, along with ethiopia, rwanda, and south africa ), and withering support for social-behavior campaigns.",
