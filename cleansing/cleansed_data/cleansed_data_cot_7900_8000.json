She will be the first woman to head the bank. Most european nations supported lagarde from the beginning, and indonesia, egypt, and several other african nations backed her as well. \"we are encouraged by the broad support she has secured, \" tim geithner said earlier, praising her \"exceptional talent and broad experience. \" but the appointment is likely to draw protests from the developing world, which had hoped to break the informal arrangement that ensures the imf is always headed by a european and the world bank by an american, the ap reports.",

The airline quickly removed the tweet and apologized, claiming it was unintentional. Apparently the image had been tweeted at us airways earlier from another twitter user, and \" we captured the tweet to flag it as inappropriate, \" us airways said in a statement, according to usa today.

In october 2011, a 32-year-old woman underwent an operation at queen's hospital outside of london; maria de jesus was suffering from appendicitis and needed to have her appendix removed. Instead, her right ovary was taken out, and de jesus, who was 21 weeks pregnant with her fourth child at the time, ended up dying roughly three weeks later. The case is now in front of a medical tribunal, which is weighing the medical fates of the two doctors involved, then-trainee surgeon dr. Yahya al-abed, and dr. Babatunde coker, who was supposed to be supervising him. During the oct. 23 surgery, de jesus began to bleed \" quite heavily.... In the midst of this, mr. Al-abed removed what he clearly believed to be the appendix. He thought he found it, removed it, and gave to a nurse what later turned out to be patient a's ovary, \" the tribunal heard. Coker, who was eating lunch at the time, was never summoned, nor was he aware the surgery was taking place. The mistake wasn't uncovered until much later. The telegraph reports that de jesus returned to the hospital in severe pain on nov. 7; two days later another doctor realized she still had her appendix, and the next day she went into surgery to have it actually removed. Instead, she died on the or table, having earlier delivered a stillborn boy. Her cause of death was ruled as multiple organ failure due to septicemia. The press association reports the hearing will likely last a month. ( a new york man is suing over an appendix mix-up of his own. )",

But first, he might want to get people to stop calling him a jerk. \" politico raised the issue yesterday in a piece headlined \" john kasich's anger management. \" it notes that while other big-name politicians such as bill clinton and chris christie are known for their tempers, kasich seems to stand apart because his reputation for surliness and for belittling those with whom he disagrees has dogged him his entire political career. The story cites a fairly recent example as kasich was courting a wealthy donor who questioned whether the governor was entering the race too late. This would be a great time to keep the temper in check, but politico says kasich \" snapped \" back, \" you don't know what you're talking about. \" in an analysis of kasich's pros and cons, jonathan martin at the new york times also takes note of the reputation: \" and then there is his persona, which can range from oversharing to irascible: it makes for great copy — both for journalists and for opponents hungry for fodder for attack ads. \"",

Ians reports that the team was on the hunt for pre-columbian sites on the archipelago, which sits off the southernmost point of the mainland, roughly 2,200 miles from buenos aires. They uncovered wood, metal, and seven cannonballs from la purisima concepcion, a spanish ship that was en route to callao, peru, and went down on jan. 10 before reaching cape horn. The shipwreck, the oldest known in those parts, didn't end with all those aboard meeting a watery grave: instead, many of the 193 who sailed on the concepcion survived and spent two months ashore, where they lived among the natives and constructed smaller boats that took them to buenos aires, reports afp, which adds that the archaeologists were able to determine exactly where the ship went down — though they're not telling. \" it is not a galleon loaded with gold and pearls like in the movies; it's just a supply ship, \" says the lead archaeologist. \" but we have chosen not to disclose the exact location so as not to encourage anyone to go souvenir hunting. \" next up: a search for the castaways ' campsite.

A half-century ago, the church largely condemned communism and embraced democracy, along with its underlying free-market system. The pope made clear yesterday that those days are long gone. \" this is more than just a lecture about ethics, \" writes green. \" it's a statement about who should control financial markets. \" and francis clearly believes \" the global economy needs more government control — an argument that would have been unthinkable for the pope just 50 years ago. \" in the longer view, popes have been railing against the abuses of capitalism for more than a century, writes tim fernholz at quartz. ( he's got the excerpts to prove it. ) still, francis ' approach seems different, adds james downie at the washington post. For one thing, he backs up his talk in the humble way that he leads his own life. \" the fact is that francis is only saying what more and more people in the united states and around the world recognize: the increasing inequality of recent decades ' cannot be the basis of hope for a better future, ' \" writes downie. \" now if only our leaders would listen. \"",

Per the daily bulletin, ward thomas'suit filed friday against the california lottery commission alleges breach of contract among other complaints. Thomas says he sent his 16-year-old son benjamin into a mobil gas station to exchange and cash out 12 winning tickets in october, reports abc 7. The father and son took home $ 230 along with five $ 20 scratchers tickets, which they played when they returned home. One of those tickets yielded a $ 5 million prize, which he says he validated that night at a 7-eleven and later again at a santa ana lottery office. Ward says that after submitting his claim, the lottery commission confirmed the winning, but come december, denied his claim for the cash prize because his son was not of legal age ( 18 ) to purchase the ticket. The suit claims that workers at the gas station, also a defendant, never said benjamin was too young to buy the tickets and failed to enforce this rule. It also accuses the commission of false advertising since there were no signs at the store stating age requirements. The california lottery commission and mobil station did not comment on the pending litigation.",

When she found an individual insurance plan with better benefits, she tried unenrolling from obamacare and spent 6 weeks talking to operators, using online chat, and sending emails, hill tells fox news. When she thought she had unenrolled, the $ 950-a-month premium was taken from her bank account. Only when she finally drove to her insurance company in kansas city did someone there help her unenroll on a federal line. \" it's consumed my whole life, \" hill said. \" i felt like i'd slipped into a parallel universe.... It's just as hard to go off as it is to get on. \" meanwhile, one unsung benefit of obamacare is the number of poor americans signing up for expanded medicaid — most of whom were previously uninsured, the new york times reports. In west virginia alone, more than 75,000 have enrolled in the program. \" i got to the point when i decided i just didn't want to be here anymore, \" said a west virginia woman who suffered renal failure after she couldn't get consistent medication.

        "summary": "There's a tiny island on the border between france and spain where it is possible to go to sleep in one country, not move an inch, and wake up in the other. Well, it would be possible if it were legal to visit the island, but alas, at less than 75,000 square feet, it is smaller than some grocery stores and off limits to the many feet that would otherwise pound it. So how does this travel-without-moving work? as conde nast traveler explains, it has nothing do with geography and everything to do with an unusual deal between france and spain that goes back four centuries. In short, they swap control of the island during the year. The island, which the spanish call \" isla de los faisanes \" and the french call \" île des faisans, \" has been jointly run by the two countries since the treaty of the pyrenees was signed there in 1659. The terms created what is essentially joint custody, by which the spaniards have control from february to august, and the french from august to february. It's one of the most unique border arrangements in the world, notes a post at atlas obscura, which calls it \" a powerful, albeit bizarre, symbol of peace and neutrality. \" the island's history is rather romantic, if that's the right word, given that it used to be where brides and grooms of royal marriages between the countries were handed off. ( see why japan is spending so much on this tiny island. )",

        "summary": "Short-statured people known as pygmies live in rain forests around the world, and a new study puts forth a relatively simple explanation for their height: their shorter step lengths make it a lot easier for them to walk around in dense jungles than it is for taller people. As newsweek explains, scientists have never been able to settle on why males with the pygmy phenotype tend to max out at 5-foot-2 and women at shorter heights. But after studying the batek of peninsular malaysia and the tsimane of the bolivian amazon, researchers make their case in the proceedings of the royal society b that \" locomotor performance \" is the driving factor. The pygmies'shorter height results in shorter steps that facilitate more efficient foraging, and the researchers theorize that jungle populations evolved over the eons to take advantage of the trait, per a post at phys.og. \" it is highly intuitive — anyone who has trekked off-trail in a rainforest knows how difficult it is, \" says vivek venkataraman of harvard's department of human evolutionary biology. \" especially if you are tall, you feel extremely clumsy. But for people who live in these environments, it seems easy for them to move around. \" the researchers speculate that other factors may be at play, though they haven't been fully explored yet. For example, the bodies of people with a smaller stature may be able to dissipate heat better, which would be an advantage in a rain-forest climate. They also note that the phenomenon isn't specific to humans — other large mammals who live in rain forests are typically smaller than their counterparts elsewhere.

People with the human pygmy phenotype are found across the globe, normally in tropical regions. Adult males are normally less than 5 feet 2 inches in height. Recent research has shown their short stature is the result of convergent evolution — where different populations evolve the same trait because of the similar environment in which they live. However, it is not entirely clear what the adaptive benefit of being so short is. In one of the first studies to look the human pygmy phenotype for its benefits, researchers examined two short-statured populations who forage in the rainforests. These were the batek of peninsular malaysia and the tsimane of the bolivian amazon. Their findings are published in the proceedings of the royal society b: biological sciences. Vivek venkataraman, from harvard's department of human evolutionary biology, and colleagues tested out the hypothesis that specific locomotor constraints — walking ability dependent on step length — would have an impact on evolutionary success in a rainforest terrain.

The spanish government is now grabbing a controlling 45 % stake in bankia, the nation's fourth-largest lender and the one with the most exposure to the country's shell-shocked property market.

Here's what they're saying: \" that is just so veronica mars, \" writes betsy sharkey at the los angeles times. Though it's not \" a particularly ambitious film, \" it \" ties up a lot of loose ends and opens up a new can of worms. \" plus, you get the sense that with each frame, the filmmakers and actors are showing their appreciation to the show's fans. And bonus: it leaves the door open for more. \" veronica mars is a great deal more than a bonus episode, but slightly less than a movie, \" david hiltbrand writes in the philadelphia inquirer. This full-length venture has \" all the wit and attitude that made you obsess over the girl private eye with the sharp tongue, \" but those who aren't mega fans may not enjoy it quite as much. But hey, at least they can look forward to \" a rather distinguished batch of cameos. \" but claudia puig at usa today basically disagrees with all of his points. She calls veronica mars \" a film noir detective story that works for both devotees of the series and the uninitiated, \" while \" it's effective as a sequel to the television series and works just as well as a stand-alone film. \" plus, kristen bell is \" as sharp, engaging, and witty as ever. \" all of that, however, is a far cry from what peter howell at the toronto star is thinking. \" be careful what you wish for, and also what you buy into, \" he writes, calling the film \" underwhelming. \" newcomers and even the more demanding fans \" might wonder if the movie needed to be kick-started with something more than money, and whether there's any need for a sequel.

        "summary": "Of the four identified groups of human aids viruses — hiv-1 m, n, o, and p — only m and n had been traced to their source. Until now. Researchers from institutions around the world, including the university of pennsylvania school of medicine, are reporting that the origins of groups o ( the second-deadliest strain, having infected 100,000 west africans ) and p ( the rarest, found in only two ) have now been identified. Unlike the deadliest group m ( infecting at least 40 million humans ) and group n ( seen in only a couple dozen ), both of which leaped from chimpanzees, groups o and p crossed over from western lowland gorillas in southern cameroon. However, these simian immunodeficiency viruses ( sivs ) both leaped from chimps to gorillas, so \" the gorilla virus is basically a chimp virus in gorillas, \" one study author says. Researchers took on the fetid task of analyzing the feces of some 3,000 gorillas spread out over several western and central african countries to pinpoint the source. Though the puzzle pieces of the origins of hiv are coming together, several mysteries remain, reports the chicago tribune. Among them: why group o didn't spread more rapidly between chimps and gorillas, who share a habitat; less than 2 % of this source population of gorillas in southern cameroon were infected with gorilla siv. The researchers also plan to study whether gorilla siv results in a disease resembling aids, as it does in chimps and humans, and also whether siv is at least partly behind the decline of this population of gorillas. ( scientists first discovered in 2009 that siv in chimps can lead to low t-cell counts just like aids in humans. )",

The scientists, led by martine peeters from montpellier, conducted a comprehensive survey of simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) infection in african gorillas. Beatrice hahn, md, a professor of medicine and microbiology, and others from penn were part of the team, whose findings appear online this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. Hiv-1, the virus that causes aids, has jumped species to infect humans on at least four separate occasions, generating four hiv-1 lineages -- groups m, n, o, and p. Previous research from this team found that groups m and n originated in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern cameroon, but the origins of groups o and p remained uncertain. The four cross-species transmissions have had very different outcomes in humans. Group m gave rise to the aids pandemic, infecting more than 40 million people worldwide by spreading across africa and throughout the rest of the world.

Us district judge david bunning has said he will keep davis in jail until she agrees to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her attorneys say there's only one way she'd cave: if kentucky state law is changed so that marriage licenses aren't given out under the county clerk's authority. But the state legislature isn't scheduled to meet until january, and democratic gov. Steve beshear says he will not call a special session, which he views as a misuse of taxpayer dollars as the issue impacts just one elected official. That means davis could potentially be in jail for months, though the courier-journal has this to say on her legal strategy: her lawyers \" are appealing the contempt ruling to the 6th circuit court of appeals and plan to file writs of habeas corpus in efforts to free her. \" her attorneys also suggest it's more than just davis being affected: they yesterday said the marriage licenses issued yesterday ( six to gay couples and two to straight couples ) aren't \" worth the paper they are written on \" since they weren't authorized by davis, reports the courier-journal. Bunning himself actually said that he didn't know if the licenses are valid.

        "summary": "It was a tense, emotional courtroom scene in minneapolis monday morning as one chapter in the abduction, sexual assault, and murder of 11-year-old jacob wetterling came to a close. At a us district court hearing for 53-year-old danny heinrich, who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on one count of child porn ( a plea deal ), heinrich apologized to jacob's family for the \" evil acts \" that led to jacob's death in 1989, telling jacob's parents specifically that \" the heinous acts of selfishness are unforgivable … i ' m so sorry, \" the star tribune reports. The ap notes that 20 years is the max that can be given on a single child-porn count, and heinrich is technically eligible for release after 17 years, though judge john tunheim said during the hearing that it's \" unlikely that society will let you go free. \" the chicago tribune notes the law permits the state to have heinrich civilly committed as a sex predator when his federal sentence ends. In handing down heinrich's sentence, tunheim noted, \" no one is ever going to forget october 22 of 1989. But we will move forward. \" before he spoke, however, it was jacob's family who addressed heinrich, with mom patty wetterling saying he \" broke my heart, my soul, and every fiber of my being when he murdered our jacob, \" per nbc news. She added directly to heinrich: \" you didn't need to kill him. He did nothing wrong. He just wanted to go home. \" and as jerry wetterling, jacob's dad, actually thanked heinrich for leading authorities to jacob's body this summer, heinrich himself appeared to tear up, per the star tribune. Jacob's brother and sister also spoke — they expressed love for jacob and insecurity should heinrich ever be released — as did a man who was abducted and molested by heinrich as a 12-year-old less than a year before jacob's abduction.",

Mitsubishi, kawasaki, toshiba, and other brands better known for consumer electronics are poised to sell submarines, planes, and radar equipment to foreign powers, reports the washington post. Japan hosted its first defense trade show in may — just over a year after prime minister shinzo abe removed the ban. Restrictions remain on selling weapons to countries involved in conflict, however, in keeping with the country's pacifist constitution. \" we will more actively cooperate on defense equipment and technology with our ally the us and other countries to maintain regional peace and stability, \" defense minister itsunori onodera says in a statement, per bloomberg. Despite the relative freedom the manufacturers now have, the military trade show was lacking in actual weaponry. There were no missiles, rifles, or grenade launchers on display, although japanese companies do make and sell weapons within japan. Most japanese oppose abe's decision to lift the weapons export ban, the post reports, and even military industry employees have trouble reconciling international gun sales with a staunchly pacifist image. \" if we suddenly started exporting in-your-face weapons, personally, i would find that difficult, \" admits a helicopter sales rep for kawasaki.

Authorities tell fox 5 atlanta that 6-year-old lanira tackett was dragged into a bathroom stall thursday at oakland elementary school in henry county, georgia, by an 11-year-old girl who choked the younger student and stuffed her head in the toilet two or three times. Lanira ended up with bruises, scratches, and cuts, and remains fearful of entering bathrooms by herself, mother cheryl tackett tells wxia atlanta. The assailant \" was choking her, and banging her head viciously on the toilet, and covering her mouth, \" says tackett, who calls the attack premeditated. Tackett says the fifth grader had already approached lanira on the school bus and threatened to assault her. Then on thursday, the girl \" said she wanted to talk to my daughter, \" tackett says. \" she pulled her into the bathroom and proceeded with the attack. \" in fact, cheryl and her husband jeremy say the school had already flagged the fifth grader for bullying but nothing was done, wsb-tv reports. Now the alleged assailant has been charged in juvenile court with battery, aggravated assault, and imprisonment, as the sheriff's department and school district continue to investigate. \" people choose to ignore it, but they need to know that bullying is real and it is something that affects children, \" says jeremy.

In a report released monday, zinke calls for significant shrinking of the 1.3 million-acre national monument in southeast utah that former president obama created in the final weeks of his presidency, the new york times reports. Opponents — including native american tribes in the region and environmentalists — argue that the move would be a \" slap in the face \" to the tribes with ties to the land, as well as a clear violation of the antiquities act that president theodore roosevelt signed in 1906. The vast region designated by obama contains an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites. In his memo to president trump, zinke said the monument should be \" right sized \" to \" the smallest area compatible \" with protecting the areas with the most artifacts. Gop utah sen. Orrin hatch, who pushed the administration for action on bears ears, praised the report as an \" unquestionable victory for utah, \" reports the deseret news. Rep. Adam sarvana, a democrat on the house natural resources committee, said the plan looks like an attempt to designate \" a few stops on a boardwalk arcade \" rather than \" a professionally conserved landscape the way national monuments are typically designated. \" a final report on the area, one of 27 monuments over 100,000 acres being reviewed, is due by july 10.",

His preliminary recommendations, outlined in a memorandum to president donald trump, will be followed by a final report due by july 10.

Republican sen. Jill vogel, who says current laws \" are not protecting children, \" hopes to put an end to that loophole with state senate bill 415 and companion house bill 703, which call for raising the minimum age for all marriages to 16, wtop reports. If approved by the governor ( both bills flew through their respective chambers monday ), the new law would permit marriage for 16- and 17-year-olds only if they petition a judge, who would consider their ages, maturity, and criminal history and determine they weren't being threatened or forced to marry. \" it's rarely the case that [ a pregnant ] 13-year-old is marrying a 17-year-old, \" vogel says. \" it's more often... That it is a child marrying somebody decades older than they are. \" in cases like that, vogel says, instead of issuing a marriage license, \" someone … should be asking the question, ' well, if this 13-year-old is pregnant, isn't that evidence of statutory rape? ' \" vogel also notes the gender disparity in the state's current laws, noting a pregnant 13-year-old girl could be forced to marry, but a boy that age doesn't face that dilemma. State sen. Thomas garrett doesn't concur with the bill, arguing that it replaces the \" insight and judgment of parents with that of the court, \" per the times-dispatch, but vogel says it's necessary. \" it really shocks the conscience, some of the situations children have found themselves in. \" ( florida was dealing with a similar problem. )",

Malinda lugin is facing a charge of endangering the welfare of a child for making doctors think her child was sick from the time of the girl's birth in november 2007 to april 2014. While authorities haven't detailed the litany of exams and surgeries the girl was allegedly made to undergo, the star-ledger cites a criminal complaint that states the girl had a feeding tube inserted into her stomach that pumped only infant formula into her body. The charges against lugin revolve around what's commonly known as munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental illness in which a caretaker reports fake symptoms for a child's \" illness \" or actually causes them to gain attention for themselves. Lugin \" was portraying this child as an invalid, \" an assistant prosecutor said, per the herald, adding the abuse was happening to the girl \" since she was in utero \"; the girl was ultimately determined to be perfectly healthy, save for a \" small \" allergy to strawberries. Lugin posted bail a couple of weeks after her june 11 arrest, which was reportedly prompted by physicians who contacted authorities. If she's convicted, she faces between five and 10 years in state prison. ( another munchausen syndrome by proxy case involved a mom who poisoned her son with salt. )",

A 22-year-old was taken into custody wednesday on a charge of first-degree murder, the broward county sheriff's office confirms, per the independent, identifying the man as dedrick devonshay williams of pompano beach. Held without bond in broward county jail, he has been hit with at least 11 felony charges, with previous arrests for grand theft auto, cocaine possession, weapons possession, domestic violence, and aggravated assault with a firearm, per tmz. He allegedly held a gun to his girlfriend's head in 2014. His arrest wednesday also led to probation violations for car theft and driving without a valid license, per the independent. Police initially described two suspects in monday's shooting in deerfield beach. It's unclear if more arrests are expected.

And as the daily news reports, it was the driver himself who ended up in handcuffs. The tale of the unusual bust involving 8 pounds of heroin worth $ 3 million began the morning of april 17, when customs officials at jfk busted a traveler from africa with the drugs in his samsonite. He agreed to proceed with his deal under the watch of federal agents and called the cell number he had been provided, reports the smoking gun. His contact turned out to be a 50-year-old bus driver for the metropolitan transportation authority named francis abankwa. The traveler boarded abankwa's bus in the bronx with the drugs and stayed right through until the end of the route, remaining on board while all the other passengers exited. After he and abankwa exited and started heading toward abankwa's car, the feds swooped in for the arrest. Both face felony narcotics conspiracy charges, and abankwa is looking at 10 years in prison if convicted. On the bright side, notes new york, \" at least they let abankwa finish his route. \"",

Now a rep is explaining what clinton really meant: we're not in a recession but are still feeling the impact of the previous recession.

But maybe clinton actually helped the president, showing \" voters that the democrats, at least, are not going to hold american families hostage to party shibboleths. \" instead, they're willing to compromise, notes john farrell in the national journal.

In a court filing monday — a day ahead of the latest court hearing on the fbi's demand for apple to unlock san bernardino shooter syed rizwan farook's iphone — the justice department announced that a third party has suggested another way to get into the phone, the new york times reports. If the method demonstrated by the outside party over the weekend succeeds, \" it should eliminate the need for the assistance from apple, \" according to the court filing. A federal judge granted the request to delay tuesday's hearing and ordered the government to deliver a status report by april 5, the ap reports. Us magistrate judge sheri pym also stayed her order for apple to help investigators bypass security features on farook's iphone, which would have been the focus of tuesday's hearing. The new development gives apple some breathing space in the standoff with federal prosecutors, the los angeles times reports, though it now has to deal with the fact that an unknown party may have developed a way to bypass its security features — and experts say the showdown over encryption is bound to happen sooner or later, whatever happens in the farook case.

Hong, ap ) the man believed to have purchased guns used to kill 14 people in san bernardino dec. 2 was described as an unlikely character in a terror plot who loved to read comic books, according to the owner of a california bar who employed him. Jerry morgan, owner",
            "Riverside, calif. — the regulars did not take it seriously when enrique marquez mused about terrorism at morgan's tavern, a dank dive bar where mr. Marquez hauled ice, cleaned bathrooms and checked ids at the door. After a few drinks, he would just start talking — about his money woes, trying to lose weight, wanting to join the navy. News reports about terrorism were just fodder for more bar talk. \"he would say stuff like: 'there's so much going on. There's so many sleeper cells, so many people just waiting. When it happens, it's going to be big. Watch, ' \" said nick rodriguez, a frequent patron who had known mr. Marquez on and off for the past two years. \"we took it as a joke. When you look at the kid and talk to him, no one",
            "( cnn ) more than one week later, authorities are still digging to make sense of the san bernardino massacre, piecing together the clues they've compiled so far and trying to discover more, including by investigating the shooters ' electronic trail and searching a lake near where the carnage occurred. The identity of the killers, syed rizwan farook and tashfeen malik, is not in doubt. But investigators want to find out more about who this married couple interacted with, how they hatched and carried out the plot, and why. These are the latest and most significant investigative leads so far: friday friend of killer says he helped build prior pipe bombs enrique marquez, a former neighbor of farook, told investigators he and his friend previously built pipe bombs, law enforcement officials said. Marquez said he had nothing to do with devices found at the home of farook and malik"

Satter says that when he traveled to ukraine to renew his visa, diplomats at the russian embassy told him the \" competent organs \" had decided his presence in russia was no longer desirable, and he was banned from returning to the country. The us ambassador in moscow lodged a formal complaint but was not given an explanation for satter's expulsion. Satter, who has been writing about russia for decades, has been unable to return to his moscow apartment to collect his belongings. He suspects the expulsion is linked to a book he is writing about some of the murkier episodes in russia's post-soviet history. \" i think this is a change in policy, \" he tells the financial times. \" the russian authorities have moved from trying to influence the western press to trying to control it. \"",

Following satter's expulsion, the embassy issued a diplomatic protest and asked for an explanation. The russian authorities declined to give one. On tuesday russia's foreign ministry accused satter of infringing migration rules. In a statement, the ministry said the journalist had waited five days before converting his initial entry visa into a multi-entry visa – \" a flagrant violation \".

The campaign today announced that romney has raised $ 10,157,947 online since unveiling his running mate, politico reports. But alexander abad-santos writes in the atlantic that if you take a cursory look at the math, that \" bump \" looks kinda lame. Romney and the rnc raised around $ 100 million last month, he explains, which averages to about $ 3 million per day. So raising $ 10 million over ryan's six days on the trail actually represents a slowdown. When john mccain unveiled sarah palin, they hit $ 10 million in half that time. Still, there is one silver lining: some 68 % of the online donors in the past six days have been newcomers, which could indicate that people are excited about ryan even if they're not giving much.

And when the researchers presented 21 participants with a tray of five bourbons and five ryes in anonymized labels and randomized order, had them sniff each, and then a few days later drink each and group them into whichever categories they pleased, people tended to catalogue the drinks based on alcohol content, bottling age, and brand ( i.e., jim beam whiskeys are known for undertones of roasted peanuts ).

This is the third dc landmark vandalized with green paint in recent days — the lincoln memorial was hit last week, and a statue outside the smithsonian castle was found defaced this morning — but it's unclear so far whether the woman in custody is also a suspect in those incidents, the washington post reports. The cathedral was closed to the public today, after paint was found on an organ in the 100-year-old bethlehem chapel and in the children's chapel. A spokesman for the cathedral says he thinks it will wash off. Though it may seem like a no-brainer that the three green paint attacks were linked, police say the paint was splattered haphazardly at the lincoln memorial, while the statue of joseph henry appeared to have been deliberately painted with symbols, the ap reports. Authorities say they hope to question the woman about all three, but a language barrier has delayed the interrogation so far.",

        "summary": "The speed with which president trump issued executive orders on pipelines, abortion, and trade deals in recent days has alarmed critics — but he's not behaving very differently than his predecessor. Trump's pace on executive orders is similar to that of barack obama, whose orders in his first week included one to close gitmo within a year, though george w. Bush and bill clinton went a lot slower. Bustle describes the trend as a product of partisanship, with trump following obama's lead in using the \" absolute maximum of presidential power \" without seeking the approval of congress. A roundup of executive order coverage: the washington post looks at how far presidents from harry truman onward have gone in revoking the orders of previous presidents. Obama holds the speed record, with eight in his first 30 days, while george w. Bush set the record for quantity by reversing 64 previous executive orders during his term. According to the pew research center, obama issued fewer executive orders per year than any president since grover cleveland 120 years ago, with obama's 277 executive orders working out to 35 per year, compared to 36 for george w. Bush, 48 for ronald reagan, a record 307 per year for fdr, and one per year for george washington. A full list is here. Roll call takes a look at all the executive orders issued in the early days of the last four presidencies, noting that trump is the first since clinton to sign one on his very first day in office. Cnn looks at what can and cannot be done with executive orders, and at the pros and cons of using them instead of laws passed by congress. One big plus for laws passed by congress is that they can't be so easily overturned by the next president. ( trump is planning executive orders on immigration in the coming days. )",

But if the mean one has something to offer that the nice one doesn't — say, lots of baby wafers — most babies will put up with the mean puppet to get the larger reward, report researchers at yale university. They go on to conclude in the journal cognition that yes, even infants have a price, but they also stress a silver lining: \" it was only when the difference between the offerings was very large that their aversion to the wrongdoer was overcome by personal incentives. \" to conduct the study, researchers observed 64 12- and 13-month-olds as they watched a nice puppet help another puppet get a toy out of a box and a mean one slam that toy box lid shut. The puppets then offered the babies crackers, but the nice puppet had only one while the mean puppet had two, four, or eight ( the number changed at random ). Turns out that babies continued to show a preference for the nice puppet even though it had less to offer — until the offering reached eight crackers, the so-called tipping point. \" when the mean puppet offers eight crackers and the nice puppet offers one cracker, two-thirds of babies will sell out or'deal with the devil, ' as we like to call this study, \" one researcher tells wshu. Older kids held out longer, choosing to avoid the mean puppet all the way until it offered a whopping 16 crackers to the nice puppet's one. ( also, babies would really prefer that we sing. )",

Scientists have long sought a better solution, and a team at harvard is now announcing that, 15 years into its research, it has successfully coaxed human embryonic stem cells into ones that produce insulin. When those cells were transferred to diabetic mice, they behaved as healthy cells do and regulated blood sugar. \" we can cure their diabetes right away — in less than 10 days, \" researcher doug melton tells npr. Six months later, that was still the case, reports cbs news, which calls the research possibly \" the biggest breakthrough in years toward a cure. \" because while scientists have been able to achieve a similar end with insulin-producing cells sourced from cadavers, they've struggled with how to get the quantity they needed. Now researchers have \" the ability to make hundreds of millions of cells, \" melton says. \" it's a huge landmark paper, \" an outside researcher tells npr. \" i would say it's bigger than the discovery of insulin. \" for melton, the issue is deeply personal: both his children, now in their 20s, were diagnosed with the disease as kids.

He is said to have appointed two senior police suspected of not giving adequate protection to opposition leader benazir bhutto at the time of her murder. Mr musharraf is accused of giving the pair their orders. Legal experts say the mention of mr musharraf's name in a prosecution report does not mean he is indicted. He has denied accusations in the past that he did not provide adequate security for ms bhutto at the time of her death. Ms bhutto was killed while travelling in an election motorcade in the city of rawalpindi in december 2007. Public prosecutor chaudhry zulfiqar ali said that mr musharraf's name was included in their investigation report in the light of what the two police officials - former rawalpindi police chief saud aziz and former police superintendent khurram shahzad - told investigators.

In a poll, 48 % of the assembled ceos said they were \"very confident \" of growth in the next 12 months, according to the guardian. In his presentation today, even nouriel \"doctor doom \" roubini himself said the risks of a double-dip recession had lessened. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a lot to discuss. Here's what ceos were talking about: china is now the world's no. 2 economy. \"we have to get out of the lexicon the words 'developing ' or 'emerging, ' \" said one advertising ceo. One finance professor, meanwhile, told the ap that \"every uncertainty in the world has to do with chinese politics. \" food prices are soaring to record highs, as are prices on other commodities, one panel warned. \"it's not going to derail the global recovery, \" one economist told marketwatch, \"but it's a big problem for the poorest countries. Interest rates are near zero now, \"but they can only go up and higher interest rates will drive financing costs up as well, \" said ge energy's ceo. Political unrest is a big risk in many countries, especially in the wake of tunisia's revolution. \"in egypt, i really can't say where this is going to go, \" a member of the saudi royal family told reuters.

        "summary": "The timing of monica lewinsky's new article — as hillary clinton seems on the brink of a 2016 presidential campaign — may seem unfortunate for clinton. On the contrary, writes ruth marcus in the washington post: though the affair wasn't really mentioned during clinton's 2008 campaign, that won't be the case in 2016. Rand paul \" has already raised the question of whether democrats in general, and hillary clinton in particular, should consort with a'sexual predator ' like bill clinton, \" marcus writes. But lewinsky is clear in her article that the affair was consensual, \" so her piece defuses paul's line of attack. And it does so before any clinton presidential announcement, \" marcus concludes. \" if and when a clinton presidential announcement comes, lewinsky will be old news. \" more reactions: in the new york times, maureen dowd is back to her old pastime of criticizing lewinsky, calling it \" disingenuous \" and \" pretentious \" that lewinsky should say she was inspired to speak out by tyler clementi's suicide. On jezebel, kate dries is similarly unimpressed. Headline: \" vanity fair gives monica lewinsky 15 more minutes. \" robin abcarian is even harsher in the los angeles times: \" we all know the story: in 1998, a horny 21-year-old white house intern flashes her thong at a horny commander-in-chief. \" but on the daily beast, emily shire hits back against that sort of talk. We've long forgiven bill clinton, but many people are still eager to \" slut shame \" lewinsky, she writes. \" it would be nice to think that in 2014, when we're much quicker to call out slut-shaming in politics, entertainment, and everyday life, lewinsky would be received with a little more understanding. But apparently when it comes to monica lewinsky, it's 1998 all over again. \"",

The poll, conducted over the weekend, showed that about six in 10 republicans want gingrich and paul to halt their campaigns, while a similar number supported santorum continuing his bid. According to cnn's latest estimate, romney has secured 569 delegates and needs 575 more to reach the 1,144 required to clinch the gop nomination. Santorum, the former pennsylvania senator, has 262 delegates, with gingrich at 136 and paul at 71. Despite the long odds, none of the three trailing candidates appears close to giving up.

The poll, conducted from march 20 through sunday, found that native son santorum's support among likely republican voters fell from 45 percent to 30 percent since february. In the same time, romney's appeal grew from 16 percent to 28 percent. Franklin &amp; marshall pollster g.

That's less than is recommended for our health, yet the groups seemed very healthy indeed. Siegel tells npr members of those three groups have long lives, very little obesity, and no trouble sleeping. \" two groups we quizzed on this ( the san and tsimane ) don't have a word for insomnia, \" he says. Contrary to popular belief, siegel found these groups don't go to bed when it gets dark and wake up with the sun. Instead they go to bed a few hours after dark when the night starts cooling off and begin waking up when the night is at its coldest point, just as the sun begins to warm things up. \" the daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep, \" states siegel's study, published thursday in biology.

Instead, they nod off between 2 and 3 hours after sunset, well after it becomes pitch-black. And they napped infrequently: the team scored \"naps \" as periods of daytime inactivity that lasted for at least 15 minutes, and based on these lenient criteria, the volunteers \"napped \" on just 7 percent of winter days and 22 percent of summer ones.

But people may be meant to sleep as little as 6 1/2 hours nightly and were doing so long before the advent of electricity and smartphones, researchers say. To find that out, they consulted with some of the few people on the planet who live roughly the same lifestyle humans did in the paleolithic.

A visibly upset bergman, 19, reportedly left work early on the morning of aug. 4; police later said she was last seen that day at her phoenix apartment and has not been heard from since. Bergman moved to arizona from the san diego area in march to live with her boyfriend, 23-year-old jon-christopher clark, her parents have previously said. She moved in with a friend a few weeks later after breaking up with clark, but clark says he then moved in with the two in mid-june after reconciling with bergman. Clark, who says he was the last person to see bergman, was arrested aug. 17 on suspicion of identity theft and forgery; he was released a week later, nbc san diego reports. Police say the investigation into the other, unrelated crimes began after a search of clark's vehicle, though authorities have said he is not a suspect in bergman's disappearance. Clark has said in an interview with the republic that he was questioned by police in the disappearance, but that he was not involved and just wants her to come home. Bergman's parents, however, have said they believe he may have had something to do with their daughter's disappearance. The day she vanished was clark's birthday, and clark says she asked him to pick her up from work in the morning. He says they later argued because he was sad they weren't doing anything for his birthday and she left the apartment upset ( and reportedly without her money, purse, or car ). A gofundme has been set up for her family.",

He is frank and charismatic yet thoughtful, called a \" happy warrior \" for the catholic church in some circles, the \" bear-hug bishop \" in others. He is 63-year-old new york cardinal timothy dolan, appointed just last year by pope benedict, and he represents the united states ' first — albeit pretty unlikely — shot at seeing an american elected pope. As the ap runs through the list of men who might be the next pontiff, it turns to dolan, who was tapped by benedict to give a speech in rome last year to other church leaders. Dolan came out of that as something of a clerical rock star, and italian media took note. But dolan faces long odds: no american has ever served as pope, and church higher-ups are squirmy about the prospect of a pontiff who hails from a superpower. And while most popes speak myriad languages, dolan speaks only a little italian and spanish, and no latin. And his brash style that plays so well on us soil may prove a liability in rome. \" cardinal dolan has a knack for getting people to feel relaxed and to laugh and to expect the unexpected, but that is not what the church needs right now, \" says one scholar. Over at the washington post, meanwhile, the paper posits that such characteristics might in fact be just what the church needs.

After an \" anonymous source \" came forward, five specialists were brought in to independently compare the anteater in cabral's pic to a taxidermied anteater at the park's entrance. Their findings: \" there are elements of the animal's posture, morphology, raised tufts of fur, and patterns on the neck and head that are too similar for the images to show two different animals. \" cabral continues to insist it was a live anteater he captured, and he even claims to have a witness who saw it.
