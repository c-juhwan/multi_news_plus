D&g has launched its first collection of abayas and hijabs for the middle eastern luxury goods market. While designed to be modest, per vogue, the new line has \" all the flair of any other dolce &amp; gabbana collection, \" with lace embellishments, bright floral details, and vibrant prints. Already, forbes notes, women in wealthy persian gulf oil states accessorize their abayas and hijabs with expensive handbags, shoes, and crystals, and often wear brands, such as d&g, \" head-to-toe \" beneath their modest outer garments. \" it's about time \" a fashion house did this, observes a post at fastcodesign. Calling muslim women \" the next big untapped market, \" fortune references a thomson reuters report that projects global spending on clothing and footwear by muslims to increase to $ 484 billion by 2019, up from $ 266 billion in 2013 ( more than was spent by japanese and italian consumers combined ). A pew research center projection helps explain why: by 2050, the number of muslims in the world is expected to equal that of christians. D&g already has several shops in persian gulf states, per forbes. And luxury e-commerce company moda operandi has had such success with clients from persian gulf states ( including the sale of a $ 413,000 ruby necklace ) that it is looking into opening a showroom in the region. \" no word yet if it ' ll stock d&g's abaya line, \" o ' connor writes, \" but watch this space. \" ( two muslim women argue that christians who wear hijabs in the name of unity are misguided. )",

The phone-tapping revealed what officials called a \" traffic of influence. \" the new claims suggest sarkozy had judge gilbert azibert keep him updated on how the funding probe was progressing — and perhaps asked azibert to influence the case on his behalf.

Musk's company calls it the \" test tunnel for zero emission subterranean transportation. \" musk was granted a permit in august to extend the tunnel 2 miles from spacex headquarters to a point about a mile east of los angeles international airport, the ap reports. He tweeted over the weekend that the tunnel is now at 500 feet, will be at 2 miles in a few months, and should stretch the 17 miles of the i-405 corridor from lax to us highway 101 in the san fernando valley by next year. Permit documents say the test tunnel will hold an experimental skate system. \" the concept is that a vehicle would... Drive on to the skate, the engine would be turned off, and the vehicle and its passenger would be transported from one end of the test tunnel to the other, \" the documents state. The idea is separate from musk's hyperloop concept, though both projects might be able to use the same tunnels.",

        "summary": "High times in the far north could lie ahead: a measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use in alaska has gained enough signatures to make it onto the primary ballot this august, reports the anchorage daily news. Alaska legalized medical marijuana in 1999, but full legalization was rejected in 2000 and again in 2004. Backers, however, say polls show support is now at 54 % — and a very high voter turnout is expected this summer. Alaskans can already legally possess up to four ounces of pot, but there is no legal way to obtain it for recreational use. The measure — which would allow alaskans to grow their own pot or buy it from licensed retailers — would make alaska the third state to allow recreational use, after colorado and washington. \" i think alaskans are watching other states, and they understand that the sky isn't falling, \" a spokesman for the legalization campaign tells the los angeles times. \" the effect has been money that was benefiting criminal enterprises and drug dealers is being used to benefit the residents of the state. \"",

The washington post reports the unusual advisory came after an investigation into a mysterious illness that struck an oregon newborn. Three days after a healthy birth, the baby was in respiratory distress, and tests revealed a deadly bacterial infection known as gbs. After a course of antibiotics, the baby recovered but fell ill again with the same thing. Tests revealed the culprit was pills made from the mother's own placenta that she had been ingesting for weeks. Breast feeding transferred the infection to the baby. Once the mom stopped taking the pills, the infant recovered. While gbs isn't usually dangerous for adults, it is perilous to a newborn's immune system, reports artstechnica. Some new moms believe popping placenta pills eases postpartum blues, boosts energy levels, and stimulates breast milk production. Tens of thousands of new moms do it, per the ap. The cdc hasn't take a stand on placenta pills, but there is no evidence to show that \" placentophagy \" has any benefits. The report states the unidentified company that dehydrated the oregon mom's placenta failed to heat the organ that attaches to the uterine wall sufficiently to kill germs. There are no standards for heating placentas, the cdc notes, adding that doctors should \" educate mothers interested in placenta encapsulation about the potential risks. \" forbes notes that placenta recipes are rampant on the internet, with suggestions to add them to lasagna, chili, tacos, and smoothies.

But that's not where the suspect stayed.

The department tells kytx she nearly backed into two officers who were behind the vehicle searching a backpack and purse, then drove away. Video footage allegedly shows sponsler swerving to avoid a spike strip thrown onto the road by an officer, per nbc news. Officers say sponsler also narrowly avoided officers and vehicles as she reached speeds up to 100mph. All the while, she was fumbling with a device that kept an officer's shotgun locked inside the vehicle, police say. After a 23-minute chase, sponsler crashed into a tree and light pole and was again arrested, police tell ktre. Sponsler, who escaped the crash unscathed, remained in angelina county jail on tuesday facing charges of escape with the threat of a deadly weapon, aggravated assault, unauthorized use of a vehicle, possession of methamphetamine, and evading arrest, ktre reports.",

In her posts, jeong, born in south korea and raised in the us, referred to whites as \" dogs \" and \" groveling goblins, \" used the hashtag #cancelwhitepeople, and made remarks such as one in 2014 in which she wrote: \" oh man it's kind of sick how much joy i get out of being cruel to old white men. \" right-wing websites started circulating the tweets after the hiring announcement. In a statement, the new york times says it knew about jeong's tweets before it hired her, explained she'd been the target of \" frequent online harassment, \" and that her reaction tweets had been an attempt to \" [ imitate ] the rhetoric of her harassers. \" the statement adds jeong, 30, \" sees now that this approach only served to feed the vitriol that we too often see on social media.

In a $ 2 billion-plus class-action lawsuit filed in illinois against quaker oats, pepsico, pinnacle food, and hillshire brands, harrington's great-grandkids maintain the companies lied about employing harrington, stole recipes and menus from her, and exploited her inexperience and youth during initial negotiations, reports the wrap. Harrington's heirs reveal the suit was partly motivated by the revelation last year that quaker officially trademarked her image in 1937, as well as their discovery of a death certificate that showed quaker oats as harrington's employer, reports fortune. The lawsuit claims quaker took part in \" industrial espionage \" by squeezing harrington's trade secrets out of her before she died and was involved in \" racial discrimination towards anna s.

The suit, which also names as defendants pinnacle foods and its former suitor hillshire brands, accuses the companies of failing to pay harrington and her heirs an \"equitable fair share of royalties \" from the pancake mix and syrup brand that uses her likeness and recipes. According to the lawsuit, quaker oats took control of \"64 of [ harrington's ] recipes and 22 complete menus \" and marketed them to the public. Filed last week by harrington's great-grandson, d.w. Hunter, who is representing himself, the lawsuit alleges that chicago-based quaker oats hired harrington to take over the pre-existing aunt jemima role in 1935 — a role she continued to serve when the company first registered the brand's trademark two years later — and that the company also reproduced harrington's own pancake recipe on a mass scale. The suit claims that harrington had entered into a \"written contractual agreement to play the actress role of aunt jemima \" that entitled her to royalties, including a",

He is seeking $ 2 billion, plus punitive damages to be determined at trial. Hunter alleges that the companies conspired to deny that harrington had been an employee of quaker oats, all the while exploiting her image and recipes for profit, but refusing to pay an \"equitable fair share of royalties \" to her heirs for more than 60 years. Also read: paula deen allegedly asked black staffers to dress like aunt jemima the claims come on the heels of the defendants allegedly receiving a certified death certificate for harrington that listed quaker oats as her employer.

            "The great-grandchildren of anna short harrington, the woman whose likeness was used for the \"aunt jemima \" logo, are seeking what they say are their just desserts, along with at least $ 2 billion, in a class action lawsuit brought recently against a group of companies, led by pepsico and its subsidiary the quaker oats company, in federal court in illinois. The suit, which also names as defendants pinnacle foods and its former suitor hillshire brands, accuses the companies of failing to pay harrington and her heirs an \"equitable fair share of royalties \" from the pancake mix and syrup brand that uses her likeness and recipes. According to the lawsuit, quaker oats took control of \"64 of [ harrington's ] recipes and 22 complete menus \" and marketed them to the public. Filed last week by harrington's great-grandson, d.w. Hunter, who is representing himself, the lawsuit alleges that chicago-based quaker oats hired harrington to take over the pre-existing aunt jemima role in 1935 — a role she continued to serve when the company first registered the brand's trademark two years later — and that the company also reproduced harrington's own pancake recipe on a mass scale. The suit claims that harrington had entered into a \"written contractual agreement to play the actress role of aunt jemima \" that entitled her to royalties, including a",
            "D.w. Hunter, the great grandson of anna short harrington, the woman known as aunt jemima, has filed a class action lawsuit against pepsico, the quaker oats company, pinnacle foods group and the hillshire brands company on behalf of all of her great grandchildren. He is seeking $ 2 billion, plus punitive damages to be determined at trial. Hunter alleges that the companies conspired to deny that harrington had been an employee of quaker oats, all the while exploiting her image and recipes for profit, but refusing to pay an \"equitable fair share of royalties \" to her heirs for more than 60 years.

The neurosurgeon and gop candidate has been among those calling for the defunding of planned parenthood after videos surfaced of an executive there talking about how to provide the tissue to interested medical companies, notes cnn. That kind of research is unnecessary because there's \"nothing that can't be done without fetal tissue, \" carson told fox news last month, per breitbart. Now, however, jen gunter, an ob-gyn, has posted excerpts on her blog of a research paper co-authored by carson in 1992 in which he and his team used tissue from fetuses aborted in weeks 9 and 17. \" could he think his own research was useless? \" she wondered. There's no contradiction, carson tells dave weigel of the washington post: \" you have to look at the intent. To willfully ignore evidence that you have for some ideological reason is wrong. If you're killing babies and taking the tissue, that's a very different thing than taking a dead specimen and keeping a record of it. \" and to cnn: \" we have banked material in the pathology lab from people from every age — from day 1 of concept to 120 years told. Those specimens are available for people who want to do comparisons. To not use the tissue that is in a tissue bank, regardless of where it comes from, would be foolish. Why would anybody not do that? \" and in a statement: \" there is absolutely no contradiction between the research i worked on in 1992 and my pro-life views. The issue of fetal tissue has everything to do with how the tissue is acquired. My primary responsibility in that research was operating on people to obtain diseased tissue for comparison to banked tissue samples. Killing babies and harvesting tissue for sale is very different than taking a dead specimen and keeping a record of it, which is exactly the source of the tissue used in our research. \"",

        "summary": "In the immediate aftermath of north korea's sixth nuclear test on sept. 3, experts described the blast as six or seven times as powerful as the one that destroyed hiroshima. That measure might not even come close. According to research site 38 north, the resulting 6.1 magnitude earthquake must have been caused by the release of roughly 250 kilotons, or a quarter megaton, of energy — equivalent to 17 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima, and very near the estimated maximum yield that can be contained at the punggye-ri underground test site, report the washington post and bloomberg. This assessment tops all others so far: us intelligence said the blast was 140 kilotons, while south korea said it was 50 kilotons. Pyongyang says it tested a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile, but south korea's nuclear safety and security commission has been unable to confirm that. Though the commission found the xenon-133 isotope in air samples collected after the nuclear test, other radioactive isotopes normally present during a nuclear explosion weren't detected, reports the ap. Tritium, traces of which are typically found after a hydrogen bomb is detonated, was one of those noticeably absent. That doesn't mean the north is misleading the international community, however. The north made changes \" to make radioactivity less detectable from a distance \" after a 2006 nuclear test sent xenon and krypton isotopes into the atmosphere, the ap notes.",

The main ball, to which more than 25,000 tickets have been distributed, spans the massive basement level and features more than a half-dozen acts. The commander-in-chief's ball, started in 2005 under president george w. Bush, includes about 5,000 members of the military and their guests. A smaller off-shoot of the main ball is being held in a nicer room on a different level of the convention center, and has significantly more restricted press access as that is where many donors and celebrities will be celebrating.

        "summary": "China is closing the drone-gap with the us military, and it may be thanks to stolen designs. The asia times reports china's newly unveiled uav — the caihong-4 — bears a striking resemblance to the us military's mq-9 reaper, especially it its size, landing gear, engine, and tail. The caihong-4 — its name means \" rainbow \" — made its combat debut this month, blowing up an isis position for iraqi forces, the new york times reports. \"this is the first time i've heard of a chinese drone, such as the ch-4 ( which is basically a clone of the reaper ), reporting an actual kill, \" one expert writes. It's believed iraqi forces have at least four chinese-made drones. And while chinese drones may not be as good as their us-made counterparts, they come a lot cheaper. While there is no direct evidence the caihong-4 — or the similar gongji-1 — were built using stolen us designs, a former nsa director says it's likely china got the plans through a cyberattack, the asia times reports. \"there are two types of companies: those that have been hacked and know it and those that have been hacked and don't know it, \" gen. Keith alexander says. Documents leaked by edward snowden showed the us had been hit by more than 30,000 chinese cyberattacks — with at least 500 of those being \" significant intrusions \" into the department of defense. If the us doesn't start protecting its information better, it may soon lose its advantage in military technology, according to the asia times. The new york times reports china is now behind only the us and russia in arms exports.",

But this month, a new model entered the fray: the chinese-made caihong-4. According to footage released by the iraqi armed forces, soldiers used the chinese drone on dec. 6 to destroy an isis position amid efforts to retake the city of ramadi. A spokesperson for the ministry of defense confirmed the video was real. The lethal strike represents a major step forward in china's drive to become a leading exporter of military equipment, experts say. Iraq is the only known export user of the drone, also known as the ch-4, which closely resembles the general atomics mq-9 reaper. Its first use in combat may be a selling point for potential buyers. \"this is the first time i've heard of a chinese drone, such as the ch-4 ( which is basically a clone of the reaper ), reporting an actual kill, and i suppose it would be cliché to say that it won't be the last, \" richard a. Bitzinger, a senior fellow at the s. Rajaratnam school of international studies at nanyang technological university in singapore, wrote in an email on wednesday.

        "summary": "As far as geological mysteries go, it's an intriguing one: for decades, china has reported being home to 50,000 rivers of at least about 40 square miles. But the country's three-year census of its water — a first-of-its-kind effort involving 800,000 surveyors and released last week — revealed a drastically different count. As of 2011, just 22,909, reports the verge, which asks the million-dollar question: why did 27,000 rivers vanish? the answer is an easy one, a census director tells the south china morning post: that 50,000 figure was arrived at using topographical maps as many as 60 years old, which were incomplete. The post cited climate change and water and soil loss as well, but the verge reports that china itself may have had a heavier hand in the decrease. It spoke with ma jun, the director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing, who agreed that the answers offered by the government likely played a role; but he cited pollution and overpopulation as key factors. As the verge explains, the destruction caused by flooding in the 1960s led the country to erect dams and reservoirs that reined in flooding but messed with the ecological system, causing rivers to go dry. Add in a more than fivefold surge in water use by a booming population in about the same period, along with pollution that only compounds the problem: it's \" destroying the limited clean resources we have, \" ma said.",

            "The number of rivers in china with catchment areas of at least 100 square kilometres has dropped by more than 50 per cent compared with 60 years ago, a landmark survey on national water resources reveals. China's ministry of water resources on tuesday released its first ever national census of water – conducted by up to 800,000 surveyors. The official study said there were 22,909 rivers in china which had catchment areas of at least 100 sq km – as of the end of 2011. This is less than half the government's previously estimated figure of over 50,000. The large fall in the number of these rivers has prompted fears that china's rapid economic development has also caused considerable water and soil loss. But huang he, deputy director of the group in charge of the census, said the disparity in the numbers was caused mainly by inaccurate estimates in the past, as well as climate change and water and soil loss. Due to limited technology in the past, the previous figures were estimated using incomplete topographical maps dating back to the 1950s, he explained. Huang said many figures released in the new study had not been known before. \"for example, we used to think china had 8,700 water reservoirs, but the census shows the number has now reached 98,002. \" the latest research, which took three years to complete",
            "For years, china claimed to hold an estimated 50,000 rivers within its borders. Now, more than half of them have abruptly vanished. Last week, china's ministry of water resources announced the results of a three-year survey of the country's waterways, revealing startling declines in water supply. According to the census, there were 22,909 rivers in china as of 2011, each covering an area of at least 100 square kilometers. That marks a decrease of about 28,000 from the government's previous estimates, raising fears among environmentalists and putting beijing on the defensive. China's longest rivers, the yangtze and the yellow, have each seen declining water levels in recent years, but the government's survey — its most comprehensive to date — may shed new light on the breadth and gravity of the country's crisis. According to the south china morning post, officials attributed the decline to global warming and outdated mapping techniques, saying previous estimates were based on incomplete topographical maps from the 1950s. Experts, meanwhile, say there are more direct factors at play — namely, explosive economic development and poor environmental stewardship.

All new cars would have to include camera systems that 'read'the limits displayed on road signs and automatically apply the brakes.

            "European road safety rules would force cars to fit systems that would automatically apply brakes to keep to speed limits drivers may be forced to have their cars fitted with technology that keeps them within the speed limit, under road safety rules being considered by the eu. New cars would have to feature systems capable of detecting limits through cameras or satellites and automatically applying the brakes. Older cars could be required to be fitted with the devices, which would mean that no car in the uk could go over the 70mph speed limit on motorways. But the transport secretary, patrick mcloughlin, has instructed officials to fight the move after he was asked for his views before formal proposals are made by the european commission this autumn. A government source said: \" it is definitely something that he is keen to resist and he has told officials that it is something we don't want to do. To be forced to have automatic controls in your car amounts to big brother nannying by eu bureaucrats. \" the ec's mobility and transport department wants to roll out the intelligent speed authority ( isa ) technology in an attempt to cut the death toll from road collisions by a third by 2020. More than 30,000 people die on the roads in eu countries every year and 1.5 million are injured, with 120,000 left permanently disabled. Mcloughlin"

        "summary": "A decade in the making, ken burns and lynn novick's documentary series, the vietnam war, premieres on pbs sunday, but it's already gaining quite the reputation among critics. The 18-hour documentary, told in 10 episodes, digs deep into the conflict, meshing first-person interviews with historical footage. Then it goes beyond since, for many, 1973 didn't mean the end of suffering. Here's what the critics are saying: james poniewozik at the new york times says it \" will break your heart and win your mind. \" given the subject matter, it's no surprise he found it \" wearying. \" it's \" probably mr. Burns'saddest film, \" he writes. But it presents a \" staggering \" amount of material and powerful oral histories. Some 80 interviewees \" offer a glimpse into the psyches of people on all sides of the conflict, \" writes sonia saraiya at variety. It can be disorienting, but \" disorientation in the midst of multiple national histories and conflicting personal agendas is, in a nutshell, the experience of the vietnam war. \" at cnn, brian lowry calls the vietnam war \" a masterpiece \" that \" humanizes what was often a faceless enemy. \" another strength: its ability to show \" the ripples from the war still being felt today. \" it may be long, but it's \" worth every single minute of your time, \" writes hank stuever at the washington post, calling it \" required viewing. \" not only will you experience \" terror, horror, disbelief, discovery, disgust, marvel, pride, ambivalence and tears, \" but \" you ' ll lose count of how many times you ' ll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. \" though \" very little that's said feels dangerous, controversial or exposed from our perspective, \" the vietnam war is remarkable, beautiful, repetitive, frustrating, assaulting, and \" nightmarish \" — and \" it's impossible to look away, \" writes daniel fienberg at the hollywood reporter. Adds ed siegel at the artery, \" it's not easy and it's certainly not fun, but ken burns and lynn novick know how to make history dramatic, how to make television riveting, and how to tell the country's story in a way that really defines what american exceptionalism is all about. \"",

Rafiq's husband, hassan khan, says she'd been tricked into going home when her mother told her the family wanted to throw a proper wedding and her uncle assured her he would protect her. Meanwhile, the human rights commission of pakistan, which was \" aghast \" at the similar murder of a 16-year-old girl in may, reports that so-called \" honor killings \" are on the rise, with nearly 1,100 women killed by relatives in pakistan last year alone, and still more by non-family members. While most of these murders go unreported, this case is garnering attention because it comes on the heels of two other recent cases. Prime minister nawaz sharif has pledged to close a legal loophole that allows killers to avoid prosecution if family members forgive them.

The dance world is buzzing that the 32-year-old may become the american ballet theatre's first black principal dancer. The company has gone its full 75 years without an african-american in the prestigious role, but classical ballet is not known for its diversity. Copeland was the first black ballerina to play the lead in firebird at a major company, one of the first to dance as odette in a top production of swan lake, and is only the third black soloist ( the rank just below principal ) at ballet theatre, which lost three of its nine female principals to retirement this year. Despite her accomplishments, she's not necessarily a shoo-in. \" it's a very difficult position, \" a former company principal tells the wall street journal. Audiences certainly seem to love copeland. Her swan lake performances sold out in days, yahoo reported in april, and her memoir, life in motion: an unlikely ballerina, was a bestseller. The california-bred dancer is also a hit on social media, with more than 500,000 instagram followers and, elle noted in april, a viral under armour campaign under her belt. Whether or not she is selected as a principal at the end of ballet theatre's season on july 4, her achievements have likely opened doors for countless other minority ballerinas. \" i think it's so important for young dancers of color to have someone who looks like them as an example — someone they can touch, \" copeland told elle last year. \" i tell them to be true to themselves. \"",

In fact, one whiff of the e2d molecule causes animals of all kinds to act in \" diametrically opposite \" ways, suggesting that it's been around for eons and responses to it are hard-wired into the systems of everything from humans to horseflies, reports afp. The molecule is believed to give blood its metallic odor, and researchers writing in scientific reports showed that it's e2d and not the blood itself that seems to cause such widespread reactions. In one experiment, they coated wood with a synthetic version of the molecule and found that wolves licked the wood and protected it as if it were fresh prey. Horseflies that feast on blood were similarly drawn to it. Mice, on the other hand, were immediately freaked out and tried to flee. Researchers also tested the effect on humans, finding that people \" recoiled \" when presented with the scent, and their hands sweated more, per healthworld. ( participants were unaware of the scent's connection to blood. ) what's more, it turns out that humans are particularly good at picking up on the scent e2d — they can do so in less than one-part-per-trillion, with the typical human capacity in the parts-per-million or -billion range. \" e2d seems to activate our entire general defense system, \" says one of the swedish authors. \" modern humans are without doubt predators, but we probably evolved from a prey species, and some aspects of this characteristic remain. \" ( in a bizarre medical case, a woman can't stop sweating blood. )",

We assayed flies ( n���=���35 ) in a y-maze setup ( fig.��1b ) in which the flies were first provided with a choice between e2d and a near-odorless organic solvent ( diethyl phthalate ) within the context of a host odor ( horse or cattle ). Given this choice, the flies significantly preferred e2d ( ��2( 1 ) ���=���25.7195, p���<���0.001; see fig.��1c, left panel ). Next, we contrasted e2d against real blood ( cattle ), again within the context of a host odor, and the flies now displayed the same level of approach response to e2d as to the odor of blood, i.e., equating the two odor sources ( ��2( 1 ) ���=���1.847, p���=���0.17; see fig.��1c, right panel ). We then sought to determine whether e2d would be sufficient to elicit approach responses typical to those elicited by real blood in a large mammalian predator.

Other options on the table include whether to let kids use them at designated places or times ( like lunch ), or whether to use devices for texting, er, learning purposes in the classroom. Predictably, de blasio's move is eliciting some strong support ( \" finally, someone saw the light! \" crows one civil rights lawyer to the new york post ), mostly from kids and parents, as well as some real concern — mostly from educators. \" what are we going to do if illicit content is found on the phones? \" asks one teacher, while another principal is more blunt: \" it's definitely going to cause problems. \" ( one student used her phone to cheat — with dire results. )",

On other issues, jarrett told host george stephanopoulos that she sees \"a great deal of momentum … on heath care, \" and said the white house does not view as a setback the decision of abdullah abdullah, afghanistan's leading opposition candidate, to withdraw from a nov. 7 runoff. Asked what the new york development shows about the republican party leadership, jarrett said: \"i think it's becoming more and more extreme, and more and more marginalized. Look at the number of people who actually say that they're registered, consider themselves a republican. And if that's the direction they want to go, fine. What we're going to do is what we've always done.

They don't want the same old health care system that's not affordable, that doesn't offer coverage to everybody, that keeps escalating in cost.

That's nothing compared to the wood frog, which doesn't urinate all winter; in alaska, that's eight months without peeing, reports the ap. Scientists have figured out how they do it, or rather how they survive without doing it. Recycling urea — the main waste in urine — into useful nitrogen keeps the frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze. Urea protects cells and tissues, even as the critters ' hearts, brains, and bloodstreams stop. The frogs can do it because special microbes in their guts recycle the urea, according to a study in tuesday's proceedings of the royal society b. Some call the frog pee a type of antifreeze, but study co-author jon costanzo, a miami university zoologist, bristles at that. \" their eyes are white. Their skin is frosty. They're like little rocks. They're frozen, \" costanzo says. Costanzo's team captured wood frogs during active times, then turned them into frog-sicles under controlled conditions. Costanzo and colleagues looked at the bacteria that live in frog guts. One type of bacteria, pseudomonas, soars in the winter but can't be seen in active frogs. If the frogs were human, they would be called dead, costanzo notes; some alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm, they come back to life. Other animals don't urinate when they hibernate, but mammals don't do the big freeze quite like wood frogs, which wake up in still-cold february to mate. \" this is stress that would definitely kill any mammal, \" costanzo says. \" people are fascinated by bear hibernation, but in my book any animal that allows itself to freeze solid and is able to...

        "summary": "The cheetah is rapidly disappearing and risks extinction if urgent measures aren't taken to save the mighty cat. A new report estimates there are only 7,100 of the world's fastest mammals left in the wild, the vast majority of them living outside of protected areas, the bbc reports. Writing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, researchers are calling for the cats to be reclassified as an \" endangered \" species from \" vulnerable \" on the international union for the conservation of nature red list. One of the most wide-roaming carnivores, cheetahs need a lot of space, some 30 by 30 miles, per cnn. Over time, the cats have lost 91 % of their native habitat in africa and southwest asia. Today, half of the world's cheetahs live across only six countries in southern africa. In zimbabwe, there are only 170 cheetahs left, down from 1,200 in 1999. Asian cheetahs are nearly gone, and fewer than 50 remain in iran. One of the main reasons behind the declining numbers is human development that has cut into the cheetah's territory. Other problems include illegal trafficking of cheetah parts, and cubs that command as much as $ 10,000, particularly in gulf states, per the bbc. Bushmeat hunting also is blamed for culling cheetah prey. All of those factors \" mean that it is likely to be much more vulnerable to extinction than was previously thought, \" says lead author sarah durant, per the telegraph. Protecting the cats will require a major shift in thinking away from protected territory, since cheetahs don't tend to stay put. Instead, conservationists should consider moves such as paying locals to protect a species, even ones they may consider dangerous. \" we must think bigger, \" says co-author dr. Kim young-overton, \" if we are to avert the otherwise certain loss of the cheetah forever. \" ( evolution cheated the giant panda. )",

Treehugger revisits this biological mystery, calling hydra \" marvels of the animal world \" that share \" regenerative powers \" with the multi-headed hydra of greek mythology. We know about hydra because — according to a video by two npr reporters — a teacher discovered the plant-like creature in a pond 250 years ago and split it in half. Each half grew into two full-size hydra, so he split them in half, and each regenerated again. And so on. \" it just wouldn't die, \" says the video. Could it be that hydra never perish? a scientist named daniel martinez tested this in the 1990s by keeping them in tiny water tanks to see if they would die in their natural habitat. Four years later, he published a paper saying hydra don't die — or, to be specific, \" mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in hydra. \" if four years seems hasty, it's based on the fact that in nature, \" the sooner you have babies, the sooner you die, \" says the video. Flies, for example, have babies in a couple of weeks and die after a couple of months. Hydra give birth after a couple of days, but martinez's hydra have now lived more than eight years, which is like an elephant living for 5,000 years. \" why the hydra? \" asks video co-producer robert krulwich at radiolab. \" why not ( excuse me for asking )... Us? \" martinez theorizes that it's because the hydra's simple, embryonic cells stay young longer, and are replaced before they get old. ( want to know how long you've got? poll your buddies. )",

Why, i wonder, are both these things true? there is an animal, a wee little thing, the size of a poppy seed, that lives in lakes and rivers and eats whatever flows through it; it's called a gastrotrich. It has an extremely short life. Hello, goodbye, i ' m dead it hatches. Three days later, it's all grown up, with a fully adult body \" complete with a mouth, a gut, sensory organs and a brain, \" says science writer carl zimmer. In 72 hours it's ready to make babies, and as soon as it does, it begins to shrivel, crumple... And usually within a week, it's gone. Dead of old age. Sad, no? a seven-day life. But now comes the weird part.

On israel's list: no more iranian research and development on weapons. An unspecified but reduced number of operational or standby centrifuges. Complete shutdown of the fordo facility for uranium-enrichment purposes, a step beyond the simple banning of enrichment in the obama-sanctioned deal. Iranian transparency on past military-focused nuclear activities. Iranian agreement to send its uranium stockpiles packing to another country ( which iran has made clear it won't do ). Israel's demands amount to what the journal calls \" a dramatic rewrite \" of the deal, unlikely to find traction on either side of the negotiating table. Meanwhile, on capitol hill, gop sen.

The list, produced by yuval steinitz, israel's minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the israeli government's harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu. Until now, israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the \"better deal \" that mr. Netanyahu told congress the world needed. But mr. Steinitz's list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by june 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the united states described critical elements of the deal on thursday."

            "The white house now views its central challenge as either negotiating a compromise with mr. Corker or stopping enough democrats from joining him so that he is short of a veto-proof majority, at least through june 30, the deadline to translate last week's preliminary agreement with iran onto paper. After that, officials said, mr. Obama may be in a stronger position to argue the merits of the accord. Conservatives are in the meantime watching carefully to make sure mr. Corker does not soften. \"corker is under enormous pressure from the white house to delay or weaken his own bill, \" said dan senor, a former bush administration official. \"but he has been strong on this issue, as has his committee and his caucus. I don't think he ' ll cave. \" while the president said in an interview over the weekend that he was open to finding a way for congress to \"express itself \" as long as it did not block his ability to carry out the agreement, aides worked on monday to discourage the impression that he could accept even a nonbinding vote. \"the president was, in an aspirational way, suggesting that we're going to engage with congress, particularly those members of congress that have done so on a principled basis, \" mr. Earnest said. \"on our two principles here, about protecting the presidential prerogative and preventing the implementation of the agreement, we're going to stand firm. \" that was fine with mr.

            "Jerusalem — clearly unsatisfied with assurances from president obama about the provisions of the iran nuclear deal, israel on monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by yuval steinitz, israel's minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the israeli government's harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu. Until now, israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the \"better deal \" that mr. Netanyahu told congress the world needed. But mr. Steinitz's list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by june 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the united states described critical elements of the deal on thursday."

Administrators who run the canal made adjustments to the water level and flow rate to assist with the search, but it was too late: the twins were found roughly an hour-and-a-half later and were pronounced dead at an area hospital, kpho reports. Marlene gleim, who said she's a family friend — and who's created a gofundme account to assist alexis keslar and her husband, mark — tells kyma that \" no parent should ever have to lose a child … let alone both of them at the same time. \" the gofundme account has raised more than $ 21,000 so far; gleim wrote that the funds will go toward memorial and medical costs.

Now, \" an 80's gold mine and a rare piece of apple history, \" has been unveiled, or so says the website for national geographic show diggers. It zeroed in on the capsule in september, but video of it is only coming out now, revealing its haul: a rubik's cube, a moody blues eight-track, and some very old balantine beer are among its hundreds of items. \" we just freaked out, \" george wyant, a co-host of the show, told cnet. As for jobs ' mouse, it comes from the apple lisa — the precursor to the first macintosh computer released in 1984 — and he used it while giving a talk at the conference, the telegraph reports. After the conference, hundreds of other items, many protected in plastic bags, were packed along with the mouse into a 13-foot metal pipe and buried. You can get a good look at the dig later this month when the whole thing airs feb. 25.",

Other nuggets include lying down on the ground with your head covered ( or even better, seeking immediate shelter underground or in a concrete or brick building ), staying indoors for at least 24 hours, and not rushing to pick up your kids at school — they're better off inside the building than in a car.

Also bidding was the new york city fc soccer team, which envisioned building a stadium on the site in elmont, just east of new york city. In october, islanders owner jon ledecky said the team will play at barclays center in brooklyn through the end of next season and the \" singular focus \" beyond that was for a new arena at belmont park. The team played at nassau coliseum from its inception in 1972 until the move to brooklyn in 2015, winning the stanley cup every year from 1980 to 1983. The move to the brooklyn arena was greeted with displeasure by fans, who always considered the team to be a long island staple. They applauded the reports the team would be headed back across the city limits to nassau county. \" it's long overdue, \" fan matt herbert tells the ap.",

            "Is nassau county big enough for two year-round concert and sporting venues? plans for an 18,000-seat arena for the new york islanders at belmont park in elmont were greeted with cheers from hockey fans tuesday. But sports business experts and area business leaders fear the belmont arena could cannibalize show opportunities at the recently renovated nassau coliseum, located 14 miles away. The islanders were informed tuesday that the state selected its bid to build a new arena that would host 150 events annually at the state-run park, according to sources familiar with the situation. Victor matheson, a sports economist with the college of the holy cross in worcester, massachusetts, said the two arenas will aggressively compete with each other for concerts and shows, splitting available dates and reducing the amount they could charge if they had the market to themselves. \"these venues will cannibalize events from one another, \" matheson said. \"combine that with msg and barclays [ center in brooklyn ] and you are starting to have a pretty crowded market, even for a large metro area like new york city. \" the coliseum reopened in april after an 18-month, $ 160 million renovation.

Clinton's plan, designed to court younger voters, isn't a total \" free ride \" proposal, the ap notes: clinton's aides say that while low-income students, veterans, and other qualifying students would indeed attend certain institutions for free, most families would still need to pitch in a \" realistic \" amount, while students would also contribute wages. Politico notes, however, the gop isn't exactly applauding the plan, which would be paid for by capping tax deductions for the wealthy. \" students, taxpayers, and voters should react with great skepticism to any proposals that would amount to a washington takeover of higher education, \" a republican aide tells politico.

No us indictment of assange has been announced, but wikileaks repeated the promise last week, tweeting: \" if obama grants manning clemency assange will agree to us extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of doj case. \" assange lawyer melinda taylor tells the ap that assange, who has been holed up in the london embassy since 2012, meant what he said. \" everything that he has said he's standing by, \" she says. A roundup of developments: cnn looks at obama's decision to free manning, which it says will count as one of the most controversial moments of his entire presidency. Sources say a key factor in the president's decision was the fact that manning had already pleaded guilty, unlike fellow leaker edward snowden. On friday, white house spokesman josh earnest drew a contrast between the manning and snowden cases. \" mr. Snowden fled into the arms of an adversary and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy, \" he said. Gizmodo takes a look at the background to what it calls assange's \" dumbass promise \" to turn himself in, noting that it is probably unlikely that the pledge affected obama's decision. The new york times reports that the decision to free manning angered some leading republicans, with john mccain calling her leaks of military information \" espionage \" and paul ryan describing the move as \" outrageous. \" engadget looks at another person who received clemency tuesday: general james cartwright, who pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about the stuxnet malware.

He was the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff from his nomination in 2007 through to his retirement from marine corps service in 2011, but he wasn't obama's golden boy. Cartwright was denied the top chairman spot in 2011 in part because of questions surrounding his staff management practices, including an alleged ( though never punished ) \" unduly familiar relationship \" with a female captain.

A major exception to that is julian assange, who managed to trip on his own dick in a big way. Last week, the wikileaks twitter account made a promise no one really asked for or expected: if chelsea manning were to be released, wikileaks founder julian assange would extradite himself to the us, thus ending his years-long stay in london's ecuadorian embassy where he's been holed up dodging a swedish rape investigation.

Chelsea manning, who was convicted of committing one of the biggest and most embarrassing leaks of classified information in us history. The move came with the hours fast running down on obama's presidency and rocked the political, intelligence and military intelligence establishments in washington. And it will now rest forever on the 44th president's legacy as one of the most controversial moments of his tenure, judging by the furious bipartisan reaction to his decision to free someone"

Writing for politico, adam lerner sees \" optimism \" as the entirely wrong word choice. As the ap recounts, a chief part of obama's asia policy has been the country's democratic reforms, the promise of which the us rewarded with suspended sanctions and visits from both hillary clinton and obama. But obama's three-year-old burma policy is rife with \" serious moral and practical shortcomings, \" which lerner sees as \" sadly embodied in the faded figure of aung san suu kyi, \" whom obama made a crucial part of his policy. The most egregious issue surrounds the country's rohingya muslims, who have suffered violence at the hands of buddhist mobs and are trapped in dismal camps. They have \" no real defenders... Including suu kyi, \" lerner writes. And so \" today, it seems, american foreign policy in the region is tethered to a... Victim of human-rights oppression who appears to be too timid — or or perhaps too political — to denounce ethnic cleansing in her own country. \" the rohingya lerner spoke with believe that if she were to publicly slam those mobs and call on the government to act, her national league for democracy party could suffer. What lerner will be watching for: \" whether the united states will use whatever influence it might still have to advocate on behalf of the rohingya, or simply on behalf of its favorite burmese politician, aung san suu kyi. \"",

But this merger \" effectively restores ma bell to her former girth yet allows the company to operate in a looser regulatory environment, \" writes david lazarus in the los angeles times. \" consumers might wonder if they've been played.... Ma bell is back, \" and the only thing left for federal regulators to do is instill \" new rules that address the shortcomings of our failed experiment in deregulation. \" the merger could leave the us market \" with just two dominant providers — and the prospect of higher rates and fewer choices for consumers, \" write david sarno and alex pham in the chicago tribune. Adds one consultant, \" this move by at&t is likely to start a chain reaction of consolidations, \" like sprint grabbing us cellular. Of course, one bright spot for t-mobile customers is that they may now be able to snag an iphone. Sprint, which \" has struggled to find its niche for years, \" now finds itself even worse off.

Staff at florida hospital memorial center in daytona beach tell police they saw jan sochalski, 61, lying across the chest of husband henry sochalski, 64, and pinching his nose, reports people. He died soon after. Two other allegations in the arrest report: the button on the machine that dispensed pain medication had been pressed 264 times over eight hours, allegedly by jan sochalski; it's supposed to be pressed just six times an hour, and a safety mechanism kicked in to prevent excess doses. Also, nurses say sochalski, who previously worked as a nurse for 40 years in new jersey, requested a drug for her husband that would have dramatically slowed his breathing. It was denied. \" she was asking for medication that would hinder his breathing instead of helping his breathing, \" says a police spokesman, per wkmg. Henry sochalski initially went into the hospital for elective back surgery, but he suffered respiratory and cardiac arrest afterward, and required a tracheotomy, the news-journal reports. Jan sochalski was so angry over what she perceived as poor care that she threatened to shoot everyone on the floor, say investigators. After her husband's death, she called the medical examiner's office to learn if her husband had been brain dead, telling a staffer \" she wanted to be sure she had made the right decision, \" according to the newspaper. The cause of death was asphyxia, and sochalski has been charged with second-degree murder. ( this mother admitted giving her disabled daughter a fatal overdose. )",

According to gawker, michelle fields claims she was trying to ask trump a question about affirmative action as he was leaving the press conference when his campaign manager corey lewandowski grabbed her arm hard enough to leave bruises. While fields says she didn't see who grabbed her, a washington post reporter standing nearby says it was lewandowski, cnn reports. The jupiter police department is investigating her claims as a misdemeanor battery case. Trump says he thinks fields is making the whole thing up, and lewandowski went even further. \" you are totally delusional, \" the campaign manager tweets. \" i never touched you. As a matter of fact, i have never even met you. \" fields ' employer, breitbart, stood by her claims thursday before hedging its bets as videos of the incident started to make it online friday.

Kilauea, a shield volcano that rose from the sea more than 50,000 years ago, is among the world's most active, and its pu ' u o ' o spatter cone has been erupting nonstop since 1983. But not too long ago a new vent opened on the east side of the crater, spilling lava down the southern side of kilauea, where it crept its way to the sea in a phenomenon not seen since 2013, reports motherboard. \" these fragments accumulate along the submarine slope to form a loose foundation that will eventually support overlying lava flows that build the delta above sea level, \" the usgs reports. The \" spectacular displays \" caused by lava colliding with much cooler water can reveal lava that shatters into fragments as tiny as grains of sand and as big as blocks, and the usgs warns that visitors should avoid walking on or near these so-called lava deltas, which can collapse and cause submarine landslides, trigger explosions, or swallow people whole. Gizmodo reports that all this volatile activity has in the past added hundreds of acres to hawaii's shorelines; as of right now, the lava flow already spans 787 feet, with visitors ( there are thousands ) urged to explore using extreme caution.
