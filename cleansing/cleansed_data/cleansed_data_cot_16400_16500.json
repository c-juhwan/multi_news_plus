        "summary": "Seventeen years later, faiz siddiqui is still peeved about a poor grade he got in university — so peeved, in fact, that he's suing his former school for $ 1.3 million. At the high court in london on tuesday, a lawyer described how siddiqui's dream of becoming an international commercial lawyer was crushed when a poor grade in the indian special subject of his modern history course at oxford university meant that he received a low upper second-class degree in june 2000, rather than a first-class or high upper second, report the bbc and guardian. ( in the uk, degrees are ranked based on a student's average mark. ) siddiqui, 39, who is unemployed, is seeking $ 1.3 million in lost wages while blaming \" inadequate \" teaching \" in what was anticipated to be his favored special subject, \" his lawyer says. Oxford acknowledges four of seven staff members who taught asian history were on sabbatical during the 1999-2000 academic year. But a lawyer for the school — who describes siddiqui's academic performance as \" laced with inconsistency, \" per the telegraph — says siddiqui received the same instruction as he would've in any other year. Siddiqui disagrees, claiming 13 of 15 students in the same situation as him received their \" lowest or joint lowest mark \" in the special subject. He adds his tutor failed to notify examiners of his health issues; siddiqui says his clinical depression and insomnia only intensified following his \" inexplicable failure. \" a judge is expected to determine liability at the end of a seven-day hearing; the school lost its bid to have the case thrown out in december. A win for siddiqui \" could open the floodgates for similar claims, \" per the guardian.",

It was all just part of the finnish military's spring training practice, though reports vary as to whether kamsholmen was an 11th-hour addition to the destination list or a predetermined training ground where residents were mistakenly left out of the loop.

Even more worrisome: these so-called silent heart attacks are \" as bad as \" any other heart attack. Nbc news reports people having silent heart attacks often think it's the flu, a strained muscle, or indigestion. They can also write one off as a sore jaw, according to cnn. These symptoms are far more subtle than the chest pain or shortness of breath more commonly seen as signs of a heart attack. But people who have a silent heart attack are still more likely — by about three times — to die from heart disease, according to the new research. In the study published monday in circulation, researchers looked at the records of nearly 9,500 people over 26 years. They found that silent heart attacks account for 45 % of all heart attacks while often going unnoticed or ignored. They are found later by ekgs. Men are more likely to suffer silent heart attacks, but they're more often fatal in women. That's because women are more likely to minimize their symptoms or have them mistaken for something else, such as diabetes. Researchers say silent heart attacks need to be treated with the same seriousness as other heart attacks. People who have one likely need to take actions like lowering their blood pressure and cholesterol, exercising more, and quitting smoking.

Jeremiah wright claims that church wasn't barack and michelle obama's \"thing, \" but in a speech the first lady delivered to african methodist episcopal church in nashville, tennessee, on thursday, she sang a very different tune. From the pulpit, mrs. Obama told parishioners that there's \"no place better \" to talk about political issues than the church. Legally, churches are restricted from delving too deeply into the political schema. While they can address the issues of the day, internal revenue service ( irs ) regulations forbid pastors and faith leaders from endorsing candidates from the pulpit. Many conservative and liberal leaders, alike, rail against these regulations, claiming that they are unfair and that they hamper free speech. So, does obama agree with these critics? well, we can't be entirely sure. While she stopped short of telling pastors to endorse people, she endorsed issues as being a centerpiece for viable discussion. Cns news has more about the speech that obama delivered about faith issues and electoral politics.

            "Faith rev. Jeremiah wright claims that church wasn't barack and michelle obama's \"thing, \" but in a speech the first lady delivered to african methodist episcopal church in nashville, tennessee, on thursday, she sang a very different tune. From the pulpit, mrs. Obama told parishioners that there's \"no place better \" to talk about political issues than the church. Legally, churches are restricted from delving too deeply into the political schema. While they can address the issues of the day, internal revenue service ( irs ) regulations forbid pastors and faith leaders from endorsing candidates from the pulpit. Many conservative and liberal leaders, alike, rail against these regulations, claiming that they are unfair and that they hamper free speech. So, does obama agree with these critics? well, we can't be entirely sure. While she stopped short of telling pastors to endorse people, she endorsed issues as being a centerpiece for viable discussion. Cns news has more about the speech that obama delivered about faith issues and electoral politics. In her talk, she made it clear that houses of worship, in her view, are the prime location at which to discuss these \"moral issues \": there is no better place than church to talk about political issues because they are ultimately moral issues, first lady",

        "summary": "Federal investigations of hillary clinton almost played an even bigger role in this election than they already do, insiders say. Sources tell the wall street journal that by february of this year, fbi agents thought they had enough evidence to investigate whether clinton foundation donors improperly received favorable treatment from the state department when hillary clinton was in charge. Senior justice department and fbi officials, however, rejected the evidence — including a secret recording of a suspect in a corruption case talking about deals bill and hillary clinton allegedly made — as insufficient, the sources say. The investigation began after the publication of the book clinton cash by conservative writer peter schweizer, notes the journal and the new york times. The book looked at \" ethical challenges, \" including money that flowed to the clintons after the russian purchase of a uranium company. Essentially, the book asserted that foreign entities who gave money to the foundation got special treatment by the state department. Cnn reports that the field agents — who also allegedly uncovered a possible suspicious transaction involving a clinton foundation donor — were repeatedly told by the justice department there wasn't enough evidence for the investigation to proceed, and any issuing of subpoenas or similar steps should not be made until after election day. The issue has reportedly caused an escalating feud between fbi agents and federal corruption prosecutors. ( president obama has spoken out on the fbi's handling of clinton's latest email issue. )",

The chamber voted 170-162 today in favor of legalizing up to 1 ounce of pot, reports the concord monitor. The measure also would make it legal to grow and sell pot, and the state would collect a tax. The problem for pro-legalization supporters is that even if the bill eventually makes it through the state senate ( before then, it actually needs to go back through a house panel and then through the full house again ), gov. Maggie hassan has promised to veto it, reports ap. So a futile effort? not exactly. While colorado and washington have legalized pot through voter referendums, today's vote marks the first time that a us legislative body has done so, reports us news &amp; world report. \" house members made history today and they are clearly on the right side of it, \" says the political director of the marijuana policy project.

The woman, so far only known as jane doe, filed a lawsuit a year ago alleging that she started dating rose in 2011, but she became uncomfortable with some of the things rose wanted her to do, like having group sex and masturbating on skype. She says that in august 2013, she was hanging out with rose and his friends, got so drunk she passed out ( her lawyer says it's possible she was drugged ), and was taken to her apartment in a taxi. She says rose, his friend, and his manager followed in another car, came in through an unlocked door, and took turns raping her in the apartment, and she woke up with used condoms around her and her legs covered in lube. Rose, 27, says the group sex was consensual and doe allowed the men into her apartment. Rose's team and the 30-year-old doe's team had previously agreed that the jury would hear her name, but the judge's decision means that anyone with access to the courtroom — including reporters — will also hear it, the washington post reports, though the paper notes that most media organizations don't publish the names of alleged rape victims. Doe has recently been doing interviews, and she told the ap it's important to her to remain anonymous in public. Her mexican family, which is not aware of the allegations, has \" very traditional cultural expectations of me. \" she also says she's been harassed and fears more harassment should her name be made public. Plus, she added to the ap, \" i want to share my story so women can know that they are able to come forward and remain anonymous and not to have to have the burden or the worry that their loved ones will find out. \" rose's team says the woman is lying, and that by making her name public, she can be exposed as a fraud.",

A spokeswoman for australia's arm of world animal protection condemned the behaviour of the beachgoers who \" used the animals for entertainment purposes \". \" this terribly unfortunate event is an example of the casual cruelty people can inflict when they use animals for entertainment purposes, without thinking of the animal's needs, \" she told the abc. \" at least one of these dolphins suffered a horrific, traumatic and utterly"

        "summary": "Shaun king is relieved cops caught new york/new jersey bombing suspect ahmad rahami monday. And he calls it \" amazing \" in his essay for the new york daily news that the two police officers in linden, nj, who apprehended rahami were able to bring in the armed 28-year-old alive, all while escaping serious injury themselves. King offers them kudos for removing rahami as a public safety threat, for risking their own lives to catch him, and for doing it without killing rahami, ensuring officials can at least try to pull some answers out of him about his alleged actions. But the fact that rahami still has a pulse leads king to another question he can't stop pondering: \" can african-americans all over the country get a little of that ahmad khan rahami treatment? \" king refers to the fact that, despite a violent confrontation with rahami in which he allegedly shot at officers, he was brought into custody alive and mostly intact, because \" somebody somewhere wanted rahami to be brought alive for questioning. \" and that's a luxury king says african-americans don't seem to be afforded when confronted by the police. King references several high-profile cases of black men gunned down, including terence crutcher, the unarmed oklahoma man shot dead by police friday — a man king says wasn't armed, dangerous, or \" even a suspect. \" \" maybe if [ these black men ] had shot up a movie theater or a church or planted a bomb in chelsea — they'd all be alive right now, but somebody would have to actually have wanted to take them in alive, \" king writes. \" black folk don't get that treatment. \" ( king's full column here. )",

        "summary": "The front-runner grabbed so much attention at last night's republican debate that some commentators are calling it the \" donald trump show \" — but there's plenty of disagreement on whether the debate helped his campaign, or those of the nine rivals that made the cut. Here's what the pundits are saying. Trump made the rest of the candidates look boring — but he also made them look \" responsible, polite, and grown-up, \" and made ted cruz look \" serious and knowledgeable, \" writes jim geraghty at the national review. The \" shining \" marco rubio turned in the best performance, geraghty writes, but jeb bush was dull and mike huckabee seemed tired. Nate cohn at the new york times also thinks rubio had a good debate, as did scott walker and john kasich, who \" advanced their causes \" with solid performances. Bush, however, wasn't especially strong and trump's \" weakest \" performance means he \" probably won't receive as much media attention coming out of the debate as he did in the weeks before it, \" cohn writes. Trump was a winner for staying \" true to trump, which is what got him to the top of the polls in the first place, \" but a loser for his rosie o'donnell remark, according to abc. Other winners include \" hometown hero \" kasich and the moderating team. Trump's \" combative, outlandish, at times barely coherent \" performance is what the debate will be remembered for, writes paul lewis at the guardian — though he became quieter when the debate shifted to \" policy areas where he had little or nothing of substance to contribute. \" the hill crunches the numbers and finds that trump was mentioned a total of 17 times during the debate — four fewer mentions than either hillary clinton or isis, but four more than president obama and 10 more than obamacare. Benghazi, oddly, wasn't mentioned once. Trump's \" in-your-face routine fell a little flat in the debate hall, \" decides glenn thrush at politico, and the contrast between him and the \" talented field of conservative governors and senators \" was not flattering. Walker, meanwhile, was a \" plodder, \" thrush writes but he had the best line of the night: \" it's sad to think right now, but probably the russian and chinese government know more about hillary clinton's email server than do the members of the united states congress. \" click for the 10 trumpiest lines of the night.",

Millions of people would have been killed. Now we have this great relationship. \" he said his efforts to improve relations with kim have brought positive results — ending rocket tests, helping free hostages, and getting the remains of us servicemen returned home. And he defended his unusual approach. \" it's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there, \" trump said, pointing at the crowd.",

As gizmodo explains, a redditor known only by the user name _9mother9horse9eyes9 began publishing lengthy, bizarre comments in unrelated posts in april, and people began to notice a connection. If read together, the comments seemed to be telling a story about what the verge calls an \" eerie alternate world. \" as happens on reddit, a group of fans created a subreddit dedicated to discussion and analysis of the posts, and they've collected them in chronological order here under the title of the interface series. That's a reference to the \" flesh interfaces \" that feature prominently in the tale, which may or may not be portals into an alternate universe. More than 75 entries are now posted, with a new one, sometimes more, added nearly every day. \" at the distinct risk of sounding like a grandiose crackpot, i would sum up my story as a warning to humanity, \" the author tells the bbc, while maintaining anonymity. \" i believe we are rushing headlong toward a focal point at which the future of our species will be decided. \" the author — some theorists suspect more than one person is at work — claims to be a 30-something male living in the us who works as a translator and once regularly did lsd. The latter point might help explain how the plot lines jump across space and time, with the story told from various points of view, including us servicemen in vietnam and world war ii. \" i don't know exactly where the story is going, \" the author says, \" but i do know the information i want to convey, which guides the story. \" ( another reddit mystery involves a sequence of numbers. )",

On thursday, as politico reported, gay-rights advocates criticized the justice department for filing another legal brief defending the defense of marriage act, the 1996 law that defines the federal government's view of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Doj spokeswoman tracy shmaler told the huffington post the department was merely fulfilling its legal obligations, \" defending the statute, as it traditionally does when acts of congress are challenged. \" but lgbt groups have long since soured on this line of defense, arguing that president barack obama could simply declare the government uninterested in backing doma's constitutionality, allowing it to be struck down. Precedent certainly falls on the side of the justice department in this debate. But legal experts aren't sold on the administration's claim that defending doma is the only option. The politics, however, are much more fascinating than the legal vagaries, in part because of obama's own place in civil-rights history. \""

Stats issued by the international air transport association called 2015 an \" extraordinarily safe year, \" noting that 37.6 million jets and turboprops safely shuttled more than 3.5 billion passengers to their destinations. Those numbers don't include two planes brought down by supposed criminal actions: germanwings 9525, likely due to pilot suicide, and metrojet 9268, believed to have been downed by terrorism, per an iata release. The benchmark was reached after steadily declining numbers in recent years: in 2013 there were six fatal jetliner crashes worldwide, and in 2014 that dropped to three. \" long-term trend data shows us that flying is getting even safer, \" iata ceo tony tyler says. There were four propeller-plane crashes in 2015, resulting in 136 deaths, and the journal notes these planes are usually in more far-flung areas with less-experienced pilots. But even turboprop accidents saw a 60 % reduction in crashes from 2014.

        "summary": "Despite all facebook's talk about improving privacy, it still takes an awfully long time for photos to actually be deleted from the site. Jacqui cheng experimented with deleting one of her photos from flickr, twitter, myspace, and facebook last year. Flickr and twitter removed the photos within seconds — meaning that the direct link to the photo stopped working almost immediately. Myspace and facebook, however, were slower — and now, 16 months later, the direct link to cheng's deleted facebook photo still works. Of course, the only way to access such a deleted photo is by using the direct url. A facebook spokesperson defends the site's slowness — \" for all practical purposes, the photo no longer exists \" — and says it's working with its content delivery network to shrink the amount of time that deleted photos remain in its cache. Even so, cheng writes on ars technica, \"if you don't want to give your enemies blackmail material, don't upload questionable photos in the first place. \" click here for more facebook privacy flaps.",

            "In an age where your boss, coworkers, parents, and even ( *gasp* ) grandparents are finally joining social networks, we are all more aware than ever that we had better keep things relatively clean. And if you were someone who joined myspace, facebook, flickr, or a number of other sites years ago, you may have more cleaning up to do than usual — after all, back then, you were probably young( er ) and dumb( er ), posting silly pics of your drunken escapades or questionable updates regarding your unusual interest in english cucumbers. If you delete questionable images of yourself, you may be in the clear — or you may not, depending on the social network. As it turns out, some social networks delete your images right away while others hold onto them even after claiming they've been deleted. This was the discovery made by researchers at cambridge university last month when they found that images deleted from social media sites are often left on the server, ripe for anyone to embed elsewhere or link up. We put this finding to the test and found that some of the most popular sites on the internet do, in fact, keep images on their servers after you delete them. On may 21, 2009, we deleted photos from four of the networks most used by",
            "Facebook may be making strides in some areas of privacy, but the company is still struggling when it comes to deleting user photos — or not deleting them, as the case may be. We wrote a piece more than a year ago examining whether photos really disappear from social network servers when you delete them, and found that facebook was one of the worst offenders when it came to leaving \" deleted \" photos online. We decided to revisit the issue recently when readers continued to point out that our deleted photos from that article were still online more than 16 months later.

            "In an age where your boss, coworkers, parents, and even ( *gasp* ) grandparents are finally joining social networks, we are all more aware than ever that we had better keep things relatively clean. And if you were someone who joined myspace, facebook, flickr, or a number of other sites years ago, you may have more cleaning up to do than usual — after all, back then, you were probably young( er ) and dumb( er ), posting silly pics of your drunken escapades or questionable updates regarding your unusual interest in english cucumbers. If you delete questionable images of yourself, you may be in the clear — or you may not, depending on the social network. As it turns out, some social networks delete your images right away while others hold onto them even after claiming they've been deleted. This was the discovery made by researchers at cambridge university last month when they found that images deleted from social media sites are often left on the server, ripe for anyone to embed elsewhere or link up. We put this finding to the test and found that some of the most popular sites on the internet do, in fact, keep images on their servers after you delete them. On may 21, 2009, we deleted photos from four of the networks most used by",

We wrote a piece more than a year ago examining whether photos really disappear from social network servers when you delete them, and found that facebook was one of the worst offenders when it came to leaving \" deleted \" photos online. We decided to revisit the issue recently when readers continued to point out that our deleted photos from that article were still online more than 16 months later.

The study was small and very specific: researchers asked 60 college-aged women who exercise regularly and have a history of body image issues to work out for a half-hour or sit quietly and read during that time. So not only does the study need to be replicated among a larger cohort, but it doesn't necessarily speak to women who are of different ages, or who don't exercise regularly or have body image issues in the first place. Still, the researchers say it's not a stretch to suggest that exercise can help certain women replace negative body thoughts with positive ones, reports ndtv.

The global seed vault in svalbard, norway, has since 2008 stored seeds within a mountain on a norwegian island 800 miles from the north pole, and on monday the number of crops it stores crossed the 1 million mark, thanks to a new shipment that included varieties of black-eyed pea and the bambara groundnut. The bbc puts its number of deposits at 1,059,646, which is 90,000 less than what could have been following a withdrawal related to the war in syria. That's enough to nearly fill one of the vault's three chambers, leaving room for what scientists believe will be the eventual total count: 2.2 million crops. Voice of america reports 73 institutions from around the globe have contributed seeds, and it points out a notable country not found on the list: china, though it's apparently discussing the possibility of making a deposit. Seeds aren't the only thing pouring into the vault: money, too, in order to extend the vault's \" viability, \" as bloomberg puts it. Norway on friday announced $ 13 million in upgrades to what was originally a $ 9 million construction job, reports reuters. It quotes the agriculture ministry's description of the planned work: \" construction of a new, concrete-built access tunnel, as well as a service building to house emergency power and refrigerating units and other electrical equipment that emits heat through the tunnel. \" ( there was a breach at the vault last year. )",

While previous administrators received door-to-door security, pruitt saw that expanded to 24/7 protection, including the time he spent inside epa headquarters. The office of the inspector general report found that the epa doesn't have an approved process to determine when it's necessary to increase security for an administrator, and it was pruitt's office that made the final determination, politico reports. The epa was supposed to conduct a threat assessment within two weeks of pruitt taking the helm to determine whether the increased security was justified, but apparently never did so, the report says. \" failure to properly justify the level of protective services provided to the administrator has allowed costs to increase from $ 1.6 million to $ 3.5 million in just 11 months, \" the report states. But it does not accuse pruitt of anything illegal. In explaining the increased security — pruitt had a security detail more than three times the size of his predecessor — agency officials cited an increased number of threats against pruitt and his family, as well as people protesting his public appearances. But the oig report, released tuesday, says officials relied on a 2017 memo that was not a formal threat assessment, and that they made the decision to increase security six months before that memo was prepared. \" we have not received any documented evidence or justification supporting the decision to continue to provide 24/7 protective services, \" the report says, per the ap. The oig is still investigating pruitt's habit of flying exclusively first-class, his infamous $ 43,000 secure phone booth, and more. The house oversight committee, white house, and the office of management and budget are conducting their own probes.",

The planned pipeline would transport oil from canada to illinois, but it would cross the missouri river just upstream of the standing rock reservation in north dakota. That presents grave environmental concerns for the tribe. Cbc reports a ruling from a federal judge that could possibly stop work on the pipeline in and around the standing rock reservation is expected friday. Here's what you need to know about the pipeline and the protest before then: the ap has an easy-to-read primer on the situation, answering questions such as why the pipeline is being built and if it's safe. Msnbc's lawrence o'donnell calls the plight of the standing rock sioux nation a \" morally embarrassing reminder \" that the \" country was founded on genocide. \" the daily beast reports the growing protest isn't so simple as native americans vs. The pipeline. Environmentalists are piggybacking on the protest to fight against fossil fuels in general. Despite native americans being at the heart of the protest, fox news latino argues the outcome could have a \" disproportionately negative impact on the latino community, \" as the battle is about clean water, something minority communities in particular struggle to get access to. Cnn also has a good explainer of the protest and what's at stake, from an america that is self-sufficient when it comes to its energy to a potential massive environmental disaster. Writing in the los angeles times, environmentalist bill mckibben says it's time for hillary clinton to take a public stance on the pipeline, stand with protesters, and prove that she will champion progressive causes as president. Meanwhile the huffington post reports on harold hamm, current trump aide and potential future us secretary of energy, who stands to make a lot of money off the pipeline, which would transport oil obtained by his company.",

Officials tell abc news that mnuchin's office made a formal — and unusual — request after his june wedding to the scottish actress, but officials decided he did not need the us air force jet, which would have cost around $ 25,000 an hour to operate. A treasury department spokesman says mnuchin, a member of the national security council, asked for the jet for the honeymoon to scotland, france, and italy because he wanted to maintain secure communication, politico reports. Travel on military aircraft, however, is usually reserved for cabinet members who deal more directly with national security, the guardian reports. \" you don't need a giant rulebook of government requirements to just say yourself,'this is common sense, it's wrong, ' \" sen.

Alexander delgado mounted his escape from the prison, located in the capital lima, on january 10 last year, during a visit from his brother giancarlo delgado. Leaving giancarlo in his cell, alexander passed through all the facility's security checks to freedom wearing his brother's clothes and flashing his identification card. It took several hours before the authorities worked out what had happened. Investigators doubted giancarlo's version that he had been drugged and never knew anything about the plan, but prosecutors later dropped efforts to charge him with complicity in the jailbreak for lack of evidence.

        "summary": "The federal government learned it was losing an important figure this week. No, not james comey, but the director of the us census bureau. The resignation announcement of john thompson was overshadowed by comey's firing, but wired argues there's good reason to care about it. A former census head says the loss of thompson could cause things to \" slow down \" ahead of the 2020 count at a time they should be picking up speed. The 10-year census is used for everything from allocating congressional seats to determining where new infrastructure is needed. One economist worries thompson quitting means \" we're going to have to make important decisions with less information. \" here's what else you need to know: thompson has been with the bureau since 1975 and director since 2013. He had been expected to at least serve out his five-year term that expires at the end of the year, but instead he ' ll be gone june 30. The official line is that he is leaving to pursue \" private sector \" opportunities, reports npr. The washington post reports the resignation was mostly related to funding, or a lack thereof. Census funding typically ramps up in the years prior to the count, but funding approved under the trump administration is less than requested and far less than what is needed, experts say. The census looks at seven data points that can have big ramifications if poorly counted, according to vox. That includes data on senior citizens and poverty levels in order to provide appropriate service levels for those in need. The new york times explains the importance of the census through a q&a, noting that it's used to draw congressional districts and distribute federal funds while being relied on by federal agencies and private businesses. Citylab reports it's true the census is more expensive than ever — it cost $ 76 more to count a household in 2010 than in 1970 — but that's not really the government's fault. Fewer people are responding to old-fashioned mailed surveys, so canvassers have to be sent for followup interviews. The areas of the census being targeted for cost savings is worrying, according to an opinion piece in the guardian. So far republicans and the trump administration have gotten rid of questions on sexual orientation and are proposing skipping data on \" racial disparities, \" writes mona chalabi. A post at mic argues that the loss of thompson could be more important than the loss of comey in the long run. Immigrants and communities of color, who rely on an accurate census to ensure political representation, are already routinely under-counted when the census has proper funding and leadership. \" put",

        "summary": "As of jan. 1, walmart will no longer offer 30,000 of its employees health insurance. Bloomberg notes that's about 2 % of its workforce. The move comes as a reaction to the company's rising health care costs as far more of its employees and their families enrolled in its health care plans than it had expected following the obamacare rollout. The ap reports those costs will surge $ 500 million this fiscal year, $ 170 million more than had been estimated. Those affected are employees who average fewer than 30 hours of work per week; the wall street journal explains they were grandfathered in when walmart in 2012 stopped offering insurance to new hires who didn't exceed the 30-hour threshold. A benefits expert says walmart is actually late to the game in terms of cutting insurance to some part-time workers; target, the home depot, and others have already done so. Meanwhile, walmart's full time workers will see their premiums rise in 2015. Premiums for the basic plan, which 40 % of its workforce is on, will increase 19 % to $ 21.90 per pay period come jan. 1.",

( wmt ), the largest private-sector employer in the u.s., will cut medical benefits to about 30,000 workers in response to mounting health-care costs and the growth of alternatives available under obamacare. Wal-mart will no longer provide health coverage to employees who work less than 30 hours a week, according to a statement today on its website. The change is in line with moves by fellow retailers, including target corp. ( tgt ), home depot inc. ( hd ) and walgreen co. ( wag ), the company said. \"we don't make these decisions lightly, and the fact remains that our plans exceed those of our peers in the retail industry, \" sally welborn, senior vice president of global benefits, said on the company's blog.

Dylan thomas woke up saturday morning with an angry red scar about 2 inches long extending up from his navel. That night, it was 3 inches longer. He went to a doctor on sunday and was given a cream to deal with what was believed to be an insect bite. It didn't help, and painful red blisters came next. On monday, doctors called in a dermatologist, who finally figured out what was happening and plucked the spider from his skin. \" it wasn't really a tickling sensation, obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling, \" thomas, 21, told a radio station, according to watoday. The best guess is that the spider got inside thomas'skin via a scar from a recent appendectomy. \" it takes a lot to deter me, but i do feel violated, \" says thomas, now known to his friends as spider-man — who was, by the way, staying in a four-and-a-half-star hotel room when the incident occurred.

Who's hot about it: supporters of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, which boasts a painting that looks to be the inspiration for the deadpool poster, reports fox 13. The poster ( see it here ) shows the film's main character, wearing a flowing white garment under the words \" yule believe in miracles, \" with various characters playing musical instruments on either side of him, per the salt lake tribune. What's got lds advocates upset is that it very closely resembles harry anderson's the second coming, which was commissioned by the church and now appears in various lds venues and adherents ' homes. Instead of the masked ryan reynolds character, the anderson art shows jesus christ in a white robe, surrounded by angels playing trumpets. A petition signed by more than 36,000 people as of thursday morning notes that \" it is unknown if the picture was used to intentionally mock the church of jesus christ, but it is clear it was copied from the original picture. This is a form [ of ] religious discrimination. \" some of the petition's comments include accusations of blasphemy, hate speech, and sacrilege over the poster — though a few commenters tell others to lighten up over the \" satirical \" poster and \" go see the movie. \" a mormon studies expert says the movie's marketing team should've more properly vetted how this poster would affect the lds community. \" if that wasn't done, then i think it's a failure of research, \" he tells fox 13. \" if it was done and they're disregarding people's feelings...

While \" we've always heard that same-sex marriage would never affect anyone aside from the same-sex couples who wanted to be married, \" writes stutzman, \" a judge recently told me that my freedom to live and work according to my beliefs about marriage expired the day same-sex marriage became the law in my state. \" stutzman has now taken on that judge's ruling: she recently filed an appeal with the washington state supreme court after the judge's february decision that she ran afoul of the state's consumer protection act with her 2013 refusal, kvew notes. \" the government is telling me i can only be a faithful christian within the four walls of my church, \" she writes. \" what would rob and curt say if the government told them they could only be who they are in their own homes? \" read stutzman's entire take.",

Fortunately, tropical depression zoraida landed almost 300 miles from the worst of typhoon haiyan's devastation, the wall street journal notes, and the latest storm — the 25th to hit the country this year — has been downgraded to a low-pressure area, philstar.com reports. Still, davao city, the large southern island's biggest city and regional home to 2.2 million, saw 3.2 inches of rain over 24 hours, weather.com reports. The site adds that some of the areas slammed by haiyan have seen heavy new showers. Meanwhile, the philippines is calling for climate change action following the typhoon. With un meetings on the matter beginning in warsaw, philippines delegate naderev saño wrote in the guardian yesterday: \" to anyone who continues to deny the reality that is climate change, i dare them to get off their ivory towers... I dare them to go to the islands of the pacific. \" his comments come with governments struggling to move forward on the issue, the guardian notes. But \" typhoons such as haiyan and its impacts represent a sobering reminder to the international community that we cannot afford to procrastinate on climate action, \" he writes.",

A roundup of coverage: mayor bill de blasio has called for an investigation into the removal of 120,000 voters from the rolls in brooklyn since november, including entire buildings of voters, npr reports. The perception of irregularities \" undermines the integrity of the entire electoral process and must be fixed, \" the democrat says. Sanders called the purging of the rolls in the area where he grew up \" absurd \" in a tuesday night speech, and a campaign spokesman tells cnn that the state's handling of the primary — \" from long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered new yorkers being dropped from the rolls \" — was a \" disgrace. \" clinton, who won by a larger than expected margin of around 14 %, may now pivot toward the general election, politico reports. \" today you proved again, there's no place like home, \" she told jubilant supporters in new york after the win was announced. \" this one's personal, \" she added. Harry enten at fivethirtyeight crunches the numbers and finds that not only is clinton on course to win the nomination, her delegate lead is now so large it would take a \" minor miracle \" for sanders to win the nomination, which would require winning 59 % of the remaining delegates. \" minor miracles do sometimes happen, \" he writes, but new york reaffirmed that clinton \" is almost certainly going to be the democratic nominee for president. \" for now, sanders is focusing on the five states voting next tuesday: connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania, and rhode island, most of which are seen as clinton-friendly. Senior sanders adviser tad devine tells the ap that after next week's contests, the campaign will \" sit back and assess where we are. \"",

In a recent study, climate scientists found that billion-dollar-plus disasters ( among them hurricanes sandy and irene, and the 2011 texas wildfires ) are happening more and more frequently, and quantified that frequency: it's increasing at the rate of 4.8 % each year. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that we're seeing more instances of extreme weather, just that the extreme weather we are seeing has better aim — striking more populated areas. Last year, for instance, saw a decade-low in the number of tornadoes, yet six of them caused more than a billion dollars in damage. ( compare that to the 1980s, in which just 20 disasters, adjusted, hit the billion-dollar threshold. ) the oklahoma tornado appears, if the $ 2 billion figure is about right, to be one of the most expensive tornadoes in us history, nbc news reports, having affected as many as 13,000 homes.

Now that 36-year-old author kristen roupenian has been thrust into the public eye, she's making yet another headline — this time for a book deal reportedly worth seven figures, sources tell the ap and new york times. The deal with scout press, a simon &amp; schuster imprint, is said to include an untitled novel and collection of short stories called you know you want this, which is scheduled for a spring 2019 release. Last week, the london publishing firm jonathan cape acquired the uk rights to the collection, per the guardian. Deborah treisman, the fiction editor for the new yorker, tells the times that roupenian's success is uncommon in two ways: that \" cat person \" struck such a nerve with so many — it's now the magazine's second-most-read article of 2017 — and that a short-story collection would command such a high price from a publisher, especially as she's not a well-known writer or celebrity. Treisman praises roupenian's attention to detail in her writing ( \" when 2 million people are collectively cringing over a sex scene, you've done something right \" ), while jonathan cape's publishing chief advises roupenian's new fans not to expect \" cat person \" clones in her new collection. \" they're dark, they're funny, they're irreverent, they're treading boundaries, and they're very different to one another, \" michal shavit says, per the los angeles times. \" but they're not all about the relationships between men and women. \"",

But do they bring the laughs? \" although this fish-out-of-water scenario might sound over-familiar, both the humor and action here are startling and visceral, \" writes liam lacey at the globe and mail. Feig is \" tightroping between a plausibly suspenseful action film and a comedy where the characters are all the more funny for playing their ridiculous characters straight. \" as for mccarthy, \" she rocks it \" in \" the kind of double-barreled role she was born to play. \" the film does run long, but lacey wants more: a whole franchise worth. Tom russo agrees the movie starts to drag a bit. But for the most part, it's good fun. \" mccarthy doesn't just adopt guises to fool the bad guys, \" he writes at the boston globe. \" part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts she pulls on the audience. \" the laughs are \" infectious, \" he adds, noting feig's script \" leaves you wondering why he doesn't write his own projects more often. \" it leaves russo with high hopes for mccarthy and feig's next project, ghostbusters. \" look out, bond.

Marquez was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. Marquez appeared in 27 episodes of er, and also appeared in the film stand and deliver and the series malcolm &amp; eddie and wiseguy, per variety. Social media posts suggest it has been a turbulent time for marquez. In january 2017, she wrote a long facebook post that mentions harassment, medical problems, and allegations that her er coworkers helped blacklist her. Late last year, she again alleged, this time via twitter, that she had been blacklisted by er costar george clooney for complaining about harassment, us weekly reports. At that time, clooney denied the allegations, saying, \" the fact that i couldn't affect her career is only surpassed by the fact that i wouldn't. \" marquez's twitter account was later suspended, and in an aug. 8 facebook post, she alleged that it was suspended because she called out clooney, a friend of twitter ceo jack dorsey.",

        "summary": "On sunday night, president obama addressed the nation from the oval office for the third time in his presidency. What the pundits are saying about the rare event: at politico, edward-isaac dovere has pretty much nothing positive to say about a speech that \" said close to nothing \" and did little to advance america's understanding of how our leader and government plan to combat terrorism. It was a \" not-so-peppy pep talk, \" and seven years after his \" cool, calm ' i got this ' air helped get him elected... It's clear that many americans don't want reassurance, but want him to convey the sense of urgency that they're feeling. \" he failed to do that, nor did he even manage to reassure. In a washington post piece headlined \" obama's oval office address reflects struggle to be heard, \" greg jaffe agrees that obama said nothing new, but rather tried to get the american people to hear what he's been saying for weeks: that he's pursuing a strategy that is \" strong and smart, resilient and relentless. \" his goal was to reassure, and jaffe doesn't really weigh in on whether he did that. But he does note that \" the absence of big new policy proposals from the president reflects the lack of any low-cost or tidy solutions to ease [ america's ] concerns. \" at the new york times, david e. Sanger argues that the purpose of obama's speech wasn't to reveal new strategies against isis. Rather, he tried to \" make the case that his administration was ahead of the problem, not playing catch-up. \" but sanger then goes on to recount recent criticism by some of obama's \" closest former counterterrorism advisers \" that he is moving \" too incrementally. \" one example, from former top pentagon intelligence official michael vickers: \" in the two months during which the united states drove al-qaeda out of afghanistan in 2001, after the sept. 11 attacks, it conducted as many airstrikes as it has in the past 16 months in iraq and syria. \" but in fred kaplan's view, obama did a decent job of doing a fairly impossible task. Kaplan writes for slate, \" will any of these remarks assuage widespread fears about terrorist attacks in the holiday season and beyond? probably not. What could he or anyone else have said that might have had that effect? i don't know, and neither does anyone else. \" obama may not have offered \" dramatic answers, \" but \" he laid out a road.

Nasa says the low-resolution video will be followed by a high-resolution one, along with color photos and panoramas. Curiosity has already sent back two stunning high-resolution photos, including one of mount sharp, a three-mile-high mountain in the center of the crater which is its chief scientific target. Nasa says the photos show that the rover has a clear path to explore in any direction, and it will begin doing so within days. At the agency's jet propulsion laboratory, fatigue is beginning to set in among the scientists and engineers who were celebrating wildly yesterday, notes npr's joe palca.

On sunday. Brian van der brug / ap the newsroom at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory is beginning to thin out as the mars science laboratory transitions from an exciting news story, to a long duration — possibly very long duration — exploration of the geologic and environmental history of mars. For the reporters still in the newsroom, fatigue is beginning to set in. Bbc science correspondent jonathan amos has been at it nonstop for 30 hours. I feel a bit guilty for stepping out and getting a few hours sleep. Reporter fatigue is matched by the scientist and engineers who stayed up for the landing and that had to go back to work preparing for ground operations. They have the added problem of going on mars time. The martian day is 24 hours and 39 minutes long, so if you're on mars time, you have to stay up an extra 39 minutes a day. That doesn't sound so bad at first, but after a while on the schedule you find you're going to bed when the sun is shining, and you face a case of non – stop jetlag. In the hours before landing the newsroom was packed. I mean packed. While engineers fretted about a safe landing, reporters fretted about deadlines.

Barry says cummins claimed to be from colorado and said he was down to his last $ 10 and on his way to a commune after losing everything in a house fire. Barry says he gave them $ 40 cash and $ 15 in gas — and after they returned, saying the commune didn't work out, he gave cummins work moving rocks and a small cabin to stay in. Barry says he became suspicious after noticing that cummins tried to keep thomas away from other people, and that their vehicle had no license plates. He says he called police wednesday evening after somebody he talked to in a bar looked up the fugitive's photo online. Cummins, who is accused of plotting to kidnap the girl for sexual purposes, was arrested early thursday. Thomas is now \" comfortable and resting \" with family back in tennessee, lawyer jason whatley tells the columbia daily herald.
