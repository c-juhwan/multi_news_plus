            "Controversial olympic swimmer ryan lochte is joining abc's dancing with the stars for season 23, the network confirmed this morning when it unveiled the rogues gallery of celebrity competitors on good morning america. Presidential politics is bleeding over into abc's hoofer competition. Former texas governor and gop presidential candidate rick perry has signed up to tap dance on a different stage. Perry was early donald trump flotsam, dropping out of the race after just 100 days, insisting \"the conservative movement has always been about principles, not personalities \" – which, as it has turned out: not so much. Lochte, this morning told gma he is now \"not sure \" if he would call his headline-grabbing pee break at a gas station in rio a robbery, an extortion, or just paying up for the damage he caused when he ripped a poster off the wall after pissing in the bushes. Fortunately, lochte is not the only representative of the u.s. Olympics team attached to the latest iteration of abc's reality series. Laurie hernandez, the 16-year-old olympic gymnast who had a much better time in rio than did lochte, taking home gold and silver medals, is making a bid for the mirror ball trophy.

Actresses already affiliated with scientology were told they were auditioning for a \" training film, \" and asked questions such as, \" what do you think of tom cruise? \" \"it's not like you only have to please your husband — you have to toe the line for scientology, \" said the former head of scientology's in-house studio, who claims he saw some of the audition tapes. \"you can't do anything to displease scientology, because tom cruise will freak out. \" scientology's first pick was tehran-born actress nazanin boniadi ( probably best known as nora on how i met your mother ). After heavy preparations and auditing in october 2004, boniadi met cruise secretly in new york in november, going skating and spending the night together. But cruise was almost immediately annoyed with boniadi, complaining she didn't gush enough love to him. But her biggest infraction was being rude to miscavige — she repeatedly asked him to repeat himself, a big no-no in communications-obsessed scientology. Scientology officials told boniadi her relationship with cruise was over in january, and she was sent to the group's celebrity center in florida, where after spilling details of the saga, she was punished by scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and digging ditches in the middle of the night. Of course, scientology denies the whole thing. ( note: mark rathbun, famous anti-scientology crusader, says that the vanity fair piece was written without boniadi's involvement, and the actress has made no comments on her twitter page ).",

Jezebel was among sites that called out the difference, noting that kaling, 34, is the lone woman of color in the group who happens to be \" on the record saying she's a size 8, not a size zero. \" the gloss summed up its argument, in part, by saying, \" the fact that kaling is a woman of color and a woman whose size defies the conventions for actresses are two traits that should never be stripped from her when slender, white women are allowed to keep their whiteness and bodies. \" but kaling, the star and creator of fox's \" the mindy project, \" took to twitter on tuesday to defend her look and the magazine",
            "The mindy project on. I wrote two books, is everyone hanging out without me? and why not me?. Instagram: mindykaling los angeles",
            "The gloss ' julia sonenshein, meanwhile, tries to play devil's advocate. \" maybe they all were supposed to be close-ups, but the other women ( who were shot in basically identical styles ) couldn't carry a close up in the way kaling could. For all we know, kaling picked the final picture, or requested that she be cropped out. Maybe, \" she writes. \" but that really doesn't seem all that likely, especially when you consider, as fashionista pointed out,'that kaling, the only woman of color to get her own cover, is also the only cover image rendered in black and white. ' i don't entirely understand the intention behind releasing four covers that act as a set, but painting one subject specifically as the odd-man-out. \" \" for all we know, kaling directed the whole shoot. Does it matter? the message is still the same: we treat a certain type of woman differently than the other celebrities in her cohort. Kaling is different based on an arbitrary set of rules, so we ' ll treat her as such, \" sonenshein continues. \" the huffington post, for their part, practically wet their pants with excitement over the kaling"

Don't buy it, writes joshua keating at slate. The fear is that a proxy war between russia and turkey in syria will turn into a real war, but russia is blaming terrorists, not turkey itself. Read the full post. A new york times q&a agrees that a confrontation is unlikely, in part because turkey has downgraded its ambitions in syria and is no longer pursuing an ouster of bashar al-assad, who is backed by moscow. Read it here. Remember fethullah gulen, the exiled muslim cleric living in the us? expect turkey to blame him for orchestrating the attack, just as it did for a failed coup over the summer. That may increase pressure on the us to extradite him, reports the washington post. The bbc rounds up what is known about the shooter, 22-year-old mevlut mert atlintas. The turkish police officer, who invoked aleppo before being killed himself, was believed to be on leave at the time of shooting. The new york times public editor has a post explaining the newspaper's decision to prominently run graphic images from the killing. Read it here. The foreign ministers of turkey, russia, and iran met tuesday and promised to work toward a settlement in syria. \" notably absent \" from the talks was the us, reports the ap. This is bad news for turkey's tourism industry, which had been hoping that a relative lack of friction in recent months would lead to a return of russian visitors, reports bloomberg.",

But on the day they planned to leave the caribbean island, the british couple were attacked. Roger pratt, 62, was killed defending his wife friday night, the independent reports. Three suspects, so far unnamed, have been arrested, reuters reports. Pratt was on board the yacht when he was killed, and his wife — who was also injured — reportedly found him floating in the water, but details are vague and it's not clear how pratt was killed. Officials are disputing reports that he was shot; a post-mortem scheduled for today should provide cause of death. Tragically, the pratts planned to set off the day before the attack, but were prevented from leaving in part because an immigration officer hadn't come to work at customs that day, according to a post on margaret pratt's blog. Another post on the blog reveals that roger pratt attended a seminar on how to deal with pirates in november. \" the must-have accessories are motion sensors linked to an app of a loud barking dog to deter intruders, \" margaret pratt wrote. \" it makes sense. \" the telegraph calls the incident a robbery.

That said, a florida supplier of horse-meat tests has been swamped by nearly 1,000 orders — including some from big us meat producers. Behind this lies america's little-known taste for horse meat. Nearly 20 slaughterhouses once produced it, and three were still operating when congress, spurred by anti-slaughter activists, effectively outlawed it by nixing funds for usda inspections. But the obama administration quietly let it resume, in part due to poor treatment of horses. \" there are plenty of people in america who have no problem with cheval and are anxiously awaiting our product, \" says a wyoming state rep.

The state's 6th congressional district, which includes atlanta's northern suburbs, has been considered a \" safe \" gop seat for decades, and an ossoff win could deliver a major shakeup to the political landscape, cnn reports. A roundup of developments: president trump weighed in on the race monday morning, tweeting: \" the super liberal democrat in the georgia congressioal [ sic ] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes! \" with 11 republicans among the 18 candidates, ossoff's best chance of winning will be to get 50 % tuesday, avoiding a runoff election that will put gop support solidly behind one candidate, analysts say. Fivethirtyeight looks at his chances against leading republican candidates karen handel, bob gray, dan moody, and judson hill. Four other democrats and two independents are also on the ballot. The ap reports that money from outside the state has poured into the race, including most of the $ 8.3 million in ossoff's war chest. The gop has been running ads trying to link ossoff to nancy pelosi. The atlanta journal-constitution looks at trends to watch for in the election, including ossoff's success with two groups of voters he has targeted: millennials and college-educated women. The hill reports that four voting machines have been reported stolen from a precinct manager's vehicle in cobb county, though officials say there's no danger of the election being compromised.

Earlier this year, underwood sued the foundation, alleging that the trump family used it illegally for their own political and economic benefit rather than as a charity. On tuesday, she said the ongoing investigation found \" a shocking pattern of illegality involving the trump foundation — including unlawful coordination with the trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more. \" the details: troubles not over: just because the foundation is going away doesn't mean the lawsuit is. \" we ' ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the trump foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law, \" said underwood, per nbc news. In defense: foundation lawyer alan futerfas says underwood is presenting a misleading account of the agreement to dissolve in a \" further attempt to politicize this matter, \" reports the ap. He said the foundation had been seeking to dissolve voluntarily since trump became president, but underwood wouldn't allow it.

        "summary": "A group of lab rats at north carolina's duke university has acquired an enviable ability: a \" sixth sense. \" scientists say they found a way to enable the rats to detect infrared light that would otherwise go unseen. The verge explains the mechanics of the feat, which involved outfitting each rat with an infrared detector that was connected to electrodes implanted in the part of the creature's brain that controls touch. The animals were primed for the experiment by being trained to identify a visible led light by sticking their nose in a corresponding port; when they did so, they were given water. Researchers then flipped on one of three invisible ultraviolet lights; the infrared detector on the rats ' foreheads identified the light and triggered the electrodes. The rats initially rubbed their whiskers when this happened, signalling that they were \" feeling \" the light. But within a month, they began to link the signal to the infrared light and were able to sweep their heads toward the left and right to find it ( the financial times describes it as \" foraging \" for the signal ). The rats could ultimately indicate which of the three was turned on ( again, by sticking their nose into a port ) with complete accuracy. A key side note: their sense of touch wasn't adversely affected. The hope: that we ' ll one day be able to \" hijack \" a person's functioning sense to restore a non-functioning one; gizmodo gives the example of enabling sight elsewhere in the brain of a person who is blind due to problems with his visual cortex.",

Initial training of the rats involved rewarding them with water when they successfully poked their nose into a port attached to a visible led light.

Among those they found was ex-gestapo officer klaus barbie — aka \" the butcher of lyon \" — in 1971 in bolivia, and now france is showering honors upon them for their efforts. The bbc and ap report that a ceremony was held monday evening at the elysee palace in which president emmanuel macron presented serge, 83, with the grand cross of the legion of honor, the nation's most esteemed award, while beate, 79, received the country's national order of merit. Serge had received a lower-tier version of the legion of honor in 2014. His backstory is a compelling one, starting with his family's escape from the nazis in romania to their trials in france, where he managed to escape the gestapo in nice. His father, however, wasn't so lucky and died at auschwitz. Beate, meanwhile, was the daughter of a german soldier who once slapped german chancellor kurt georg kiesinger in the face at a 1968 political rally, per insider. Together, the determined couple not only followed the trail to barbie — who was responsible for the torture or deaths of tens of thousands of people during the war, and who died in prison in france in 1991 thanks to their detective work — but also to at least 10 other war criminals. Their son, arno, named for serge's father, is a lawyer who now helps them prosecute the criminals they find, per the guardian. \" neither could have succeeded without the other, \" their daughter, lida, once noted, per afp.",

The governor's facial expressions ( which vox called \" easily the best part \" of trump's presser ) and general demeanor as he stood to the side of the podium relayed what mashable says appeared to be a \" state of deep emotional pain. \" twitter didn't renege on an opportunity to poke fun of a doleful christie, drawing comparisons to sad eli manning, a loyal dog, and darth vader \" right before he decides to kill the emperor. \" even when christie simply stared straight ahead he couldn't escape scrutiny: one commenter asserted, \" there is a picture of a meatball sub on the back of trump's head. \" to sum up tuesday night's christie trending, a final tweet: \" tonight was chris christie's meme-ification. \" ( raw story also features a collection of the best christie-as-hangdog tweets. )",

        "summary": "President obama's health care reform scored a legal win today: a federal appeals court in cincinnati ruled that requiring people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty does not violate the constitution, reports cnn. \" we find that the minimum coverage provision is a valid exercise of legislative power by congress under the commerce clause, \" said the three-judge panel. But backers should hold the celebration: two more appeals court rulings are expected in weeks or months, and the case is all but certain to reach the supreme court, notes the wall street journal. Today's ruling, though, is unique in two ways, notes the new york times. It's the first appellate decision for one thing, and it's the first time a decision \" has not broken down strictly along seemingly partisan lines. \" meaning, an appointee of george w. Bush joined an appointee of jimmy carter in the 2-1 decision. The dissenting judge is a reagan pick. In the lower courts, democratic appointees have backed obamacare and republican appointees have ruled against it.",

        "summary": "More than half of the amazon's 15,000 tree species may be facing extinction if governments can't curb deforestation, a new study says. Researchers reached this conclusion by comparing ground-level data on trees — about their leaves, branches, diameters, and so on — to projected deforestation across the vast south american region, the new york times reports. The result: between 36 % and 57 % of amazonian tree species should be considered endangered by the widely accepted \" red list \" standard. These trees include vital food crops as well as hundreds of species that locals need for seeds, fruits, medicines, and oils, an ecologist tells reuters. \" we've never had a good idea of how many amazonian species were vulnerable, \" says another expert. \" and now, with this study, we've got an estimate. \" the study also found that 40 % of the amazon's forests will vanish by 2050 if deforestation continues in \" business-as-usual \" fashion, while 21 % will disappear if governments put stronger regulations into place. The authors stressed that the news isn't all bleak, noting that 52 % of the amazon basin falls within protected areas, the washington post reports. They also cite a significant decline in deforestation in the brazilian amazon, which makes up 60 % of the amazon region. \" a message we would like to convey is the message that there is hope, \" lead author hans ter steege tells the christian science monitor. \" if we can protect these areas … the amazon could be a showcase of large-scale conservation worldwide. \" ( the world is apparently \" shrugging \" during the biggest eco-disaster of our times. )",

        "summary": "December brought the news that johns hopkins university planned to attempt the first penis transplants in the us; now, the first candidate has been selected. An american soldier wounded in an explosion in afghanistan will be the first person in the us, and the third in the world, to undergo a penis transplant. The first was in china in 2006, though the patient was so disturbed by the donated organ that he asked for it to be removed, while the second, in south africa in 2014, was so successful the man fathered a child. Reuters reports the unnamed american patient sustained significant groin injuries and lost the majority of his penis in the explosion. The transplant could happen within a few weeks, pending the availability of a donor organ that fits the necessary age ( within five to 10 years of the recipient ) and skin color parameters. The washington post looks at the donation part of the equation, noting that the johns hopkins team has voiced worries that some individuals may shy away from becoming an organ donor over the thought of losing his penis after death. A johns hopkins q&a on the transplant clarifies that \" many people might think that organ donation means unquestioned consent for donation of all organs. That's not the case with the face, hand, or penis \"; the consent of the deceased's family is required in those cases. Johns hopkins is currently looking only at us servicemen as potential transplant candidates, with more than 60 identified as possibilities, per the post. The transplant team notes potential patients must be physically and mentally up for the procedure; psychiatric evaluations for the patients can be up to a year long.",

A police spokesman tells the new york daily news that the two suspects, who are now in custody, ran down 13-month-old dillan harris in his stroller in front of his mother and two sisters. Witnesses say the people in the car kept going across a parking lot after their car jumped the sidewalk and killed the boy. Capo, whose real name was marvin carr, was an associate of la-based rapper chief keef, who plans to appear via hologram at a concert on friday to raise money for dillan's family, the chicago tribune reports. A spokesman says chief keef is \" heartbroken and appalled \" by the death, but he can't appear in person because of \" outstanding warrants his legal team is addressing. \" capo's manager tells the chicago sun-times the rapper had just returned from recording in la. \" he was a good kid. The streets of chicago is something, \" he says. \" he was murdered.

The woman identified as jane doe, represented by the cyber civil rights legal project, accused ex-boyfriend david elam ii of sharing intimate photos she gave him while the pair were in a long-distance relationship. Because the photos were taken with doe's consent, she had to copyright the photos showing her topless and \" simulating sexual acts, \" which meant sending them to the federal government, to get some websites to take them down. Through a civil case accusing elam of copyright infringement, online impersonation, stalking, and intentional emotional distress, she has now been awarded $ 6.45 million, reports cnn. The compensation — including $ 450,000 for copyright infringement, $ 3 million in compensatory damages, and $ 3 million in punitive damages — marks the end of a fight that began five years ago. Elam was first investigated in 2013. A criminal case alleging stalking and identity theft was then launched, but dropped in 2016 by federal prosecutors who decided the burden of proof couldn't be met, the new york times previously reported.

Cnbc reports fox business reporter liz claman asked musk about the share price and got a single-word response: \" 420. \" there were initial questions about whether the tweet was legitimate or \" serious, \" as reuters puts it ( a follow-up tweet from musk's account simply read, \" good morning \" followed by a smiley face emoji; others pointed out the 420-marijuana connection, per cnbc ). However, musk has followed up with a blog post making clear the idea is indeed under serious consideration. \" first, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for tesla to operate best, \" he writes. \" as a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at tesla, all of whom are shareholders. \" if it happens, it would be the biggest take-private deal ever, given that it would value tesla above $ 70 billion, notes the wall street journal.

The 500-page manuscript, titled in blind allegiance to sarah palin: a memoir of our tumultuous years, was leaked friday. The anchorage daily news got its copy from author joe mcginniss ( who is writing his own book about palin and famously irked her by moving in next door ) and it offers a look inside: bailey alleges that palin coordinated with the republican governors association during her gubernatorial campaign, a violation of election law. The rga paid for tv commercials and mailers, calling it an \"independent \" effort, but bailey says palin worked with the group on at least one ad ( an allegation that was made at the time by the alaska democratic party ). State candidates are not allowed to team up with soft-money groups like the rga. Palin was obsessed with minor slights and often sought revenge: \"we set our sights and went after opponents in coordinated attacks, utilizing what we called 'fox news surrogates, ' friendly blogs, ghost-written op-eds, media opinion polls ( that we often rigged ), letters to editors, and carefully edited speeches. \" bailey is best-known for his involvement in the \"troopergate \" scandal; he was the one who made a phone call to a trooper lieutenant complaining about palin's one-time brother-in-law mike wooten and asking why he was still employed as a trooper. In the book, bailey claims todd palin had been feeding him the information on wooten that he passed along to troopers. Bailey also alleges that palin's animosity toward wooten influenced her choice of morgan christen for the state supreme court, because christen had ruled in palin's sister's favor during a custody dispute. Less than three years into her term as alaska's governor, shortly before her resignation, palin allegedly sent bailey a message saying, \"i hate this damn job. \" click for more on the manuscript and its author.",

According to an nbc5 report, the girl, whose name has not been released, did not attend school and was beaten with a belt or electrical cord if she did not perform her duties. Authorities believe that the couple, mohamed toure and denise florence cros-toure, both 57, arranged for the girl to come to the us from her home in guinea when she was roughly 5 years old. They have been charged with forced labor, per the dallas news, and face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The girl escaped from the home two years ago with the help of neighbors, including one she baby-sat for, reports the washington post. According to court papers, the neighbors encouraged the girl to document her situation by gathering evidence. Two months later the neighbors helped her escape while the family was out of the house. In an odd twist, the post reports that mohamed toure is the son of ahmed sekou toure, guinea's first president, who held office from 1958 until his death in 1984. Cros-toure's attorney, who denied most of the allegations, confirmed that the girl did not attend school but said she was kept out of school because she had overstayed her visa and the couple feared that she would be deported.",

The most incredible thing i've seen. \" posted by buckingham on facebook, the video has generated 3,600 comments and nearly 95,000 shares as of this writing. \" there has been concern that fracking and extraction of coal seam gas could cause gas to migrate through the rock, \" writes buckingham in the post. \" not only is it polluting the river and air, but methane is an extremely potent heat trapping gas. \" but one company running coal seam gas wells in the area calls the methane \" naturally occurring \" and government scientists who investigated the seeps seem to agree, the guardian reports. \" the presence of the industry there has not caused that crack to occur or that fault to occur, it's been there for aeons, \" says an australian official who points to rock fissures and shifting sediment as likely causes. But the methane seeps were first reported in 2012, buckingham notes, just a year after more fracking was developed in the area. \" it would be the most remarkable coincidence that the very thing that we warned would happen has happened in the middle of a gas field and it's totally unrelated, \" he says.",

Ithaca residents judith jones, 80, and carolyn kenyon, 70, raised $ 12,500 over the summer and gave it to the rip medical debt charity, which used it to forgive an amazing $ 1.5 million in medical debt, reports the new york times. The charity — started in 2014 by former debt collection execs craig antico and jerry ashton — was able to buy up the overdue debt for less than a penny on the dollar, which is something more typically done by debt collectors who then hound the debtors for the money. The people whose debt was bought up will receive a slim yellow envelope with a letter telling them their debt has been forgiven. Jones and kenyon are campaigners for universal health coverage and while fundraising for the debt forgiveness fund, they explained how medical debt can wreck lives and stressed that it was part of a bigger problem caused by health care costs, jezebel reports. Antico says he and ashton founded the charity after realizing the impact medical debt had on so many lives. \" i like doing this much more than i liked doing collecting, \" he tells the times. \" the random act of kindness is kind of a cool thing. \" as for how they're doing, they say they've been able to erase $ 434 million in past-due medical debt so far...

Medical debt. R.i.p. Medical debt buys up people's old medical bills and forgives them. With jones and kenyon's donation, the organization bought up $ 1.5 million in medical debts, belonging to thousands of people in need across new york. The non-profit focuses on alleviating the debts of those who really cannot afford to pay their bills, like those who earn less than two times the federal poverty level.

            "Image: getty judith jones and carolyn kenyon are two new yorkers who are passionate about the new york health act, a bill that would bring universal health care to the state. Jones and kenyon are 80 and 70 years old, respectively, but according to the new york times, they didn't want to just wait around for that to happen — so they rallied their friends and neighbors and raised $ 12,500 for the non-profit r.i.p. Medical debt. R.i.p. Medical debt buys up people's old medical bills and forgives them. With jones and kenyon's donation, the organization bought up $ 1.5 million in medical debts, belonging to thousands of people in need across new york. The non-profit focuses on alleviating the debts of those who really cannot afford to pay their bills, like those who earn less than two times the federal poverty level.

So the transformation pics she's been posting to her positive-body instagram page @bodyposipanda are a bit unusual, in that she looks thin and athletic before, and has tummy rolls now. She tells us weekly that these are \" reverse before-and-afters. \" that's because the thin woman in 2014 was miserable, reports today, while the heavier 24-year-old uk caregiver is beaming today. \" as it turns out, happiness isn't a size, \" she writes. \" i wasted far too many years believing that it was. \" so far she's responded to several negative comments in stride. For example, one of the more than 7,000 comments reads: \" wait so you just decided to ruin your body? \" crabbe replies: \" nah, i just stopped torturing myself every day for not fitting an image i was never supposed to be. \" she emphasizes that she's not scolding thin people to gain weight.

And that's not all, veronique greenwood writes in discover: many sites you visit are amassing information about you and selling it to advertisers. Inspired by an article in the atlantic this week, greenwood downloaded a mozilla plug-in called collusion that allowed her to track everyone who was tracking her. \" the feeling of navel-gazing fascination... Morphed into a pretty deep frustration, \" she writes. After an hour of browsing, greenwood had visited 50 sites and had 50 verified trackers on her trail. Some made sense to her — like google and facebook — but others she'd never heard of, like advertising.com. Also, media sites were tracking her journey to other web pages, and five sites were soon monitoring her behavior in a chatroom. What's worse, she says, you can't really \" opt out \" of this tracking without proper plug-ins, which few know how to use. \" one of the great benefits of the internet, for many people, has been its promise of anonymity, \" writes greenwood. \" to keep everything free, though, users...

Today, however, the salvadoran — sporting a short, new haircut and a shave — appeared a lot worse for the wear and needed help entering his hotel in the marshall islands. \" he was much weaker, extremely tired looking, much less animated, and was speaking extremely slowly. He looked exhausted, frankly, \" a witness tells the ap. \" i would say he made an impression that is really now far more consistent with the journey he said he made. \" though the daily mail notes alvarenga is to fly to el salvador today, the ap reports officials say it could be a while longer as more hospital checks are needed. And though doubts still linger about such a long stint in the pacific ocean — especially given alvarenga's initial healthy appearance — a separate ap story has this quote from a survival specialist: \" the appearances of malnutrition can manifest differently depending on how short you are on calories or protein... It's only in end stage starvation that people get that really emaciated appearance. \" he added that if alvarenga had been overweight when he set off, \" it would be a significant advantage. \" meanwhile, the family of alvarenga's fishing mate, ezequiel cordoba — who alvarenga says died after four months at sea — is hoping to \" find out was it really our brother who he is talking about... We need confirmation from ( alvarenga ) before we can accept his death. \"",

The skagit valley herald reports the unnamed man accidentally shot himself in the face sunday while taking a photo. The girlfriend of the 43-year-old from concrete says they had been snapping photos with the gun throughout the day; her beau reportedly removed the bullets before posing, then returned them to the gun between photos, per the skagit county sheriff's office chief of patrol. The man apparently thought the gun was unloaded during his last picture, but there was one bullet in the chamber, causing what police are so far calling his accidental death. And he's far from alone in meeting this kind of demise: citing a priceonomics study published at the end of january, cbs news reports there have been 49 selfie-related deaths since 2014 — four of them attributed to guns.

The skagit valley herald reports the man and his girlfriend were photographing themselves with the weapon on sunday at a residence when he shot himself. Skagit county sheriff's office patrol chief chad clark says the woman reported that she and the man had taken photos with the gun several times that day and that the man had loaded and unloaded bullets multiple times. Clark says a bullet apparently remained in the gun the final time he fired. The death is being investigated as accidental. The man's name has not been released. According to san francisco-based data service provider priceonomics, there have been 49 recorded selfie-linked deaths since 2014, not including this incident. Four of those 49 deaths were caused by guns.",

In the course of any given week, \"selfie \" is mentioned in 365,000 facebook posts and 150,000 tweets. A comb of instagram hashtags turns up more than 50 million results for the word.

            "Concrete, wash. -- a 43-year-old man has died after authorities say he accidentally shot himself in the face while taking selfies. The skagit valley herald reports the man and his girlfriend were photographing themselves with the weapon on sunday at a residence when he shot himself. Skagit county sheriff's office patrol chief chad clark says the woman reported that she and the man had taken photos with the gun several times that day and that the man had loaded and unloaded bullets multiple times. Clark says a bullet apparently remained in the gun the final time he fired. The death is being investigated as accidental. The man's name has not been released. According to san francisco-based data service provider priceonomics, there have been 49 recorded selfie-linked deaths since 2014, not including this incident. Four of those 49 deaths were caused by guns.",

One was that she was found in a blanket, another that she had a canadian father, and yet another that she was given to them by strangers. \" her features suggest that she might be from an eastern or northern ( european ) country, \" says a local police chief, per the ap.

            "A free syrian army commander reacts after they failed to capture a syrian amry tank during clashes with forces loyal to syria's president bashar al-assad in aleppo's neighbourhood of salaheddine, april 29, 2013. Moscow ( reuters ) - russia and the united states agreed on tuesday to try to bring together syria's warring parties at an international conference, possibly by the end of this month, in an attempt to negotiate an end to their civil war. Foreign minister sergei lavrov and secretary of state john kerry announced the agreement in moscow, despite their nations'differences over syria, saying they would work to ensure both the damascus government and the rebels fighting it would attend. The aim is to revive an agreement to create a transitional government that was reached in geneva last june but was never put into force because it left open the question of what would happen to syrian president bashar al-assad. \" the alternative ( to a negotiated solution ) is that there is even more violence. The alternative is that syria heads closer to an abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos, \" kerry told a joint news conference with lavrov. \" the alternative is that the humanitarian crisis will grow. The alternative is that there may be even a break up of syria, \" said kerry, who earlier held talks"

The investigation was revealed in a restraining order granted against keya morgan, who in recent months has been acting as lee's business manager and personal adviser, the ap reports. Morgan has inserted himself into the life of lee, 95, according to the restraining order. The filing accuses morgan, 42, of taking advantage of lee's impaired hearing, vision, and judgment, moving lee from his longtime family home and preventing family and associates from contacting him. Morgan was arrested on monday for allegedly filing a false police report by calling 911 saying burglars were in his house when in fact two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on lee. Morgan's arrest and ouster is the latest and thus far most dramatic move in a struggle that has emerged over lee's business and fortune since his wife of 69 years, joan, died in july. Police have been investigating reports of elder abuse against lee since at least february, and had issued an emergency order keeping morgan from lee before wednesday's order was issued. Lee has for decades been revered as a comic book giant for his central role in creating the incredible hulk, spider-man, iron man, and other major marvel characters. Morgan is a memorabilia dealer and marilyn monroe expert who befriended lee's daughter and only child jc lee. Lee appeared in a video posted to his twitter account sunday declaring that morgan was his only partner and representative, and anyone claiming otherwise was lying.",

( see factcheck.org for a thorough rehashing. ) warren's speech has generally been well received by native american groups, per politico, though cherokee writer rebecca nagle has a more nuanced assessment: \" i believe warren that she grew up with stories of distant cherokee relatives, \" she writes in the boston globe. \" i just don't see how those stories could be true. \" moreover, she doesn't understand how warren doesn't come to the same conclusion given the \" mountain of evidence. \" however, nagle makes clear she'd like trump and other non-natives to butt out. \" native people are the authority on who is and who is not native.

        "summary": "Motherboard has an eye-opening profile on maria staver, the woman \" who beat sleep \" as a college student. A lifelong insomniac, staver gave up attempting to sleep like a regular person in 1998. She and a friend — inspired by a 1943 time interview with inventor buckminster fuller — developed the \" uberman \" sleep schedule, so named because \" they were accomplishing so much in a day that they were freaking people out; their schoolwork was done, their dorms were clean, they held down jobs, they made appearances at social events. \" they would wake up at 4am to study at denny's then take 20-minute naps every four hours, getting a total of two hours of sleep every day. \" i felt the best i've ever felt in my life, \" staver tells motherboard. Not that it was easy. The first two weeks of uberman are an \" absolute unholy monstrous biyotch, \" motherboard quotes a 2006 blog post by staver. That adjustment period can cause moodiness, chills, constant hunger, and worse. Regardless, staver unwittingly kicked off a \" polyphasic sleep \" movement, with followers pestering her for information and advice. She eventually created a blog and wrote a book for people interested in uberman. Nowadays, without the luxury of a college student's schedule, staver practices the everyman: three hours of sleep at night and three 20-minute naps. Sleep experts don't recommend either schedule, as they both fall far short of eight hours of sleep. But staver doesn't mind. \" my goal is just to be able to sleep in a way that works for me, \" she tells motherboard. Read the full story here. ( this is america's most sleep-deprived group. )",

            "A new discovery has been made at armant temple, 25 kilometres south of luxor. A mission from the french institute for oriental studies ( ifao ) unearthed a limestone head of the 18th dynasty king amenhotep iii, grandfather of king tutankhamen. Antiquities minister mamdouh el-damaty told ahram online that the head was accidentally found during restoration and consolidation works carried out at the temple's foundations. Aly el-asfar, head of the central administration of upper egypt, told ahram online that the head is carved in sandstone and in very bad condition. The face is totally damaged but a part of the crown still exists. The head is now under restoration at the gallery of the ifao in luxor. He continued that last year the mission unearthed five heads of royal priests within the temple. The heads are carved in limestone and each one has the crown of upper and lower egypt on top. Each head is 50 centimetres high and could date back to the middle kingdom. Armant temple was dedicated to worshipping the falcon-headed god of war montu. It was originally built during the old kingdom but it was reused during the ptolemaic period, although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the romans. Because of montu's strong association with raging bulls, the temple was a major centre for the worship for bulls, containing many statues and reliefs of the animal.

            "A new discovery has been made at armant temple, 25 kilometres south of luxor. A mission from the french institute for oriental studies ( ifao ) unearthed a limestone head of the 18th dynasty king amenhotep iii, grandfather of king tutankhamen. Antiquities minister mamdouh el-damaty told ahram online that the head was accidentally found during restoration and consolidation works carried out at the temple's foundations. Aly el-asfar, head of the central administration of upper egypt, told ahram online that the head is carved in sandstone and in very bad condition. The face is totally damaged but a part of the crown still exists. The head is now under restoration at the gallery of the ifao in luxor. He continued that last year the mission unearthed five heads of royal priests within the temple. The heads are carved in limestone and each one has the crown of upper and lower egypt on top. Each head is 50 centimetres high and could date back to the middle kingdom. Armant temple was dedicated to worshipping the falcon-headed god of war montu. It was originally built during the old kingdom but it was reused during the ptolemaic period, although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the romans. Because of montu's strong association with raging bulls, the temple was a major centre for the worship for bulls, containing many statues and reliefs of the animal. Most of these statues are now located in museums around the world. Short link:",
