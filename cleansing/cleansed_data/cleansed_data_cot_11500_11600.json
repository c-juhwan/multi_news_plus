Cbc news reports that francesca matus, 52, was last seen with boyfriend drew devoursney, 36, leaving a bar in corozal tuesday. Matus ' white isuzu rodeo was located by police sunday 15 miles away with no trace of the couple. Local authorities plan to search the area today with police dogs. The family of devoursney, a veteran, tells wsb-tv atlanta he met matus on his extended belize holiday two to three months ago, and that the former marine has always checked in frequently, even while he was away on active duty. \"that's the hardest part, is just that we don't know anything, \" devoursney's mother says. \"we don't know where he is, what's going on. \" matus was scheduled to leave the country on wednesday, but when her friend arrived to drive her to the airport, she was not home and devoursney's motorcycle was still parked in in the driveway. Devoursney was scheduled to leave the country may 4. Both their passports were found, and none of their personal items appeared to be missing. Devoursney's brother has expressed frustration at trying to coordinate from afar and plans to leave for belize this week. Friends of devoursney set up a gofundme page to help fund their search, which has received $ 4,300 at the time this article was posted.",

        "summary": "At least one police officer opened fire on rioters monday in a swedish neighborhood with a large immigrant population, cnn reports. According to the ap, the unrest started while officers were attempting to arrest a resident suspected in a drug crime. Bystanders threw rocks, one of which hit an officer in the arm. A number of officers fired warning shots, but one fired directly at rioters. Police tell the local no one was found injured at the scene, and there were no gunshot wounds being treated at area hospitals. Rioting in the rinkeby suburb of stockholm lasted for a few hours. At least 10 cars were set on fire, and a news photographer was reportedly attacked. The rioting took place two days after president trump seemed to allude to a nonexistent incident in sweden while apparently referring to a fox news piece on immigrants and crime rates in the country. Swedes reacted with confusion to trump's statements, and many deny monday's rioting has anything to do with the recent influx of refugees. Sweden has accepted more refugees per capita than any other european country in the past few years, but officials say crime rates are not rising and are comparable to or better than those in the us. Most of the unrest in sweden takes place in areas settled by immigrants decades ago and has more to do with unemployment and gangs. Police say monday's rioting was likely the result of \" increased pressure on criminals in the area. \"",

        "summary": "The suspect in the deadly van attack in toronto posted a chilling facebook message just minutes before plowing into a crowded city sidewalk, authorities said tuesday, raising the possibility that he may have nursed grudges against women — a possible echo of a 1989 massacre of 14 women that remains one of canada's most traumatic acts of violence. The 25-year-old suspect, alek minassian, was charged tuesday with first degree murder in the deaths of 10 pedestrians he mowed down in the rented van he sent careening along the busy walkway. Fourteen others were injured. Toronto police services det. Sgt. Graham gibson told a news conference that those killed and injured were \" predominantly \" women, though he declined to discuss a possible motive, the ap reports. Authorities have not yet released a list of victims. Those known to have been killed include a 30-year-old woman from toronto, anne marie d ' amico, who was active in volunteer work, as well as a female student at seneca college, which minassian also attended. A jordanian citizen and two south koreans were also among those killed. ( the cbc has much more on d ' amico as well as another victim identified by her family. ) the gender issue arose because of what police called a \" cryptic \" facebook message posted by minassian just before the incident that suggested he was part of an online community angry over their inability to form relationships with women. The now-deleted post saluted elliot rodger, a community college student who killed six people and wounded 13 in shooting and stabbing attacks near the university of california, santa barbara, in 2014. Calling rodger \" the supreme gentleman, \" the facebook post declared: \" the incel rebellion has already begun! we will overthrow all the chads and stacys! \" rodger had used the term \" incel \" — for involuntarily celibate — in online posts raging at women for rejecting him romantically. Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use \" chad \" and \" stacy \" as dismissive slang for men and women with more robust sex lives. The anti-women sentiment recalled the 1989 massacre at the ecole polytechnique, an engineering college in montreal, when 25-year-old marc lepine entered a classroom, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself. In a suicide note, he blamed feminists for ruining his life. Since then, there have been sporadic mass shootings in canada, but none with a higher death toll.",

Alek minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. Ontario's chief coroner said tuesday that identifying the victims \" is our no. 1 priority. \" dr. Dirk huyer said there were three coroners at the scene monday, and there are currently forensic pathologists, forensic anthropologists, coroners, dentists and scientists all working together to identify the victims. Families are starting to confirm the names of the dead, but the coroner said it could be days before the names of the dead are confirmed by officials. Ontario's chief coroner identifying the victims is the \" number one \" priority 2: 42 huyer said it's imperative \" to ensure that we're completely accurate when we do this — so we're always balancing the need to know and the desire to know quickly, to ensure that we have 100 per cent accuracy — and that takes time. \" he said he knows the wait can be frustrating but that tragedies of this scale are challenging and require diligence and caution. \" it's far different, for example, than somebody found in their house deceased. \" the victims",

When that payoff didn't happen, claud was offered a three-year extension. In a previous interview with the atlanta journal-constitution, mciver said the loan had gone toward building a $ 1.3 million barn on the couple's property, complete with stables, a saloon, and guest accommodations. The shooting took place on sept. 25, when claud says diane was sitting in the front passenger seat of an suv her best friend was driving, with him in the seat directly behind diane. He claims he nodded off in the back, and when he jolted awake, a gun he was holding accidentally discharged. A family friend told the ajc a few days after the shooting that the mcivers were fearful of a carjacking due to recent black lives matter protests nearby, but claud's attorney nixed that allegation about a week later, telling the paper the couple was nervous because of homeless people wandering in the area. Also of note, per court records seen by people: claud mciver was indicted in 1990 for aggravated assault, possession of a firearm in connection with a crime, and criminal damage to property charges after three teens say he shot several times at their car.

This goes back well beyond the advent of the couch potato: the bones of modern humans aren't as tough as those of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and researchers are linking it to farming. \" modern human skeletons have shifted quite recently towards lighter — more fragile, if you like — bodies. It started when we adopted agriculture. Our diets changed. Our levels of activity changed, \" an expert tells the smithsonian. His team, which looked at ct scans of primate bones, finds that the lighter bones developed about 12,000 years ago. A separate study investigated the hip joints of several populations, including agriculturalists, foragers, and nonhuman primates, eurekalert reports. The agriculturalists, these researchers found, showed lower bone mass than foragers, while the particularly active foragers ' bones were comparable to those of nonhuman primates. \" the key appears to be higher physical activity and mobility from a very young age that makes the bones of nonhuman primates and human foragers stronger, \" a researcher notes, though he adds that diet may also be a factor.

        "summary": "Facebook shares plummeted 20 % after market close wednesday, and one person in particular felt it more than others. Bloomberg reports mark zuckerberg lost about $ 16.8 billion as a result of the dip, which would not only negate the nearly $ 14 billion he'd already gained this year — it would also knock his nest egg down to just below $ 70 billion, per sec filings cited by fortune. Should the drop hold through the close thursday, it would lower his spot on the bloomberg billionaires index from third place to sixth. Facebook's stock price fall — which the financial times, via newsweek, says is one of the biggest after-market drops ever — came after a statement from facebook noting average daily visitor numbers and second-quarter revenue didn't meet analyst expectations. The tech giant has been contending lately with accusations of abusing user privacy, as well as with new eu data mandates. Meanwhile, parents of 6-year-old sandy hook victim noah pozner slammed zuckerberg wednesday in an open letter in the guardian for not kicking \" conspiracy groups and anti-government provocateurs \" off the site. And even more bad news looms on the horizon: business insider reports that facebook shareholder trillium asset management has worked up a game plan to have zuckerberg ousted as chairman due to facebook's \" mishandling \" of its various crises. In his place, trillium wants an independent chair, though business insider notes that, because of zuckerberg's voting power ( he retains more than half of the total influence ), \" the chances of trillium's proposal becoming reality [ are ] extremely slim. \" ( for more on facebook, read about this deep dive into its \" wild \" early days. )",

Yasin aktay, a ruling party adviser to erdogan, said friday that \" there can be no other formula \" to explain why the saudi journalist's remains have not been found a month after he was killed. Aktay, who was a friend of khashoggi's, says he believes that the body was cut into pieces so that it could be dissolved in chemicals. \" the reason they dismembered khashoggi's body was to dissolve his remains more easily, \" says aktay, per the bbc. \" now we see that they did not only dismember his body but also vaporised it. \" he adds that \" all the findings point to his body parts being melted, \" but did not offer any proof for his comments. Meanwhile, turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said friday that the order to kill khashoggi came from top saudi officials and argues that the culprits still need to be found. In a washington post op-ed, erdogan says he doesn't believe saudi king salman had ordered the oct. 2 killing of khashoggi — yet turkey's close ties to saudi arabia did not mean that turkey could turn a blind eye to the killing of the journalist. \" we know that the order to kill khashoggi came from the highest levels of the saudi government, \" erdogan says, adding: \" as responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppet masters behind khashoggi's killing and discover those in whom saudi officials — still trying to cover up the murder — have placed their trust. \" ( the saudi crown prince apparently bad-mouthed khashoggi in white house phone call. )",

But what researchers learned from the \" friendship bench \" study could change the lives of millions in sub-saharan africa who suffer from common mental disorders where services are scarce. In zimbabwe, where the study took place, trained lay medical workers known as \" grandmothers \" listened and offered support to low-income sufferers during weekly talks on the wooden benches that dot the grounds of clinics around harare and other major cities, reports medical daily. Writing in jama, researchers say participants showed significant improvement after six \" problem-solving therapy \" sessions. They were three times less likely to show depression symptoms, and four to five times less likely to experience anxiety and suicidal thoughts. \" in many parts of africa, if you are poor and mentally ill, your chances of getting adequate treatment are close to zero, \" dr. Karlee silver of grand challenges canada says in a news release. Participants — 86 % of whom were women — were among the most vulnerable, with 70 % having a history of domestic violence or illness, and more than 40 % were hiv positive. Although an estimated 25 % of zimbabweans suffer from depression, the country has only about 25 psychiatrists and psychologists to treat them. The friendship bench program treated 27,500 people in more than 72 clinics around the country. Now the team is looking to expand in sub-saharan africa where researchers say common mental disorders \" impose a huge burden on all countries. \" ( a discovery about memory also holds promise for the mentally ill. )",

The marines who were videotaped urinating on the corpses of dead taliban fighters will receive similar punishments, probably including reprimands, reductions in rank, and cuts in pay, officials say. The koran-burning sparked several attacks on us troops and rioting that killed at least 30 people across afghanistan.

        "summary": "When you've had the bestselling vehicle in the us for 32 years, why change the formula? to make it even better, ford argues. That's why the company's 2015 f-150, which will appear at dealerships next month, will have a body made almost entirely out of aluminum rather than steel. Customers ' biggest concern about pickup trucks is their gas mileage, executive chairman bill ford tells the new york times. With the aluminum version some 700 pounds lighter than previous models, the f-150 will see its mileage improve by 5 % to 15 %, ford says. Aluminum is as strong as steel, the ap reports, though it's a little pricier. The base model will now cost an additional $ 395, making it $ 26,615. And right now, gas prices are around their lowest in four years. But \" even with gas at $ 3 a gallon, fuel economy is still very important to people, \" says bill ford. The 2014 f-150 gets about 19 miles per gallon, the times notes; the official figures for the 2015 model haven't yet been revealed. In other improvements, the new model can tow 1,100 pounds more than its predecessors, while it hauls up to 530 pounds more, the detroit news reports. The first one came off the assembly line yesterday. \" is this a risk? yes, \" says bill ford. \" but it's a risk worth taking. \"",

The covered visited the er 1.43 times over the study's period, compared to 1.02 times for those who entered the lottery but didn't get coverage; that's a 40 % bump. They even visited more often for conditions that could have been treated by their primary care physician. The obama administration tells the new york times that the study's 18-month time frame was too short, citing a years-long massachusetts study that registered an 8 % decrease in er visits.

        "summary": "For seven long years, the us has been struggling to break out of a sluggish economy after the great recession, bloomberg notes. Some \" remarkable progress \" on that front came tuesday, per the white house blog: a us census bureau report says median household income ( adjusted for inflation ) for 2015 came in at $ 56,516, a rise of 5.2 %. The highest income level before 2015's was $ 57,423 in 2007 — and the 2015 boost was the fastest increase ever recorded by the feds, the washington post reports. Income grew the most for the lowest-paid workers, which the president of the economic policy institute think tank calls \" very welcome news. \" meanwhile, the poverty rate for 2015 fell 1.2 percentage points from 2014 to 13.5 % — 43.1 million people, a decrease of 3.5 million — which the post notes was the largest plummet since 1968. The suggested underlying reason: job gains. Two different reactions to this news have already emerged from the two sides of the political fence. \" this exceeds the strong expectation that i already had, \" jason furman, chair of the president's council of economic advisers, tells the post, emphasizing the growth rates. Not agreeing is kevin brady, gop chair of the house ways and means committee, who says those 43 million people still living in poverty are nothing to crow about. \" today's report is another disappointing confirmation that too many americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential, \" he says. The new york times notes the median household income still has a little way to go ( 1.6 % ) before it reaches 2007 levels, and 2.4 % more before ascending to its late-1990s peak.

The key quote: \" racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the kkk, neo-nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans, \" trump said in an afternoon news conference, per politico. Trump had taken much criticism for failing to call out those groups in his initial comments on saturday. \" those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of america, \" said trump monday. Related coverage: full text: read the president's full statement via politico. He said the \" horrific attack \" that killed 32-year-old heather heyer \" fills us with grief \" and promised that \" justice will be delivered. \" he also spoke of troopers jay cullen and berke bates, who died when their chopper crashed. Victim's mother: susan bro, mother of heyer, thanked trump for his \" words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred, \" per the hill. Common criticism: trump's condemnation of the racist groups was \" necessary, \" writes chris cillizza at cnn. \" here's the problem: it came two days too late. \" at the new york times, frank bruni argues that trump's two-day delay \" upped the ante \" for monday's comments, and they ended up being \" passionless. \" plus, he opened his remarks by bragging about the economy, and bruni found that to be offensively out of place. Familiar foe: trump clashed with cnn's jim acosta over the delay, and each ended up accusing the other of spreading fake news. See video at axios.

A team of researchers — who, yes, got the idea over a cup of coffee — are reporting in the journal nanotechnology that soaking spent coffee grounds in potassium hydroxide and then heating the grounds in a furnace creates a material that can store up to 7 % of its weight in methane, a greenhouse gas that popular science calls both \" incredibly potent \" and \" much stronger than carbon dioxide. \" further, the scientists write they were able to create their carbon capture material in fewer than 24 hours — \" a fraction of the time \" it normally takes. Trapping and storing methane is a double win for the environment: not only does doing so remove the harmful greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, but it can also be used as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels that can, say, power cars. In their paper, the scientists explain that traditional methane storage methods involve compressed gas cylinders, a storage system they describe as \" dangerous and heavy. \" that's shifted attention to \" low-weight \" alternatives, and the researchers think theirs stands out. \" the waste material is free compared to all the metals and expensive organic chemicals needed in other processes — in my opinion this is a far easier way to go, \" coauthor christian kemp of pohang university of science and technology in south korea tells nanotechnology now. The absorbency, he adds, turns out to be key: \" it seems when we add the sodium hydroxide to form the activated carbon it absorbs everything. We were able to take away one step in the normal activation process — the filtering and washing — because the coffee is such a brilliant absorbent. \" ( more news about our planet: earth has 3 trillion trees...

Waste coffee used as fuel storage: scientists have developed a simple process to treat waste coffee grounds to allow them to store methane london, uk &#124; posted on september 2nd, 2015 the results are published today, 03 september 2015, in the journal nanotechnology. Methane capture and storage provides a double environmental return - it removes a harmful greenhouse gas from the atmosphere that can then be used as a fuel that is cleaner than other fossil fuels. The process developed by the researchers, based at the ulsan national institute of science and technology ( unist ), south korea, involves soaking the waste coffee grounds in sodium hydroxide and heating to 700-900 ° c in a furnace. This produced a stable carbon capture material in less than a day - a fraction of the time it takes to produce carbon capture materials. \" the big thing is we are decreasing the fabrication time and we are using cheap materials, \" explains christian kemp, an author of the",

We ' ll be here when you get back. ) yes, those coffee grounds, the ones that you so callously tossed in the trash ( or composted, or turned into a diy project ) have the potential to store substantial amounts of methane. In a new paper published in nanotechnology, researchers report that heating coffee grounds with potassium hydroxide creates a material that can store methane. Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas, much stronger than carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, leading to climate change. Researchers have been looking at ways to store methane for quite some time. With this new method, the treated coffee grounds can store up to seven percent of their weight in methane. As an added bonus, the storage is also stable at room temperature, between 58 and 94 degrees fahrenheit ( 288 to 308 kelvin ). And really, they just used normal, spent coffee grounds ( kirkland 100 % colombian coffee, dark roast fine ground ). The researchers hope that one day, this method can be used to either store methane and keep it from getting into"

Waste coffee used as fuel storage: scientists have developed a simple process to treat waste coffee grounds to allow them to store methane london, uk &#124; posted on september 2nd, 2015 the results are published today, 03 september 2015, in the journal nanotechnology. Methane capture and storage provides a double environmental return - it removes a harmful greenhouse gas from the atmosphere that can then be used as a fuel that is cleaner than other fossil fuels. The process developed by the researchers, based at the ulsan national institute of science and technology ( unist ), south korea, involves soaking the waste coffee grounds in sodium hydroxide and heating to 700-900 ° c in a furnace. This produced a stable carbon capture material in less than a day - a fraction of the time it takes to produce carbon capture materials. \" the big thing is we are decreasing the fabrication time and we are using cheap materials, \" explains christian kemp, an author of the",
            "The damp coffee grounds sitting alone and forgotten in the basket of your coffee maker have the potential to save the world. ( you forgot to clean the coffee maker, didn't you? go ahead. We ' ll be here when you get back. ) yes, those coffee grounds, the ones that you so callously tossed in the trash ( or composted, or turned into a diy project ) have the potential to store substantial amounts of methane. In a new paper published in nanotechnology, researchers report that heating coffee grounds with potassium hydroxide creates a material that can store methane. Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas, much stronger than carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, leading to climate change. Researchers have been looking at ways to store methane for quite some time. With this new method, the treated coffee grounds can store up to seven percent of their weight in methane. As an added bonus, the storage is also stable at room temperature, between 58 and 94 degrees fahrenheit ( 288 to 308 kelvin ). And really, they just used normal, spent coffee grounds ( kirkland 100 % colombian coffee, dark roast fine ground ). The researchers hope that one day, this method can be used to either store methane and keep it from getting into"

Among the biggest freudian-style revelations thae offers in the book is the \" tightly guarded secret \" of kim's mother, ko young hee, a japanese-born dancer shunned by kim's grandfather, kim il sung. Thae writes that kim jong un's 2013 execution of his own uncle, jang song thaek, was driven by animosity he'd had toward jang since childhood because he blamed his uncle for driving a wedge between his mother and grandfather. Even more intriguing are thae's details on kim's reclusive older brother kim jong chul, who was reportedly passed over to take the north's reins because dad kim jong il thought he was too \" effeminate. \" kim jong chul, said to be an \" avid guitarist, \" apparently lives a high life courtesy of his powerful brother. Thae says that included a 2015 trip to london to see an eric clapton concert — a trip filled with unreasonable demands ( thae said he had to talk the brother out of forcing a london music store to open after hours ), mcdonald's runs, and a fanboy presence at the clapton show. The times notes kim jong chul \" was completely taken over by the music, standing up, wildly clapping and raising his fist. \" thae's distaste for the kim family solidified after seeing how they lived it up while north koreans starved during the ' 90s famine.",

As recounted in the australian program a current affair, the boy did some research online and figured out he could fly alone without needing a letter from a parent on jetstar airways. He nabbed his mom's credit card, tricked his grandmother into giving him his passport, took a train to the airport, and flew to bali. \"they just asked for my student id and passport to prove that i ' m over 12 and that i ' m in secondary school, \" says the boy, identified only as drew. He then checked into a four-star hotel, having made reservations in advance, telling the clerk that his older sister would be joining him soon, per stuff.co.nz. And there he stayed, having a fine time while his panicked mom reported him as missing back home. It wasn't until the boy posted a video of himself in the hotel pool that his vacation finally came to an end. \" i was shocked and disgusted, there's no emotion to feel what we felt when we found out that he'd left overseas, \" says mom, per news.com.au. One reason she's ticked: her son had actually tried this stunt twice before, only to be turned away at the airport by qantas and garuda airlines. Mom says she was informed her son's passport would be flagged by federal authorities as a result, but that apparently never happened. In the aftermath, jetstar promises to tighten up its policies. \" he just doesn't like the word no and that's what i got, a kid in indonesia. \" ( closer to home, a city in north carolina makes the \" coolest \" places to visit list. )",

Those areas include charleston, sc, and new madrid, missouri, which both suffered serious earthquakes during the past 200 years. \" the more small earthquakes we have, it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event, \" said geophysicist william ellsworth after presenting the study to a science association. A kansas geological official responded with, \" we are worried about this, no question about it. \" meanwhile, another study says that hidden geological faults in oklahoma are ready to to burst — including ones that were just discovered and may damage vital structures, livescience reports.

        "summary": "Hookworm is a disease more commonly associated with third-world countries, but a small study out of alabama suggests it has a disturbingly strong foothold in the us. The study by the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine focused on rural lowndes county, reports the guardian. The sample was small, with just 67 participants, but the results were striking — 34 % showed traces of the parasite. Given the high percentage, researchers plan to conduct another study with a larger sample size. Hookworm was common in the us decades ago, particularly in the southeast, but improved sanitation and living conditions greatly reduced the number of cases, per the cdc. The new peer-reviewed study, published in the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene, suggests it may be more common than realized. \" the concept of global health needs to give way to a new paradigm: on the new map, texas and the gulf coast would be lit up as a hot spot, \" dr peter hotez, dean of the national school of tropical medicine, tells the financial times. Both newspapers note that residents of lowndes county are generally poor and can't afford septic systems. As a result, sewage runs from their homes into their yards, conditions perfect for hookworm and other parasitic diseases. The worms typically enter the body through the soles of a person's bare feet and make their way up to the small intestine. Hookworm patients suffer a wide range of ailments, from anemia to iron deficiency to impaired mental function. It's \" america's dirty shame, \" says community activist catherine flowers, whose work calling attention to living conditions helped lead to the baylor study.",

And it's about time, with whitepages tracking a 34 % jump in spam and scam calls between 2014 and 2015, the seattle-based tech company reported in a december business wire news release. Caller id, of course, isn't new, and whitepages already boasts android and iphone apps. Whitepages inked a similar deal with t-mobile in 2014, but engadget observes that \" it's rare for such a service to be integrated into a flagship phone. \" it makes sense, given whitepages has info on some 1.5 billion numbers worldwide, 600 million of which are us-based, reports geekwire.

Dogan says she shot her husband with a gun kept under her pillow when he came to her home in adana and tried to force her to move with him to another city to work as a prostitute. He began beating her when she refused, and that's when she grabbed the gun, dogan tells police. Dogan became a media sensation when photographed in handcuffs wearing a shirt with the phrase, \"dear past, thanks for all the lessons. Dear future, i am ready. \" at one point, she even flashed a thumb's up to photographers, and supporters have been rallying behind her on social media. The case comes amid a dramatic spike in domestic violence in turkey — as detailed in this previous piece in al jazeera — and dogan's case has resonated because she says her previous police complaints went nowhere. Though divorced, the couple had remained in contact because they have a daughter.

Two of bahar's children scurry into the room and are quickly shuffled along by a young and pale-faced woman, also in hiding. The pale-faced woman bore her father's child four years ago. \" i have no future, \" says bahar. \" my only hope is that my children die with me. This is no world for them. \" flowers - maroon, purple, and gentle yellow - stand in a vase in the corner of the room.

Akin said his \" guess is it's somewhere in the six or seven, but i don't know the exact number right now. \" brunner simply passed. The state's actual minimum wage is $ 7.25, and none of the candidates liked it. Steelman said it can prevent young people from finding work because employers aren't allowed to \" pay a lower wage. \" ( daily kos takes a shot at that argument. ) brunner said when he ran a business he always paid workers \" above the minimum wage \" because he wanted the best people. Akin dismissed the minimum wage altogether, calling it \" just another example of a wrong thing that the government does. \" ( in another shot from the left, thinkprogress explains their ignorance by noting they're all too wealthy \" to be anywhere near \" the minimum wage. )",

According to testimony, the men attacked him as the women shouted gay slurs; the men were looking for a tire iron to kill him with when pennington escaped. David and anthony were both convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy, earning them 30 and 17 years in prison, respectively, but cnn reports that in a major disappointment for the justice department, they were both acquitted on the hate crime charges. Attorneys for the men argued the assault had nothing to do with pennington's sexual orientation, but that the elder jenkins believed they were en route to a seller who was a police informant, and went ballistic, reports the herald-leader. Their cohorts mable jenkins ( anthony's sister ) and alexis jenkins ( anthony's wife ) became the first sentenced under the new hate crime provisions, but they pleaded guilty to those charges, as part of a deal to testify against the men.

Edward hopper house in nyack, ny — now a museum — is auctioning off a one-night stay in the bedroom where hopper slept until moving out in 1910 at the age of 28, reports smithsonian. Thanks to hopper's own drawings of the room, the space has been restored to look just as it did when hopper lived there, reports artnet news. It includes furniture and decorations from the period — even hopper's original bed frame, fitted with a new mattress — and views of the hudson river, which inspired hopper's focus on boats and seascapes, the museum says. A live invitation-only auction will be held on oct. 15, but you can register bids online in advance. The winning bidder — who will be watched by a self-portrait of hopper painted in 1905-06 — will be the first to stay overnight in the home built by hopper's grandfather since tenants occupied it in the 1970s, per hyperallergic. As of this writing, a $ 700 bid would take the cake, with proceeds going to fund a student studio space at the museum as well as arts education at local schools. Don't feel like forking over that much cash? museum visitors can also go inside the room until the end of may. Naps, however, are discouraged.

        "summary": "How to combine passions for food, friends, and global aid? a portland couple is cooking 194 dinner-party meals that recreate food from all the united nations member states. Laura hadden and her husband, jesse friedman, started the united noshes project about three and a half years ago when they lived in new york city. Since then they've worked their way through the alphabet from afghan food to lao cuisine, hosting small groups of friends as well as big dinners in banquet halls ( their blog drew curious strangers over time ). The price to attend? originally a small donation to the un's world food program, it's now one to portland-based mercycorps, npr reports. They've raised nearly $ 23,000 so far. \" we felt we had to acknowledge the fact that many people couldn't even enjoy the sorts of foods we were celebrating from their own country, \" friedman says. But it's not always easy: \" there are disasters of technique and some things that are just bad, \" friedman tells the jewish daily forward. \" we made headcheese from iceland and it was terrible. We call those milkshake meals because even after you eat, you need to go out after for a milkshake. \" they also grew weary of african fare after many similar meals in a row, until discovering the island nation of comoros, with its mouth-watering lobster in vanilla crème fraiche sauce. They've spread the word by hosting united noshes events in the bay area, seattle, dc, and boston, and \" met hundreds of people who are adventurous, \" he says. They expect to finish in about four more years: \" we've always said that if it gets tedious then we can just stop, \" says hadden. \" but it hasn't gotten boring yet. \" ( now see why foodies are rejoicing in california. )",

To be fair, at live science, muhlestein was quoted as qualifying the word \" mummy, \" given the natural, not artificial, processes reportedly involved: \" if we want to use the term loosely, then they were mummified, \" he said. But dr. Youssef khalifa, who, newsweek reports, heads the ancient egypt department at the country's antiquities ministry, suggests that neither the number nor the word \" mummy \" are correct. The statement, which was published in the daily mail, \" is not true, \" he says. \" there are no million mummies; a mummy definition to begin with means a complete mummified body, and there is only one mummy found at the site of fag el-gamous, in 1980. \" in recent years, says dr.

Yemen's u.s.-backed leadership came under serious threat... ( associated press ) sanaa, yemen ( ap ) — yemen's powerful shiite houthi rebels shelled the residence of the country's embattled president tuesday and simultaneously swept into the presidential palace in the capital, sanaa, as a top military commander warned that a full-fledged \" coup \" was underway. President abed rabbo mansour hadi was inside the residence as it came under \" heavy shelling \" for half an hour but he was unharmed and protected by guards, officials said. The dramatic development put the u.s.-backed hadi into a precarious position and represented the starkest challenge to his authority since the houthis swept into sanaa from their northern stronghold and seized the capital in september. Information minister nadia al-sakkaf posted on her twitter account that the shelling started at 3 p.m. Local time \" by armed forces positioned over rooftops facing \" the president's house. At the same time, houthi rebels also raided the president's offices, sweeping into the presidential palace and looting the grounds ' arms depots, according to col. Saleh al-jamalani, the commander of the presidential protection force that guards the palace. \" this is a coup. There is",

        "summary": "A witness called 911 on oct. 6 after seeing tron gorbonosenko allegedly crash his ford mustang into a parked car and utility pole, confronting him after he left the vehicle, and smelling alcohol on his breath. Three police officers came to the indiana scene, and the witness told them it appeared gorbonosenko's car had also been driven into a ditch. Little more than an hour and a half after that 911 call, police were again dispatched — this time to the scene of a fatal crash. Gorbonosenko's mustang had crashed into a minivan driven by donald and angela kaczmarek. ( the mustang crossed the centerline, according to a report at the time. ) the couple was killed in the crash; 40-year-old gorbonosenko, an off-duty paramedic, was critically injured but survived. Now, a tort claim filed by the law office representing the kaczmarek family says police were negligent in letting gorbonosenko go when they initially encountered him. According to the claim, which estimates $ 700,000 in damages is due to the kaczmareks ' estate and indicates a civil lawsuit may be coming, the officers did not ask to see gorbonosenko's license, did not conduct field sobriety tests, and did not take his keys or his car. It also alleges the officers opened the doors of the car to inspect it, and notes that empty alcohol bottles were later found on the vehicle's floor. The herald-argus, upon learning of the claim, requested a copy of the police report related to the officers ' initial interaction with gorbonosenko — and was told there wasn't one. Gorbonosenko, who was allegedly found to have a blood alcohol content of more than twice the legal limit at 0.17 after the fatal crash, faces multiple felony charges that could lead to as many as 36 years behind bars and fines of as much as $ 40,000.",

Swiss researchers had young adults complete surveys on their smartphones during \" real-life \" drinking situations, according to a news release at eureka alert — specifically, they participated every thursday through saturday night for five weekends. The subjects were asked five times throughout the night and once the next morning how much they'd drunk and how many friends were around. The average age of the 183 drinkers was 23, and they were divided about evenly by sex. The findings aren't hugely surprising: having more friends around was linked to more drinks per hour, and the results were more pronounced among men. Drinks were also downed faster later in the night, yahoo health notes. Similar research has been done before, but prior studies are often based on data collected after the night out. Information gathered after drinking sessions is often wrong, the news release says ( for reasons we can't possibly fathom ). One finding the researchers did dub \" interesting \": the impact group-size has didn't vary between thursday, friday, and saturday nights. The researchers'takeaway: the findings could factor into warnings issued to young drinkers: as the release puts it, \" the arrival of more drinking buddies at the college bar on a friday night may be cause for delight, but not necessarily a call for another round. \" speaking of young drinkers, another new study, this one out of the uk, finds men's booze consumption peaks at age 25.

Doctors are seeing a growing number of cases of alcohol misuse among the elderly and this finding supports concerns that older people might be abusing alcohol. Teenagers favour bouts of irregular heavy drinking episodes, only drinking once or twice a week, but as we grow older we shift into a regular drinking pattern. A substantial proportion of older men drink daily or most days of the week, while a majority of women tend to drink monthly or on special occasions.

Half a dozen of the world's tech giants, including samsung, nokia, qualcomm and ericsson, have agreed to work with the company as partners on the initiative, which they call internet.org. The companies intend to accomplish their goal in part by simplifying phone applications so they run more efficiently and by improving the components of phones and networks so that they transmit more data while using less battery power. For mr. Zuckerberg, the formation of the coalition is yet another way in which he is trying to position himself as an industry leader. He has been speaking out more forcefully than other tech executives on topics like immigration overhaul, which the industry sees as critical to its hiring needs.

Why did you find that to be a powerful image? polio eradication is this amazing effort. We're raising the money to get it done by 2018. When these problems leave the rich world, they're out of sight, out of mind. And reminding people of what a big problem it was and how amazingly others responded — which is why we have these tools at all — helps people, saying this can be the second disease to be eradicated. What are the prospects for the eradication of polio and malaria? polio is where we have a very concrete plan. It's raising $ 5.5 billion — of which the [ bill &amp; melinda gates ] foundation is going to give $ 1.8 billion. If we get credibility from the polio success, we can be more articulate about a malaria or measles elimination plan. The big one would be malaria, but that's a long-term, in-my-lifetime-type thing, not imminent. Can you share experiences in your travels that persuaded you to spend your time and money trying to improve global health? in the rich world, the death of a child is very rare",
            "Menlo park, calif. — about one of every seven people in the world uses facebook. Now, mark zuckerberg, its co-founder and chief executive, wants to make a play for the rest — including the four billion or so who lack internet access. On wednesday, facebook announced an effort aimed at drastically cutting the cost of delivering basic internet services on mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, where facebook and other tech companies need to find new users. Half a dozen of the world's tech giants, including samsung, nokia, qualcomm and ericsson, have agreed to work with the company as partners on the initiative, which they call internet.org. The companies intend to accomplish their goal in part by simplifying phone applications so they run more efficiently and by improving the components of phones and networks so that they transmit more data while using less battery power. For mr. Zuckerberg, the formation of the coalition is yet another way in which he is trying to position himself as an industry leader. He has been speaking out more forcefully than other tech executives on topics like immigration overhaul, which the industry sees as critical to its hiring needs. With internet.org, he is laying out a philosophy that tries to pair humanitarian goals with the profit motive. Photo \"the internet is such an important thing for driving humanity forward"

        "summary": "America's favorite ice-cream flavor is getting a lot pricier and could be challenged by cheaper, synthetic knock-offs. We're talking about vanilla, which became 150 % more expensive last year after madagascar suffered a poor harvest, munchies reports. Cakes, soft drinks, and perfumes could all be affected, but ice cream manufacturers will really feel the chill. \" the price has doubled in the last month, \" charlie thuillier, founder of the ice-cream company oppo, tells the guardian. But another maker of ice cream sees little choice: \" vanilla is every ice-cream company's biggest-selling product, \" he says. \" you've just got to take the hit on it because customers would notice the difference. \" vanilla prices were once low — so low that production fell off in countries like uganda, china, and indonesia, leaving madagascar to become the world's top vanilla producer, bloomberg reports. Then madagascan harvesters began harvesting the beans early ( in part to sidestep thieves ) and vacuum-sealing them instead of curing and drying ( to gain greater market flexibility ), meaning the pure vanilla taste declined. Now their crop has fallen from an average of about 2,200 tons of beans to roughly 1,500 tons in 2015, triggering the price increase, the christian science monitor reports. So some manufacturers are using synthetic alternatives to get cheaper and possibly better-tasting vanilla. \" there's a limit to what people will pay for natural vanilla and we're nearing that point, \" says the president of a flavoring company.",

        "summary": "The man accused of the gruesome killing of ingrid lyne has now been formally charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors filed the charge against seattle man john charlton on wednesday afternoon and also charged him with stealing the mother-of-three's car, nbc news reports. In a press release, prosecutors say he \" could face a sentence range of at least 21 to nearly 28 years in prison. \" they don't explain why charlton, who's accused of killing lyne at her home last friday, dismembering her, and dumping her body parts in a recycling bin, wouldn't face a life sentence if he's found guilty of the murder. Charlton, believed to have met lyne online and dated her for around a month, claims he was blackout drunk the night of the murder and has told investigators he's homeless. \" the tragic murder of ingrid lyne has left a family and community in a spiral of grief and anguish, \" king county prosecuting attorney dan satterberg said in a statement. \" we may never understand why she was killed, but the police and prosecutors working on this case have done a tremendous job of piecing together a solid case against the person we believe to be responsible for her death. \" according to court documents, charlton was arrested monday at the home of an ex-girlfriend, who told investigators he was a \" mean drunk, \" the renton reporter notes. He was initially \" nonchalant \" when police interviewed him, but he soon \" expressed annoyance \" with the line of questioning and invoked his right to a lawyer, the documents state. He will be back in court on april 27.",

The rnc says it has paid more than $ 230,000 to two members of trump's legal team, but the money comes from a legal proceedings account, which is separate from funds used for political work, politico reports. An rnc official tells the ap that the committee has also paid almost $ 200,000 toward donald trump jr.'s legal fees, including $ 30,000 for an attorney who helped prepare him for senate testimony earlier this month. Under a law created in 2014, the national committees of both parties were allowed to establish legal proceedings accounts to cover the expenses of election recounts and other legal matters. Donors are allowed to contribute a maximum of $ 100,200. Federal records show that the rnc's legal proceedings account has raised $ 3.35 million since the election, meaning it still has millions left after paying russia-related legal fees for both trumps, the hill reports.

Despite the small number of states involved, the results could go a long way in determining which party will be in control of the senate next year. The race getting the most attention is in west virginia, where a once-imprisoned coal executive, don blankenship, is vying to become the gop candidate for the senate against two more mainstream opponents. Republican leaders, including president trump, are actively trying to prevent that. More details and highlights: blankenship: the gop thinks it has a rare chance to flip a senate seat in november by ousting vulnerable democratic incumbent joe manchin in west virginia. But party leaders say that won't happen if the controversial blankenship wins tuesday's primary. Late polls show he has a chance, however, especially if his two gop foes \" split the anti-blankenship vote, \" per politico. How bad? so what if blankenship wins? \" i don't know, \" says john thune of south dakota, the third-ranking republican senator. \" but let's just hope and pray that that doesn't happen. \" it's possible the party would cut ties with its own nominee in november, reports the washington post.",

Although the australian man had taken mandarin in high school, he was never fluent, and doctors are still trying to figure out exactly why he completely lost the ability to speak his native language — his english skills did eventually return — and suddenly became the \" best non-native speaker \" his mandarin pals had ever heard, the independent journal review reports. Mcmahon isn't the first person to suffer a brain injury or illness and come out of it with a foreign accent or speaking a different language. Scientists often attribute this phenomenon to \" bilingual aphasia \": different languages are retained in different parts of the brain, so if one section is injured, a person's brain could transition over to another stored language, discovery reports. In cases where there's swelling in the affected part of the brain, the \" lost \" language is typically recovered once the swelling subsides.

The shrimp-on-a-treadmill study was part of an examination of how marine animals will cope with increased environmental stress, and the laundry-folding robot mocked in coburn's report was part of a project to create robots that can interact with complex objects. \" i sympathize with the desire to identify things that are silly and not useful, \" a researcher tells livescience. \" but i ' m not sure he's identified a really practical strategy to distinguish between the two. \"",

        "summary": "There are identical twins who have special bonds, and there are the ardolino sisters, who live just three blocks from each other in mineola, new york. Between them they had three sons: dawn ardolino policastro has a 7-year-old and 3-year-old; sister allison ardolino dinkelacker has a 6-year-old, dylan. But now they have four — dawn gave birth to hudson last wednesday, a child she carried for allison. In 2009, when allison was 30 weeks pregnant with dylan, she learned she had stage 3 breast cancer. A facebook post explains that the aggressive nature of the cancer necessitated chemo immediately. But after receiving one treatment a sonogram showed her baby's movement had stopped. She delivered her son at 31 weeks, on her 33rd birthday. Though her cancer is in remission, mineola patch reports that her cancer was \" brought on by hormones. \" that killed the possibility of a desired second pregnancy for her, something dawn was told when she accompanied her sister to an appointment with an oncologist. As he began to explain that another pregnancy wouldn't be possible, allison says dawn inserted herself, saying, \" it doesn't matter because i am going to carry their child. \" she did exactly that, serving as a gestational carrier and birthing the 8-pound, 13-ounce hudson. A pregnancy photo shoot the sisters did has gone viral, with one picture in particular getting attention: it shows allison standing just in front of dawn, who is holding a sign reading, \" shhh... It's a boy! \" she kept the baby's gender a secret from her sister throughout the whole pregnancy. ( a 27-year-old recently gave birth in a historic way. )",

        "summary": "Joe arpaio has asked an arizona judge to vacate his contempt of court conviction, arguing a presidential pardon \" warrants an automatic vacatur of all opinions, judgments, and verdicts related to the criminal charge. \" but he ' ll have to come up with a bit more than that. On tuesday, us district court judge susan bolton ordered arpaio to present oral arguments in favor of such an outcome before she decides whether his conviction should be wiped, reports the arizona republic. The justice department will likewise have to present arguments for or against a nullification. The arguments are scheduled to be heard on oct. 4. Arpaio's sentencing hearing had been set for oct. 5, though it was canceled following friday's pardon. A lawyer for arpaio gives a hint as to what might be presented during the october meeting, telling the republic that the verdict \" was never delivered to sheriff arpaio in open court, but instead sent to his attorneys via email, thus violating his constitutional rights to a public trial and to participate in his trial. \" he adds arpaio is ready to appeal if the judge's decision isn't in his favor. Meanwhile, arpaio has blamed the media and elected officials for recent \" derogatory, slanderous statements \" claiming his conviction for disobeying a judge's order was in fact for racial profiling. The washington post has a timeline of facts from the case, noting it did stem from systemic racial profiling by arpaio's maricopa county sheriff's office.
