        "summary": "Michigan's attorney general announced criminal charges wednesday against two state regulators and a flint employee, alleging wrongdoing related to the city's lead-tainted-water crisis. The charges — the first levied in a probe that's expected to broaden — were filed against a pair of state department of environmental quality officials and the city's utilities administrator, the ap reports. The felony and misdemeanor charges include official misconduct, evidence tampering, and neglect of duty, and all three men face prison time, reports the detroit free press. In january, republican attorney general bill schuette opened an investigation and appointed a special counsel to lead the probe because his office also is defending gov. Rick snyder and others in lawsuits filed over the water crisis. The state investigation team has more than 20 outside attorneys and investigators and a budget of $ 1.5 million. ( snyder says he is going to drink flint water for a month. )",

        "summary": "\" it wasn't a mistake out of anything other than trying to ensure that my daughter's well-being was taken care of, \" says antwan wilson, but it's a mistake that has cost the dc public schools chancellor his job, just one year and 19 days into his tenure. The washington post reports wilson was a high-profile pick made by mayor muriel bowser who came to the dc area from oakland, calif. January brought one big hurdle — an investigation that determined one third of 2017 graduates received diplomas despite violating attendance requirements — but an issue much closer to home proved his undoing. In what wtop calls one of his first moves as chancellor, npr reports wilson last summer put in place rules that curtailed a chancellor's ability to greenlight school transfers for public officials ' kids. But then wilson violated his very own policy. Wilson's wife and three children arrived in dc over the summer. Rather than send his oldest daughter to dunbar high, the lower-rated school their neighborhood is zoned for, he relied on the lottery system and got the sophomore into the duke ellington school of the arts. But after a few weeks, she was \" struggling socially and emotionally... Not eating, not coming out of her room and expressing real anxiety around going to school, \" says wilson, who tells wttg he had \" tunnel vision \" around the issue. Wilson then had his wife work with deputy mayor for education jennifer niles to get the teen into the highly rated woodrow wilson high, which has a 600-person-long waitlist. The new york times reports bowser learned last week that the dc inspector general's office was looking into the transfer. Niles was fired on friday; wilson resigned tuesday.",

Shane smith and suroosh alvi spoke out after a new york times report found that the company had reached settlements including at least four harassment or defamation cases, including one involving vice's current president. More than two dozen women contacted the times to describe sexual misconduct amid a culture of \" male entitlement \" at the company, which grew from a small magazine in montreal into a global media empire. The times noted that despite the young age of the company and many of its managers, old-school sexual harassment and misogyny was allowed to take root. \" cultural elements from our past, dysfunction and mismanagement were allowed to flourish unchecked, \" smith and alvi said, per the bbc. \" that includes a detrimental ' boy's club ' culture that fostered inappropriate behavior \" throughout the firm. The company, which had required employees to sign an agreement saying they wouldn't be offended by the \" workplace environment, \" says it has taken steps including hiring a new hr director and creating an advisory board that includes feminist gloria steinem. The guardian reports that after the times story, more former vice employees shared stories, including billie jd porter, who tweeted that after vice hired her as an \" incredibly vulnerable \" 16-year-old, they gave her business cards with the title \" lolita life ruiner. \"",

A new study that examined the long-term use of over-the-counter pain relievers found that women who took certain meds steadily for six years were 10 % more likely to experience hearing loss, reports the new york times. The pain relievers in question were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibruprofen ( advil ) or naproxen ( aleve ). Those taking acetaminophen ( tylenol ) for the same period were 9 % more inclined to report hearing problems. The team did not find diminished hearing associated with aspirin use. While the mechanism behind the hearing loss is unknown and the study did not prove causation, a press release notes it adds to a growing body of evidence that these sorts of drugs are linked to auditory problems. Writing in the american journal of epidemiology, researchers compared long-term users with women who took the same pain meds two or more times per week for less than one year. The study involved more than 54,000 mostly white women between the ages of 48 and 73 who self-reported their usage. Lead author brian m. Lin of harvard tells the times that while the amount of hearing loss was low, use of the drugs in question is so widespread that \" it can have large implications for public health. \" two-thirds of american women over 60 experience hearing loss, and the study says the researchers may have found \" an important modifiable contributor. \" lin says don't halt the meds, but longtime users should \" talk to their doctor just to see if they really need to be on them. \" ( studies have linked tylenol use to hyperactivity in children and a \" lack of empathy. \" )",

        "summary": "The days of menthol cigarettes might be doomed: a new fda review suggests that menthols are more dangerous than regular cigarettes, reports reuters. It's not because they're any more toxic — it's because the mint flavor, along with menthol's ability to mask the harshness of a cigarette, seems to make people more likely to start smoking and less likely to stop. Those factors and others make it \" likely that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with non-menthol cigarettes, \" says the review. While that doesn't seem to bode well for lorillard, maker of the popular newport menthol brand, any potential regulatory is action is years away, reports the wall street journal. The review did not recommend any restrictions, which displeased anti-smoking advocates, reports the new york times. For now, the fda is seeking public comment over 60 days on whether menthol flavoring should be banned — as all other types of flavoring are — and on how the cigarettes are marketed to youths and minorities. The latter stems from the stat that 80 % of black smokers prefer menthols. Overall, menthols account for about 25 % of cigarettes sold in the us.",

The \" viral video effect \" is something he's used in the past to explain the recent spurt of seemingly less-aggressive policing, the new york times reports — a phenomenon in which cops avoid going after suspects because they don't want to end up as the next viral video. \" there's a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal additional policing that suppresses crime — the getting out of your car at 2 in the morning and saying to a group of guys, ' hey, what are you doing here? ' \" he said wednesday. His comments were spurred by his review of a major cities chiefs association quarterly report that showed rising crime rates — especially murder rates — in dozens of cities, especially las vegas and chicago, per usa today. \" i don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem, \" comey said of what's also known as the \" ferguson effect \" ( after ferguson, mo. ). \" a whole lot of people are dying.

Comey brought up the same issue in october, inciting ire from the police and even the white house. \" i was very worried about it last fall and i am in many ways more worried, \" he said, per politico, imploring the national media to pay more attention to the issue. The director of the national fraternal order of police, meanwhile, tells the times that the fbi chief \" ought to stick to what he knows. He's basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no proof. \" ( the fbi has promised to start keeping better track of deaths by cop. )",

But the protesters blocked the road and were able to force the buses to turn around and head back toward san diego. Cnn reports they were instead taken to a border station in san ysidro. As cnn explains, texas facilities are jam-packed, due in part to an influx of immigrant children, leading detainees to be sent out of state for processing.

        "summary": "It's \" rare \" for antiques roadshow to make a mistake when appraising items, time notes, but it does happen — and it happened in january in a big way. The show took a look at an item it calls \" grotesque face jug, \" a jug with bizarre faces on it that antiques broker alvin barr found in a barn at an estate sale and bought for $ 300. Stephen fletcher, an appraiser on the show, acknowledged that \" it's a little difficult to identify precisely when this was made, \" the washington post reports, but ultimately estimated its worth at between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000. He guessed that it was likely created in the late 19th or early 20th century on the east coast, but was a little off: it was actually created in 1973 or 1974 by then-student betsy soule at churchill high school in eugene, ore. An old friend recognized the jug on the show and called soule, and together they submitted evidence to the show proving she was the actual creator. Soule, who considered a career in the arts before going on to become a horse trainer, told the bend bulletin back in march that she's not sure how exactly the jug got from her possession to the barn where barr found it. Antiques roadshow officially corrected its estimate of the jug's worth in february, with fletcher admitting, \" i was fooled, as were some of my colleagues. \" his new estimate of the jug's worth: between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000, \" based on its quality and artistic merit. \" barr is far from disappointed: \" i hated it when it was $ 30,000 to $ 50,000, because who wants $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 lying around their house? \" he said, noting that he had it packed away for safekeeping after the show. \" now, it's on my table, and i love it. \" ( here's a much more valuable antiques roadshow discovery. )",

The antiques broker from oregon was at an estate sale when he noticed the object in the barn, covered by a layer of straw and dirt and chicken poop. Upon closer inspection, the many-hued purplish-brown jug had six faces jutting out from its textured clay body, each sporting a distinct expression of woe. One face had a stitched-up eye, another a forked tongue. And their sculpted skins ranged from furs to scales. Barr knew he had to have it, and paid $ 300 to take it home. Later, he would tell an appraiser on \"antiques",

( ryan brennecke/the bulletin via ap ) it was the jug's strange composition that caught alvin barr's eye. The antiques broker from oregon was at an estate sale when he noticed the object in the barn, covered by a layer of straw and dirt and chicken poop. Upon closer inspection, the many-hued purplish-brown jug had six faces jutting out from its textured clay body, each sporting a distinct expression of woe. One face had a stitched-up eye, another a forked tongue. And their sculpted skins ranged from furs to scales. Barr knew he had to have it, and paid $ 300 to take it home. Later, he would tell an appraiser on \"antiques",

An ugly-faced jug was appraised at $ 50,000 on the show last year. The appraiser estimated it dated back to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. In fact, a woman actually made it in an oregon high school art class in the 1970s. Horse trainer betsy soule claimed the piece when a friend recognized it on the show, according to the bend bulletin.

In a reddit ama a couple years ago, zemdegs explained how he does it — it's complicated and involves lots of math, including dozens of algorithms and memorized twist sequences. But, he also noted, it helps to oil up the cube so things move more quickly.

That's the takeaway from new research out of michigan state university that found taking a spin on a \" medium-intensity \" coaster may aid in the passing of the pesky mineral masses, with minimal discomfort, the los angeles times reports. The study published in the journal of the american osteopathic association found that taking the rear seat on a roller coaster resulted in a kidney stone passing almost 64 % of the time; sitting in the front seat gave a more modest 17 % passage rate. How the experiment itself came to pass: the researchers ' interest was piqued after they heard from several patients that their stones had passed after riding disney's big thunder mountain railroad in florida. Live science and wired describe the creative way scientists replicated an actual person with kidney stones riding a roller coaster. First they made a 3d silicone kidney, complete with three kidney stones of various sizes — 4.5, 13.5, and 64.6 cubic millimeters — encased within the model in urine. The fake kidney went into a backpack, then went for 20 rides on the disney coaster, which reaches speeds of 35mph. \" many people in the united states probably live within a few hours'drive of an amusement park containing a roller coaster with features capable of dislodging calyceal renal calculi, \" the researchers write, though they note the smaller the stone, the better, per nbc news. But there may be a sweet spot when it comes to the purge: one of disney's other roller coasters, space mountain, with a top speed of 28.7mph, didn't have the same effect.

But she does get to hold a slightly more ignominious title: briefest vice presidential candidate in modern us history. Fiorina was named ted cruz's pick for vp last wednesday. On tuesday, cruz dropped out of the race. Vox reports her seven-day stint as a vice presidential candidate is the shortest since thomas eagleton, who spent 18 days as george mcgovern's vp choice in 1972. He was removed from the ticket after it was discovered he had been hospitalized for depression multiple times and received electroshock therapy.

Regardless, jezebel has a bit of sympathy for fiorina, who \" dragged her ass out of bed to return to the campaign trail \" at cruz's request. That her effort was rewarded with a string of minor humiliations makes it all the more tragic.

Fiorina's run was cut short by no fault of her own ( probably ), but instead by an overzealous candidate who declared a vp with basically no shot of winning the nomination.

            "After a crushing defeat in indiana, the soggiest senator ted cruz announced that he would end his presidential campaign. The decision was no doubt a blow to the small pocket of christian conservatives who had, above all odds, held out hope that this snarling bespawler would somehow trounce donald trump. But it was not as devastating to them, or to anyone, as it was to carly fiorina, who had — literally days before — dragged her ass out of bed to return to the campaign trail as cruz's vice president. Advertisement the washington post reports that at seven days, her vp candidacy is the shortest in modern history — 11 days shorter than the previous record holder thomas eagleton ( george mcgovern's short-lived vp who dropped out due democratic leadership pressure after it learned he had been hospitalized for depression and had thrice undergone electroshock therapy ). Fiorina's run was cut short by no fault of her own ( probably ), but instead by an overzealous candidate who declared a vp with basically no shot of winning the nomination. But boy, was it a humiliating run.

According to the independent, asiya bibi ( also reported as aasia bibi ) was forced to marry a 25-year-old man against her will in september. She recently tried to flee the marriage and return to her family but was sent back to her husband. Police say bibi got poison from an alleged lover and mixed it with her husband's milk last week, the telegraph reports. According to upi, the alleged lover is a cousin whom bibi had hoped to marry. Police say bibi's plan to \" avenge \" her forced marriage fell apart when her husband refused to drink the poisoned milk. Instead, police say bibi's mother-in-law used the milk to make a yogurt drink called lassi, which was served to 27 people, including children, last thursday in the city of muzaffargarh. Police say 17 people, including bibi's husband, are dead. There are reportedly up to 10 more victims in critical condition. It's unclear if any children are among the dead. Police say bibi initially claimed the milk was poisoned when a lizard fell into it. Bibi's alleged lover and an aunt were also arrested. The telegraph notes there is little legal recourse in pakistan for women forced into a marriage by their family against their will.

Some 15 hours of observing natural behavior in 86 horses, ranging in age from four weeks to 27 years and spanning several breeds, have yielded that number of facial expressions, they report in the journal plos one. That's three more than chimps use, one more than dogs, and only 10 fewer than humans, reports the guardian. They call their system equine facial action coding system ( equifacs ), and while they've managed to identify the facial movements horses can make, \" the challenge now is to document what contexts these occur in, and then we will be able to make more informed comparisons, \" says jennifer watham, one of the lead authors. What surprised her the most, she tells discovery, is that \" we didn't expect horses to have any similarities with humans at all — they're two such distantly related species and, at first glance, have such differently shaped faces. \" but with better vision than cats and dogs, horses are visual animals, and appear to have developed incredibly nuanced expressions. For instance, both horses and humans are capable of raising the skin above their eyes, as well as retracting the corners of their mouths. Whether these expressions mean similar things across species remains to be seen, but the researchers surmise that in the evolution of equine facial expressions, social factors are at play.

Mueller-korenek of valley center, calif., also had help from a special carbon-fiber bike fitted with motorcycle tires. Twice the size of a normal bike, it travels up to 130 feet on one pedal stroke, per the journal. But that says nothing of the work mueller-konorek put in while chasing the record over six years, per the san diego union tribune. After hitting 147.7mph as the first woman to try for the speed record in 2016, she broke a shoulder blade in a february 2017 crash, then accidentally shot herself in the leg at a competitive shooting event months later. Coach john howard — who set the record at 152mph in 1985 — pushed her on. Despite a moment of fear sunday as the bicycle's front tire nearly hit the car, \" it all came together, \" howard says.",

Once she's going autobahn speeds, though, she can unhook from the drag racing car that tows her off the line and start to crank the gear around. Drafting off the steadily accelerating racer and spinning up the rpm's on the bike's compound reduction gear, she ' ll have two and a half minutes to reach the goal that brought her to utah's bonneville salt flats this weekend: set the motor-paced bicycle land speed record. Which right now stands at 167 miles per hour. Accelerating past the takeoff speed of a boeing 757 on a bike seems impossible, but a top-flight cyclist riding",

            "It took just two minutes on sunday to prove that denise mueller-korenek is the fastest bicyclist in the world... Two minutes and six long years of training, testing and team-building to set the new paced bicycle speed world record at utah's bonneville salt flats. On sunday afternoon, the 45-year-old valley center resident was officially recorded pedaling an average 183.9 miles per hour over one mile, breaking the existing 167-mph record set in 1995 by dutchman fred rompelberg. The only person who's seriously tried to beat him over the past 23 years is mueller-korenek, who set the women's world record of 147.7 mph during her first attempt two years ago. In a phone interview from utah on monday morning, mueller-korenek said she was shocked to learn that she'd not only broken rompelberg's record, but smashed it by more than 16 mph. \"i was literally stunned, \" she said. \"i was hoping to land somewhere in the 170s and we just blew right through them. It's amazing to have this record. \" on sunday, sept. 16, denise mueller-korenek, 45, of valley center set the paced bicycle speed world record of 183.9 miles per hour at the bonneville"

Its occurrence has doubled over the past 10 years, and in one section of appalachia covering parts of kentucky, west virginia, and virginia, cases of the disease's final stage have quadrupled. \" it feels like i've got a heavy wet sack on each lung, \" says a victim of the breath-stealing disease. The 1969 regulations initially cut cases by 90 %, leading many to believe it was on a path to extinction. But though mining firms and regulators have been aware of miners ' overexposure to disease-producing coal mine dust over the past 20 years, they have \" failed to protect \" their workers, reports npr. Among the more damning facts and stats: autopsies on 24 of the miners killed in the 2010 big branch mine blast showed that 71 % had signs of the disease. Some victims have developed the disease after a relatively short period in the mines, it's advancing to worse stages more quickly, and it's affecting younger miners — in their 40s, 30s, and even 20s. This could be due in part to more exposure: in the last three decades, the workweek has gotten 11 hours longer, translating into 600 extra hours in the mines annually. Mining machines are more efficient these days, meaning, says a pulmonologist who works with miners, \" they release more silicon dioxide, and the increase in silica is more toxic than just the coal dust itself. \" click through for the full piece.",

            "At weekengo, we live and breathe weekend getaways, so the topic of which destination is best to visit is debated in our office on a daily basis. To settle the question, we decided to commission a study into the best cities to spend 48 hours. The goal of the study was not only to define which factors make a city great for short visits, but also which trips are best suited to different age groups and dynamics. To determine the criteria for the study, we looked at all the factors which could affect a weekend trip, such as time spent stuck in traffic and the availability of accommodation. Since different types of travellers look for different kinds of attractions, the study offers both a general overall ranking, and in addition splits the results to show which cities are best suited for millennials, families and baby boomers. The number of main tourist attractions such as museums and galleries were factored into the research, as well as safety, equality and tolerance. Calculating all scores, we were able to create the ultimate index of the best cities to spend a weekend. \" given the fact that we looked at over 1,000 cities worldwide, every destination that made it to this top 100 ranking ought to be on your weekend getaway bucket list. \" commented tobias boese, co-founder and managing director of"

But buzz has been steadily building around the country's wines, particularly its dominant tannat grape, which is becoming to the country what malbec is to argentina. This week edward deitch at today speculated that these wines might be \" the next big thing, \" noting that they're \" richer \" and \" more opulent \" than french tannats, and praising their \" slightly rustic honesty \" and charm. In decades past, argentina mostly produced high-volume hybrid jug wines, richard jennings observed in the huffington post last summer. But the south american free trade zone forced it to compete more with its neighbors, and changing government subsidies soon led to more fine wine grapes. Now, producers are using techniques like micro-oxygenation and barrel aging to tame tannat's mighty tannins, making wines that are drinkable sooner. Top vineyards such as bouza cultivate grapes in areas as small as half a hectare, ensuring quality control and traceability, according to this 2010 afp piece dubbing uruguay a \" rising star. \" for some examples to try, with tasting notes, check deitch's article.",

Regulators often halt prosecutions by warning that charging the banks might force them to revoke their charters, effectively killing the banks and damaging the economy. But prosecutors have met with regulators and emerged reassured; new york's top financial regulator, for instance, said he'd impose penalties on bnp, including forcing it to fire employees, claw back pay, and temporarily stop transferring money through new york, but that he wouldn't revoke its charter.",

Instead, the wall street journal got its hands on a memo that suggests the company's cash troubles remain significant. In the memo, sent by an unnamed global supply manager to an unnamed parts supplier, tesla asks for money back on deals struck as far back as 2016. The pitch is that tesla needs the cash to become profitable and that the supplier should see the give-back as an investment in a long-term partnership. The memo says other suppliers were getting the same message. The journal notes that while it's not unusual for car companies to seek discounts, it is unusual to seek a discount on past deals. \" this is troubling for us to hear, \" a morningstar analyst wrote in a note to clients, per the guardian. Shares in the company dropped about 5 % after the story broke. Tesla confirmed it was seeking price cuts on old deals but said it was a standard business practice. Not everyone agrees. \" it's simply ludicrous and it just shows that tesla is desperate right now, \" a manufacturing consultant tells the journal. \" they're worried about their profitability but they don't care about their suppliers ' profitability. \" tesla hit a manufacturing milestone on the model 3 earlier this month, prompting musk to say it had \" become a real car company. \" but tesla is burning through about $ 1 billion in cash per quarter, and the san jose mercury news notes that it just slashed 9 % of its workforce to cut costs.",

Lee willie dejesus, 23, was originally charged with aggravated child abuse and child neglect after the monday night incident inside their home on the 300 block of southwest 4th avenue. Police said they will bump the charge up to first-degree murder if the boy is taken off life support. Dejesus told officers he was watching his son while the mother was at work when he decided to have a sparring session with the toddler. He put on 16-ounce boxing gloves and punched his son, willy brown, as much as 15 times during the boxing lesson, according to police. Dejesus originally told police that the bruises on the boy's body were from a babysitter, but he later admitted that was a lie. Dejesus also told officers that brown fell off the bed and hit his head on the wall and tile floor, but waited between 30 minutes to an hour to call 911. Brown was airlifted to miami children's hospital, where he is brain dead and on life support, according to police. Dejesus was booked into a miami-dade jail and a judge had issued a $ 75,000 bond, but later rescinded the bail after police increased"

With all eight votes counted in the new hampshire town, traditionally the first in the us to report election results, hillary clinton has four votes to two for donald trump. Gary johnson and, more surprisingly, mitt romney are tied for third with one vote apiece. The polls opened at midnight and closed minutes later. After going 40 years without voting for a democrat, the town chose obama in 2008. Romney and obama were tied with five votes each in 2012. But dixville notch wasn't the only new hampshire town voting at midnight this year: results were in a few minutes later from millsfield, which trump took in a landslide, with 16 votes to four for clinton — and one for bernie sanders, according to the town's facebook page. In hart's location, which revived midnight voting in 1996, clinton had 17 votes to 14 for trump. Usa today notes that new hampshire law allows towns with fewer than 100 voters to open their polls at midnight — but with a massive ski resort development in the area set to boost the population, this could be dixville's last year in the spotlight.",

Video provided by afp newslook as the world waits with bated breath for the results of tuesday's contentious presidential election, its eyes turned briefly to three sleepy hamlets in rural new hampshire, as their residents — fewer than 100 total — became the first in the nation to cast their ballots. In dixville notch, hillary clinton beat donald trump 4-2. Libertarian gary johnson received one vote, and the 2012 republican candidate, mitt romney received a surprise write-in ballot. In the slightly larger burg of hart's location, clinton won with 17 votes to trump's 14. Johnson got three votes, while write-ins bernie sanders and john kasich each got one. And in millsfield, trump won decisively, 16-4, with one write-in for bernie sanders. So, in the three new hampshire towns with midnight voting, trump came out ahead 32-25. According to new hampshire law, communities with under 100 voters can open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. The best known of these three towns, dixville notch, has been voting at midnight every election since 1960. Neil tillotson, the former owner of the balsams grant resort hotel, which closed in 2011, started midnight voting in dixville in 1960 to stir up publicity for the resort. Almost all of the dixville voters are employees of the resort. This could be dixville's last year in the election spotlight, however. Les otten, a new england businessman, bought the balsams and plans to redevelop it into a massive ski resort. That could bring the population in dixville over 100 people, thereby ending its midnight voting tradition. Hart's location was the first town to begin the tradition of early voting in 1948. According to the town's website, it started when the town was \" inhabited mostly by maine central railroad workers and their families \" and early voting became the most convenient way for them to vote. But midnight voting was abandoned in 1964, \" when residents became tired of all the media ruckus and voted to end it. \" hart's location revived the practice in 1996.

The bodies of the four children — who were reportedly on the autism spectrum and all home-schooled — and one of the adult women were found in a converted shed on the property where katrina and her children lived, reports the bbc. They reportedly moved there following what news.com.au calls katrina's \" acrimonious split \" from the children's father. \" police have spoken to the children's father, he's understandably grieving and we're providing as much support as we can, \" dawson said, per abc.

        "summary": "At least 26 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in the worst violence in ukraine's post-soviet history, according to the country's health ministry, which says the dead include 10 police officers and a journalist. The mayhem began as anti-government protesters clashed with security forces yesterday, and it continued overnight, with riot police making a fresh attempt to clear a central kiev square in the early hours, reports the bbc, which witnessed police gain control of a corner of the square for the first time since december. As of 6am, a bbc correspondent reported \" no sign these clashes will die down, \" calling the independence square area a \" battle zone. \" the latest developments: as thousands of police attacked the square, opposition leader vitali klitschko urged civilians to defend the protest camp; at least 10,000 heeded his call amid fires and exploding stun grenades, the ap reports. Cnn reports that protesters fashioned a makeshift compressed-air cannon and stockpiled weapons last night, transporting stones from hand to hand, building molotov cocktails, and fueling fiery barricades composed of wood and tires. The eu and germany are among those calling for calm, while the governments of france and poland got more specific: they're calling for \" quick and targeted sanctions against those responsible for these acts. \" reuters reports that francois hollande wants to see them imposed as soon as tomorrow, at an eu meeting of foreign ministers. Meanwhile, russia called the chaos the \" direct result of connivance by western politicians, \" reuters finds. After late-night talks between president viktor yanukovich and opposition leaders failed to yield any compromise, the president issued a statement calling for opposition leaders to draw a \" boundary between themselves and radical forces which are provoking bloodshed. \" the opposition leaders said that yanukovich's only proposal was for the demonstrators to go home. Ukraine's olympic committee said in a statement that it was \" shocked \" and \" doing our best to honor ( loved ones back home ) on the fields of play here in sochi. We appeal for peace and mutual understanding, to find a positive way forward for ukraine. \" meanwhile, the ioc rejected the ukrainian delegation's request to wear black armbands to honor the dead, notes the ap.",

Kelly doesn't explicitly state either thing in the book, settle for more, but times reviewer jennifer senior reads between the lines. For instance, on the leak, kelly wrote in her memoir that trump was angry the day before the debate because he'd heard that the first question would be a tough one from kelly, which turned out to be true — it was about his treatment of women. Reads senior's review: \" she doesn't speculate where the leak came from. ( she reports.

The 15th-century voynich manuscript, which, as the guardian puts it, combines an \" intriguing mix of elegant writing and drawings of strange plants and naked women, \" has stumped scholars for decades. Now, after a 10-year quest, small spanish publisher siloe has won the right to reproduce the mysterious tome, which sits in a vault at yale university. Siloe will publish 898 replicas of the manuscript next year, raising the hope that a cryptologist will be able to crack the code, notes the telegraph. The reproductions won't come cheap, however, each costing between $ 8,000 and $ 9,000. \" it's a book that has such an aura of mystery that when you see it for the first time … it fills you with an emotion that is very hard to describe, \" delighted publisher juan jose garcia told the guardian. Some 300 copies have already been pre-ordered. The manuscript is named after wilfried voynich, a polish antiquarian who bought it from italian jesuits in 1912, but its origins are unknown. The 13th-century english franciscan friar roger bacon, who was jailed for practicing alchemy, was ruled out as its creator after carbon dating put it between 1404 and 1438. Others have pointed to leonardo da vinci, who often wrote in code during the inquisition. Some experts say the 250 vellum pages could be a study in medieval medicine, while the guardian notes that others think the voynich holds magical powers, the guardian says. While many experts have puzzled over the manuscript without success, in 2014 one cryptographer claimed to have deciphered 10 words.",

At least that's how one republican lawmaker from oklahoma characterizes it, the week reports. Sen. James lankford has released his second annual federal fumbles report detailing what he calls \" wasteful and inefficient \" federal spending. The report includes 100 examples of federal spending — totaling $ 247 billion — for studies, research, and more that lankford doesn't believe the government needed to be involved in. Take the tanzanian fish bone thing, for instance, which was funded by the national science foundation. Lankford says the nsf needs to focus more on the \" national \" in its name. \" when we deal with foreign aid, we should simply deal with foreign aid that is to the benefit of the united states, \" he says in a press release. But the nsf argues that's exactly what it was doing. A spokesperson tells the washington post that the fish bone study was done with a low-income school in the us to \" increase participation in science by underrepresented minorities. \" and the national institutes of health says finding out kids don't like sneezed-on food was only a small part of a study intended to figure out how children relate to food in order to promote lifetime healthy eating.

It's a \" credentials arms race among teenagers and college students \" who are going to extreme measures to pad their resumes, writes new york times columnist david leonhardt. And that includes the double-major. Upon hearing that a student has a double major, leonhardt writes, \" my heart sinks just a little bit. \" while he concedes that some students truly have more than one academic interest they want to pursue, leonhardt says most students who opt for a double-major — and there are more and more of them in recent years — are doing it for the aforementioned resume padding. But what's wrong with that? well, per leonhardt, students \" learn more creatively by mastering a single major — and leaving themselves time to take classes in multiple other fields. \" he quotes a wellesly college student who wrote in a op-ed in her college paper that double majors squelch exploration of different fields. In general, leonhardt argues, the \" credentials arms race \" can make well-to-do students seem more accomplished than others. And for those well-off students, it can take the joy out of learning as they load up on extracurricular activities and the like. Leonhardt closes with an excerpt of a recent speech by college board president david coleman that argues that students should, \" take the time to focus and do a few things well, and enjoy the golden time of high school, \" rather than pack their schedules with a.p. Courses and extracurriculars — and, leonhardt might add, double-majors once they get to college.",

But what 15-year-old british teenager natasha ednan-laperouse didn't realize is that the baguette from the pret a manger sandwich shop at london's heathrow airport also contained sesame seeds. The seeds were apparently baked into the baguette and thus not visible, and they weren't listed on the list of ingredients because of a business loophole now under scrutiny, reports the guardian. Natasha boarded her flight from london to france and collapsed during the flight, reports the bbc. Her father administered two epipen injections, but the teen — who had a severe allergy to sesame seeds — never recovered and died later at a hospital in nice. An inquest is now underway into her 2016 death. \" as a family now of three, my wife, son and i are still trying to adjust to life without our beloved girl, \" says her father, nadim ednan-laperouse. Pret is a chain with locations in several countries, including the us. In the european union, regulations require that sesame seeds be listed as a potential allergen on food packaging, but smaller, independent chains such as pret that use on-site kitchens are exempted. Instead, pret posts signs with allergy information in stores and directs concerned customers to talk to a manager. In the us, a similar lawsuit unfolded against pret in 2015 after a man went into anaphylactic shock after eating at a new york city location. But because sesame is not classified as an allergen that must be listed in the us, the suit was dismissed, per the guardian.",

        "summary": "Another victory for those calling for antibiotics to be eliminated from our food chain: by 2017, tyson foods will have largely eliminated human antibiotic use in its chickens. \" antibiotic-resistant infections are a global health concern, \" says the ceo in a statement. \" we're confident our meat and poultry products are safe, but want to do our part to responsibly reduce human antibiotics on the farm so these medicines can continue working when they're needed to treat illness. \" some quick reactions: npr: \" it's the most dramatic sign so far of a major shift by the poultry industry. The speed with which chicken producers have turned away from antibiotics, in fact, has surprised some of the industry's longtime critics. \" keep antibiotics working campaign: \" why are the turkey, pork, and beef industries lagging so far behind? \" cnnmoney notes that one food safety expert at the center for science in the public interest says the move is not enough and that a ban on antibiotic use in agriculture is needed. The move comes shortly after mcdonald's — one of tyson's largest clients — announced that within two years, it will no longer use chickens treated with human antibiotics. Tyson, one of the biggest meat producers in the us, had already been taking steps to remove human antibiotics from its chicken production, the new york times reports, and many speculated at that point the company would take the final steps. Perdue and pilgrim's pride have made similar moves, reuters reports, meaning that now the top three chicken producers in the us are all on the road toward eliminating antibiotics. Tyson may still use human antibiotics on chickens in the future if absolutely necessary, but any such use would be publicly disclosed.",

Seattle's gum wall in pike place market, which has been collecting wads of chewed gum for 20 years, will be reduced to plain old brick beginning tuesday courtesy of a contractor with an industrial steam machine, reports the seattle times. The area's preservation and development authority says the wall has attracted 1 million pieces of gum, spread eight feet high by 54 feet wide, and the gunk is six inches thick in spots, per king 5. And though it's cleaned every other month with a light steaming, officials say it's time the gum is removed to preserve the market district's historic buildings. Won't people just create a new gum wall? probably, the pda admits. But the hope is that it will be contained to the original wall, since the stuff has moved \" far beyond, \" a rep says. \" gum is made of chemicals, sugar, additives. Things that aren't good for us. I can't imagine it's good for brick, \" she adds. \" it was never part of the charter or the history of the market to have the walls covered with gum. \" the attraction actually started accidentally, when audience members waiting in line for a late night improv show at the market theater found the wall was a great place to leave their gum. \" the wall is like the art that takes place behind it, constantly changing from the sharing of its participants. And, like a good improv story, has a beginning, middle and end, \" a rep for the improv theater troupe tells kiro. \" the wall is ready to start a new story. We are excited to see the new incarnation. \" workers will use 280-degree steam to melt the gum, which will then be collected and weighed. ( click for more icky tourist attractions. )",

The advance notice given to the us embassy came in the form of a senior russian military official who would only say russian aircraft would be flying in syria's airspace, reportedly keeping mum on exactly where the strikes would take place, abc notes. Per russia's interfax, putin said that the strikes were born of a syrian request and that they were in accordance with international law. What's not clear: whether he's targeting isis, which doesn't have a major presence in homs, or rebels fighting bashar al-assad. \" there doesn't seem to be any operational effect on ( isis ) where they are flying, \" says the us official. That conflicts with what a russian defense ministry spokesman told russian news agencies wednesday, noting that targeted strikes are being carried out on sites that russians believe are under the control of isis, per the ap.

Forbes notes larsen has in his personal holdings 5.19 billion xrp tokens from his virtual-currency company, ripple, in addition to a 17 % stake in ripple itself. That massive stash apparently paid off thursday after xrp hit a high of $ 3.84, per cnbc. The new york times reports that larsen, ripple's co-founder and former ceo, was briefly worth almost $ 60 billion thanks to the ripple stake and xrp tokens, now the second largest virtual currency behind bitcoin. Those assets catapulted him within reach of facebook's zuckerberg, currently no. 4 on forbes ' richest person list with around $ 74 billion, and ahead of oracle co-founder larry ellison, who's worth about $ 59 billion. But what the times calls \" hysteria \" behind cryptocurrency successors to bitcoin — others in play include stellar, cardano, and byteball — has some money experts skeptical. \" this is beyond insane, \" one investor says, adding: \" there's absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant fomo [ fear of missing out ], misinformation, and speculation. \" in fact, the times notes the catch-22 of being loaded with non-tangible blockchain currency: if larsen tried to cash out and exchange xrp tokens for dollars, it would probably send the value of the virtual currency down and reduce his wealth. Still, though ripple needs a lot of stars to align to become a major currency player used by big banks, one analyst writes for medium that he expects the company to keep doing well, since \" this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts. \"",

It seems the phone numbers shared by uk adult channel babestation on sky tv were meant for uk callers only. To reach \" one of the babestation girls, \" callers from ireland needed to replace the first numeral of the number with an international dialing code, babestation says. Many, however, failed to do that and were instead connected with residents of the irish town of westport, who were \" aggravated and annoyed \" to be \" getting these calls in the middle of night, \" local politician michael ring tells the irish independent. Ring, who claims residents also received calls from people trying to reach sky tv helplines, says he's asked the commission of communications regulation to force babestation to change its numbers. The commission says it's working to \" identify a solution as soon as possible, \" per the guardian. Babestation, meanwhile, has apologized to both the \" disappointed callers in ireland \" and westport's residents for the \" innocent misunderstanding. \" and \" as a show of support and recognition, \" the company says it will send two of its models to speak to westport locals on thursday, reports ireland's journal. \" we don't want them, \" ring tells the herald.

That would be staying in the upper echelons of the fashion world, where the teen originally from spanish fork, utah, currently resides. The times calls him \" the face of the age. \" new york magazine describes him as \" basically the one direction of male models. \" the new york times goes the distance with \" most hyped male model on the planet. \" he's done campaigns ranging from tom ford to marc jacobs to balmain and was dubbed one of the \" 13 most stylish men in the world right now \" by gq. He's \" social media's favorite male model, \" proclaimed vanity fair ( an assertion backed up by his 2.6 million instagram followers ), and is in a band called the atomics with his three older sisters. Those sisters — starlie cheyenne, 22; daisy clementine, 20; and pyper america, 19 ( all their birth names ) — are all models, and blazed the path. As vanity fair recounts, sister daisy was scouted in 2008, and a then 10-year-old lucky was told they'd be back for him. Two years later he was signed, and in 2012 the siblings were all part of gap's holiday campaign. Now 6-foot-2, smith has a 240-page autobiography ( yes, at 18 ) titled stay golden out nov. 1, and he still makes time to go to church and pray before meals. He's \" pretty grounded, \" he says, with credit going to his \" good, solid family who can take me down a couple of pegs if my ego's getting out of hand. \" ( a mormon millionaire plans a utopia in vermont. )",

        "summary": "It looks like space buffs ' plan to push an aged nasa space probe into a new orbit has come up against a deal-breaker. Weeks after making contact with the international sun-earth explorer-3, or isee-3, the group of citizen scientists has learned the tanks on the spacecraft are apparently empty of nitrogen, the new york times reports. Since the gas is required to fire the thrusters that would alter the probe's trajectory — the group had planned to boot it out of its heliocentric orbit and into one where it could better communicate with earth — it's a massive problem. \" odds are, there is nothing we can do, \" says keith cowing, a leader of the reboot project. \" without that, you don't have a rocket. \" the group fired the thrusters just last week, but when they tried to activate the thrusters yesterday and tuesday they just sputtered. Space.com reports scientists initially thought a \" valve malfunction \" could be at fault, but cowing last night wrote they were instead pinning the blame on a lack of nitrogen, which is needed to push the fuel, called hydrazine, to the thrusters. As for why the thrusters appeared to work last week, that was \" probably the result of residual hydrazine that was already in the system that had pressure, \" says cowing, per space news. He says isee-3 is now operating in science mode, meaning it's sending data back to earth that ' ll be accessible for the next three months or so. After that, it ' ll be so far from us that communicating with it will become cost-prohibitive.",

The louisiana republican suffered life-threatening injuries and has endured lengthy hospitalizations, multiple surgeries, and painful rehabilitation. Scalise was honored before the game and started at second base for republicans, fielding a ground ball and completing the put-out to first on the game's first play. \" it's been a long road to this day, \" scalise tweeted earlier in a day filled with media interviews, accolades, and a capitol hill blood drive to commemorate the donations he received a year ago. Scalise wore a capitol police cap to honor officers who worked the shooting last year, injuring gunman james hodgkinson, who later died. Hodgkinson's social media posts prior to the shooting suggest he targeted the republican baseball team because of his political views. Giving no mention to hodgkinson, scalise pronounced himself \" grateful for the support and prayers \" thursday and added, \" let's play some baseball. \" ( a \" series of miracles \" prevented last year's shooting from being a much greater tragedy. )",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — republicans and democrats put aside the sectarian hostilities that have increasingly defined this town and came together on the baseball diamond thursday, a year after bullets from a would-be mass assassin shook congress to its core. Democrats prevailed 21-5 in the 57th congressional baseball game for charity at nationals park. But the night belonged to house majority whip steve scalise and all who hailed his return after he was shot during a team practice last spring in suburban virginia. The louisiana republican suffered life threatening injuries and has endured lengthy hospitalizations, multiple surgeries and painful rehabilitation. Months removed from struggling to walk, scalise was honored before the game and started at second base for republicans, fielding a ground ball and completing the put-out to first on the game's first play. \" it's been a long road to this day, \" scalise wrote on twitter earlier in a day filled with media interviews, accolades and a capitol hill blood drive to commemorate the donations he received a year ago. Scalise wore a capitol police cap to honor officers who worked the shooting last year, injuring gunman james hodgkinson, who later died. Hodgkinson's social media posts prior to the shooting suggest he targeted the republican baseball team because of his political views. Giving no mention to hodgkinson, scalise pronounced himself \" grateful for the support and prayers \" thursday and added, \" let's play some baseball. \" the house whip's comeback was enough to leave francis kelly bursting with pride in the centerfield seats. \" it's just being an american — terror should not scare us, \" the 41-year-old graphic designer said, sporting a necktie emblazoned with stars and stripes. Still, the outpouring for scalise obscured the daily realities of a capital city still bitterly divided on nearly every major policy debate, including how to regulate the weapons like those wielded on scalise and his fellow republicans",
