But anaheim cops now say those five have been released after evidence shows they acted in self-defense, the los angeles times reports. \" the totality of the evidence, including videos, still pictures, and interviews, paints a pretty clear picture as to who the aggressors were, \" an anaheim police sergeant says. The demonstration, which the chicago tribune says was meant to be an anti-immigration rally, turned violent from the get-go after six kkk members showed up around noon. Witnesses say some of the anti-protesters — who the washington post says numbered in the \" several dozen \" — started kicking a klansman wearing a \" grand dragon \" shirt, and soon the stabbings began, including one by a kkk member using the decorative end of a flagpole. \" [ the counter-protesters ] were so angry, they would have torn these folks limb from limb, \" brian levin, the director of center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university-san bernardino, tells nbc los angeles. Levin, who was there to record the rally for research purposes, says he ended up shielding kkk members until police could get there. \" i was afraid for their lives. \" levin later posted on twitter a video of him asking one of the kkk members: \" how do you feel that a jewish person helped save your life today? \" ( the klansman thanked him. ) \" regardless of an individual or group's beliefs or ideologies, they are entitled to live without the fear of physical violence and have the right, under the law, to defend themselves when attacked, \" a police statement read, per nbc. The seven counter-protesters who remain jailed are being held on charges of assault with a deadly weapon or elder abuse for attacking a klan member older than 65. The three people stabbed were in stable condition at a local hospital.",

When they retested the participants, they found that the group exposed to the bright light tripled their sexual satisfaction scores while the control group's scores stayed roughly the same. The researchers also found that testosterone levels increased in men who had been given the active light treatment from around 2.1 ng/ml to 3.6 ng/ml - but the control group showed no increase.

In an opinion piece for al-jazeera america, harris offers his take on how marijuana bars would give americans more palatable gathering spaces with fewer health risks, creating an \" urban-planning win-win \" and possibly even saving lives. Some highlights: harris points out the 88,000 deaths annually from excessive alcohol use as noted by the cdc and the \" hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity, health care, and property damage \" that the national institutes of health has researched. Citing another nih study, harris says that pot would serve as an acceptable \" substitute medication \" for booze: \" from a public health perspective, every drink we can replace with a toke is a victory. \" there are few places these days that resemble the famous bar from cheers. \" fewer and fewer people have a third place ( not work or home ) where everyone knows their name, \" harris writes. Because so many people have migrated to the suburbs and holed up with their cable tv and internet, not as many people are heading out to congregate. \" these spaces [ would ] promote community integration, friendship, and extrafamilial networks of support, \" harris notes. Although he's optimistic that \" eventually americans will have public places to go and get high with their friends, \" harris thinks government should ease up on strict regulations. \" not one amsterdam-style coffee shop has managed to keep its doors open, \" he writes. \" though owners seem willing to conform to whatever guidelines they're given, so far, no locality wants to be the first to host an american marijuana bar. \" harris also acknowledges some of the logistical hurdles that businesses may have to overcome. \" one problem with weed bars is employees ' right to a smoke-free workplace; even if cops allowed indoor marijuana smoking, no one would be allowed to work there, \" he writes.

Now incidences of guillain-barre are said to have risen in seven countries in tandem with outbreaks of zika, per a study in the new england journal of medicine. The new york times notes that while the cdc remains wary of saying zika can cause gbs ( it simply says gbs is \" strongly associated \" with zika ), this research offers further evidence that zika may indeed be responsible — worrisome news, as about 500 million people in latin america and the caribbean are vulnerable to becoming infected with it. \" it's pretty obvious that in all seven sites there is a clear relationship, \" says lead author dr. Marcos a. Espinal of the pan american health organization. The study found nearly 165,000 cases of zika virus ( some confirmed, some suspected ) between april 2015 and march 2016, as well as almost 1,500 cases of gbs, reported in the brazilian state of bahia, colombia, the dominican republic, el salvador, honduras, suriname, and venezuela. During the weeks of zika outbreaks in these areas, the incidence of gbs cases spiked compared to pre-zika baseline numbers — jumping as much as 877 % in venezuela. Women had a 75 % higher reported incidence rate of zika than men, but men had a gbs incidence rate 28 % higher than women's, and incidence rates also climbed with age, nbc news reports.

Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \" pretty murals \" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called lumos ( yes, after one of her harry potter spells ), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as bulgaria, moldova, and the czech republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \" i recently committed to becoming president of lumos for life, \" writes rowling. \" it is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world. \" click for her full column.",

His hands clutched what appeared to be chicken wire containing him, and his expression was agonised. There would be no lumos – the charity dedicated to closing child institutions and so-called orphanages – if there hadn't first been this picture. I knew the immediate shameful impulse to turn away, to hide the page, not to look. I could try to justify that impulse by saying that i was pregnant at the time, feeling vulnerable and hormonal. The sad truth remains that my instinctive reaction to that picture could stand as a metaphor for the attitude that has enabled the unjustifiable incarceration of 8 million children around this world to take place with little outrage or comment. Ashamed of that reflexive refusal to look, i forced myself to turn back to the picture and read the article. It told of a nightmarish institution where children as young as six were caged most of the day and night. I ripped the article out, and the following day i began writing letters to everybody i could think of with influence in the matter. These efforts led quickly to the establishment of lumos, named for the spell i created in harry potter to bring light to some dark and frightening places. Part of our work in lumos is to shed light on the lives of those millions of children separated from their families for reasons of poverty, disability and discrimination. The shocking truth is that the vast majority of these children have parents that could care for them. They are not orphans. Most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them, or because of a lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs. The minority who do not have parents, or for whom staying at home is not in their best interests, are often placed in institutions because there is no alternative. The idea of any child being taken from their family and locked away, all too often in atrocious conditions, is particularly poignant at this time of year.

        "summary": "With 20 million americans using online dating sites, how can you be sure that your prospective date isn't married? or, say, a mass murderer? new online security services — such as mymatchchecker.com, date check, and the instant national criminal search — are offering background checks on people using the nearly 1,500 dating websites in the united states, reports the new york times. New york and new jersey are the first two states to offer some regulations on internet dating sites, such as requiring sites to post safety tips and to say whether they require background checks of their members. Experts say that many more states will soon follow. Although some sites like true.com insist on background checks for all members, other dating sites say this is a false sense of security because criminal screening databases are imperfect. But with online dating a billion-dollar industry, increasingly government officials and public safety advocates are calling for better safeguards. Failing that, there's always a healthy sense of skepticism: \"don't give up your heart so fast, \" cautions one safety expert.",

Acting president oleksander turchinov ordered troops to be placed on high combat alert. Foreign minister andriy deshchytsya said he had met european and u.s.

For years as the city dug them up ( about 10,000 tons a year ) to continue building or repaving, it paid to haul them to the dump, reports the new york times. No longer. It finally occurred to officials last march to salvage these rare gems of parisian history and sell them to contractors so that they'd have \" a second life, \" say the head of the city maintenance yard that stores them. \" they are cheap and have some charm, \" he tells bloomberg. In september, one enterprising woman bought five tons for $ 215 and set up a souvenir shop of sorts, where her team polishes, weighs, and hand-paints the stones. She sells them online for between $ 60 and $ 160, plus $ 15 to $ 40 in shipping fees. Tourists from as far afield as china and oklahoma have paid for what entrepreneur margaux sainte-lagüe calls enduring little pieces of history.

On tuesday, an appeals court in san francisco approved a $ 25 million settlement reached last year while rejecting an appeal from a florida woman who hoped to opt out of the class-action lawsuit and pursue a separate case against trump, reports nbc news. Sherri simpson, who says she paid $ 19,000 for trump university classes, argued a notice sent to students early in the litigation progress promised they could opt out at the time the notice was sent or after a proposed settlement. But judges said the notice gave \" only one opportunity to opt out. \" they added \" among over 8,000 class members, simpson is the only one advancing this understanding of the notice, \" per politico. The decision also referenced claims that simpson's challenge was politically motivated to hurt the president. Throughout his presidential campaign, trump vowed to fight allegations that students paid up to $ 35,000 for trump university programs based on false promises they'd reveal trump's \" secrets of success, \" per the los angeles times. Though trump quickly agreed to the $ 25 million settlement after his election victory, his lawyers said he'd back out if simpson were granted a trial. Though \" we are disappointed … all of the lurid facts about the fraud won't receive the public hearing they deserve, \" her lawyer says simpson will end her fight so that 4,000 students can receive payments. In what the appeals court calls a \" highly favorable \" deal, students are expected to get 80 % to 90 % of what they paid to the school while it was open from 2005 to 2010.",

        "summary": "King harold ii's death is immortalized in the bayeux tapestry, which shows england's final anglo-saxon king taking an arrow to the eye during the battle of hastings on oct. 14, 1066; norman knights then were said to have hacked him to pieces. Now, a team is tugging on the tapestry's threads to see if that story holds. The same geological survey company that unearthed richard iii under a parking lot will tomorrow ( that's the 948th anniversary of the death ) scan the ground where harold is supposed to be buried in an investigation of an alternate tale: that the king actually survived and lived another four decades as a hermit. That theory was penned in a document called the vita haroldi in the 12th century, and amateur historian peter burke believes it to be true, so much so that he's funding the scan at essex's waltham abbey church. King harold is said to be buried in a tomb at the high altar there, but burke suspects he's actually interred about 45 feet away, near the east wall. \" we have the norman story put through the bayeux tapestry — the english story is a different one, \" he tells the independent. As the telegraph reports, burke hopes the scan will reveal harold's body — and that it will prove to be the remains of an elderly man, indicating the king did indeed regain health and then fled to germany two years later. Should the scan surface \" old man, 6 foot 1, with scarring to his temple and cheek... Then we will need a dna test, \" burke tells culture24. Who would be in the tomb then? the hertfordshire mercury reports harold's wife, edith, could have ided a headless knight as her husband in order to hide the truth.

        "summary": "The \" angst \" travelers feel at overcrowded gates may soon be eased at united airlines terminals, an exec for the airline says. That's because united just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \" passenger pain point, \" as cnbc puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: the number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group ( one of six in total, including pre-boarders ) is announced. \" it's too congested, \" a ua rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, united test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way american, delta, and southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at lax since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per usa today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders ( e.g., families with young kids, service members ), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \" the boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved, \" another ua rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

        "summary": "President trump knew that mike flynn had misled vp mike pence about his contacts with the russian ambassador weeks before pence was informed, it emerged tuesday as the national security adviser's resignation continued to rock the administration. Pence spokesman marc lotter tells the washington post that the vice president \" became aware of incomplete information \" on feb. 9 following a post story on the issue. The white house, however, says trump and other top administration officials were briefed on the justice department's concerns about flynn at least two weeks earlier. \" it's not that he was being left out. It was a legal review, \" an administration source tells cnn. In other developments: the fbi interviewed flynn in late january after it warned the trump administration that he could be blackmailed, the new york times reports. If authorities determine that he lied during that interview, he could face felony charges. In an interview with the daily caller hours before his resignation, flynn insisted there were \" no lines crossed \" in his conversation with russian ambassador sergey kislyak. \" it wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out, \" flynn said, referring to former president obama's expulsion of russian diplomats in december. \" it was basically, ' look, i know this happened. We ' ll review everything. ' i never said anything such as, ' we're going to review sanctions, ' or anything like that. \" legal experts tell politico that flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the fbi, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer mark zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the defense intelligence agency, flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like russia would be under surveillance. Republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the flynn affair, but he still has his defenders, including rush limbaugh. On tuesday, the radio host described pressure on flynn as a \" political assassination \" by the media, the hill reports. \" they think they have blood in the water, they've got a scalp, and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get trump, \" he said. The bbc reports that pence and other top us officials will be in europe later this week to reassure american allies — though nato allies will apparently be untroubled by the departure of flynn, who was seen as \" a bizarre and destabilizing appointment. \"",

The two big developments: crew member: ship maitre'd antonello tievoli told the court that he asked the captain to sail close to the tuscan island of giglio because tievoli had family there, reports ap. Schettino did so on jan. 6 but didn't think he got close enough. He ordered his crew to make a closer pass the following week, and that's when the ship hit the rocks and sank. Lover testifies: domnica cemortan, a 26-year-old moldovan dancer, confirmed to the court, reluctantly, that she was indeed schettino's lover, reports the bbc. The two dined together before the crash, and she said the captain asked the crew to slow down so he could have dessert before taking the helm for the pass-by of giglio. Cemortan accompanied him to the bridge and was with him when the ship crashed. She had two memorable quotes today: \" when you are someone's lover, no one asks you for a ticket, \" and, outside court, \" today, i died a second time. \"",

The michigan teen uploaded her first video two years ago. Since then, she's uploaded about a dozen videos showing off all she can do with her quirky mouth feature, including licking her nose, touching her tongue to her elbow, and, with a little help from her hand, even licking her own eyeball. Speaking to barcroft tv, her mom says they realized lewis'tongue was unusually long when she was about 10, and notes that her daughter comes from a long line of long-tongued people: her great-grandfather, grandmother, and mother share the trait. While lewis is psyched about the hundreds of thousands of views her youtube videos have amassed, boyfriend tim hegedus notes, \" it's the internet, so there's a lot of weird people there. I've seen some comments that make me uncomfortable. \" more fame could come: the length of lewis'tongue might just be enough to get her into guinness world records. While she hasn't had it officially measured by the guinness folks, she estimates her tongue measures at least 4 inches, which mashable reports could be enough to beat the 3.97-inch-long tongue ( as measured \" from its tip to the middle of the closed top lip \" ) currently holding the record.",

Oliver's counterproposal: buy every american a waffle iron. Says oliver: \" because this waffle iron plan will cost less, it ' ll do nearly as much to keep out immigrants and drugs, it won't harm our relationship with our third-largest trading partner, ( and ) if it is racist it's only toward belgians... \"",

        "summary": "The united nations ' cultural body is on the trail of christopher columbus ' flagship — and it says the wreck that an expedition identified as the santa maria earlier this year is a different, much younger ship. As predicted by authorities in haiti, unesco experts say there is \" indisputable proof \" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the bbc. Unesco says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of columbus ' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. Unesco says it believes the wreck may lie \" under coastal sediment \" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area. Marine archaeologist barry clifford, who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago, says columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site, the independent reports. \" the lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the santa maria, \" he says. ( columbus wrote about the 1492 sinking of the santa maria in his journal, but one historian believes that the explorer lied about the ship's fate as part of a spy plot. )",

According to an article written by the agency's senior in-house historian, the cia purposely held back information from the warren commission, politico reports. John mccone, then the agency's director, apparently failed to tell the commission about agency plots to murder fidel castro ( including ones involving the mafia ). So the commission never knew to ask whether lee harvey oswald had cuban comrades dead-set on retaliating against the us president. The commission famously concluded that oswald acted alone, spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving castro, the mafia, the cia, the soviets, and even president lyndon b. Johnson. Seems the white house nudged mccone along: he \" shared the administration's interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [ the ] cia in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough us response against the perpetrators of the assassination, \" reads the article, which was published in a cia internal magazine in 2013 and declassified ( with 15 redactions ) last fall.

Cote, who presided over a non-jury trial, said the fhfa was entitled to judgment against nomura and the royal bank of scotland plc ( rbs.l ), which underwrote some of the $ 2 billion in mortgage-backed securities, in light of misstatements they made in offering documents. \" the offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans, \" the judge wrote in a 361-page decision. \" the magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous. \""

Just two years ago, when the media frenzy was at a fever pitch following the shooting death of trayvon martin, taaffe made an aggressive showing in front of the cameras, defending his neighbor and saying \" [ zimmerman ] became the victim, \" as reported by news 13. Now, as a grand jury hears a case this week to decide whether zimmerman will face federal charges for violating trayvon's civil rights, taaffe — who testified before the grand jury yesterday — is saying that zimmerman was probably in the wrong and just might be a racist after all, based on a mysterious phone call he received shortly after martin's death, raw story reports. Taaffe didn't recognize the number, and the caller, who said his name was \" george, \" made a racially charged comment about martin, taaffe says. At first taaffe thought it was a prank — \" people knew my phone number, so it could've been anybody, \" he tells wftv. He's not sure if it was zimmerman, but he finally told investigators about it in june to make \" amends to the martin family \" after his own two children and a brother died recently, and to mend things with his surviving child, who was \" ostracized \" for his zimmerman advocacy. ( taaffe's somewhat-confusing explanation of all this is shown in the video here. ) he now thinks zimmerman racially profiled trayvon, saying, \" in my heart of hearts, i do believe that. \" even more bizarre: his own reported racist rantings and criminal rap sheet, according to a 2013 mother jones article.",

The outrage stemmed not from the fact that you intended to be racist, but that you seem so utterly clueless that what you were saying was unacceptable. 2. Blackface is a \"lesser known theatrical term \"? don't be condescending. The people who took offense to your comments knew exactly what blackface is, and the entire ugly racist history behind it. On the contrary, you sound like the ignorant one for seriously trying to downplay that ugly history as just some cute theater factoid. 3. So blackface \"is not racist, \" but \"is instead part of a racist history in this country. \" i … i won't even respond to this because it's literally nonsense. I honestly don't even know what he's getting at. 4. \"i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage … \" let's pause you right there. Who in god's name are you that you have the right to tell someone that they have abandoned their entire race? it's bad enough when conservatives of color get this from people of their own race, but now it's apparently a racial elimination free-for-all.

Howard schneider in 2014 — but, instead, she came in to the procedure room to find her daughter \" face-first \" on the bloody floor with scratches, bruises, and all eight of her front teeth extracted. When brandi motley couldn't get an attorney to take her case, she \" turned her minivan into a rolling billboard attack on schneider, \" abc news reports. Then, in april 2015, she posted about her experience on facebook, and the post went viral. She found other parents who said they'd had similar experiences — they allege schneider, who catered to children in low-income families, performed unnecessary procedures, harming their kids in the process, in order to collect millions in medicaid funds — and they started protesting outside schneider's clinic. Ultimately, the attorney who'd at first refused the case took on 131 individual lawsuits against schneider, settling 104 of them thus far, but schneider continues to insist he's done nothing wrong. After the protests had been going on for weeks, schneider shut down his clinic after more than 50 years of practicing dentistry, and voluntarily gave up his dental license — which meant he avoided a full investigation by the dental board. In november 2015, he was arrested and charged with 11 counts of medicaid provider fraud; he pleaded not guilty and may go to trial, although his defense team is seeking to have the 78-year-old declared mentally incompetent in order to avoid a trial, news 4 jax reports. In may, usa today reported that some parents accuse schneider of going so far as to choke his patients into unconsciousness rather than using anesthetic.",

Kimberly pappas, 26, allegedly gave birth in her office bathroom on march 31, put the baby in one bag, placenta in another, and placed them in her desk. Her sister, cassandra pappas — who worked in the same office — says kimberly texted her asking for a set of fresh clothes and looked really sick. \" she said she had an accident, \" says cassandra. Kimberly said she \" had a heavy period, \" says a first responder, but she later said she'd miscarried and put the baby in her desk, hometown life reports. A medical examiner says the baby lived for several minutes before dying of asphyxiation — but admits cpr efforts may have created a false positive by putting air in the newborn's lungs. Other evidence still indicates homicide, the examiner testified. Kimberly's attorneys argued that she was in shock at the time and may have been confused if the baby was born \" flaccid, \" or not moving. But apparently she'd always denied being pregnant: \" she just said she was gaining weight, \" says cassandra. Kimberly now faces arraignment on aug. 31, people reports: \" then we can... See if there might be some sort of a resolution short of trial, \" says one of her lawyers. \" but i don't know where it's going at this point in time. \"",

Fischer hopes to see mary lee again, but is ok if that never happens. \"i feel like she's done so much, it's hard to ask for anything else, \" he says. \"for any individual shark, she's undone more of the damage from jaws than any shark in history, and she's the most famous shark in history. \" mary lee was 40 or 50 years old when first tagged, so fischer figures she has another 20 years of life.

A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is marden henge, which sits a few miles north of stonehenge in wiltshire. National geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The guardian writes that the henge was \" far larger than the avebury or stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use. \" but over the ages marden henge's berms have \" slumped \" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking stonehenge. Until now. Jim leary of the university of reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations ( he worked at the site in 2010, too ) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \" insane, utterly unsustainable \" construction boom that led to marden henge and four other nearby neolithic monuments, including stonehenge. \" not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places, \" says leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside marden henge, per the bbc; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \" for all the attention that has been lavished on stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that marden was where it was really at during the neolithic, \" he says.
