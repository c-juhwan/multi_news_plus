        "summary": "Former acting attorney general sally yates on monday testified before a senate subcommittee looking into the trump campaign's alleged ties to russia, and analysts say she provided some key information about the departure of national security adviser michael flynn — and raised some new questions for the white house. A roundup of coverage: the new york times lists six takeaways from the hearing. Chief among them: a lot of people, including barack obama and chris christie as well as yates, had reservations about flynn becoming national security adviser. \" to state the obvious: you don't want your national security adviser compromised with the russians, \" yates said in the hearing's most-quoted line. She said she warned that flynn could be open to blackmail because he had lied about his contacts with the russian ambassador. Politico lists several key moments from the hearing, including yates ' and former director of national intelligence james clapper's denial that they were ever anonymous sources for news reports about trump campaign ties to russia. Another was when yates disclosed that she had to learn about trump's travel ban from media reports. Another takeaway: some republicans, including ted cruz, are still focusing on hillary clinton's emails, with cruz asking clapper a hypothetical question about email forwarding that the times calls a \" thinly veiled \" reference to huma adebin and anthony weiner. The washington post notes that the hearing didn't explain why the white house waited 18 days to fire flynn after learning that he had lied to the administration, and it is unclear what administration officials did with the information yates gave them before she was fired for not defending trump's travel ban. Trump attacked the testimony in a series of tweets, which cnn considers a sign that yates may have \" put another dent in the administration's defenses. \" \" sally yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today, \" he tweeted. \" she said nothing but old news! \" the hill notes that there was no \" smoking gun \" from the hearing that is expected to damage trump. His most controversial moment of the day was a tweet saying people should \" ask sally yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to w.h. Counsel, \" which some trump critics called witness intimidation. The guardian reports that social media poked fun at trump after his twitter header banner was briefly altered to include one of his own tweets: \" director clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ' no evidence ' of collusion w/ russia and trump. \"",

The new york times gives some american perspective, saying the distance covered \" is about the equivalent of making the long and annoying \" round-trip drive from los angeles to san francisco, \" with a few dozen more miles thrown in for rest stops and food. \" the child was stopped in broken hill due to a dislodged bumper, which was dragging on the ground. Police tell the aap the damage suggests he was involved in some sort of accident along the way. \" he'd taken the family car, \" police said monday. \" his parents reported him missing immediately after he left home \" shortly after 11am friday. The child is in the custody of his parents, but will likely face charges including driving without a license and not paying for gas; sky news reports he fueled up around 6am in cobar. As for how he managed to not raise suspicions for such a long period, sky news reports the 6-foot-tall boy looks much older than 12. Indeed, the manager of the gas station the child stopped at thought he looked \" 19 or 20. \"",

            "Plenty of churches contain relics of saints, but not many of those relics were found in excavations from sixth-century churches. Archaeologists at a medieval fortress site in burgas, bulgaria, found a lead vessel, which contains some of the ashes from the alleged grave of john the apostle, in a reliquary that dates to the sixth century c.e. The reliquary, which was once part of an early christian basilica, is named for saint john the theologian, who is considered one of jesus ' apostles. The vessel, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses. Milen nikolov, director of the burgas regional museum of history, said that early christians would have believed the relic had healing properties. John the apostle's grave in turkey was also a pilgrimage site for early christians seeking healing, ancient origins reports. Nikolov said the reliquary was \" one of the most important discoveries \" in the museum's history. In addition to the relic, the archaeologists also uncovered a 10th century bulgarian royal seal at the fortress site. Meghan demaria",

The discovery of the lead tube containing ashes from the grave of john the apostle, who is known as st.

            "Plenty of churches contain relics of saints, but not many of those relics were found in excavations from sixth-century churches. Archaeologists at a medieval fortress site in burgas, bulgaria, found a lead vessel, which contains some of the ashes from the alleged grave of john the apostle, in a reliquary that dates to the sixth century c.e. The reliquary, which was once part of an early christian basilica, is named for saint john the theologian, who is considered one of jesus ' apostles. The vessel, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses. Milen nikolov, director of the burgas regional museum of history, said that early christians would have believed the relic had healing properties. John the apostle's grave in turkey was also a pilgrimage site for early christians seeking healing, ancient origins reports. Nikolov said the reliquary was \" one of the most important discoveries \" in the museum's history. In addition to the relic, the archaeologists also uncovered a 10th century bulgarian royal seal at the fortress site. Meghan demaria",
            "Ashes from the grave of john the apostle, one of the twelve apostles of jesus christ, have been discovered in a lead tube reliquary by bulgarian archaeologists during excavations of the ancient and medieval port of burgos ( also known as poros ) on cape foros in today's black sea city of burgas. The discovery of the lead tube containing ashes from the grave of john the apostle, who is known as st. John the theologian in bulgarian ( eastern ) orthodox christianity, located in the ancient city of ephesus in anatolia, today's turkey, has been made during the 2014 excavations of the fortress of burgos ( or poros ) on cape foros in burgas but was announced only on wednesday, march 25, 2015, by milen nikolov, director of the burgas regional museum of history, at a special press conference. He has also announced other intriguing finds such as the discovery of a late antiquity latrine, also found at burgos ( poros ), and the discovery of a 10th century bulgarian royal seal from the rusocastro fortress. The structures at the ancient and medieval fortress and port of burgos ( poros ) which were excavated in 2014 include an early christian basilica from the 6th century ad, a building complex from the 5th-6th century ad, and a roman villa from the 3rd century ad. The john the apostle reliquary was found in the 6th century basilica. \"probably a pilgrim from the foros peninsula ( cape ) went on a pilgrimage to ephesus, and came back here with this relic which was then donated to the basilica on foros, \" nikolov has explained,"

        "summary": "The study on the austrian find calls it a \" sunken ship of the desert \" and an \" exotic animal. \" what exactly was found in a cellar containing centuries-old trash during excavations for a planned shopping center in tulln: the full skeleton of a 17th-century camel. That a complete skeleton was found is unique, but the presence of camel bones is less so: the ottoman army used the creatures for transportation and, in some cases, food, and their bones have been found in the region. But the completeness of the skeleton shows \" the animal was not killed and then butchered, \" says archaeozoologist and study author alfred galik in a press release. He suggests it may have been traded or left behind by the troops, possibly following their siege of vienna in 1683, reports the bbc. The locals \" did not exploit this alien animal \" for food upon its death, as the ottoman troops \" certainly would have done, \" write the authors in the study, published in plos one. \" exploitation of camel flesh especially in times of need was absolutely necessary, \" and the regularity with which that happened is \" a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general. \" what researchers were able to glean from this find: the male camel was the hybrid offspring of a female dromedary and male bactrian camel and probably castrated, which would have made him easier to handle. Crossbreeding, which was not unusual for the time, made for larger animals that \" were especially suited for military use, \" galik explains. To wit, the study points to bone defects that indicate the animal was harnessed and ridden, reports the bbc. ( oil workers recently made a big find in siberia. )",

As with most debates on climate change — particularly when talking about a single weather event — the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: wrong question: did climate change cause harvey? that's not the right question, writes dino grandoni at the washington post. \" the better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: does climate change make storms like harvey more likely? \" this is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below.

Too ' fussy ': david leonhardt at the new york times thinks \" it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather. \" the evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions.

It was not immediately clear whether trump meant the allied military operation would extend beyond an initial nighttime round of missile strikes. Trump did not provide details on the joint us-british-french attack, but it was expected to include barrages of cruise missiles launched from outside syrian airspace. He described the main aim as establishing \" a strong deterrent \" against chemical weapons use. The syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. French president emmanuel macron confirmed the attack, saying it was launched against a \" clandestine chemical arsenal \" run by syria's government, the ap reports. Macron says france's \" red line has been crossed \" after a suspected chemical attack last week in the syrian town of douma. The us decision to strike marked trump's second order to attack syria; he authorized a barrage of tomahawk cruise missiles to hit a single syrian airfield in april 2017 in retaliation for assad's use of sarin gas against civilians.",

So reports unicef in a global analysis that finds girls on average spend 40 % more time on household chores than do boys, and that this amounts to 160 million more hours of work every day. The gender divide starts by age 5, with girls between the ages of 5 and 9 devoting 30 % more time on this unpaid work than boys, and widens to 50 % more time for girls between the ages of 10 and 14. The bbc reports that the findings, which include data on violence, child marriage, education, and female genital mutilation, is being formally released on oct. 11, the un's international day of the girl. Chores range from cooking and cleaning the house to taking care of family members young and old and collecting water and firewood, reports new york magazine. \" as a result, girls sacrifice important opportunities to learn, grow, and just enjoy their childhood, \" says unicef's principal gender adviser, anju malhotra. She adds that the unequal distribution of unpaid labor perpetuates gender stereotypes and in some countries is shown to increase girls ' risk of sexual violence. The countries with the highest gender gap are burkina faso, yemen, and somalia, and girls in somalia average 26 hours a week on chores, more than any other children anywhere.

        "summary": "The first name on your family tree — in fact, on the family tree of every living creature — should technically be luca. As the new york times explains, the acronym stands for the last universal common ancestor, an organism that lived about 4 billion years ago and became the ancestor of all life forms. Now, a new study in nature microbiology provides what its authors say is evidence that settles the debate about where this first life began: near hydrothermal vents, like those found near deep-sea volcanoes. Researchers at germany's heinrich heine university say their genetic sleuthing has revealed that luca was tailor-made to live in such an environment — it was essentially \" a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen, \" in the words of science. To figure out this genetic profile, the scientists examined 6 million genes associated with two simple and ancient forms of life, bacteria and archaea. After identifying genes that were shared between the two groups, they whittled the figure down to 355 gene families that met their criteria for having originated in luca, their joint ancestor. \"it was flabbergasting to us that we found as many as we did, \" says lead researcher william martin. This smaller group of genes allowed them to create a snapshot of sorts of luca, one hailed as \" remarkable \" by a ucla evolutionary biologist. But don't expect the debate to end. The study \"is all very interesting, but it has nothing to do with the actual origin of life, \" cambridge chemist john sutherland tells the times.

The five-year cyber espionage campaign is still going on, according to isight, which dubbed the operation \" sandworm team \" because it found references to the \" dune \" science fiction series in the software code used by the hackers. The operation used a variety of ways to attack the targets over the years, isight said, adding that the hackers began only in august to exploit a vulnerability found in most versions of windows. Isight said it told microsoft corp about the bug and held off on disclosing the problem so the software maker had time to fix it. A microsoft spokesman said the company plans to roll out an automatic update to affected versions of windows on tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the russian government, nato, the eu or the ukraine government. Researchers with dallas-based isight said they believed the hackers are russian because of language clues in the software code and because of their choice of targets. \" your targets almost certainly have to do with your interests. We see strong ties to russian origins here, \" said john hultquist, head of isight's cyber espionage practice. The firm plans to release a 16-page report on sandworm team to its clients on tuesday. While technical indicators do not indicate whether the hackers have ties to the russian government, hultquist said he believed they were supported by a nation state because they were engaging in espionage, not cyber crime. For example, in december 2013, nato was targeted with a malicious document on european diplomacy. Several regional governments in the ukraine and an academic working on russian issues in the united states were sent tainted emails",
            "For months this summer, unidentified hackers used a previously unknown hole in microsoft corp.'s windows operating system to spy on north atlantic treaty organization and ukrainian officials, according to an investigation by a u.s. Cybersecurity company. Microsoft released a patch for the bug on tuesday.

But while most of social media is beaming at his newest honor, scottish author irvine welsh, who wrote the novel trainspotting, isn't terribly pleased, the ap reports. Welsh spent much of thursday morning on twitter retweeting posts that trashed dylan's win, and tweeting: \" i ' m a dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies. \" his main beef appears to be the separation of a metaphorical church and state — in this case, songs and lit — that he thinks should exist, adding, \" if you're a ' music ' fan, look it up in the dictionary. Then ' literature '. Then compare and contrast. \" other takes on dylan's new laureate status: the wall street journal lists feedback from major authors, from the gushing — salman rushdie writes on twitter, \" from orpheus to faiz, song &amp; poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice \" — to the eyerolling, including satirical writer gary shteyngart's take: \" i totally get the nobel committee. Reading books is hard. \" jay perini gives a thumbs-up at cnn, noting how dylan's songs \" speak to our deepest concerns \" and how he's \" filled our heads with language that both interprets and transforms the realities we confront. \" at the guardian, richard williams looks at whether music and literature can actually be successfully linked ( in terms of a nobel prize ), and he breaks it down line by line to show the \" profound resonance \" of dylan's lyrics. Robert chalmers makes the slightly uncomfortable observation for gq that \" everything would be so much more simple if he were dead, \" as dylan would have ascended to legendary status. But chalmers still jumps on the pro-dylan bandwagon, noting, \" his voice may, like the havana cigars and bourbon to which it is often lazily compared, be an acquired taste, but dylan is responsible, as much as billie holiday, for reinventing the whole style of popular singing. \" meanwhile, a naysayer singing the black \" eating crow \" blues: alex shephard, who wrote last week for the new republic that \" bob dylan 100 percent is not going to win.

His mother seconded that claim, adding \" evidence could have been planted \" in her son's trailer. Bud runion posted an ad on craigslist on jan. 19 looking to buy a 1966 ford mustang convertible, like the one he purchased after returning from the vietnam war. \" he said, ' you can't take money with you when you're gone, ' \" his daughter says. \" you might as well spend and enjoy it. \" police now say towns — who has a wife and young daughter and was recently fired from a landscaping company — answered the ad with the intention of robbing the couple, who set out from their home in marietta on thursday. A cellphone used to contact them was traced to towns, who police say doesn't own a mustang, cbs news reports. In marietta, the runions are remembered as charitable people, who restored bicycles for kids and donated food, household supplies, and coats to the poor.",

The working theory is that wet springs followed by warm summers in asia prompted gerbil populations to soar, and that within a few years plague bacteria would show up in harbor cities in europe, sweeping the continent from there. \" if we're right, we ' ll have to rewrite that part of history, \" a researcher tells the bbc. \" suddenly we could sort out a problem, \" the researcher continues. \" why did we have these waves of plagues in europe? we originally thought it was due to rats and climatic changes in europe, but now we know it goes back to central asia. \" next up: sequencing plague bacteria from skeletons across europe.

        "summary": "Always hoped you're mom's favorite? a new study out of purdue university finds that the favorite child is actually more prone to be depressed as an adult, researchers report in the journal of gerontology: social sciences. Looking at 725 adult children from 309 families in the within-family differences study — a longitudinal project documenting various aspects of relationships between parents and their adult children — they say that depressive symptoms were most common in the adult children who claimed to be emotionally closer to their mother than their siblings, reports medical news today. That also held true for \" the children with whom their mothers had the greatest conflict, and in whom the mothers were most disappointed, \" write the authors. Interestingly, the study found no difference between male and female children, but it did find a racial disparity, notes medical daily. Adult black children felt their mother's disappointment more acutely than their white counterparts. Researchers hypothesize that sibling rivalry may be behind the depression, meaning more attention or support from mom doesn't necessarily beat out the negative attention from jealous siblings. Or that the favorites are more often asked to help the aging mother, which is its own source of stress. ( the adult children in the study had mothers who were 65 to 75 when interviewed. ) and yet a third possibility is posed by bustle: a mother's attention may naturally drift toward the weakest or most sensitive child, thus her favoritism doesn't necessarily cause depression. Researchers plan to look at whether similar results play out with fathers, and whether it's possible to predict favoritism. ( one study finds that young kids in religious households are less willing to share stickers. )",

        "summary": "In a new vanity fair essay, monica lewinsky reflects on her scandal with former president clinton 20 years ago, opening with a chance encounter in late 2017 that rattled her. While at a manhattan restaurant, she ran into none other than kenneth starr, the special investigator who turned her into a household name in 1998. This, surprisingly, was the first time lewinsky had ever met him, and she describes his demeanor as \" somewhere between avuncular and creepy. \" he asked multiple times if she was \" doing ok \" and kept touching her arm and elbow, \" which made me uncomfortable. \" then lewinsky told him, in what she later realized was an attempt to elicit an apology, \"though i wish i had made different choices back then, i wish that you and your office had made different choices, too. \" starr didn't apologize, however. He merely said, \" i know. It was unfortunate. \" the anecdote precedes lewinsky's revelation that she was diagnosed with ptsd several years ago, and she suggests the nation suffered a similar kind of trauma. \" both clinically and observationally, something fundamental changed in our society in 1998, and it is changing again as we enter the second year of the trump presidency in a post-cosby-ailes-o'reilly-weinstein-spacey-whoever-is-next world, \" she writes. The nation lost its \" capacity for mercy, measure, and perspective, \" and bitter partisan differences \" settled in. \" lewinsky adds that while she has previously described her relations with clinton as consensual, she has come to realize that assessment is \" complicated, \" given the \" power imbalances \" at play. She also reveals that a leader of the #metoo movement expressed a sentiment in a private exchange that \" undid \" her: \" i ' m sorry you were so alone. \" ( read the full essay. )",

And while it's big news in jersey, andrews isn't exactly a household name nationally. Still, the washington post observes that he's got a legislative track record remarkable in its own way: over 23 years, not one of the 646 pieces of legislation andrews authored has become law. All the more impressive is that no representative has introduced more bills than him in that span. Sure, most bills fail in congress, but \" by those numbers, andrews would be america's least successful lawmaker of the past two decades, \" writes david fahrenthold. Andrews, described as a \" semi-liberal back-bencher, \" defends himself by saying that modern lawmaking these days is done through massive pieces of legislation, not through individual bills. By his own reckoning, andrews estimates that 110 of his ideas have become law in that fashion. If he wants to eliminate the goose egg, however, maybe he can rename a post office in his final two weeks?",

A local scientist had a theory, she explained wednesday at the annual meeting of the european geosciences union: that it had something to do with the tirpitz. The 820-foot battleship was the largest in hitler's navy, and the bbc reports it spent much of wwii anchored and hiding along norway's coast, including in kåfjord, where hartl observed the tree-ring anomaly. But then allied forces found it, and that's when the trees suffered, believes hartl. The nazi ship released chlorosulphuric acid as a sort of \" chemical fog \" to try to cloak it from aerial enemy forces, and hartl now believes the acid caused damage to the trees ' needles. \" if trees don't have needles they can't photosynthesize and they can't produce biomass, \" she explains, noting recovery can be a multi-year process as pine trees can retain their needles for as long as seven years. And that jibes with what she found: in one case, a tree had no growth for nine years and took three decades to revert to \" normal growth. \" near where the ship was stationed all the trees she studied were affected, with more than 60 % not growing at all in 1945. She found the impact on the rings diminished with distance, with trees about 2.5 miles away starting to be unaffected. As for the tirpitz's ploy, it didn't work: it was ultimately sunk.

        "summary": "Firefighters at disney world were warned to stop feeding alligators two months before a gator killed 2-year-old lane graves, according to employee emails. Emails from employees of reedy creek emergency services — which operates inside the park — show firefighters had been feeding at least one of two gators apparently living in a pond near their fire station, less than a mile from where lane was killed, reports the orlando sentinel. One alligator was believed to be four or five feet long, and the other was a juvenile. In one email to the fire station's commanders, a communications rep said an alligator had been spotted near the station where communications staff parked their cars, and some \" expressed concern of becoming alligator food.... ( c ) ould you ask your crews to stop feeding the gator. \" a reedy creek dispatcher later complained about two gators in the parking lot. \" they are not docile gators, they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them, \" he wrote. \" it's getting uncomfortable. \" a reedy creek district administrator says firefighters received \" just a talking to \" — though feeding gators is illegal in florida. It's not clear whether these gators have any connection to lane's death. The administrator is skeptical because they would have had \" to travel across a couple roadways \" to get to the seven seas lagoon near the grand floridian resort &amp; spa, where the june 14 incident took place. Still, notes the washington post, trying to avoid such attacks is \" one reason it is illegal to feed alligators in florida. \" the resort area has since added signs warning people about feeding them, reports people. ( the june attack was the result of a \" perfect storm \" of circumstances. )",

Ian hawes is the 25-year-old behind dinnerwithtrump.org, a site not affiliated with trump's campaign and that offers an exciting opportunity, if you're a trump fan: a chance to win tickets to a trump \" fundraising event, \" complete with flight and hotel stay. That contest site, in addition to other fundraising efforts hawes has made — including nearly $ 110,000 in facebook ads, per federal records — has so far brought in $ 1.1 million from more than 21,000 donors, hawes says. The issue: donors say they thought this fundraising effort was part of trump's campaign, though the fine print on the site notes it's simply giving away two tickets to a \" sponsor-selected fundraising evening event \" with trump in attendance. \" i feel ripped off and taken advantage of. … this is robbery, \" says one donor who ponied up $ 256 to hawes ' american horizons pac, thinking she was donating directly to trump's camp. Hawes denies he's pulling one over on anyone, noting that interested parties can enter the dinner contest without donating — though politico notes a \" double your chances \" promotion is offered via multiple entries if someone contributes — and that the pac will refund donations to anyone who asks for one. Plus, he adds, trump's campaign has never told him to cease and desist using trump's name. The \" dinner with the donald \" site isn't hawes ' only moneymaker scheme: he's also launched crookedhillary2016.org — \" to fight crooked hillary's campaign of lies \" — and has registered imwithtrump.org, though that's not live yet.

        "summary": "The teenager accused of killing three people at a house party near seattle bought his ar-15-style rifle so recently he had to study the instruction manual before the rampage, police say. According to court documents, 19-year-old allen ivanov has told police that he bought the ruger firearm just a week ago and carried out the shooting because he was angry that the \" dream girl \" he split up with two months ago didn't want to get back together with him, nbc news reports. Investigators say ivanov has told them that on friday night, he bought another magazine for the gun after leaving his job at an apple store early. He drove to the party in the suburb of mukilteo around 10pm and looked through a window. After spotting his ex with another man, he returned to the car to study the rifle's instructions. Around midnight, he allegedly returned to the party and opened fire. Cops say ivanov killed his ex-girlfriend, anna bui, as well as partygoers jake long and jordan ebner, all 19 years old. An 18-year-old victim was seriously injured. Ivanov, who fled after the shooting and was arrested more than 100 miles away, is being held without bail on charges including first-degree murder, komo reports. Investigators say the teen's recent posts on social media suggest the murders were planned. Tim leary, a lawyer hired by his parents, tells the seattle times it worries him that ivanov could buy the ar-15 when he is too young to buy beer. The fact that he had to read the manual \" speaks volumes to his youth and inexperience and highlights the lethality of the weapon involved, \" he says. ( the family of the ar-15's inventor says he'd be \" sickened \" by his gun's use. )",

        "summary": "Kathryn bigelow's detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 motor city riots. Based on real events, the film reunites bigelow with screenwriter mark boal, both of the oscar-winning film the hurt locker. It's got a strong 89 % \" fresh \" rating at rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \" bigelow drills down into one of american history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness \" in what \" feels like her timeliest movie yet, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post. It's \" daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing. \" and \" in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental. \" \" it's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is, \" writes lindsey bahr at the ap, calling detroit \" a well-made and evocative film \" jam-packed with \" stomach-churning horror. \" she argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \" maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with detroit is the point. \" chris klimek says detroit is \" maddeningly imperfect but still honorable, \" citing \" lightly fictionalized \" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \" for maximum outrage. \" this is \" messy work, even when it's done in good faith, \" he writes at npr. He applauds john boyega, previously of the force awakens. Radiating a \" denzel-like calm, \" he shows \" he's a bonafide movie star, \" klimek writes. Peter howell's main gripe is that the film \" tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. \" but detroit still makes for \" urgent viewing, \" he writes at the toronto star. Why? \" the injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, \" when \" a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police. \"",

When you can breathe again, you ' ll want to take quick action to ensure that you deal with your newfound millions safely and effectively. At cnn, steve almasy offers a checklist: first, sign the ticket. You don't want to risk losing it, or having a \" friend \" claim it. While you're at it, you might want to take a selfie with the ticket, then drop it in a safe deposit box. Then, seek out financial experts, but not too many — you want to keep the news quiet as long as possible. \" start with one experienced attorney and look for a seasoned certified financial planner, \" almasy writes. Big question: is there any way you can legally remain anonymous? if you live in south carolina or a handful of other states, the answer is yes, but generally you ' ll have a tough time hiding. You might want to hire a pr person. In fact, you might want to slip out of the country until the hubbub over the prize has died down.

Republican bob turner leads democrat david weprin by 47 % to 41 %, with 7 % still undecided, public policy polling finds. Turner's got a 32-point lead among independents, and he's even got 29 % of democrats behind him, leaving weprin with less than 60 % support in his own party. The poll ties turner's success to anti-obama sentiment in the area, but the race is also taking a turn for the nasty: thinkprogress reports that the gop blanketed the district with a flier portraying a mosque rising from the ashes of ground zero, alongside images of weprin and obama, with weprin quoted as saying, \" i support the right of the mosque to build. \" meanwhile, politico leaked details of a nasty 1986 custody battle between weprin and his ex-wife, in which weprin is described as \" heedless \" of his toddler's son's welfare. And while weprin is \" something ( well ) short of a star candidate, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post, the whole race could soon be a moot point: many expect the district to disappear in redistricting.",

        "summary": "Court rulings in pennsylvania and new jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone ( yet ) had to legally assume this burden: in the 2013 new jersey appellate case, the \" remote texter \" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend — who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle — was driving when she texted him, the aba journal reports. And in the pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver — it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the legal intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The new jersey and pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: certain conditions must be met, such as knowing ( or having good reason to believe ) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \" special relationship \" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters ( including new york's controversial \" textalyzer \" bill ), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \" people often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges, \" a university of south carolina law professor tells vocativ. \" the same used to be true of drunk driving... These legal developments could signal that a similar change in thinking is underway regarding distracted driving. \" ( jenny mccarthy's son called the cops for her texting-while-driving transgression. )",

            "Mountain city — the johnson county sheriff's department arrested two men on first-degree murder charges tuesday morning, completing an intensive, weeklong search for the killers of billy clay payne jr., 36, and his girlfriend billie jean hayworth, 23, while leaving the couple's 6-month-old child alive in his mother's arms. Sheriff mike reece said marvin e. \"buddy \" potter jr., 60, 727 hospital road, and jamie lynn curd, 38, 2358 pleasant valley road, were taken into custody without incident. The sheriff said the motive for the killings of the young couple was \"senseless and stupid. \" potter was angry about internet and telephone communications between the couple and his daughter. Reece said the arrests were the culmination of an investigation by his department and the tennessee bureau of investigation in which officers interviewed between 150 and 170 people. He said potter and curd were among the list of suspects at the start of the investigation and as more and more people were interviewed some suspects dropped off the list, but potter and curd kept returning. Finally, information gleaned from the interviews led to the department interviewing potter and curd with a polygraph. Things soon came into focus when curd began to cooperate after the polygraph test. The tbi reported payne and hayworth made complaints against potter's daughter last year for harassing them",
            "A father who was upset after a tennessee couple deleted his adult daughter as a friend on facebook has been charged in the shooting deaths of the couple, authorities said wednesday. The victims had complained to police that marvin's potter's daughter was harassing them after they deleted her as a friend on the social networking site, johnson county sheriff mike reece said wednesday. Potter, 60, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in last week's slayings of billy payne jr. And his girlfriend, billie jean hayworth. The couple was shot to death in their mountain city home in the far northeast corner of the state. Their 8-month-old baby was found unharmed in hayworth's arms. \" it's a senseless thing, \" the sheriff said. Authorities have been involved other cases where potter's daughter, jenelle potter, believed she had been slighted by someone. Marvin potter's friend, jamie curd, has also been charged in the killings. Curd, 38, had romantic feelings for jenelle potter, 30, the sheriff said. Potter and curd were arraigned wednesday. Potter asked for time to hire an attorney while curd was assigned a public defender who did not immediately return a phone message. Assistant district attorney general matthew roark said curd's initial bond was raised to"

            "( adds details ) athens, june 29 greece will not pay a 1.6 billon euro loan installment due to the international monetary fund on tuesday, a greek government official confirmed on monday, highlighting the depth of the financial crisis facing the country. Ministers have said repeatedly that greece would not have the funds to pay the imf unless it reached a deal with creditors to unlock 7.2 billion euros in bailout funds frozen while the two sides wrestled over the conditions demanded of athens. After talks broke down at the weekend, triggering the imposition of capital controls on greek banks, it became a virtual formality that the imf's june 30 deadline would not be met. Imf managing director christine lagarde earlier this month said greece would be in default as of july 1 if it failed to the pay the money, though an imf spokesman last week said a missed payment would classify greece as \" in arrears \". The missed payment would bring greece closer to an exit from the euro zone currency if it prompted the european central bank to cut off emergency funding that greek banks rely on.

            "( adds details ) athens, june 29 greece will not pay a 1.6 billon euro loan installment due to the international monetary fund on tuesday, a greek government official confirmed on monday, highlighting the depth of the financial crisis facing the country. Ministers have said repeatedly that greece would not have the funds to pay the imf unless it reached a deal with creditors to unlock 7.2 billion euros in bailout funds frozen while the two sides wrestled over the conditions demanded of athens. After talks broke down at the weekend, triggering the imposition of capital controls on greek banks, it became a virtual formality that the imf's june 30 deadline would not be met. Imf managing director christine lagarde earlier this month said greece would be in default as of july 1 if it failed to the pay the money, though an imf spokesman last week said a missed payment would classify greece as \" in arrears \". The missed payment would bring greece closer to an exit from the euro zone currency if it prompted the european central bank to cut off emergency funding that greek banks rely on.

Here's what critics are saying: director brett morgen \" gives us the man instead of the myth \" in a documentary that makes \" cobain's story feel not only comprehensive and fresh but revelatory, \" chris nashawaty writes at entertainment weekly. Some parts, including a home video of cobain nodding off on drugs, are \" uncomfortable, \" but \" morgen isn't interested in hagiography. He wants to show us the real kurt cobain, warts and all. \" the result is, in a word, \" brilliant. \" \" the movie creates a portrait of cobain that's more intimate, and more disturbing, than any that fans have witnessed before, \" writes jim farber at the new york daily news. It \" downplays commentary to stress raw evidence drawn from cobain's deep archives. \" viewers will see \" a strung-out cobain struggling to hold his infant daughter, \" farber writes, and hear him speak about a high school suicide attempt. The film as a whole leaves \" questions, frustrations, and a chill. \" \" edited from thousands of photographs, home movies, and audio clips \" the \" source materials alone [ make ] this film a must-see for any hard-core nirvana fan, \" charles r. Cross writes at the seattle times. The highlights come in \" segments where noirish animations dramatize stories cobain himself narrates in audio. \" though the \" many powerful images on screen... Begin to overwhelm the viewer, \" most will be left \" cheering. \" mike hale describes the film as a \" seamless mystery ride \" that \" concentrates on cobain the writer, draftsman, and personality. \" morgen \" finds abundant clues and premonitions in cobain's writings \" to suggest that \" insecurity and shame \" played a role in his suicide, though the truth remains elusive, hale writes at the new york times.

A video circulating online shows the aussie journalist on abc24 on sunday, zoning out and staring at a pen while waiting for a prerecorded portion of the show to end, not knowing at first the camera had cut back to her, per the new york post. Once exelby realized she was back on the air, she let out a startled gasp, but quickly composed herself and continued with the broadcast. News outlets reported exelby, a freelance journalist, was yanked from on-air segments for abc, with some even framing it as a firing. But abc's news director insists that's not true and that \" slip-ups will happen. \" \" our presenters are humans, not robots, \" he says, adding exelby is simply an occasional contributor ( not a full-time employee ) who only does on-air segments as needed, even though at the moment she hasn't been rescheduled to do more on-air bits, per the guardian ( which cites sources saying exelby had been \" read the riot act \" by management ). The australian notes she's been hired to temporarily read the morning news for a sydney radio station while the regular host is on break. Exelby, who had supporters such as russell crowe rushing to her defense, thanked everyone on twitter, adding, \" not my finest hour. Myself and my mesmerising pen honourably salute you! \" ( this news anchor reported on horrible news that hit too close to home. )",

The escape, which he was doing to raise money for leukemia and lymphoma research, is only believed to have been attempted ( and failed ) twice before in the last century, including once by houdini himself. Even though britton tells the examiner he's disappointed he passed out just 2 feet from the surface, he says he won't be trying this trick again.

He has worked on 137 cases involving suspected nazis, and in all but 30 of them, the accused lost citizenship or was deported. Now, cnn reports, just a single active case remains. But when it comes to jakiw palij, who lives in queens, ny, deportation isn't likely. In fact, a federal judge ordered the 92-year-old deported in 2004, but the european countries he could be sent to won't take him. Palij, cnn notes, will likely die here. \" what mr. Palij did prevented other people from reaching old age, \" says rosenbaum, who now also oversees more recent war-related crimes as the doj's director of human rights enforcement strategy and policy. Palij is accused of being a guard at the trawniki death camp in german-occupied poland — \" in the end, \" rosenbaum says, \" everyone who was held there was massacred. \" palij, who, per the new york times, came to the us in 1949 as a refugee using falsified immigration papers, has denied any wrongdoing. In 2003, he told the times that the nazis coerced him into service patrolling bridges and roads at night. \" we knew they would kill me and my family if i refused, \" he says. \" i did it to save their lives, and i never even wore a nazi uniform. \" the founder of the simon wiesenthal center downplayed that line of argument: \" to work at those camps, you had to be eager to be there. They only took people they knew were loyal and brutal and not sympathetic to pleas of the inmates. \" in a 2013 interview with npr, rosenbaum described questioning the suspects about their alleged nazi pasts as \" surreal... These people look close to harmless. \" ( joseph goebbels ' \" love nest \" is proving to be a tough sell for berlin. )",

In a new ad, the pizza chain shows some of the furious messages it received after its founder blamed nfl protests for poor sales and later admitted using the n-word. \" racism is disgusting and i won't support it, \" one person wrote. Another said that \" blaming players for poor sales with dog whistle racism was a hack move. \" between the messages, words from the company appear on the screen. \" you expected better from papa john's. So did we, \" the company writes. \" thank you for your honesty... It is making us better. \" papa john's is struggling with declining sales, especially since founder john schnatter was forced to resign as chairman",

This month, he sued the cafeteria for selling \" dangerous \" sandwiches.

Officials confirm that his first wife was indeed killed, some six years ago; the guardian reports she was strangled. Iqbal's 20-something son reportedly went to police after the killing, and iqbal spent a number of weeks on the run before being arrested. The son says his father served a year in jail; police say he was freed after reaching a \" compromise \" with his family as allowed by pakistani law. Iqbal says, \" i wanted to send a proposal to farzana so i killed my wife. \" the timeline of the events remains a bit murky in terms of when iqbal met parveen, with the guardian previously reporting the two were engaged for nearly two years before marrying this january. Cnn does clarify some details about iqbal and parveen's involvement, per iqbal: he says that the woman's mother died in december, and her father and brothers then changed their mind about the agreed-upon marriage, preferring she wed a cousin instead. The two opted to elope on jan. 7, and her furious family demanded more money on top of what iqbal had initially paid in exchange for their lives. Iqbal says his refusal to pay led to an abduction charge against him, and parveen was planning to testify when she was attacked outside the court. According to a preliminary police report, her own brothers bashed her head with bricks.",

The question seemed settled in 2010 when a team of researchers used facial-reconstruction techniques to conclude that it was indeed \" good king henry, \" who was assassinated in 1610. But now a second team of scientists says it isn't so because dna tests don't match henry's living relatives. They wrote this week to the british medical journal urging a retraction of the earlier study, and, in fact, two members of the 2010 team agree that their conclusions were faulty. Not so, says the lead researcher from 2010. He explained to phys.org in an earlier story that it's useless to make conclusions based on dna results in part because the french royals were such philanderers. \" it is hopeless to try to match a family tree and a series of genetic links ( over ) such a long period, \" he said.

Boston is effectively shut down in the meantime: residents of boston, watertown, newton, waltham, belmont, cambridge, and the allston-brighton neighborhoods of boston were told to remain in their homes; mass transit has been halted; businesses were asked not to open; and the boston globe reports that at least 16 area colleges have canceled classes. What we know of what happened overnight, per the ap and the washington post: the middlesex district attorney says the two men are suspected of killing an mit police officer at the college last night after the officer responded to a disturbance, then stealing a car at gunpoint and later releasing its driver unharmed. ( all just hours after police released photos of the bombing suspects. ) authorities say the suspects threw explosives from the car as police followed it into watertown; witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1am. A transit police officer was critically wounded. The suspects and police exchanged gunfire and one of the suspects was critically injured and later died at a hospital while the other escaped. Doctors at boston's beth israel deaconess medical center say they treated a man with a possible blast injury and multiple gunshot wounds. They wouldn't confirm that the patient, who came in with police, was the suspect in the black hat from marathon surveillance footage. Police say the suspect on loose is a \" terrorist \" who \" came here to kill people. \" governor deval patrick held a press conference with police this morning extending the shelter-in-place warning to all of boston. \" there is a massive manhunt underway, \" he assured reporters. \" we've got every asset that we can possibly muster on the ground right now. \" authorities have identified the mit officer who was killed as 26-year-old sean collier of somerville, according to the boston globe. The mbta police officer who was injured has been identified as richard h. Donohue.",

That's only the first eyebrow-raiser about the country's electoral process, held every four years so voters can \" choose \" mayors, governors, and local assemblies. North koreans over age 17 are not only required to show, they're also told which preapproved candidates to vote for by placing already prepared ballots in the ballot boxes, cnn notes. And according to sky, it was a \" festive atmosphere, \" with voters \" singing and dancing \" as they cast votes. \" all participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power, \" the korean central news agency proclaimed. Voting is simple: to vote \" yes \" for the candidate predetermined by kim jong un's workers ' party, participants just place their ballot in the correct box; those who vote \" no \" place their ballot in a separate box, all within view of elections officials, the economist explained in 2014. Abstaining or voting no is viewed as treason, the bbc notes. The real reason for even having the vote is basically to serve as a census of sorts and to keep track of no-show defectors, nk news notes. A professor of asian studies explains that this election system makes even more extreme the one used in the soviet union during the cold war, including the ridiculously high turnout rates. \" people used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in north korea, let alone lose consciousness, \" he says.

Detectives learned that 140 gallons of water were used between 1am and 3am on the morning collins died, and a hose was used. They believe the patio was sprayed down in an attempt to wash away evidence; they found hot tub knobs and head cushions lying on the ground and collins ' blood spattered on the hot tub cover, one of the cushions, and the sides of the tub.

Reports of bald eagle sightings are pouring in from around the boston area. \" they are too big to escape notice, \" palmer says. The ap reports there were 51 confirmed breeding pairs of bald eagles in the state last year. That's the most since the birds were reintroduced to massachusetts in 1982. And it's part of a trend seen nationwide. There were 10,000 or so pairs of bald eagles in the continental us when they were taken off the endangered list in 2007. That's 20 times as many as in 1963. One ornithologist says the resurgence is partly due to bald eagles getting more used to humans and humans getting more used to not shooting bald eagles. Another says it's a sign that the waters around boston are getting healthier, providing good fishing for breeding eagles. \" once rare and threatened with extinction, the national symbol can now be seen from the comfort of your car, \" the washington post states. But that can also be its own problem. Bald eagles are increasingly being hit by cars while eating roadkill. Last year, a 38-year-old bald eagle — the country's oldest — suffered that fate. The problem is compounded by eagles getting lead poisoning by eating the remains of deer shot by hunters. \" it's like they're flying drunk, \" one veterinary director tells the post. ( some eagles may also be making themselves sick by eating euthanized animals. )",

But at the bbc, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks ' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, claudia hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. ( as for \" beer before liquor, never been sicker \"? it appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference. ) \" the existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks, \" hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: a study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, science daily reported.

They think ideology is something squished down on their heads from on high, something imposed on them by big thinkers who create systems we're all supposed to conform to. Americans are more interested in philosophy, which bubbles up from human beings, from tradition and learned experience, and isn't imposed. Lately we are hearing a bit about ideology, but the work of a great political philosopher, edmund burke, is more pertinent. Burke respected reality, acknowledged human nature, and appreciated political context. In \" reflections on the revolution in france, \" he wrote, \" circumstances ( which with some gentlemen pass for...",
            "Vice-presidential picks are always judged by their effect on the coming election. They rarely have any. They haven't had a decisive influence since lyndon johnson carried texas for john kennedy in 1960. ( that and illinois put kennedy over the top. ) this time, however, the effect could be significant. The democrats ' mediscare barrage is already in full swing. Paul ryan, it seems, is determined to dispossess grandmother, then toss her over a cliff. If the charge is not successfully countered, good-bye florida. Republicans have a twofold answer. First, hammer home that their medicare plan affects no one over 55, let alone 65. Second, go on offense. Point out that president obama cuts medicare by $ 700 billion to finance obamacare. It's a sweet judo throw: want to bring up medicare, supposedly our weakness? fine. But now you've got to debate obamacare, your weakness — and explain why you are robbing granny's health care to pay for your pet project. If mitt romney and ryan can successfully counterattack mediscare, the ryan effect becomes a major plus. Because: ( a ) ryan nationalizes the election and makes it ideological, reprising the 2010 dynamic that delivered a \"shellacking \" to the democrats. ( b ) if the conversation is about big issues, obama cannot hide from his dismal economic record and complete failure of vision. In obama's own on-camera commercial — \"the choice... Couldn't be bigger \" — what's his big idea? a 4.6-point increase in the marginal tax rate of 2 percent of the population. That's it? that's his program? for a country with stagnant growth, ruinous debt and structural problems crying out for"

Salvatore cordileone, who officially takes charge next week, is considered an \" architect \" of proposition 8, notes the los angeles times. He helped develop the proposition to shoot down the state's gay marriage measure when he was an auxiliary bishop in san diego.

It's just very, very sad, \" he tells the san francisco chronicle. The archdiocese recently banned drag queens from serving as emcees at charity events at the church.
