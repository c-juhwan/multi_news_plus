Abc 6 reports that 28-year-old david desper of pennsylvania surrendered around 2am sunday and has been charged with first- and third-degree murder, among other crimes. Desper is believed to be the driver of a red truck that highway cameras recorded driving alongside 18-year-old bianca roberson. \" as bianca was merging from two lanes to one, there was a man in a red pickup truck also merging down, \" district attorney tom hogan said during a press conference. \"they jockeyed for position and he wasn't happy, \" the driver was recorded pulling out a gun and shooting roberson in the head in what hogan calls \" a savage and senseless murder. \" roberson was killed immediately while her vehicle veered off the road and struck a tree. According to the new york daily news, desper's dented red truck has been recovered, while a 40-caliber handgun believed to be the murder weapon was found in desper's bedroom. Authorities declined to comment on desper's previous criminal record during a press conference, but do not believe the incident to be a \"race crime or a hate crime. \" roberson recently graduated from high school and was planning to attend jacksonville university in florida in the fall, where her brother says she was \"headed for greatness. \"",

The department of justice indicted the owners of the three largest sites — full tilt poker, pokerstars, and absolute poker — for bank fraud, illegal gambling, and money laundering on friday, shutting down all three sites, the wall street journal reports. The indictment said the defendants used fraudulent methods to trick financial institutions into processing payments on their behalf following a 2006 law that made such payments illegal. It said they sometimes arranged for money from us gamblers to be disguised as payments to hundreds of non-existent online merchants purporting to sell merchandise such as jewelry and golf balls. The government also seized 76 bank accounts, many of which contained players ' money. The government knew exactly where to strike, because it persuaded the \"boy genius \" who helped invent the sites ' e-commerce systems to help them, the courier-mail reports. Daniel tzvetkoff had already fallen out with the sites, who were suing him for $ 100 million, when the government arrested him in april. He was released on bail in august — after a secret meeting with prosecutors, in which he gave them everything they needed to take down the sites. Click for more on the \" boy genius. \"",

That's what you could see in the night sky over the next week or so as the taurid meteor shower makes its annual appearance, usa today reports. The cosmic show, which can be viewed anytime from late october through the end of this month, is set to peak from thursday to nov. 12 and will be visible to us viewers. And mother nature network notes this could be one of the best displays ever, thanks to an atypically heavy debris field from the comet — meaning more of the shooting stars than usual — and the lack of a full moon. An accuweather meteorologist notes that viewers typically see up to 10 meteors per hour. How the fireballs come about: as the encke comet orbits the sun, it leaves a trail of dust and ice particles, per usa today. As our planet moves through that debris field, the particles zip through our atmosphere at up to 65,000mph, burning up and resulting in the spectacular trails we see in the sky. ( the fireball seen in this video is said to have been recorded in bangkok earlier this week. ) with this particular meteor shower, they appear to emerge from the taurus constellation: the south taurids, seen south of the star pattern, peak thursday night; the north taurids peak nov. 12, space.com reports. The best time to catch a peek: after midnight, when there's little moonlight and taurus is high up above. If you miss them, don't fret: the even more eye-catching leonid shower is right on the taurids'tail, due to peak around nov. 17, usa today notes.",

Fireballs are just extremely bright meteors, space.com's joe rao added. The taurid shower generally shoots about two to 10 meteors across the sky",
            "Meteors, popularly called \" shooting stars, \" are much more common than most people think. In fact, there's a display going on now - courtesy of two taurid meteor showers - if you know when and where to look. Meteor showers are made up of brief-lived streaks of light caused by small particles traversing the earth's atmosphere and heating it to incandescence. In space these particles are called \" meteoroids. \" if they survive their trip through the atmosphere to reach the surface of the earth, they are called \" meteorites. \" it is only while they are in transit through the air that they are",
            "Excited about cooler temperatures and fall activities? be sure to save some of that outdoor enthusiasm for the night sky. On nov. 12 and 13, the annual taurid meteor shower will peak for the second time this month for sky watchers in north america. Unlike other celestial fireworks from recurring showers like the perseids or leonids, the taurids aren't so famous for their frequency as they are for the extremely bright fireballs. The dust from the taurids, which originate from debris left behind by comet encke, hits the earth's atmosphere at 65,000 miles per hour and burns up, creating the taurid meteor shower, according to",

Kevin mccarthy, the presumed next speaker of the house, on thursday, republicans are going back to the drawing board to find a replacement for the outgoing john boehner. One familiar name is being bandied about by politicians and the media: paul ryan. Though ryan has said he's not interested in the position, quite a few columnists are weighing in on why he should reconsider: \" no other figure within the party combines ryan's philosophical radicalism and tactical pragmatism, \" jonathan chait writes in new york. \" if he accepts the position, it would formalize a standing he has held for years. He is already the president of republican america. \" \" ryan may be the only republican with the national standing and conservative credentials to defy the cruz ultimatums, \" declares a wall street journal editorial. \" he'd be assailed with the usual sellout and surrender epithets, any future presidential ambitions might suffer, and he'd have less time for his young children. But he could save the house majority from self-destruction. \" \" he has consistently pushed the envelope on substance, understanding that the party needs a serious policy agenda to counter that of the left, \" states a national review editorial. \" he is a knowledgeable and effective defender of conservative policy. Sometimes we think he is wrong on both substantive and tactical matters, but we never doubt that he is wrong for the right reasons. \" \" ryan is respected by most people on both sides of the divide, \" writes ramesh ponnuru at bloomberg view. \" no other house republican has the same reservoir of goodwill. No other house republican is considered as good a spokesman on such politically perilous issues as entitlement reform. \"",

It's \" newish \" because doctors have known about mycoplasma genitalium, or mg, since 1981, but researchers have now found the strongest evidence to date that it can be transmitted through sexual contact. They analyzed urine samples from 4,507 brits aged 16 to 44 and found that 1 % of those who had at least one sexual partner had mg, reports the independent. The figure rose to 5.2 % of men and 3.1 % of women who had more than four sexual partners in the previous year, per mic. Tellingly, no sign of the infection was found in the 200 or so participants who had never had sex. \" there were strong associations with risky sexual behaviors, with behavioral risk factors similar to those in other known stis, and no infections were detected in those reporting no previous sexual experience, \" the authors say. While sufferers may report genital discharge, pelvic pain, pain while urinating, and bleeding after sex in the case of women, \" over 90 % of men and more than half of women with mg had no symptoms, \" a researcher tells the guardian. The lead author notes the infection could also lead to inflammations of the urethra or cervix ( urethritis or cervicitis ), pelvic inflammatory disease, and female infertility, but further research is needed to understand the long-term effects. A sex researcher adds there's no need to freak out. Mg \" is prevented in the same ways that gonorrhea and chlamydia are: by using condoms properly and consistently, \" she says. Doctors, she adds, should keep the results in mind when patients have ailments such as urethritis or cervicitis but test negative for gonorrhea or chlamydia.

After a few blocks of the truck riding her tail, stackhouse, 34, pulled to the side at a roundabout so the truck could pass — and says driver jay allen barbeau instead went nuts. The women say he broke their car's left tail light and rear window with his bare hands and then approached the driver's side door. Police say he grabbed stackhouse's arm through the open window and twisted it until it broke. \" it was visibly broken, \" stackhouse says of the compound fracture, and she alleges barbeau didn't end there but began punching her face, causing mann, 26, to get out of the car and try to stop the 245-pound man. Instead, she says the 49-year-old gave her a concussion by slamming her into the concrete. He was arrested as he allegedly tried to flee the scene, was treated for injuries to his hand, and appeared in court monday on charges of assault, criminal mischief, and reckless driving.

A video obtained by tmz shows odom slumped over and being helped by security personnel at a club in west hollywood. Odom's spokesperson said in a statement that the 38-year-old, who last appeared in an nba game with the los angeles clippers in 2013, is \"doing great. \" \"he was dehydrated due to intense workouts earlier in the day without the intake of enough fluids, \" the spokesperson said. \"it was also very hot in the club. He has seen his doctors and is doing great. \" odom's collapse occurred more than two years after he nearly died of a drug overdose. In an article that appeared in the players'tribune earlier this year, he wrote that he was in a coma for four days. \"at that point in my life, i was doing coke every day.

But with the downing of the malaysia airlines plane and increasing sanctions from the us and eu, the mood appears to be shifting, the new york times reports. Russian officials \" were not anticipating the west to make radical moves, costly moves, \" says a political analyst. \" what is happening is different from what they wanted and what they expected. \" one key sanction, imposed by the us and europe together, seeks to hit russia where it really hurts by limiting its access to new sources of oil. Russia's energy resources, the times notes, are its \" economic foundation. \" among the possible effects of the sanctions: half of russia's economy is controlled by the government, the times observes, but business leaders outside that sphere are growing concerned about anti-western sentiment and its dangers to development, a putin ally recently told state news. The economy is already struggling, and the new sanctions could require the government to support firms burdened by debt, economists say, per cnbc. \" if nothing else, the pickup in investment needed to revive russia's ailing economy is starting to look ever more unlikely, \" they say in a letter to clients. Russia could hit back with an energy embargo against european countries. Foreign minister sergey lavrov, however, said this week that \" to fall into hysterics and respond to a blow with a blow is not worthy of a major country, \" the times notes. What's more, russia would be seriously hurt by the loss of revenue involved, cnbc notes, potentially leading to \" a deep recession, \" says an expert. Russia has already launched what may be a form of retaliation, reuters reports: it banned the majority of polish fruit and vegetable imports. The rest of the eu could soon face a similar ban, russia says. The country, which is the top export market for eu fruits and vegetables, says the ban is tied to health concerns. The uk is among countries facing economic fallout from the sanctions themselves, as russian borrowing from british banks is halted. The sanctions \" will affect our economy... But you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, \" says british foreign secretary philip hammond, per sky news. Even outside the sanctions, russia's leadership may have a lot to answer for when it comes to investment, notes the economist, which figures that vladimir putin may have cost investors some $ 1 trillion.

Richards on wednesday night, and the ones who drove around the dying boy afterward. Police say the boy was hit around a block away from his home in the illinois city at around 6: 30pm. After several drivers maneuvered around him as he lay in the street, one motorist stopped, blocked the road with his vehicle, and called 911, cbs reports. Maurice, remembered by his family as a happy boy who loved to play and ride his bike, was taken to the hospital, where he died around an hour later, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. His family says he was hit while simply trying to cross the street. Maurice's grandmother, denise richards, tells the post-dispatch that it's not clear how long the boy was lying in the road for, though witnesses said his clothes were drenched from rain. \" as citizens of this city, we have to do better because no one will protect it like us. So if you were one of the ones that saw the young man lying in the street and went around him, you know it's not right, \" said detective jason hicks from the east st.

        "summary": "The first presidential debate was a busy night for the fact-checkers — who were asked to \" get to work \" by hillary clinton after donald trump said she had been fighting isis her \" entire adult life, \" the los angeles times reports. Isis, in fact, first emerged in 2004 as al-qaeda in iraq, meaning clinton could not have started fighting the group when she was an 18-year-old at wellesley college in 1965. Some other contentious claims, from both sides: trump: \" i was endorsed by ice. \" trump was not endorsed by immigration and customs enforcement, which as a government agency, can't endorse anybody, though he was endorsed this week by a union of ice employees, reports politico. Trump: clinton called the trans-pacific partnership the \" gold standard ' of trade deals and the \" finest deal \" she had ever seen. Clinton did indeed say the deal \" sets the gold standard \" and praised it on many other occasions, though there's no record of her calling it the finest deal she'd ever seen, abc news reports. Clinton: \" donald says climate change is a hoax created by the chinese. \" trump denied having said this, but he was proved wrong by a tweet he made in 2012. Trump's claim to have been against the invasion of iraq. The washington post takes a close look and finds there's nothing in the public record to support it: he told howard stern \" yeah, i guess so \" in september 2012 when asked if he supported the invasion. He does, however, say he told sean hannity he was against the war in what were apparently private conversations. Trump: nafta is \" the worst trade deal \" in american history. According to the new york times, the north american free trade agreement was not a \" big deal in economic terms, \" largely because trade with canada and mexico doesn't make up a huge portion of american economic activity. Clinton: under the current mayor, crime in new york city \" has continued to drop, including murders. \" the murder rate actually rose the year after bill de blasio became mayor in 2015, politico reports, though it has fallen again so far in 2016, according to nypd statistics. Trump: \" my father gave me a small loan in 1975. \" clinton says trump received $ 14 million in loans from his father, which is the figure that appeared in a 1985 financial disclosure document, the new york times notes. Trump's father acted as guarantor on his early project and loaned him $ 1 million in 1978, which works",

As cbs 6 explains, the 2011 virginia law prohibits state employees from collecting their pensions if convicted of a felony. The misdeed must be related to on-the-job conduct, which would seem to be the case here, though the washington post says it's \" still unclear \" whether mcdonnell will have to forfeit the money. In a story written well before the ex-governor's corruption trial began, the richmond times-dispatch estimated mcdonnell's annual pension would be about $ 65,000. The strange quirk that could save him: the law stipulates that the employee's supervisor must alert the state's retirement system that benefits should be suspended. But who, exactly, is the governor's supervisor?",

Twenty-year-old lanza shot his mother nancy lanza to death at the house before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at sandy hook elementary school in december 2012. Adam lanza killed himself at the school as police arrived. Some newtown residents have said they'd like to see the property torn down and replaced with a park or nature preserve."

Lebreton is the lead author of the most comprehensive study of the patch, which was published thursday in scientific reports. While the actual size of the patch, which floats in the pacific ocean between hawaii and california, is holding largely steady at around 600,000 square miles — twice the size of texas or three times the size of france — the mass of plastics it contains is up to 16 times higher than previous estimates. Researchers using 18 boats and two planes found about 79,000 tons of plastic in the patch. The patch is made up of about 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, usa today reports. While it contains everything from plastic bottles to a toilet seat, about 46 % of its mass is comprised of huge fishing nets that have been dumped overboard, which is a big problem. \" entanglement and smothering from nets is one of the most detrimental observed effects we see in nature, \" an expert on marine plastics tells the post. Because the patch — as well as four other floating trash islands like it — are located in international waters, the world's governments aren't doing anything about them, leaving it to private groups like the ocean cleanup foundation, which led the recent study. \"we need a coordinated international effort to rethink and redesign the way we use plastics, \" lebreton tells the guardian. \" things are getting worse and we need to act now. \"",

With the prize money, parcak plans to develop a website that will use volunteer crowdsourcing to amplify that effort and to spot looting. She says the latter is more vital than ever now that groups such as the islamic state are bent on destroying antiquities. \" we can't keep up, \" she says. \" we are losing the battle.

        "summary": "Three billboards outside ebbing, missouri stars frances mcdormand as a woman who swears a whole lot more than a sailor. She also happens to be grieving over the unsolved murder of her daughter, which prompts her to erect three billboards highlighting what she views as police incompetence. The flick, written and directed by martin mcdonagh, has an impressive 95 % rating from 85 critics on rotten tomatoes. What they're saying: kenneth turan calls three billboards an \" energetically demented production \" with \" so many devious turns that it just about whipsaws our expectations. \" he credits mcdonagh for \" its verve, its flair and its precision, \" as well as its \" intensely imagined \" characters. At the forefront is mildred hayes \" played with convincing and uncompromising fierceness by mcdormand … in what could be the role of her rich and varied career, \" he writes at the los angeles times. Kate taylor agrees mcdormand is \" powerful \" in this film that \" satirizes police brutality and prejudice to great effect. \" it \" recalls the heights of the coen brothers ' black comedies, \" as mcdonagh \" reaches for that same kind of black and bloody mix where the audience has no choice but to laugh at the savagery, \" she writes at the globe and mail, touting sam rockwell's \" delightfully over-the-top performance \" as racist dixon. One weakness: \" emotional plausibility. \" get this woman an oscar, brian truitt writes of mcdormand, whom he praises as \" wielding righteous anger, fiery emotion, biting humor and an ornery manner right out of a clint eastwood western \" at usa today. Perhaps most complimentary is truitt's take on the film overall. It's timely — touching on \" racism, gender politics, sexual assault, police violence \" — yet satisfying, \" blending black humor and menace, and fostering a pervading sense of hope amid a relentless story of revenge. \" put another way, three billboards is \" a renegade masterpiece that will get you good, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. With not a bad thing to say, travers calls the film \" a no-brainer awards contender. \" rockwell is \" so crazy good and volcanically funny that you want to spontaneously applaud whenever he shows up. \" but it's mcdormand who \" should be adding more gold to her impressive collection. \" she \" will blow you away. \"",

        "summary": "In a piece at slate, shannon palus takes note of two things about amazon: a staggering 100 million people or so have prime subscriptions, and yet more people seem to be canceling their subscriptions in protest. The reason for the latter, as spelled out in vox, is an apparent rising concern over labor issues and amazon's monopolistic ways. But while palus applauds those making a statement by ditching prime, she's not about to cast judgment on those who won't. \" it's simply not a step that everyone can take, and that's not just because people are unwilling to forgo convenience, \" she writes. \" it's easy to forget, because everyone has to do it and it's often pleasurable, but shopping is labor. \" prime, especially for those struggling to make ends meet, can be \" a band-aid, helping them save money and time, \" writes palus. She talks to several people who explain why they don't feel they can give it up, including a young couple who have giant boxes of diapers delivered to their second-floor condo at a discount of 20 %. She suggests that people like this who still want to support the amazon protests can cut back in smaller ways, like not taking part in additional services such as same-day delivery. And they can also be vocal about their concerns. \" small actions, if broadcast to a social network and in turn, to politicians, can help spur that change. \" read the full piece.",

The millennial generation boasts the highest percentage of women bike owners with nearly 18 %, while generation x females make up 17 % of all bike owners in that segment, and baby boomer females 9 % of that segment. The median age for a female rider is 39 ( for men it's 48 ), though tuzee, herself a rider, tells the paper that she and other women riders often gravitate toward the bike and relish their \" freedom \" when their kids leave home. As for the types of bikes women prefer: 34 % tend toward cruisers, 33 % prefer scooters, and just 10 % would pick a sport bike, motousa notes. And compared to the 42 % of male riders who take motorcycle safety courses, 60 % of women do. \" it's encouraging that we're seeing more women among the riders who are entering the sport, \" the chair of powerlily, a network for professional women into powersports, tells motousa. \" motorcycling is … being recognized by younger generations and non-traditional customer segments. \" ( male or female, don't text while you're cruising, or you could meet this fate. )",

Original: a lot of people are unhappy about the upcoming celebrity boxing match pitting trayvon martin killer george zimmerman against troubled rapper dmx, and someone has started a white house petition to stop the fight. As of wednesday afternoon, the petition had over 4,000 signatures. The white house is obligated to respond to any petition with more than 100,000 signatures. The petition, created by someone in california, reads: celebrity boxing promoter damon feldman &amp; george zimmerman are attempting to promote and profit off of racial tensions in america. Damon feldman has been known for fixing fights and taking short cuts in the past in bypassing state requirements for fighters to obtain a license to box. Mr feldmans past should be highly considered in this regard if feldman is not going through the proper channels to ensure the safety of the participants it puts lives at risk. In addition the entire idea of this event is to use racial tensions to lure people in to purchase the event.

            "Update: under pressure from the growing opposition to the george zimmerman/dmx boxing match, fight promoter damon feldman has indicated that zimmerman will not appear at the philadelphia press conference next week. Original: a lot of people are unhappy about the upcoming celebrity boxing match pitting trayvon martin killer george zimmerman against troubled rapper dmx, and someone has started a white house petition to stop the fight. As of wednesday afternoon, the petition had over 4,000 signatures. The white house is obligated to respond to any petition with more than 100,000 signatures. The petition, created by someone in california, reads: celebrity boxing promoter damon feldman &amp; george zimmerman are attempting to promote and profit off of racial tensions in america. Damon feldman has been known for fixing fights and taking short cuts in the past in bypassing state requirements for fighters to obtain a license to box. Mr feldmans past should be highly considered in this regard if feldman is not going through the proper channels to ensure the safety of the participants it puts lives at risk. In addition the entire idea of this event is to use racial tensions to lure people in to purchase the event. This will only hurt america as it will continue to stir up racial tensions that have been on going in this nation for quite some time. No promoter or celebrity boxer should ever be allowed to use racial tension to profit.

        "summary": "It's no surprise that us policies are failing in afghanistan, pakistan, egypt, and around the region — they're completely missing what makes countries succeed, writes thomas friedman in the new york times. The key, according to a new book, why nations fail, is developing \" inclusive \" economic and political institutions. Inclusive systems make the people as a whole feel involved and inspire them to innovate and invest, whereas exclusive systems concentrate power on a small oligarchy. Trying to push democracy onto the middle east is doomed to fail without more inclusive support. \" we can only be a force multiplier, \" friedman warns. So the united states should be turning its aid from military regimes to more grass-roots institutions. \" right now, i'd argue, our foreign aid to egypt, pakistan, and afghanistan is really a ransom we pay their elites not to engage in bad behavior. We need to turn it into bait, \" he writes. Friedman also says this theory of inclusion should be a warning to china about the limits of its current system — and to the united states, where economic inequality is leading to political inequality.

Seth mazzaglia was convicted in 2014 of the rape and murder of lizzi marriott, whose body has not been found. He said the university of new hampshire sophomore died accidentally during consensual sex. According to cbs news, mazzaglia's girlfriend at the time said she brought marriott to mazzaglia as a \" sexual offering \" and he killed her when she wouldn't have sex with him. During the trial, marriott's sexual history was deemed inadmissible due to new hampshire's rape shield laws. But the state supreme court in june ruled that those records be made public as part of mazzaglia's appeal, the new hampshire union leader reports. Both the state and marriott's parents filed emergency motions and they're now going to court to try to keep any documents regarding marriott's sexual past sealed. \" this has completely traumatized her family, who... Was just starting to heal, \" their attorney, rus rilee, tells huffpo. The family is joined by more than a dozen organizations, including the new hampshire association of chiefs of police and the national alliance to end sexual violence. They argue the state supreme court's ruling would destroy rape shield laws around the country, as victims of sexual assault would be less likely to report it if they knew their sexual histories would become public on appeal.

Abigail fisher also says her grades were better than those of many of the minority students admitted. The case doesn't bode well for the principle of affirmative action because — as the los angeles times, the new york times, and the washington post all point out — the court is more conservative than it was the last time the issue came up, in 2003. Specifically, the author of that 5-4 decision, sandra day o ' connor, has been replaced by the more conservative samuel alito. What's more, elena kagan has recused herself from the new case.

But the maryland state medical examiner says he stabbed and shot the girl at some point during a police chase and gun battle with officers in maryland on saturday, the washington post reports. Police gave chase after finding laila's grandfather and great-grandmother shot, allegedly at miller's hand ( they are now in critical condition ) in a residence, wjla reports. Miller, 38, allegedly took off from the home in a nissan with laila as a passenger. Police say miller stopped twice to exchange shots before he was killed. Police then found laila in the car with injuries to her upper body; she later died. The girl's mother was later found unharmed. Neighbors say she and miller had been fighting over their daughter since 2011; the mother had custody and miller was given visitation rights that were then demoted to supervised visits, the post reports. Relatives suggest a financial disagreement over child support and disability payments may have triggered saturday's incident, but at least one neighbor doesn't believe miller — a disabled and unemployed marine veteran — could have harmed his daughter. Six officers involved in the shootout are now on administrative leave, nbc reports.",

The ap puts the death toll at one, while reuters has it at two. It's possible the quake caused so little trouble because it struck so deep, about 25 miles below the surface.",

Per phys.org, the analysis ordered by the russian orthodox church could eventually mean the remains of nicholas ii and his family will finally be given their full rites 100 years after they were murdered by the bolsheviks in 1918. The church investigative committee wrote in its findings that \" the remains found belonged to the former emperor nicholas ii, his family members, and members of their entourage. \" in order to come to the conclusion, investigators reportedly had to first exhume the remains of nicholas ' father and test his dna in order to prove the familial link. The investigation concluded that the bones believed to be those of nicholas ii were, indeed, those of the son of alexander iii. The orthodox church has expressed satisfaction with how the investigation has been conducted and church authorities say they ' ll take the findings into consideration. As the week notes, the remains of nicholas ii, his wife alexandra, and three of their children have been interred in the family crypt in st. Petersburg since 1998. The bones of his children alexei and maria were not discovered until 2007 and remain apart from the rest of the family pending verification, which has also been ordered by the church. The family was rounded up on the night of july 16, 1918, in the home where they were imprisoned by bolshevik revolutionaries after vladimir lenin seized power that same year, ending the 300-year romanov dynasty to which nicholas and his family belonged.

            "Washington — representative alan b. Mollohan of west virginia, a veteran democrat, on tuesday became the first house incumbent to lose his seat this year when he was handily defeated in a hard-hitting primary by state senator mike oliverio. The defeat comes just days after senator robert f. Bennett, a utah republican and three-term incumbent, was turned out of office by his party at a state convention and just a week before a handful of high-profile primaries next tuesday, including senate races in arkansas, kentucky and pennsylvania. The mollohan loss is certain to intensify the political anxiety among lawmakers and heighten the perception that incumbents of both parties face a real risk of being rejected this year by a disgruntled and hostile electorate. A senior member of the house appropriations committee, mr. Mollohan was the victim of an aggressive campaign by mr. Oliverio, who challenged him over his conduct in the house and the democratic push for climate change legislation that was unpopular in coal country. Mr. Mollohan opposed the bill last year. Advertisement continue reading the main story mr. Mollohan was first elected in 1982 when he succeeded his father, robert. He was at one time the senior democrat on the house ethics panel, but he encountered ethics scrutiny of his own in 2006 over accusations that he funneled federal money to nonprofit organizations in his district and benefited his business associates.",

Reveal from the center for investigative reporting explains: san diego man osbaldo padron claims he was sexually abused as a child in the 1990s by an adult congregation member and filed suit against the jehovah's witnesses for not interceding and continuing to promote the man. The san diego union-tribune reports the church allegedly knew in 1982 that gonzalo campos had molested a child; campos later admitted to abusing at least eight kids between that year and 1995 ( he fled to mexico in 2010 ). Padron wants internal documents that he believes show a pattern, and the church won't hand them over, in violation of a court order. Hence the $ 4,000 daily penalty; the order was upheld on appeal last week. Reveal offers details on internal documents it was able to obtain, which reach back three decades and include a 1989 letter sent to all congregations from hq, known as the watchtower, noting that elders \" must be careful not to divulge information about personal matters to unauthorized personnel. \" a 1997 letter decried molestation but instructed on how to handle a \" former child molester \" moving to a new congregation: send a letter about any \" needed cautions \" in a \" special blue \" envelope to the new congregation's elders, but \" this letter should not be read to or discussed with the congregation. \" the union-tribune notes that watchtower has complained the court order is overly burdensome and broad, and has heavily redacted the documents it has handed over.",

        "summary": "Details are beginning to emerge about the still-unnamed soldier accused of killing 16 afghan civilians yesterday. An official who spoke to the new york times says the army staff sergeant was part of a village stabilization operation in the rural panjwai district of kandahar, in which green berets forge close ties with communities in an attempt to track down taliban leaders. Other soldiers support the green berets in such operations, and an official says the suspect himself was not a green beret. Another official tells the times the suspect has been in the army 11 years; a third says he is 38, married with two children, and served three tours in iraq before being deployed to afghanistan for the first time in december. The suspect's unit is based at joint base lewis-mcchord, near tacoma, wash., one of the country's largest military installations — and one that has been plagued by violence recently, the ap notes. Four soldiers from the base were convicted of thrill-killing three afghan civilians in 2010; a military newspaper called lewis-mcchord \" the most troubled base in the military \" that year. It has also seen a high number of suicides among returning soldiers; a former soldier linked to the base shot a police officer in 2010; and a veteran linked to the base killed a mount rainier national park ranger this year. Relatives of the afghan victims have vowed revenge for yesterday's killing spree.",

The newspaper crunched the numbers on his various proposals to arrive at that eye-popping total, one that would amount to the \" largest peacetime expansion of government in modern american history, \" writes reporter laura meckler. The biggest chunk of the total, about $ 15 trillion, is associated with sanders ' plan to expand medicare to all americans. Other big-ticket items include $ 1 trillion in spending on roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects, and $ 750 billion for tuition-free public colleges. ( update: a washington post analysis of the journal story makes the case that the $ 18 trillion figure is grossly misleading. For one thing, that $ 15 trillion estimate for health care reform is based not on sanders ' figures but on the cost of a similar bill currently in congress. ) still, the journal finds that it's not just conservatives wary of sanders ' initiatives. \" we are not a country that has limitless resources, \" says jim kessler of the democratic think tank third way. \" you need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn't. \" to help pay for it, sanders has so far pitched tax increases, mostly on the wealthy, that would bring in $ 6.5 trillion over a decade. More tax proposals on the way. His \" agenda does cost money, \" acknowledges sanders ' policy director. But \" if you look at the problems that are out there, it's very reasonable. \" along those lines, the post adds that \" while sanders does want to spend significant amounts of money, almost all of it is on things we're already paying for; he just wants to change how we pay for them. \" a blogger at the atlanta journal-constitution has a different mindset, writing that despite all the attention paid to donald trump, the journal story shows that sanders is \" the most radical candidate \" in the race.",

In a study of 75 \" physically inactive \" people — that is, those who engage in less than 150 weekly minutes of moderate exercise — researchers divided subjects into a walking and a non-walking group ( whose members weren't left out: they acted as a control group, then started walking later in the study ). Walkers took 30-minute strolls three times during the workweek and twice on weekends, scientific american reports. In surveys, walkers said they felt more enthusiastic and more relaxed than non-walkers, scientific american notes. They were also less nervous after their walks, and they felt better in the afternoons on walking days than on other days. They saw physical health benefits, too, the new york times reports. Plus, bosses shouldn't mind: \" there is now quite strong research evidence that feeling more positive and enthusiastic at work is very important to productivity, \" a researcher tells the times. \"so we would expect that people who walked at lunchtime would be more productive. \" one caveat: the study's participants were almost all women, so more research is needed to generalize to men.

The mass of insects was so dense it weighed down sections of the stand's umbrella. The vendor, visibly agitated, had nothing to say about the visitation of apis mellifera. The incident lasted all of an hour before the new york police department's own beekeeping team vacuumed up the horde of honeybees and took them safely to a new location. In their brief brush with fame, the bees attracted hundreds of onlookers and inspired some embarrassingly bad jokes by police officers."

Officials began evacuating the park around 3pm, urging visitors to go indoors, nbc chicago reports. The wind caused the women's slalom race to be postponed until friday. \" all of them are anxious to race, absolutely, but they all want to race in fair conditions. That's the main thing, \" us coach paul kristofic said, per the ap. The women's biathlon was also postponed because gusts of more than 15mph made it difficult for competitors to use their rifles. In other olympics happenings: a serious issue. Writing for the globe and mail, cathal kelly reports that with the winds arriving just as the games began to warm up after days of bitter cold, the weather is becoming a serious issue that could make it impossible to complete all the events, or at least lead to \" a glut of events in the second half of the games, piled one atop the other. \" the science: kelly calls gangwon-do province, where the olympics are taking place, \" one of the most inhospitable populated places on the planet \" in terms of weather. He explains that while pyeongchang lines up with mid-california latitude-wise, elevation and winds from siberia make it \" the coldest place in the world at such a southerly position. \" it's also unique in that it can see hurricane-force winds without there actually being a hurricane.

        "summary": "Maybe he just knew how to use it right. A new paper by pace university psychologist terence hines picks apart previous studies that claim to have identified that special something in the makeup of einstein's brain. Hines reviewed — and chipped away at — several prominent studies that looked at einstein's brain on a cellular level or in terms of its size and shape. In the case of the former, hines throws water on a 1985 study that found einstein's brain had a noticeably higher proportion of glial cells than those of control brains. The issue, per hines: the researchers reported on \" four different t-tests, \" only one of which \" was significant at the.05 level. \" in actuality, six other dependent measures were examined in four different brain areas during the study. That's a total of 28 comparisons, making that one \" significant \" result unsurprising. Discover reports that hines suggests a blind test be conducted, where unlabeled slides of einstein's brain are compared to slides from other brains to see if differences are clearly apparent. The posthumous saga of einstein's brain is rich in oddball details: the brain was saved from cremation during the scientist's 1955 autopsy by thomas harvey, who ended up losing his medical license ( due to a failed exam, not the brain theft ) and becoming drinking buddies with beat poet william burroughs, per national geographic; more odd facts here.",

So special that when he died in princeton hospital, on april 18, 1955, the pathologist on call, thomas harvey, stole it.

But harvey took the brain anyway, without permission from einstein or his family. \"when the fact came to light a few days later, harvey managed to solicit a reluctant and retroactive blessing from einstein's son, hans albert, with the now-familiar stipulation that any investigation would be conducted solely in the interest of science, \" burrell writes. Harvey soon lost his job at the princeton hospital and took the brain to philadelphia, where it was carved into 240 pieces and preserved in celloidin, a hard and rubbery form of cellulose.

On monday the cybersecurity startup tweeted it has a winner — an anonymous team, digital tech reports, that was able to set up an attack \" on a fully updated ios 9 device … remotely, reliably, silently, and without requiring any user interaction except visiting a web page or reading a sms/mms, \" per contest rules. That winning \" jailbreak \" now gives zerodium the ability to sell the hack to its choice of customers, which company founder chaouki bekrar tells wired include \" major corporations in defense, technology, and finance \" and \" government organizations in need of specific and tailored cybersecurity capabilities. \" bekrar says that two teams were actually neck and neck in racing to achieve the \" zero-day \" attack — finding a software vulnerability that the vendor doesn't even know about and then sneaking through that hole to plant a virus or other malware, per wired — \" but only one has made a full and remote jailbreak. … the other team made a partial jailbreak and they may qualify for a partial bounty. \" bekrar also says he has no plans to let apple in on the specific vulnerabilities so it can work up a patch, though he may do so \" later \" ( i.e., after his company has profited ). Wired points out that while zerodium selling software exploits isn't technically illegal, companies like it have been blasted as \" modern-day merchants of death \" for hawking \" the bullets for cyberwar, \" and bekrar himself has been called an \" ethically challenged opportunist \" by a google security team member.

        "summary": "Walking while texting can be dangerous — a fact that was recently reconfirmed in england. A 20-foot-high sculpture of two clasped hands that formed an archway over a path on the grounds of the salisbury cathedral in wiltshire had to be relocated because walkers kept bumping into it ( despite the 6 feet, 4 inches of clearance beneath the center of it ), the bbc reports. In a facebook post last week that showed \" the kiss \" being moved by crane, artist sophie ryder wrote the galvanized steel wire sculpture was moved \" because people were walking through texting and said they bumped their heads! oh well!! \" a cathedral official didn't specify texting as the issue, but said \" during the hours of darkness \" there were some incidents. The sculpture was installed earlier this month as part of an exhibit on the cathedral lawn, reports the telegraph; the show runs through july 3. The dangers of texting while walking are well documented. See: the woman who took an unintended dip in a frigid canal in birmingham, england ( her surname, ironically, was safe ), and the lady in pennsylvania who took a header into a shopping mall fountain. In 2014, more than 2,500 pedestrians ended up in the er for accidents related to cellphone distraction, fortune reports. That happened fewer than 250 times in 2006. Rather than pocketing their smartphones, however, pedestrians have developed a protective gait, according to npr. Researchers found that while navigating an obstacle course and using a smartphone, \" people actually slowed down and engaged in a more protective or cautious walking pattern, \" says an author of the study.

Locke went on to direct the 1986 movie ratboy, which didn't do well here but received critical applause overseas. Locke and eastwood's relationship famously combusted in 1989 when locke says he kicked her out of the home they shared, changing the locks. People reports she sued eastwood twice, and settled, twice over the next few years — once for palimony and once for fraud. Locke is survived by her husband, gordon anderson, whom she married in 1967 and never legally split from. Anderson was said to be gay, per imdb, but the two wed due to a \" spiritual kinship \" and stayed friends.",

        "summary": "Bigger is no longer better, at least when it comes to the extinction threat facing the animals who call our planet's oceans home. In a study published in science on wednesday, stanford researchers reveal what a press release calls an \" unprecedented pattern of extinction \": large-bodied marine animals, not smaller, are the ones now more vulnerable to extinction, and we're likely to blame for throwing the system into reverse. \" for every factor of 10 increase in body mass, the odds of being threatened by extinction go up by a factor of 13 or so, \" says co-author jonathan payne. The researchers looked at the interplay between extinction rates and four traits for 2,497 mollusks and marine vertebrates genera: its body size, sea floor vs. Open water living, predator vs. Not, and swimmer vs. Stationary. The los angeles times explains those relationships were examined over five mass extinction events over the past 445 million years; in essentially all of that time, size either wasn't a factor or smaller animals were a bit more likely to go extinct. But in the last 500 years comes the unprecedented shift: size is the now the leading factor, and significantly so. ( gizmodo reports that previously, the biggest factor was habitat, with those in open waters facing the greater threat. ) as for what's behind the reversal, the researchers have a hunch: \" after looking at the fossil record and then looking at fisheries studies, we can't think of anything but human hunting that might be the cause, \" says coauthor noel heim. The effects could be profound: \" a larger clam will mix more sediments than a smaller one, \" says heim, who recommends humans intervene to reverse the trend.",
