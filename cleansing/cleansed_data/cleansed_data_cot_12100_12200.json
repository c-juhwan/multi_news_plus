Throngs converged on the presidential palace in cairo today, despite the presence of tanks and republican guard troops, reports reuters. They chanted slogans such as \" leave! leave! \" — reminiscent of chants against the ousted hosni mubarak — but made no attempt to enter the palace itself. The huge demonstration came after opposition leaders rejected morsi's invitation to talks tomorrow. The morsi government did take one step today that might signal a willingness to budge, reports ap. Election officials postponed the start of early voting ( for those living abroad ) on the controversial draft constitution from tomorrow until wednesday. However, \" it was not immediately clear if the postponement was a concession or how that would affect the overall referendum timeline, \" notes ap. As of now, the main vote is still set for dec. 15, but opponents want morsi to delay it.",

The five-hundred-meter aperture spherical telescope — or fast, which takes the title of world's biggest telescope from the 300-meter arecibo observatory in puerto rico — officially opened on sunday and will now commence what could be three years of testing and calibration, npr reports. The 4,450-panel telescope is designed to detect radio waves emitted from distant galaxies as well as extraterrestrial life, and the discoveries have already begun: xinhua reports that the telescope detected a pulsar 1,351 light years away during a recent trial observation. The project was completed in five years at the cost of $ 180 million — plus the displacement of an estimated 9,000 villagers — and the ap notes that it could pay for itself: tourist facilities including an observation deck have been completed on a nearby mountain in guizhou province. The project is seen as a massive boost to china's scientific prestige, though the country's scientists will be collaborating with researchers worldwide, including scientists from the alien-hunting seti institute in the us, reports the new york times, which notes that xi jinping could now become the first world leader to send greetings to beings on another planet.

Goyal, m.d., m.s.c.e., director of research in the division of emergency medicine at children's national health system, was published online sept. 5, 2017 in pediatrics and echoes similar racial and ethnic differences in treating acute respiratory tract infections in the primary care",
            "Methods: this is a retrospective cohort study of encounters at 7 peds in 2013, in which we used electronic health data from the pediatric emergency care applied research network registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between patient race and ethnicity and antibiotics administered or prescribed among children discharged from the hospital with viral arti. Children with bacterial codiagnoses, chronic disease, or who were immunocompromised were excluded. Covariates included age, sex, insurance, triage level, provider type, emergency department type, and emergency department site. Background and objectives: in the primary care setting, there are racial and ethnic differences in antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (",
            "Page content article body parents need to know that using antibiotics when they are not the right medicine will not help and may even cause harm to children. Antibiotics are medicines used to treat infections and they target bacteria, not viruses. Before prescribing an antibiotic, your child's doctor will find out if it is the right medicine to treat your child's infection. Read on for answers from the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) to common questions about the use of antibiotics. Talk with your child's doctor if you have other questions. 1.

            "Hillary clinton's candidacy has provoked a wave of misogyny — one that may roil american life for years to come. Except for her gender, hillary clinton is a highly conventional presidential candidate. She's been in public life for decades. Her rhetoric is carefully calibrated. She tailors her views to reflect the mainstream within her party. The reaction to her candidacy, however, has been unconventional. The percentage of americans who hold a \"strongly unfavorable \" view of her substantially exceeds the percentage for any other democratic nominee since 1980, when pollsters began asking the question. Antipathy to her among white men is even more unprecedented. According to the public religion research institute, 52 percent of white men hold a \"very unfavorable \" view of clinton. That's a whopping 20 points higher than the percentage who viewed barack obama very unfavorably in 2012, 32 points higher than the percentage who viewed obama very unfavorably in 2008, and 28 points higher than the percentage who viewed john kerry very unfavorably in 2004."

        "summary": "Fourteen people overdosed on heroin laced with fentanyl in a span of just four hours wednesday in camden, new jersey, nbc philadelphia reports. While none of wednesday's overdoses in camden were fatal, buzzfeed — citing new data from the cdc — reports fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are now the leading cause of overdose deaths in the us, having killed more than 21,000 people last year. One epidemiologist calls those numbers \" shocking. \" fentanyl is about 50 times stronger than morphine and 10 times stronger than heroin. Researchers say the increase in overdose deaths — a jump of 21 % between 2015 and 2016 driven by fentanyl and synthetic opioids — is likely due to people buying heroin or counterfeit pain pills and not expecting the spike in potency. Opioids, including fentanyl, are reducing life expectancy in the us by 2.5 months, cnn reported last month. American life expectancy dropped in 2015 for the first time since 1993, and overdose deaths are thought to be the reason. Experts believe overdose deaths will continue to increase, at least in the near future. According to cdc estimates, more americans died of overdoses — the majority of which involved opioids — in 2016 than died in the vietnam war. President trump has called the situation a national emergency but has yet to officially declare it as such. ( this mom shared a photo of her dying son as a psa on the dangers of opioids. )",

It was messages between him and overall al-qaeda leader ayman al-zawahri that triggered us alarm. So who is he? some snippets from various stories: wuhayshi is 36 and runs al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula out of yemen. He recently got promoted to \" general manager \" of the al-qaeda operation — essentially the no. 2 position in the entire network. Cnn reports the move reflects the growing importance of him and his group. He served as osama bin laden's personal aide for years, possibly even during the time of the 9/11 attacks, reports the wall street journal. Bin laden personally groomed him for a leading role in the terror organization. Wuhayshi fled to iran from afghanistan in 2001, then got extradited to yemen, reports the new york times. He escaped in 2006, eventually establishing aqap in 2009. He modeled the group on bin laden's structure, but ordered subordinates to swear allegiance to him, says a georgetown expert. ( still, he is said to have a \" soft-spoken, humble \" manner similar to bin laden, and is well-liked by his fighters, says the cnn profile. ) his group has carried out, or at least tried, some of al-qaeda's most high-profile attacks. That includes the failed underwear bomber plot in 2009.",

            "By paul cruickshank cnn terrorism analyst there may be a link between what sources tell cnn is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against u.s and western interests by al qaeda's affiliate in yemen and the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader as the new general manager of the global al qaeda network. Seth jones, a senior analyst at the rand corporation, told cnn's barbara starr on friday that there are indications that nasir al wuhayshi, the yemeni leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ), had recently been appointed into the role by al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri. The appointment would effectively thrust wuhayshi, a yemeni national, into the no. 2 position in the global al qaeda terrorist network, a position previously held by the libyan abu yahya al libi before his death in a drone strike in pakistan in june 2012. It would also provide a broader foundation to al qaeda's top leadership at a time when the center of gravity of the group has shifted from the afghanistan-pakistan region to the arab world. And it would potentially allow the group to retap fund-raising opportunities for the group in saudi arabia and other gulf countries where wuhayshi is more popular than zawahiri, al qaeda's less charismatic and sometimes divisive egyptian leader. Wuhayshi's appointment would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between the aqap and al qaeda central. Given al qaeda's past track record, that would most likely have involved couriers traveling back and forth between yemen and pakistan, where zawahiri is presumed to be hiding. This would have given wuhayshi plenty of opportunity to inform zawahiri of any plan in the works to hit american targets in the region. This possible foreknowledge in turn may explain zawahiri's impassioned plea in a message posted on jihadist websites earlier this week for followers to hit american targets in the middle east and beyond.

            "By paul cruickshank cnn terrorism analyst there may be a link between what sources tell cnn is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against u.s and western interests by al qaeda's affiliate in yemen and the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader as the new general manager of the global al qaeda network. Seth jones, a senior analyst at the rand corporation, told cnn's barbara starr on friday that there are indications that nasir al wuhayshi, the yemeni leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ), had recently been appointed into the role by al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri. The appointment would effectively thrust wuhayshi, a yemeni national, into the no. 2 position in the global al qaeda terrorist network, a position previously held by the libyan abu yahya al libi before his death in a drone strike in pakistan in june 2012. It would also provide a broader foundation to al qaeda's top leadership at a time when the center of gravity of the group has shifted from the afghanistan-pakistan region to the arab world. And it would potentially allow the group to retap fund-raising opportunities for the group in saudi arabia and other gulf countries where wuhayshi is more popular than zawahiri, al qaeda's less charismatic and sometimes divisive egyptian leader. Wuhayshi's appointment would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between the aqap and al qaeda central.

The paper reports on a remarkable display of kindness and respect for americans who died fighting the nazis — consideration that continues seven decades after the us selected a fruit orchard on the outskirts of the village of 1,500 as a place to lay some of our dead to rest. The first graves were dug in november 1944, two months after the nazi occupation of margraten ended; the next few months saw as many as 500 new bodies arrive daily, swelling the 65-acre netherlands american cemetery's population to 18,949, reports the holland sentinel. Many were returned home in 1948; 8,301 remain, among them, four women, per the sentinel: two red cross workers and two flight nurses. Every one of the graves that remain has been adopted, either by a family ( most, but not all, of them dutch ), local school, business, or military outfit who visit it on days such as memorial day, christmas, and the first and last day of the soldier's life. Some graves are \" passed down \" to a family's next generation; there's even a waiting list for those wanting to adopt a grave. Yesterday saw some 6,000 people — including dutch prime minister mark rutte, notes the ap — attend a ceremony there, as they have done since may 30, 1945.

            "Kabul suicide bombers attacked a compound housing westerners in kabul on wednesday hours after u.s. President barack obama signed a security pact during a short visit to a city that remains vulnerable to a resilient insurgency. The taliban claimed responsibility for the attack which involved a car bomb and insurgents disguised as women on the eastern outskirts of the capital, killing seven people, a gurkha guard and six passers-by, and wounding 17. The taliban said it was in response to obama's visit and to the strategic partnership deal he signed with afghan president hamid karzai, a pact that sets out a long-term u.s. Role after most foreign combat troops leave by the end of 2014. The insurgency also claimed their spring offensive, which began two weeks ago with attacks in kabul, would be renewed on thursday, despite a security clamp-down in the capital. Obama's visit came a year after u.s. Special forces troops killed al qaeda leader osama bin laden, the architect of the september 11, 2001, attacks, in a raid in neighboring pakistan. In a televised address to the american people from a base north of kabul, he said the war in afghanistan was winding down. \" as we emerge from a decade of conflict abroad and economic crisis at home, it's time to renew america, \" obama said, speaking against a backdrop of"

A georgetown university team says its \" highly sensitive and specific test \" can identify people in their 70s who are likely to develop alzheimer's in the next two to three years, reports the bbc. They tested levels of 10 fats in the blood to get results they say are 90 % accurate. It's already possible to spot the disease early with mri scans or spinal taps, but the researchers say a quick and easy test could be a \" game changer \" that will help efforts to find ways to slow down or stop the disease. If larger-scale tests confirm the breakthrough, many seniors will have to ask themselves whether they are prepared to face what the lead researcher calls test results that \" could be life-altering, \" npr finds. No cure for alzheimer's exists, and while knowing they will soon develop the disease would help people plan ahead for their needs, they would face major questions of stigma and identity, medical ethicist notes. \" how will other people interact with you if they learn that you have this information? \" he says. \" and how will you think about your own brain and your sort of sense of self? \"",

The tweet, since deleted, came from the parts unknown account, which shared an article and said, \" embrace the newfies as they are. \" the show apologized after several readers weighed in that the term is considered a slur; the show also made clear bourdain wasn't involved in the tweet and said it would \" stick to newfoundlanders going forward. \" james baker, a sociologist at ontario's mcmaster university, discussed the word's origins with the cbc last year. He said it may have been born during wwii when the us was building a naval base on newfoundland's avalon peninsula and a lieutenant used the word derisively to describe locals who had quit the project. Others have run afoul of the term. Walmart, for example, was criticized when it sold t-shirts with \" newfie \" on them and at least one politician has gotten into trouble for using the term. Baker notes that newfoundlanders are more likely to take offense when the word is used by outsiders and on social media. But acceptance of the word is growing and younger newfoundlanders are even using it as a term of endearment. Linguistics professor paul de decker of memorial university of newfoundland tells globalnews, \" it would be great if we're now at the time, and maybe this is one episode...

        "summary": "As nebraska becomes the 19th state to abolish capital punishment, researchers out of kansas state university have been investigating just what makes some americans more fervently in favor of the death penalty than others. One clear factor, they report in the journal personality and individual differences, is whether someone believes in the existence of pure evil. Those who do tend to be in favor of killing people who've confessed to the crime, regardless of whether the perpetrator outwardly displayed evil or non-evil character traits. \" if they believed in pure evil, it didn't matter the characteristics; they were more likely to support the death penalty or life in prison, \" study co-author donald saucier tells the topeka capital-journal. To test this, the researchers surveyed 212 general psychology students at kansas state, all of whom had to rate their level of belief in pure evil, defined as involving sadistic motivations. The students then read one of two fictitious newspaper articles about a murder. Both involved a confession on the part of \" mr. Beatty, \" but he was depicted as two different kinds of criminal: in one version, he was interested in the occult and cruel to children; in the other article, he was a family man who enjoyed camping. Those who believe in pure evil were more likely to want either version of beatty killed. Why? in a word, demonization, say the researchers. As saucier explains to smithsonian, people who believe in pure evil will \" just say, 'you know what? that person did something horrible, which makes that person evil. They are a demon, and we need to get rid of them. ' \" ( read the \" untold story \" of the very botched execution in oklahoma. )",

Considering it was also the very last to decommission the electric chair as its sole method of execution — finally repealing the practice in february 2008 — the news surprised many who had previously viewed nebraska as a quiet midwestern state firmly aligned with republican views. Critics nationwide praised the bill's passage as a rare example of bipartisanship, and many hinted that conservative support for capital punishment may be waning. But the u.s. As a whole is still at odds with international opinion — recently it was one of just 38 nations to oppose a un resolution calling for an international moratorium on the death penalty.

Just weeks before britain entered wwii, the former prime minister penned an essay titled are we alone in the universe?, the bbc reports. His answer: probably not. \" i for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that i am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures, \" churchill wrote in the never-published and recently discovered essay. According to nature, churchill wrote — years before the discovery of exoplanets — that he was \" not sufficiently conceited \" to think there aren't other, possibly life-supporting planets circling stars outside our solar system. Churchill's essay, written in 1939 and revised in the 1950s, was discovered last year in missouri's national churchill museum and handed over to astrophysicist mario livio, who wrote about it this week. Livio says churchill uses the \" logic of a scientist \" in the essay, which discusses the importance of liquid water and describes what are now known as \" goldilocks \" zones, the new york times reports. That's not surprising, as churchill was immensely interested in science in general and space in particular. He was the first british prime minister to have a science adviser, funded telescopes, and even instructed the royal air force to cover up a potential ufo sighting. Livio says it's \" moving \" to see a leader involved in science when so many current politicians \" shun \" it.",

For starters, manning wants to start hormone therapy immediately in preparation for a sex-change operation, but fort leavenworth says neither option is available to inmates at the all-male facility. \" i ' m gonna change that, \" says manning attorney david coombs. The army deems sex-change surgery to be elective and thus would not cover the cost, reports politico. Could manning foot the bill? maybe, says a spokesperson for the army medical command, but that decision would be in the hands of fort leavenworth. Court cases have established a precedent for federal inmates to receive transgender medical care, but manning is out of luck because leavenworth is a military prison, explains cns. On a different note, slate blogger amanda marcotte thinks the media should immediately honor manning's wish to be called a she instead of a he. \" even if you disagree with manning's actions and believe she deserves the harsh sentence she received, her gender identity had nothing to do with her crimes, \" writes marcotte. \" most people don't have to transition under as much scrutiny as manning has suffered; all of us making the switch graciously can help make things slightly easier for her. \" ( wikipedia is already on board. )",

        "summary": "The tiny eastern mosquitofish, indigenous to the southern and eastern us, is unlike much of the rest of the animal kingdom when it comes to reproduction, starting with the differing objectives of the females and males of the species. Because they have to bear the burden of actually carrying the offspring, the females are typically picky about potential partners. But since the males don't have that problem, they're out to get busy as often as possible — except instead of trying to seduce females, the males attack, sometimes up to 1,000 times a day, reports live science. Each male uses its gonopodium, an anal fin that's the fish version of a penis and which is inserted into the female to fertilize the eggs inside her body ( most other fish use an external fertilization process called spawning, releasing eggs and sperm into the water ). Now researchers report in the proceedings of the royal society b that when faced with males whose gonopodia are large, the brains of females get bigger. It's all part of what's known in evolutionary biology circles as \" sexual conflict, \" where one sex has evolved a feature that's not mutually beneficial, so the other sex evolves some countermeasure, reports phys.org. In the case of mosquitofish, when scientists artificially selected for males with larger genitalia, females responded by getting smarter as they worked to avoid the attacking males and maintain some semblance of selection — so much so that in just nine generations their brains were 6.5 % heavier than females thrown in with males sporting smaller genitals. Male brains, meanwhile, didn't change in size, which surprised the researchers, who thought chasing the females would be similarly \" cognitively demanding. \" the findings hint at the possibility that sexual conflict can in fact lead to the evolution of bigger brains, though whether this applies to other species is for future research. ( our brains appear to be part male and part female. )",

Introduced on the network oct. 8 as a former navy seal who served in vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two purple hearts, john garofalo has since admitted to the military times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift president trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the fox segment. But he was never a seal, he never served in vietnam, and he didn't earn all those commendations, not even a single purple heart.

        "summary": "As the supreme court starts its new term monday and the gossip mill restarts on who will fill antonin scalia's empty seat, there's at least one other judge's chair that's not being willingly relinquished in the near future. Ruth bader ginsburg sat down for an interview with npr to talk about her new book, my own words, which comes out tuesday. The 300-page compilation features the justice's best writings — from a high school editorial she penned to what the ap calls some of her \" spiciest \" dissenting opinions — and even a few photos ( don't miss seeing her take on an elliptical machine ). This book, whose selections were hand-picked by ginsburg and her two authorized biographers, was supposed to come out after a biography on her. But in the npr interview last month, ginsburg — who politico points out is the oldest justice on the court at age 83 and often the subject of speculation about when she ' ll step down — tipped her hand on her retirement plans, noting her biographers wanted her court tenure to be near completion before they published the biography, and so they chose \" to flip the order \" of the books. When prodded a bit more, she replied ( perhaps much to donald trump's chagrin ), \" i will retire when it's time. And, when is it time? when i can't do the job full-steam. \" check out the npr piece for more on what's in rbg's new book, including the scoop on her sleep habits and the one thing that made her cry in front of interviewer nina totenberg this summer. ( need advice on how to live? ginsburg offered some in sunday's new york times. )",

Sources tell the wall street journal that trump and members of his inner circle are urging jared kushner, who is married to ivanka trump, to join the administration as a senior adviser or something similar. A 1967 law bans public officials from hiring relatives — including sons-in-law or daughters-in-law — to agencies they have authority over. Sources tell the new york times that kushner has spoken to lawyers about the issue and believes he could join the trump white house and remain on the right side of the law if he refuses a salary and distances himself from his real estate holdings. Norman l. Eisen, president obama's ethics counsel during his transition, tells the times that the law \" would seem to block out kushner flatly \" and trump \" would be treading upon very serious statutory and constitutional grounds \" if he tries to find a way around the law. \" on the very hardest calls that confront a president, you want the president's adviser to remember that their oath or affirmation to the constitution comes first, before family ties, \" eisen says. Kushner is a \" kindred spirit \" to trump, politico finds in a profile of the 35-year-old real estate baron.

            "Jared kushner had a meeting scheduled with a new york city councilman from brooklyn. He just didn't seem to know exactly why. It was october 2013 and kushner and a group of investors had just purchased five brooklyn warehouse properties for $ 375 million — an eye-popping $ 50 million more than the seller expected to get. His idea was to replace the buildings with gleaming, high-end residential towers. The hitch: the plan required an onerous rezoning process and multiple layers of city approval, including a green light from local councilman steve levin. Story continued below the two shot the breeze in kushner's fifth avenue office — they talked about new jersey, where they both grew up, and brooklyn, where they both wanted to burnish their names. Kushner recommended an eatery in williamsburg. Levin told him about glasserie, an airy cocktail lounge in greenpoint. But levin then grew puzzled about whether kushner — the scion of a new jersey real estate empire who has emerged as an improbable power broker inside his father-in-law donald trump's transition team — understood the political levers that needed to be pulled. \"it was a weird meeting because it seemed like he didn't understand why he was meeting steve and what the significance was, \" recalled one person familiar with the meeting. \"steve had to explain to him, 'if you're going for a residential rezoning, i have to approve it.'the reaction was, 'oh, interesting. ' \" \"a head-scratching experience, \" was how the person described the meeting, which left many in the industry gossiping about how kushner had plunked down so much money without fully understanding the giant hurdles ahead. Kushner, apparently, saw the meeting simply as a courtesy, as he talked with other city officials who he thought carried more weight. But the outcome was clear — after the luxury condo towers proved too difficult to push through, kushner scrapped the plan and instead focused on signing commercial tenants.

It was based on interviews with current but anonymous members of seal team 6, co-authored by a former seal sniper, and produced by sofrep.com, a site run by former commandos. \"how was he repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service? \" a passage of no easy op asks. \"he was ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to virginia from a training operation. \" no easy op calls bissonnette an \" operator's operator \" and says he probably did not disclose any vital information in no easy day. But it also criticizes bissonnette for not submitting his book for pentagon review, as well as seal culture in general, which is considered much more arrogant than other special forces. The authors also suggest that blowback from the high-profile leaks from seal team 6 could create major policy changes across the special forces.",

The first announcement, which garnered the majority of the attention, was the list of astronauts slated to be the first ever to venture into space aboard commercial rockets. The second, however, tempered the excitement -- acknowledging that the planned launch of these missions has been delayed due to some setbacks in the manned space programs of both boeing and spacex.

It's the other part that's generating national headlines: ed michawlowski, 43, accuses state treasurer dan rutherford of sexual harassment, reports the chicago sun-times. Among other things, he accuses rutherford of grabbing his genitals during a staff retreat at rutherford's house. Rutherford has angrily denied the allegations, which he calls politically motivated. He vows to stay in the gop primary, but one analyst tells ap that the allegations might doom him considering that social conservatives tend to turn out in state primaries. \" this kind of accusation from another man is just going to be devastating to rutherford with a lot of those voters, \" he says. \" there's just no other way to portray this. \" the frontrunner is venture capitalist bruce rauner, and rutherford has been running at no. 2.

Fast-fashion basically means overproducing cheap clothing, which can be good for consumers but not so good for workers and the environment. ( last week tonight with john oliver explains the problems with fast-fashion here. ) now, the swedish clothing giant is trying to address some of those criticisms of fast-fashion by offering a $ 1.2 million annual prize for new innovations in recycled clothing, reuters reports. Cotton can be reused, but it's inefficient, and recycled cotton produces poor-quality fabric. And there's currently no good way to recycle mixed-material clothing at all. In addition to adding mass amounts of cheap, lightly worn clothing to landfills, h&m is concerned with future shortages in resources, such as cotton, which requires large amounts of water and pesticides, according to reuters. The project manager for h&m's global challenge award — launched today — tells the guardian shoppers aren't going to stop buying clothes, so companies need to figure out how to reduce the waste from making new garments. But critics say the contest is just a clever way for the retailer to avoid dealing with the actual problem of overproduction. \" [ their ] model only works if they encourage very frequent purchases, but the consumers are aware of the increasing effect it has on the environment, \" one expert tells reuters.",

        "summary": "Accurately measuring the age of low-mass, hydrogen burning stars is notoriously difficult, but now astronomers say they have come up with a technique for measuring those difficult stars using white dwarfs, reports the la times. A white dwarf is a star that has burned through all of its hydrogen, shed its outer layers, and become a dense lump of carbon and oxygen, and astronomers consider them relatively simple objects to measure. Jason kalirai from baltimore's space telescope science institute compared newly formed white dwarfs from the inner halo of the milky way with a well-studied cluster of stars called messier 4. Because more massive stars burn faster, kalirai was able to calculate how old the stars were that became the white dwarfs. From there, he was able to figure out how old the stars in the inner halo were: 11.4 billion years ( plus or minus 700 million years ). \" if we want to assess when components of the milky way formed, we need the ages of the stars, \" said kalirai.

The halo is composed mostly of very old stars, for which scientists have had a hard time establishing a precise age using traditional techniques that rely on measurements of brightness and temperature.to get his sharper age estimate, kalirai first looked at light from newly formed white dwarf stars in messier 4, a nearby cluster of stars known to be about 12.5 billion years old.

Here i report observations of newly formed white dwarf stars in the halo of the milky way, and a separate analysis of archival data in the well studied 12.5-billion-year-old globular cluster messier 4. I measure the mass distribution of the remnant stars and invert the stellar evolution process to develop a mathematical relation that links this final stellar mass to the mass of their immediate progenitors, and therefore to the age of the parent population.

Now a warning has been issued by the consumer product safety commission about some of its top-loading washing machines, which nearly two dozen consumers since last year say have exploded, abc news reports. \" in rare cases, affected units may experience abnormal vibrations that could pose a risk of personal injury or property damage when washing bedding, bulky or water-resistant items, \" samsung says in a statement about possibly affected units made between march 2011 and april 2016. The issue that's supposedly causing the problem, per an attorney for customers now suing samsung in federal court: the machine's tub breaking free of its restraints during the spin cycle because of faulty support equipment. Georgia's melissa thaxton found that out firsthand when her machine blew apart in april while she was right next to it. \" it was the loudest sound. It sounded like a bomb went off in my ear, \" she tells abc. \" there were wires, nuts, the cover actual was... On the floor. \" samsung says it's working with the cpsc to address the problem, but in the interim, the company suggests throwing those previously mentioned washable items in the delicate cycle, which so far hasn't been reported as causing any issues.

( priya mathew/the washington post ) groups seeking to protest in the nation's capital on the day of — and the days around — the inauguration of president-elect donald trump say they are being kept in limbo because officials have yet to issue permits for demonstrations. About 20 groups — including the women's march on washington, people's action and the answer coalition — have applied to demonstrate on federal property around the jan. 20 event. But the national park service, which handles permitting, said it does not grant any requests until the presidential inaugural committee, which plans the parade and other events to usher in the new president, maps out where it will hold inauguration-related activities. Although each incoming president is afforded the same courtesy, the issue is attracting special attention this year since the bitter election emboldened more people to organize to support their causes.

About 20 groups — including the women's march on washington, people's action and the answer coalition — have applied to demonstrate on federal property around the jan. 20 event. But the national park service, which handles permitting, said it does not grant any requests until the presidential inaugural committee, which plans the parade and other events to usher in the new president, maps out where it will hold inauguration-related activities. Although each incoming president is afforded the same courtesy, the issue is attracting special attention this year since the bitter election emboldened more people to organize to support their causes.

That's because homosexual married couples can now take advantage of the same maximizing strategies heterosexual married couples can when claiming and filing. The article uses one fictitious couple as a case study and explains that, just by collecting social security benefits as a married couple rather than as two single people, they can boost lifetime benefits by $ 140,832 ( because the longer-surviving spouse will receive spousal and survivor benefits based on his partner's earnings ).

        "summary": "An attempted military coup in turkey over the weekend that killed hundreds was put down, but more details continue to trickle out — and this one has some scratching their heads. As president recep tayyip erdogan jetted back to istanbul from his vacation in marmaris during the uprising, rebel fighter jets apparently had his airplane right on their radar, an ex-military officer with \" knowledge of the events \" tells reuters. \" at least two f-16s harassed erdogan's plane while it was in the air, \" he says. \" they locked their radars on his plane and on two other f-16s protecting him. Why they didn't fire is a mystery. \" at least two senior turkish officials acknowledged there had been an incident involving erdogan's aircraft, with one simply noting the plane had been \" in trouble in the air. \" flight tracker data shows a gulfstream iv plane like the one owned by the country's government had taken off from an airport near marmaris late friday night and then circled outside of istanbul, where sounds of gunfire could still be heard, before eventually touching down. One of the officials also says erdogan had \" evaded death by minutes \" in the resort town of marmaris, with local media saying about 25 coup troops had descended from choppers on ropes and infiltrated a hotel to try to abduct him ( he had already fled ). Haaretz notes erdogan's vacation home was bombed after he had left, per reports. One of the officials also noted prime minister binali yildirim was a target during the coup but just barely got away in istanbul. The wall street journal documents erdogan's tech savvy during the coup, including how he sent a text message during the turmoil to every cellphone in the country and used facetime to speak to turkish citizens.",

            "Westminster, colo. - westminster police say a 16-year-old boy who walked into the cafeteria at standley lake high school early monday, and set himself on fire, was trying to commit suicide. Sixty students were in the cafeteria at the time and may have witnessed the horrific scene said jefferson county public schools spokeswoman lynn setzer. She said there were others in the hallway who also may have seen the incident through windows. Sources say the teenager was burned over 80 percent of his body and is in critical condition at a local hospital. Investigators spent most of the day monday interviewing witnesses and the teenager's friends to try to find out why he set himself ablaze. They're also focusing on messages the boy posted on his facebook page and one sent out via his cellphone. When asked if the boy intended to harm anyone else, westminster police spokeswoman cheri spottke replied, \" we have no evidence of that. \" after the boy used an accelerant to set himself ablaze, two school staffers grabbed a fire extinguisher and put the fire out, spottke said. She said a cafeteria worker suffered minor cuts while breaking the glass to grab the extinguisher.

The westminster high school was open tuesday only for students to come back and retrieve items they may have left behind in the evacuation. Classes remained cancelled, but counseling services were being offered for students. A 16-year-old sophomore walked into the school around 7 a.m. On monday, and used a one-gallon can of coleman fuel. \"i saw this explosion happening in the lunch room, \" leif samson said. \" everyone started running out screaming, 'fire! ' i just grabbed my backpack and ran upstairs, and i looked out the windows overlooking the cafeteria. That's when i found out it was a guy on fire. \" two employees used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire quickly, according to westminster police spokeswoman cheryl spottke, but not before the student suffered severe burns. One of the first emergency responders estimated he had third degree burns over 80 percent of his body.

With a lawsuit filed late last month, the pearson family members foundation aims to reclaim what would be the third-largest donation in the university's history, including $ 22.9 million paid out so far, on the basis that the university hasn't held up its end of the bargain. Brothers thomas and timothy pearson argue the 2015 donation was to be used to create the pearson institute, a research center aimed at resolving violence around the world, with a director and four professorships, reports the chicago tribune. Two years later, they say positions have been filled by under-qualified candidates or no one at all. They also take issue with budgeting decisions and say the university failed to plan an annual forum as required.

Such complaints have \" caused the foundation to lose all confidence that the u of c is an appropriate or capable steward of the pearson family legacy, \" the suit states. But u of c is hitting back against the \" baseless \" complaint.

            "A family foundation that gave the university of chicago $ 100 million in 2015 to fund research aimed at reducing conflict around the world is suing the school for breach of contract and accusing the university of incompetence and deception. The pearson family members foundation, led by thomas pearson and his brother timothy, hopes to recoup the $ 22.9 million it has already given the school to create the pearson institute.

            "The donation to the university of chicago in 2015 was as generous as it was ambitious: the pearson family members foundation pledged an eye-popping $ 100 million to establish a center devoted to finding new ways to resolve global conflicts. Nearly three years later, that donation is in disarray. The foundation, led by thomas pearson and his brother timothy pearson, is suing the university to recoup the $ 22.9 million it has already handed over, saying the university's leaders have failed to demonstrate they are using the landmark gift for its intended purpose. They say the university, among other shortcomings, has failed to hire a full-time daily director to oversee the institute, develop academic curriculum, hire high-quality faculty or schedule the institute's annual forum as stipulated by the gift agreement, according to the lawsuit. \"as a result of having breached its obligations and having engaged in deliberate misrepresentations over a period of more than two years, the u.

If that's not impressive enough for a company still in its infancy, boxed — which was specifically designed for mobile platforms — was created by a small team of 10 engineers and project managers, most of whom worked on mobile games first. Of the app and e-commerce platform: \" it was actually a lot easier to build than a game, \" says ceo chieh huang. So how'd they do it? boxed currently sells just 600 popular items, staying away from heavy stuff like dog food, ordered wholesale directly from manufacturers. It doesn't re-package goods before shipping them to customers from rented warehouses in either new jersey or las vegas, and ups handles the shipping. As for the software, they built it from scratch. \" online, there's not many things per unit that are cheaper than what we sell right now, \" huang says. The next step is to put a system in place that offers to re-supply goods automatically. You may never have to stand in line for toilet paper again, says huang.",

The death toll in the most lethal building fire in the u.s. In more than a decade was not expected to go higher. A refrigerator was a potential source of the fire, but it was too soon to say for sure, said jill snyder, special agent in charge of the san francisco office of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. Snyder said investigators were looking at \" anything electrical \" on the first floor of the warehouse near the origin of the blaze. \" we have no indication that this was intentionally set, \" she said.

But holding the city liable for civil claims stemming from the tragedy may be nearly impossible, even if evidence grows that it failed to act on warnings about the fruitvale district warehouse, experts say.

Ormerod demanded an inquiry after egypt's tourism ministry initially cited \" respiratory failure, \" per the express. On wednesday, egyptian general prosecutor nabil sadek said 69-year-old john died of acute intestinal dysentery caused by e.coli, the same bacteria likely responsible for his 63-year-old wife's deadly infection, per the bbc. Sadek also said tests showed nothing unusual in the hotel's air or water and no toxic or harmful gas emissions or leaks in the couple's room. However, specialists commissioned by thomas cook, a travel company associated with the hotel, \" identified a high level of e.coli and staphylococcus bacteria \" related to food and hygiene standards, per sky. That should've come as no surprise, according to a 29-year-old british woman. Elizabeth austin tells the sun she was compensated by thomas cook after contracting e.coli at the same hotel in january. But ormerod says it's \" unheard of that someone dies of e.coli in such a short space of time, \" and describes a strange smell in her parents ' room at the all-inclusive resort.

Leaders from dozens of countries have paid heartfelt tributes to nelson mandela, who has died at the age of 95, and newspapers worldwide have turned their front pages into full-page tributes to the south african leader, reports the washington post. Books of condolences have been opened at south african embassies around the world, where flowers and other tributes piled up overnight. After south african president jacob zuma announced mandela's death late last night, crowds gathered within minutes to sing and dance in front of his former home in soweto. At daybreak, many more people poured into city streets to mourn the man zuma called his country's greatest son, the bbc reports. The country now has a long period of national mourning ahead — as well as the challenge of hosting one of the biggest state funerals in history, which will be held in qunu, the remote village where he grew up. Days before the funeral, a ceremony will be held at a 95,000-seater stadium outside johannesburg.",

Researchers assigned volunteers to take part in simulated dialogues that were either sarcastic, sincere, or neutral, then gave them tasks to test creativity. Those who were involved in sarcastic exchanges did better on the tasks. \" the research suggests sarcasm, used with care and in moderation, can be effectively used and trigger some creative sparks, \" researcher francesca gino writes in scientific american. According to the harvard gazette, this is the first time sarcasm has been shown to be beneficial for the recipient. According to the study, researchers think the reason for the boost in creativity is that sarcasm engages abstract thinking. The brain has to work harder to make the jump between literal and intended meanings when using or listening to sarcasm, scientific american reports. But people hoping for more creativity should be careful with sarcasm — which the gazette notes comes from the greek and latin for \" to tear flesh \" — because it can create conflict and hurt relationships. According to the study, people who already trust each other can safely reap the benefits of sarcasm without creating conflict. And the researchers hope organizations and even bosses take note. \"instead of discouraging workplace sarcasm completely...

The salt lake tribune reports that low was also criticized last month when he allowed vallejo to remain free on bail after his conviction, despite the prosecutor's request to have him jailed until sentencing.

Then came his remarkable fall: a year later, he was overwhelmed by debt before being accused of insider trading. Today, batista is one of six men housed in a single cell at bandeira stampa public prison in rio de janeiro, his expensive head of hair ( thanks to implants ) now shaven off. Getting him there wasn't easy, reports the new york times. Batista, accused of offering rio's state governor $ 16.5 million in bribes as part of a widespread corruption scandal, was nowhere to be found when authorities showed up to arrest him at his mansion on thursday. Batista was instead in new york, where he'd flown two days earlier despite an order for his arrest, for what his lawyer says was a business trip. After he was put on an interpol wanted list, batista told reporters sunday that he was heading home to \" help clean things up \" and \" respond to the justice system, as is my duty. \" as soon as he touched down in brazil monday, batista was taken to ary franco prison — described as a filthy \" dungeon \" with double the number of prisoners it was built to house — before being moved to bandeira stampa, or bangu 9, which is less crowded. The bbc reports he will be kept in a cell with six other inmates. At bangu, inmates typically sleep on concrete beds and share a squat toilet. Batista maintains he's done nothing wrong and says \" prosecutors are cleaning up brazil in a fantastic way. \"",

Experts say improved blood flow to the fetus might play a role in any benefit of left-sided sleep, although that remains a theory. The report is published in the june 14 online edition of the bmj.

That's important — tebow can't afford to let any morally questionable decisions chip away at his squeaky-clean image. And can you blame him? agron is gorgeous. She would certainly take his mind off his likely departure from the broncos, which may result in him taking a career demotion and sitting on another team's bench as a backup quarterback. Methinks tebow could use some good news right about now — or maybe agron humming some hymns in his ear and telling him everything will be okay.
