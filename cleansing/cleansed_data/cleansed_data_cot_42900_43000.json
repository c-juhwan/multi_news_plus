        "summary": "Chalk up one more health advantage for the rich over the poor: more sleep. Researchers in colombia crunched data about the movement of residents in medellin and manizales and found some interesting patterns, they report in royal society open science. For instance, rich and poor people traveled longer distances to get to work than the middle class, but their journeys were much different. Poorer residents left their homes at 5 or 6am and followed indirect routes — likely because they're walking parts of the way and then taking public transportation, reports ars technica. Richer residents, on the other hand, left about 7am and traveled direct routes because they're driving cars ( or being driven ). The same applied on the return trip. The chart breaking down low-income commutes looks like a graph of \" relatively poor wiring, \" write the researchers. But as wealth increases, so does travel efficiency, all of which \" translates to substantially more sleep for the wealthy, \" notes a post at boing boing. In effect, the rich are able to buy more sleep than the poor, and the consequences go beyond the physical, writes roheeni saxena at ars technica: \" this is sobering because it suggests that possessing wealth is a self-perpetuating state. The poor, who spend more time stuck in transit, have less opportunity to increase their income. \" she sees one potential remedy: better public transit. ( your body will pay when you skimp on sleep. )",

            "Being poor comes with many inadvertent costs, while being rich comes with unexpected benefits. For example, poor people are more likely to be in ill health and have poor dental hygiene, which may cost more money in the long run. In contrast, wealthy people can afford to spend money to maintain their ideal level of fitness. A recent article published in royal society open science analyzes another advantage the rich have over the poor: wealthy people are able to sleep until later in the morning. In essence, the rich buy the ability to rest more and commute more efficiently. The paper in question uses data from human mobility studies, which examine large data sets of human movements in search of patterns at particular times of the day or year. This study uses survey response data from the colombian cities of manizales and medellin. The authors separate their population into six different socioeconomic strata to look at finely tuned differences in economic status. This is possible because, in colombia, households are legally assigned to a different economic strata according to their physical and environmental characteristics.

Sleep deprivation is well-understood to cause cognitive impairment and physical illness. Poor commuters in the study leave their homes later, and return later, than rich ones, suggesting that their livelihoods are at odds with their ability to sleep. In addition to these spatial patterns, the authors are also interested in temporal patterns. So they look at the times of day when people in the different groups are likely to travel. The researchers were surprised to find that the timing of movement is also closely linked to socioeconomic status. They saw that as socioeconomic class increases, every morning's peak transit time moved to later and later in the day. So people with the lowest status had peak morning transit times around 5am or 6am, whereas those with higher incomes didn't peak until nearly 7am.

Yet five siblings in a family of 19 in hatay, turkey, walk not just primarily but only on all fours, and lack the balance to do otherwise. Since the siblings were first discovered by scientists in 2005 — and featured in a bbc documentary in 2006 — one popular explanation of their unusual quadrupedal gait was \" reverse evolution \" — meaning they could be living proof that we can essentially devolve. But new research published this week suggests that theory is false, and that the condition is instead an adaptation to a rare disorder, reports the washington post. While 14 of the ulas family siblings are fine, five have uner tan syndrome, named after the turkish evolutionary biologist who first studied them; they suffer from reduced balance and cognition. ( when tan in his first study asked them the year, the five siblings replied: \" 80, \" \" 90, \" animals, \" \" july, \" and \" house. \" ) their resulting gait, which differs from other primates in that it is lateral instead of diagonal and involves putting weight on wrists instead of knuckles, is actually a sign of adaptation to help cope with a loss of balance, the new research suggests. The family is protective of the oft-ridiculed siblings, and the four sisters mostly stay indoors and crochet, while their brother is reported to be more adventurous. All move gracefully, even down stairs. ( click to read about a gruesome mystery disease that appears to affect just one family on the entire planet. )",

            "A man from a family with 19 children walking on his hands and feet in hatay, turkey, in 2005. ( anatolian/reuters ) in a village of dirt roads and stone dwellings just north of the turkey-syria border, a slight rain falls as a hunched man clad in black wobbles down the pavement. At first glance, as seen in a bbc documentary, he appears inebriated. He clings to a stone wall to his left and lurches uneasily. But then he slowly lowers his hands, encased in green slippers, to the muddy ground. Gingerly, he begins to walk away and out of the frame — on all fours. The man is one of five children in a religious family bedeviled by an unusual condition that has flummoxed and fascinated scientists since the scientific community first discovered them in 2005. The parents are normal. But five of their progeny are quadrupedal. They walk appendages down, bottom in the air. Earlier theories held the family's gait signaled a devolution to our primate ancestry, but fresh research published wednesday claims those earlier theories had it all wrong. It's not devolution. It's adaptation to an unforeseen and rare disorder. An undated photo of a woman walking on her hands and feet in hatay.

            "Published on dec 29, 2013 the family that walks on all fours is a documentary that explored the science and the story of five individuals in the ulas family in turkey that walk with a previously unreported quadruped gait. Debate exists as to the nature and cause of their walking, including controversial speculation in the form of the uner tan syndrome that it may be a genetic throwback to pre-bipedal hominid locomotion. Nicholas humphrey, who accompanied the documentary makers, concluded that it was due to a rare set of genetic and developmental circumstances coming together. First, their mother recalls that initially all of her 19 children started off walking with a bear-crawl ( i.e. On their feet rather than their knees ). Second, due to an inherited recessive genetic mutation, they have a non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance children normally use to learn to walk bipedally. Not being able to manage the balance needed for bipedal walking, they perfected in its place their initial bear-crawl into an adult quadruped gait."

( anatolian/reuters ) in a village of dirt roads and stone dwellings just north of the turkey-syria border, a slight rain falls as a hunched man clad in black wobbles down the pavement. At first glance, as seen in a bbc documentary, he appears inebriated. He clings to a stone wall to his left and lurches uneasily. But then he slowly lowers his hands, encased in green slippers, to the muddy ground. Gingerly, he begins to walk away and out of the frame — on all fours. The man is one of five children in a religious family bedeviled by an unusual condition that has flummoxed and fascinated scientists since the scientific community first discovered them in 2005. The parents are normal. But five of their progeny are quadrupedal. They walk appendages down, bottom in the air. Earlier theories held the family's gait signaled a devolution to our primate ancestry, but fresh research published wednesday claims those earlier theories had it all wrong. It's not devolution. It's adaptation to an unforeseen and rare disorder. An undated photo of a woman walking on her hands and feet in hatay. ( reuters ) what is undisputed: the five kurdish siblings — four female, one male — are like few others on the planet. They're impaired with something called uner tan syndrome, named after the turkish evolutionary",
            "Published on dec 29, 2013 the family that walks on all fours is a documentary that explored the science and the story of five individuals in the ulas family in turkey that walk with a previously unreported quadruped gait. Debate exists as to the nature and cause of their walking, including controversial speculation in the form of the uner tan syndrome that it may be a genetic throwback to pre-bipedal hominid locomotion. Nicholas humphrey, who accompanied the documentary makers, concluded that it was due to a rare set of genetic and developmental circumstances coming together. First, their mother recalls that initially all of her 19 children started off walking with a bear-crawl ( i.e. On their feet rather than their knees ). Second, due to an inherited recessive genetic mutation, they have a non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance children normally use to learn to walk bipedally. Not being able to manage the balance needed for bipedal walking, they perfected in its place their initial bear-crawl into an adult quadruped gait."

        "summary": "Michael flynn made a flurry of headlines friday and saturday, the most pressing of which was a new york times report that investigators working for robert mueller asked the white house for documents related to the ex-national security adviser. Sources say investigators have also asked witnesses if flynn was secretly paid by the turkish government. Flynn's consulting business was paid $ 530,000 to handle a campaign against an opponent of the turkish government. If that money actually came from the turkish government itself, flynn could face a felony charge for not declaring himself a foreign agent or other charges for trying to hide the source of the money. The document request is one more sign mueller's team is expanding its investigation beyond russia to the business dealings of trump and his team. On friday, the white house released an updated version of flynn's financial filing that shows he briefly had an advisory role with cambridge analytica, the ap reports. The \" controversial \" data mining and analysis company helped the trump campaign during the election. It's unclear what, if anything, flynn did for the company. According to usa today, former russian ambassador to the us sergey kislyak gave an interview to russian media saturday in which he claimed he never discussed sanctions with flynn, who was fired for lying when he told vice president pence the same thing. Kislyak says his conversations with flynn were \" absolutely correct, calm, absolutely transparent \" and about \" the simplest things. \"",

Scaramucci's first remark was to jokingly tell colbert he's added the show's writers to his \" kill list, \" to which colbert responded: \" so you're comedically threatening to kill people who work for me? \" \" i ' m not allowed to joke anymore, i've learned that, \" scaramucci said. \"",

Stopping by the late show on monday, anthony scaramucci chatted with stephen colbert to share his 11-day tenure at the white house and his current relationship with president donald trump. We're guessing the mooch is a big fan of game of thrones as he answered many of colbert's questions with references from the hit hbo series. Here are the highlights from the short-lived white house communications director's interview: 1. \"i ' m like arya stark. \" scaramucci's first comments after arriving at his guest chair included a shout-out to maisie williams' got character. \"i ' m like arya stark, i took a list of all your comedy writers for my kill list, \" he told colbert as the audience didn't"

At least seven deaths and more than 200 injuries have been reported since typhoon jebi made landfall in western japan around noon local time tuesday, reports the japan times. Considered to be japan's first \" very strong \" typhoon since 1993, per the bbc, jebi brought heavy rain and wind gusts of 129mph as it moved from shikoku island to the japanese mainland. A 71-year-old man died when a warehouse collapsed, while another man in his 70s died in a fall from a roof, reports reuters. More than a million people were evacuated from their homes, and 1.6 million homes remained without power across the region late tuesday when the storm finally reached the sea of japan with sustained winds of 78mph, reports the ap. Osaka was among the worst hit locales, notes the independent. At one point, winds sent a 2,500-ton tanker crashing into a bridge connecting kansai international airport in osaka bay to the japanese mainland. As a result, some 3,000 people were stranded at the airport where at least one runway was covered with water.

With its nontraditional name, it's not entirely surprising to learn that this structure won't be part of the 13-library strong system that the national archives runs ( currently encompassing commanders-in-chief from herbert hoover to george w ). The washington library will house thousands of books — 105 of which are rare volumes owned by the president himself, reports usa today. But bookish history fans won't get to touch.

More on that and the suddenly warm relations between the president and top democrats: rosy press: politico reports that trump seems thrilled with the generally positive media coverage of his outreach to schumer and pelosi, and he spoke to both by phone thursday. \" in the eyes of trump, news coverage often matters more than almost anything else, \" writes josh dawsey, which could bode well for future deals.'schumer test ': \" it goes something like this, \" explains npr. \" if you're a republican and chuck schumer is happy, then it's likely not a good day. \" well, schumer, is \" beaming, \" and that has republicans leery.

The problem is these votes \" are often politicized and can cause panic among investors, \" explains the post. Trump himself suggested, \" has anybody ever thought about eliminating this vote? \" recounts pelosi, per the hill. \" and we said we ' ll take it back to our caucus. \" a report at politico says schumer was the one to broach the idea with the president, who responded, \" let's do it. \" nope: house speaker paul ryan threw cold water on the idea thursday. \"i won't get into a private conversation that we had, \" he said, referring to the president. \"but i think there is a legitimate role for the power of the purse and article 1 powers, and that's something we need to defend here in congress. \" that article of the constitution essentially gives congress control over the us purse strings.

Stupak's departure does not really surprise me. By time the final vote rolled around, the michigan democrat had essentially driven himself into a corner where he was certain to please no one.

Several of his pro-life colleagues — like rep. Marcy kaptur — had already announced their support for the bill.

For several weeks, apple employees have been testing an iphone feature that uses siri to transcribe voicemail messages, business insider reports. It reportedly works like this: when someone calls, you can choose to have the call picked up by siri, rather than a digital audio recorder ( the answering machine of today ). Siri can tell the caller what you're up to and why you can't answer the phone and also record a voicemail, which is then converted to text using voice recognition. Appleinsider notes the concept of a system that translates voicemail into text was first mentioned in a 2012 patent filing. Google offers a similar service, google voice, that's been around for years, but it's been plagued by accuracy issues, reports the verge. It isn't clear if apple has a strategy to cut down on errors. Though ios 9 offers siri upgrades — including providing limited access to third-party apps and an automatic switch to driving mode when you get into your car, per 9 to 5 mac — the icloud voicemail feature will reportedly be included with ios 10, if it proves reliable.

The american talk-show host had been traveling with both american and indian bodyguards while visiting the hindu pilgrimage town of mathura, about 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) south of delhi. Press trust of india said police detained three of the guards after local journalists said their video equipment had been damaged in a brawl. No one was reported hurt, and there was no indication that the american bodyguards were involved. The three guards were released after apologizing in a letter to the journalists, pti said. It is winfrey's first trip to india, where she has been filming her new show \" oprah's next chapter. \" earlier this week, she delighted mumbai locals by wearing a bright orange sari while meeting with bollywood stars including amitabh bachchan, shah rukh khan and aishwarya rai at a private party.

        "summary": "Jaws would've been a lot less scary had steven spielberg replaced his great white villain with a bonnethead shark. It's \" the first known omnivorous species of shark, \" says researcher samantha leigh, co-author of a new study that describes the hammerhead relative as a lover of seagrass. Indeed, up to 60 % of the bonnethead shark's diet is seagrass found in coastal waters around the americas, with the rest made up of bony fish, crabs, snails, and shrimp, reports the guardian. Researchers were previously aware of bonnethead sharks munching on the marine plant but \" it has been assumed by most that this consumption was incidental and that it provided no nutritional value, \" says leigh. Through a series of tests, scientists proved that wasn't the case. They captured five bonnetheads, which can reach up to five feet long, and put them on a three-week diet of squid as well as seagrass the researchers had given a distinctive chemical signature. Using enzymes to break down starch and cellulose — strong stomach acids might also be at play — the sharks digested more than half of the organic material in the grass, meaning they were better at digesting plant material than pandas, per mashable, or \" on a par with young green sea turtles, \" per the guardian. A carbon isotope added to the seagrass was also found in the sharks ' blood and liver tissue, indicating the plant does serve a nutritional purpose for the sharks. The \" ecological implications \" of 4.9 million bonnethead sharks munching on seagrass are not yet fully understood. ( there was once a shark twice the size of a great white. )",

Her fingers and thumbs had been cut off at right angles, according to police documents obtained by the tribune. Police have not disclosed how they made the connection between the maidenwater victim and reyes-geddes.

The new numbers highlight what's at stake as congress returns to an unresolved debate over republican proposals to roll back much of former president obama's health care law, the ap notes.

Though small, the change was statistically significant, survey analysts note. The gallup-sharecare survey serves as a kind of early indicator, publishing several months before the nimblest government surveys. While obamacare has remained politically divisive, it had helped drive the uninsured rate to historic lows as some 20 million people gained coverage. The most recent government report found that progress reducing the number of uninsured had stalled in 2016, after five consecutive years of coverage gains under obama. Peering at this year, gallup-sharecare estimates nearly 2 million dropped out of coverage. The losses were concentrated among younger adults and people buying their own health insurance policies, the survey found. Meanwhile, mitch mcconnell plans to check vital signs on his gop bill, which the cbo estimated would cut at least 22 million more people.

On that day, the 20-year-old stood in front of a clark county, nev., judge and explained why her birth certificate should read male. And then it was so, and maddy forever became jake, and jake called his dad to share the good news. Jon ralston heard a \" giddy \" voice on the other end of the line, and the moment inspired ralston — \" one of the most respected political reporters in nevada, \" per the washington post — to write a \" love story, \" a blog post about \" how my daughter became my son, \" he tweeted. It's been shared more than 16,000 times. The post is bookended with parallel statements, opening with the line, \" when maddy ralston came into this world almost 21 years ago, it was love at first sight. \" he writes of \" a stunning, blonde-blue-eyed kid \" who he thought of as a tomboy through and through. \" we went shopping for clothes, and she would never go into the girls'section. Always the boys. It wasn't even a question. I didn't really care. She was my little girl, and i adored her. \" he could tell that things were rough for maddy as she was teased and bullied and called a lesbian in high school, that \" something wasn't right. \" but \" i don't think i even listened very well when maddy told me a few years ago she was really a male inside. \" what he thought was a phase clearly wasn't, and ralston has \" come to not just accept it but to embrace \" his child's truth — though there are moments when it's hard. And then, that touching bookend: \" when i get home later this week, i will see someone officially named jake ralston for the first time. And one thing i know for certain: it will be love at first sight. \" read his full post here.",

It helps to be hearty since the 350-year-old hermitage has no running water, heat, or internet. And it doesn't hurt to be independently wealthy since the april-november post is unpaid. \" there is no classic job description for a hermit, \" the parish website says, per the telegraph. In lieu of previous experience, the would-be loner ought to have a christian outlook and be \" a self-sufficient person at peace with himself, \" says local priest alois moser. And contrary to expected hermit demeanor, the this one should be game for chatting up the occasional passing pilgrim. The first occupant took up residence in the bird's-eye perch in the town of saalfelden in 1664, per visit-salzberg.net. The winner will be selected more for personality than native skills, per the local, and may have to contend with the occasional disgruntled competitor for the job. In 1970, someone who lost out opened fire with a shotgun, though the occupying hermit wasn't hurt. Remote by any standard, the hermitage is built into a natural cave perched above lichtenberg castle, with a 17th century chapel next door, per the local. It has been empty since last fall when the last occupant went back home to his life as a pastor in vienna. Before him, a benedictine monk held the job for a dozen years. Applications are due by march 15. ( a \" dead \" doctor was found living as a hermit in italy. )",

But nissan is testing a car that can keep itself clean, thanks to special paints that repel water and oils. Similar technology could eventually allow manufacturers to do away with windshield wipers by effectively fending off water, frost and grime. Meanwhile, new coatings can also help keep a car's interior cleaner, something especially useful for parents – or those actively involved in sports like camping and trail biking. The nissan technical center in rolle, switzerland, is in the midst of testing a specially prepared version of the maker's little european note model. The subcompact hatchback has had a layer of a special coating, called ultra-ever dry, applied over its conventional paint finish. Developed by ultratech international, it's technically known as a super-hydrophobic and oleophobic paint. In other words, it actually repels both oil and water. That means that most common dirt, grime and oil won't stick to the vehicle's sheet metal. The ultra-ever dry finish even works with rain, frost and sleet, nissan reports, after preliminary testing. \" the nissan note has been carefully engineered to take"

The guardian reports moftah was buying gifts for her family last summer in new york when she was accused of shoplifting. A macy's manager and two security officers refused to look at her receipt or macy's card account. Instead, they took her belongings, patted down her private areas, and locked her in a basement cell for hours.

When she started crying, she claims the manager told her the price to go home had just increased to $ 500. She refused to pay, but she says they charged her credit card anyway. Then they called the police, who arrested moftah. All charges against her were finally dismissed in march.

            "A manhattan judge ordered macy's on wednesday to stop getting suspected shoplifters to sign confessions and pay damages before they are released — a practice a spokesman for the retailer says the company already abandoned. State supreme court justice manuel mendez said the chain — which reportedly detailed 6,000 accused shoplifters in new york state in just one year — had no authority to extract confessions and payment from customers where the accused had no right to counsel, hearings or rules of evidence. Mendez issued an injunction barring the practice. The lawyer for the customers, faruk usar of queens, said macy's, like other retailers, was detaining young, mostly minority customers who were intimidated into signing confessions that became the basis for arrests.

According to the bbc, a federal prosecutor says the 31-year-old belgian admitted to being present during the bombing at the brussels airport after being confronted with the evidence against him. He was charged saturday with terrorist murders and participating in the activities of a terrorist group. Abrini has been on europe's most wanted list since the november attacks in paris that killed 130 people, the guardian reports. Authorities believe he played a part in those attacks as well; his fingerprints were allegedly found in a car used in the paris attacks. Authorities say abrini threw his vest in a garbage can and sold his hat following the brussels airport suicide bombing in which his two accomplices were killed. He is believed to have travelled to syria last summer, and his younger brother died in that country in 2014 after joining isis. Six people total were arrested friday in brussels. Two of them were released, and the remaining four — including abrini and another man suspected of being present at the brussels subway bombing — were charged with terrorism-related crimes saturday.",

The mass shooting tracker is a crowd-sourced tool from an anti-gun forum at reddit called guns are cool, and it defines \" mass shooting \" as incident in which at least four people were shot. Not all of the incidents resulted in deaths. A post at quartz digs in a little deeper to the numbers and finds that 40 of 50 states have had at least one such mass shooting this year, with new york ( 16 ), california ( 14 ), florida ( 14 ), texas ( 12 ), and georgia ( 12 ) at the top of the list. In its coverage, the post quotes a barb from the economist, written after the charleston church massacre, that has been in wide circulation of late: \" those who live in america, or visit it, might do best to regard [ mass shootings ] the way one regards air pollution in china: an endemic local health hazard which, for deep-rooted cultural, social, economic and political reasons, the country is incapable of addressing.

The news comes from a study of a city in chile. Between 1958 and 1970, antofagasta had way too much arsenic in its water: some 80 times the maximum amount recommended by the world health organization. Some forms of cancer, including those of the lung, bladder, and kidney, soared among locals, ozy reports. But breast cancer mortality rates among women actually sank by 50 %, uc berkeley reveals in a press release; among women under 60, the figure was 70 %. The findings were \" completely unexpected, \" researcher allan smith tells ozy. Researchers were able to use arsenic to kill lab-grown breast cancer cells, and they found that healthy breast cells showed arsenic resistance. \" based on what we've found, it's not a stretch at all to say arsenic could treat breast cancer, \" says another expert. The next step: \" carefully designed clinical trials should take place as soon as possible based on this new evidence, \" smith notes. Forms of arsenic have previously been used in the treatment of other cancers; the chemical has been called a \" double-edged sword, \" medical daily reports.

            "Though arsenic, which found in drinking water, has been linked to harmful effects such as arsenic poisoning, a new study out of the university of california, berkeley, and the pontifical catholic university of chile has found that it might somehow assist in the fight against breast cancer. The results of the study may appear somewhat contradictory to the research that already exists about arsenic's health hazards. Arsenic is a naturally occurring chemical element that is often found in various minerals, alongside sulfur and metals. When it's found in drinking water, however, it can lead to arsenic poisoning, and even increase people's risk of cancer. The authors of the berkeley study examined breast cancer mortality data from a region in chile that is notorious for having high levels of arsenic in the drinking water and environment. Scientists normally see an increase in cancer and toxicity in such regions, but this study shows opposite results. Breast cancer deaths were actually cut in half in this chilean region during a period of time that coincided with high arsenic exposure. Women under the age of 60 had the most pronounced results; breast cancer mortality was cut by 70 percent. \"what we found was astonishing, \" said dr. Allan smith, lead author of the study and a professor of epidemiology at berkeley, in a press release. \"we've been studying the long-term effects of arsenic in this population for many years, focusing on increased disease and mortality attributed to the historical exposure to arsenic in this population. \" once an arsenic removal plant was placed in the city of antofagasta, chile, the researchers found that breast cancer deaths began to rise again. While exposure to arsenic has been linked to the growth of malignant cells for various other types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer cells were shown to be destroyed by arsenic. Stanford cancer institute researchers assisted in the study by growing breast cancer cells in the lab, and finding that arsenic in fact killed them. Regular breast cells, meanwhile, appeared to be more resistant to arsenic than other types of cells. A double-edged sword interestingly enough, though arsenic exposure can be toxic, the element has been used medically for over 2,400 years to treat various conditions. The element has been referred to as a medicinal \"double-edged sword, \" due to its ability to work as a therapeutic agent as well as a poison. Arsenic trioxide has often been used to treat relapsed promyelocytic leukemia, for example. But it has also been found to",

The results of the study may appear somewhat contradictory to the research that already exists about arsenic's health hazards. Arsenic is a naturally occurring chemical element that is often found in various minerals, alongside sulfur and metals. When it's found in drinking water, however, it can lead to arsenic poisoning, and even increase people's risk of cancer. The authors of the berkeley study examined breast cancer mortality data from a region in chile that is notorious for having high levels of arsenic in the drinking water and environment. Scientists normally see an increase in cancer and toxicity in such regions, but this study shows opposite results. Breast cancer deaths were actually cut in half in this chilean region during a period of time that coincided with high arsenic exposure. Women under the age of 60 had the most pronounced results; breast cancer mortality was cut by 70 percent. \"what we found was astonishing, \" said dr. Allan smith, lead author of the study and a professor of epidemiology at berkeley, in a press release. \"we've been studying the long-term effects of arsenic in this population for many years, focusing on increased disease and mortality attributed to the historical exposure to arsenic in this population. \" once an arsenic removal plant was placed in the city of antofagasta, chile, the researchers found that breast cancer deaths began to rise again. While exposure to arsenic has been linked to the growth of malignant cells for various other types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer cells were shown to be destroyed by arsenic. Stanford cancer institute researchers assisted in the study by growing breast cancer cells in the lab, and finding that arsenic in fact killed them. Regular breast cells, meanwhile, appeared to be more resistant to arsenic than other types of cells. A double-edged sword interestingly enough, though arsenic exposure can be toxic, the element has been used medically for over 2,400 years to treat various conditions. The element has been referred to as a medicinal \"double-edged sword, \" due to its ability to work as a therapeutic agent as well as a poison. Arsenic trioxide has often been used to treat relapsed promyelocytic leukemia, for example. But it has also been found to",

Then she let go and i caught it. I held on like a football and didn't let go,",

His citizenship is unclear. Authorities later raided his house and were seen leading away two unidentified women in handcuffs. All four victims were shot to death inside a navy and marine reserve center, and two others were wounded. Minutes earlier, the gunman had opened fire on a military recruiting center just miles away, though nobody was injured in that attack. Abdulazeez did not appear to be under investigation by the fbi prior to the shooting, reports the new york times. \"it is incomprehensible to see what happened and the way that individuals who proudly serve our country were treated, \" said chattanooga mayor andy berke. National security officials were keeping president obama briefed on the attack. An army sergeant recounts the first shooting: \" we heard one single shot, which kind of sparked our attention. Shortly after that, just a few seconds, the shooter began shooting more rounds. We realized it was an actual shooting, so we then initiated our active shooter drill: getting down low to the ground, moving to a safe location. And we waited until everything seemed to be clear. \"",

        "summary": "The trend of eating placenta after childbirth \" borders on cannibalism \" and is only lining providers ' pockets, rather than offering any benefit to women or their newborns. That's according to researchers of a study published in the american journal of obstetrics &amp; gynecology, which finds \" no known scientifically proven benefits \" to placentophagy, per the independent. There are, however, several risks, including of viral and bacterial infections in mothers and their babies. The risk of infection may remain even when placenta is heated, freeze-dried, or turned into pill form, as there are no regulations on placenta preparation, and certain viruses, like hiv and hepatitis, are only killed when heated at high temperatures for hours, reports live science. Even placenta free of viruses may contain heavy metals, immune to heat, that could do damage, according to the study, which notes headaches reported by some mothers may be caused by cadmium in placenta. While headaches may be a small price to pay for a boost in mood or milk production claimed by some, \" we found that there is no scientific evidence of any clinical benefit of placentophagy among humans, and no placental nutrients and hormones are retained in sufficient amounts after placenta encapsulation to be potentially helpful to the mother postpartum, \" researchers say. And yet, \" the people who tell women they should eat placentas make good money from it, \" notes one of the study's co-authors. \" it's the same idea as people selling snake oil. \" ( the cdc is also cautious. )",

Despite major differences that remain between angela merkel and nicolas sarkozy, a four-point deal is taking shape, including increased fiscal discipline for eurozone countries to be added to european treaties; an increase of the european financial stability facility to two or three times its current size; more money to the imf to increase the bailout fund; and relaxing regulations to enable the european central bank in the short run to continue aggressively supporting italian and spanish bonds. It's a huge and ambitious plan — and completely irrelevant to the eurozone's problems, says alex harrowell at a fistful of euros, noting that two of the biggest violators of the eurozone's fiscal rules for the past decade were germany and france. With germany obsessing about austerity and french concerned with sovereignty, \" i doubt they have ever understood the economic and financial dynamics behind the crisis, \" writes wolfgang munchau in the financial times. Propping up the ecb in the short run and moving toward eurobonds in the long run — along with a true fiscal union — is the only hope of saving the euro. \" what i fear is a fudge, \" says munchau, calling temporary liquidity without bigger changes \" a compromise, but no solution. \"",

But a new study out of northwestern suggests that when it comes to fish evolution, it all comes down to the eyes. Fish could see far better above the water line, and were likely tempted by tasty prey on land, the atlantic explains. That clear-eyed goal perhaps prompted fish to grow bulging peepers that migrated to the top of their heads. With that evolutionary task ticked off, the shoreline was theirs to conquer and limbs followed. At least that's the theory laid out by scientists in this week's journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences. ( see a video about it. ) the team measured fossilized eye sockets from 59 species from fish to tetrapods with legs. Over 12 million years, the eyes nearly tripled in size. This boosted the ability of crocodile-like early tetrapods to spot shore-based snacks like centipedes and millipedes without having to expend lots of energy moving around. \" long-range vision gives you a free lunch, \" lead researcher malcolm maciver tells the atlantic. \" no invertebrate on land would have been a match for it. \" other changes followed, maciver reasons, such as breathing holes behind the eyes to sample surface oxygen. Fins morphed into flippers and then limbs, permitting the creatures to make their first foray out of the water. That process could also explain brain development as the tetrapods began to navigate terra firma. \" now you're choosing the best thought for your environment, which looks like a kind of proto-consciousness, \" maciver says.

New one-star winners included heston blumenthal's hinds head pub, in bray. In london, there were single stars for alyn williams at the westbury, dabbous, medlar, hedone, launceston place, st. John soho, tom aikens and trishna. The u.k's four three-star restaurants -- fat duck, waterside inn, alain ducasse and gordon ramsay -- held onto their top rating. This isn't the first time the results have appeared prematurely. In 2009, pied a terre owner david moore spotted them on the web. In 2010, a copy of the guide was sent out before publication. Other winners of a single star include bath priory ( bath ), alimentum ( cambridge ) raby hunt ( darlington ), red lion freehouse ( east chisenbury ), tristan ( horsham ), paul ainsworth at no. 6 ( padstow ), thackeray's ( tunbridge wells ), locks brasserie ( dublin ) and aniar ( galway",
            "A total of 16 british restaurants were yesterday awarded their first michelin star, while three were given their second. Almost half of them were in london. Rebecca burr, editor of the guide, said: \" it is realistic, in future london could overtake new york and paris. London is the place to be, a lot of the top chefs want to set up here. We have got a much more diverse cuisine which we should celebrate. \" the capital has a total of 60 starred restaurants, including four with three stars and eight with two stars. Paris has 77 starred restaurants, including 10 with three stars and 17 with two stars. Mikael jonsson, a swedish chef, earned his first michelin star at the age of 44 for hedone, a french restaurant based in chiswick, west london. Jonsson opted to set up his restaurant in london after being put off by restrictive labour laws in paris. He said: \" in paris there are so many constraints that it [ opening a restaurant ] would never really have happened. \" you can't get rid of staff, you have to assume responsibility for them. You have seen a gastronomic revolution in england. I love paris but london is also a fantastic restaurant venue because it's extremely dynamic with a highly multi-cultural population. \""

        "summary": "If you don't wash the pre-washed spinach you buy from the store, you may want to stop reading. Actually, even if you do wash your spinach, you still may want to stop here. According to new findings by food safety researchers out of the university of california, riverside, bacteria such as e. Coli and salmonella can survive even the bleaching process used in food processing plants thanks to the many folds and contours in a typical spinach leaf. In fact, 15 % of a typical spinach leaf sees itself exposed to only trace amounts of disinfectant. What remains can be much more than that: \" following rinsing under the low bleach condition, upwards of 90 % of adhered bacteria were observed to remain attached to and survive on the leaf surface, \" per the university. Unfortunately, once those bacteria are there, they tend to multiply and spread, reports yahoo health. Worse still, \" rinsing isn't going to do a whole heck of a lot for food safety, \" says benjamin chapman, a food safety specialist at north carolina state university. Indeed, a second food safety expert tells yahoo health he won't eat raw spinach because of the risks; the cdc estimates that about 17 % of americans become ill and 3,000 die every year from foodborne diseases. Chapman says that while at-home washing essentially just removes bits of dirt and debris, cooking the spinach does eliminate the bacteria. These findings, which have not yet been submitted for publication but were thursday presented at the 250th american chemical society national meeting &amp; exposition, have implications beyond spinach since many leafy greens have lots of grooves.

The government says the boys are receiving crash courses in swimming and diving from rescue teams, though the 2.5-mile route to safety through dark, treacherous tunnels takes even the best divers around three hours, reports reuters. The governor of chiang rai province, narongsak osatanakorn, says the youth soccer team has been practicing with diving masks but he's not sure if they have attempted any dives yet, the guardian reports. He says no attempt to extract the boys will be made wednesday, though the weather will remain ideal for a rescue later in the week. Rainy season is only just beginning in the area, meaning the boys could be trapped for up to four months if authorities decide it is too dangerous to extract them, though the military describes four months as a worst-case scenario. In video released by thai navy seals, the boys, aged from 11 to 16, appear healthy, the bbc reports. The boys, who have been in the cave since june 23, have been provided with supplies and the military says two seals will remain with them at all times. To keep water levels as low as possible, teams of soldiers and other rescuers have been pumping water out and building weirs across creeks to divert water away from the cave system, the bangkok post reports. Teams are also trying to find cave shafts that could offer another escape route.",

He \" washes away any memories of the actor's more clownish performances, \" he writes at the globe and mail. \" it's a terrifying, towering performance, and one that would normally lend hill toward oscar consideration, if only the rest of the film matched his talents. \" \" the wolf of wall street hinted at the great work hill can do with the right antagonistic role, and war dogs lets him steal the movie at gunpoint, \" agrees brian truitt at usa today. The film's highlights include entertaining banter, \" a gripping plot and enjoyably sketchy characters, \" he writes, noting miles teller and bradley cooper are also good. Meanwhile, mark jenkins describes war dogs as \" an amusing if underachieving bad-boys farce \" at npr.

The investigation into oxenham started in late march after reports of child abuse were received by the florida department of children and families. A 7-year-old told investigators that oxenham got mad at her 5-year-old sister for locking a cat in the bathroom. She said that oxenham slammed the girl's head into a wall several times before kicking her in the side. Then, the 7-year-old said their mother on another occasion, lit a stick on fire and burned both sisters on the arm for two reasons. She told investigators oxenham wanted to be able to identify the children as hers and the other reason being so they could have ice cream. Oxenham denied after attacking the 5-year-old and refused to answer questions about the burn marks when asked by investigators."

        "summary": "Hip-hop is seen as a \" man's world, \" and it's easy to see why: since 2000, just 17 female rappers have made it into the top 20 of billboard's hot 100 chart, jezebel reports. That number goes down even further when you eliminate the female rappers who did so either as a featured artist on a song by a male or males, or with a featured artist of their own. Since 2010, only three have cracked the top 20 with solo singles: nicki minaj, young m.a., and, most recently, cardi b of love &amp; hip hop. Meanwhile, more than 184 male rappers or rap acts have made it into the top 20 since 2000. Jezebel runs down some of the other issues with the lack of diversity in the genre, like the fact that there is no grammy award for best female rap solo performance ( one did exist, but only for two years ) and the recent interview given by rapper and record label owner rick ross in which he said he doesn't sign female rappers because he's afraid he'd have sex with them and things would get messy. Following that interview, pitchfork surveyed hip-hop record labels and found that no label had signed more than two female rappers. Three of the labels hadn't signed any. Earlier this year, pitchfork conducted an investigation dating back to 1991 and concluded that the rap industry and mainstream society only support one \" rap queen \" at a time. \" there are plenty of women rappers out there, \" concludes jezebel's rich juzwiak. \" but what seems to be lacking is opportunity. \"",

That figure — which is significantly more pessimistic than the congressional budget office's $ 1.48 trillion estimate — comes alongside obama's newly released $ 3.73 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2012, which the administration says would shave $ 1.1 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. Under obama's plan, the deficit would shrink to $ 1.1 trillion in 2012, and to around $ 600 billion a year thereafter through 2018. The budget would cut funding on a host of programs long-championed by democrats, and raise taxes on the rich and corporations, the washington post reports. At the same time, it would boost spending on education, energy and medical research, and high-speed internet infrastructure. It's a revealing look at obama's priorities, but odds are it ' ll be all but ignored on capitol hill, as republicans push much larger cuts in a house vote this week.",

In a news conference at a baltimore county middle school, obama cast the document as a responsible alternative to the deep spending cuts that republicans will urge in a vote this week on the house floor. Obama's plan would trim domestic spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, striking hard at programs long favored by democrats to make room for targeted increases in energy and medical research, corporate research and development and a new network to bring high-speed internet access to 98 percent of americans. However, obama also would rely heavily on new taxes, to a degree unacknowledged by administration officials in recent days. His budget request calls for well over $ 1.6 trillion in fresh revenue over the next decade, much of it through higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses. Households with income of more than $ 250,000 a year would immediately see new limits on the value of their itemized deductions.

Researcher bernie krause has made it possible thanks to decades of recordings at california's sugarloaf ridge state park, reports outside online. He goes there every spring to the same spot with equipment he's used as a leader in the field of \" soundscape ecology, \" or \" ecoacoustics, \" which the boston globe describes as a blend of art and science. Over the years, a creek that runs through the park has dried up, and the sounds of wildlife — or \" biophony \" — have dried up along with it. By krause's measurements, the biophony is down fivefold since 2004. He is now working with a researcher at the university of urbino in italy to translate his recordings into hard data for scientists. \"it's a true narrative, a story telling us that something is desperately wrong, \" krause tells outside. Krause himself says he didn't realize the extent of the decline until playing recordings from previous years side by side with more modern ones. At the san francisco chronicle, mark morford finds krause's work \" chilling, \" summing up thusly: \" what once was a rich, varied symphony of sound has become a far more subdued chamber orchestra, with large spaces of eerie silence where there was once a vast natural racket, signifying everything. \" the 77-year-old krause tells the globe that he's not \" terribly optimistic \" about change, but \"i am hopeful that we ' ll begin to hear the message these critters are putting out in time to do something about saving them. \" ( scientists now say california's snowpack is at a 500-year low. )",

They join three neptune-sized gas giant planets circling the parent star kepler-20, which is slightly smaller and dimmer than the sun. The system is located about 1,000 light years away in the constellation lyra. While kepler-20e and 20f are not thought to be habitable, it is \" the next major milestone along the road to finding habitable planets around stars beyond the sun, \" said kepler project scientist nick gautier, with nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena, calif. Slide show: top exoplanets for alien life the two new discoveries were found by a team led",
            "Moffett field, calif. - nasa's kepler mission has discovered the first earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system. The planets, called kepler-20e and kepler-20f, are too close to their star to be in the so-called habitable zone where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, but they are the smallest exoplanets ever confirmed around a star like our sun. The discovery marks the next important milestone in the ultimate search for planets like earth. The new planets are thought to be rocky. Kepler-20e is slightly smaller than venus, measuring 0.87 times the radius of earth. Kepler-20f is a bit larger than earth, measuring 1.03 times its radius. Both planets reside in a five-planet system called kepler-20, approximately 1,000 light-years away in the constellation lyra. Kepler-20e orbits its parent star every 6.1 days and kepler-20f every 19.6 days. These short orbital periods mean very hot, inhospitable worlds. Kepler-20f, at 800 degrees fahrenheit, is similar to an average day on the planet mercury. The surface temperature of kepler-20e, at more than 1,400 degrees fahrenheit, would melt glass. \" the primary goal of the kepler mission is to find earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, \" said francois fressin of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge, mass., lead author of a new study published in the journal nature"

Also starring the crown's claire foy, the film has won over critics, who give it an 90 % rating on rotten tomatoes. What to expect: at cnn, brian lowry calls first man \" a dazzling accomplishment, from the cinematography to the musical score \" and one of the year's best movies. \" the buttoned-up nature of the character puts gosling to the test, but he conveys a great deal with mere glances and expressions, \" he writes. Chazelle, meanwhile, \" keeps the focus squarely on the protagonist and the mission. \" gosling \" turns in a discreet, sensitive performance \" that might fit his character, but \" the movie feels too fussed-over for such a low-key hero, \" stephanie zacharek writes at time. There are \" too many feelings, even for those of us who like them, \" continues zacharek, who felt chazelle's emphasis on the 1968 death of armstrong's 2-year-old daughter from a brain tumor didn't mesh with the astronaut's private nature. On the opposite side of the fence, colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune applauds the \" tremendous personal insight \" given to armstrong, aided by gosling, who \" digs down to the man's bone marrow. \" foy is just as \" excellent \" as armstrong's wife, janet. Together, they add \" a sense of emotional intimacy to the people committed to the [ space ] program. \" while gosling \" seriously impresses, \" first man \" finds its beating heart in foy's emphatic portrayal of janet, \" peter howell writes at the toronto star. He describes a scene in which she demands her husband be the one to tell his two sons he might not come home as \" a real ' oscar moment.

Rather than going through a ticketing service — notorious for adding on ridiculous charges — the comedian is selling the tickets only on his website, for $ 45 apiece, which he says is about half of what most people paid to see him last year. And the implied \" eff you \" is not just to ticketing services but to re-sellers as well: anyone who attempts to sell a ticket for more than the original price will find that ticket canceled and refunded. \" doing things this way means i ' m making less than i would have made if i did a standard tour, \" ck writes in an email reprinted by pop culture brain. \" but i like doing more shows and about a year ago i reached a place where i realized i am making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that interested me is bringing your price down. Either way, i still make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and raised chickens in michigan. \" vulture takes a look at the tour schedule and notes that \" the dates are spaced so the most publicly filthy single dad of all time can properly care for his daughters half of each week, \" writes zach dionne. \" helluva guy, all around. \"",

After a hearing in the case in texas on tuesday, attorney scott brown said the question of whether the 18-year-old \" was voluntarily or involuntarily taken to mexico is something that is still being investigated. \" couch, who was on probation in texas for killing four people while driving drunk, was found with his mother in mexico last month, and she has been charged with hindering the apprehension of a felon. Tonya couch was quickly deported to the us, where she was released on bail last week. Ethan is still in a mexico city detention facility, and he could be there for a while: brown says the teen's mexican lawyers will stop fighting his deportation to the us, reports reuters, though a mexican immigration official says the challenge has yet to be withdrawn and it will be at least another month before couch can be deported. In tuesday's hearing, prosecutors had planned to argue that couch's case should be moved to adult court, but it was postponed because couch was absent and his parents hadn't been notified, reports the dallas morning news.

But this bad boy can write songs and sing them like they're torn from his insides, even though bad's headliner days are behind him and he has a habit of puking between songs. It's a juicy, career-crowning role, and bridges — a master of subtle brilliance — plays the hell out of it. Not by showing off but by going bone-deep into a character who only thinks he's running on empty. Bridges just turned 60, and he's still the most underrated actor in america. Crazy heart may finally"

She first played laverne de fazio in a guest spot on her brother's series happy days, which was well-received and ultimately led to her brother pitching laverne &amp; shirley. It aired from 1976 to 1983, and marshall began her directing career by directing some of its episodes. Her feature directorial debut was the whoopi goldberg-starring jumpin ' jack flash in 1986; she went on to direct tom hanks in big in 1988, which became the first female-directed film to gross more than $ 100 million. Her third film, awakenings, starring robin williams and robert de niro, was just the second female-directed film to be nominated for a best picture oscar.
