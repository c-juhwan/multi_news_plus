Sources tell cnn that authorities are reviewing security camera footage from a gas station a few miles from the prison. Dogs detected the men's scent at the gas station and followed it toward cadyville, ny, where a highway was closed amid a major search operation yesterday. There's a subway restaurant at the gas station and police say the escapees may have been looking for food in the garbage. Investigators have also found food wrappers and a possible sleeping site, according to cnn's sources. Police say the tracking dogs are still following the scent, though the bbc reports that rainstorms have made it a lot harder for dogs to detect the prisoners'traces. Officers have been following up leads as far away philadelphia, where they spoke to a cab driver who said he may have given the men a ride, the bbc reports. That possibility was ruled out. Joyce mitchell, the 51-year-old prison worker accused of assisting the men, has not been arrested yet but authorities say she may face charges of accessory to escape and promoting prison contraband. The local da tells the plattsburgh press republican that an incident involving sweat and mitchell — whose husband also works at the prison — was reported a year ago but was handled \" in-house. \"",

        "summary": "A uk couple's family wants answers after the pair suddenly died within hours of each other while vacationing in egypt. Daughter kelly ormerod, who was on holiday with john cooper, 69, and susan cooper, said to be in her early 60s, at the steigenberger aqua magic hotel in hurghada, says the two were \" fit and healthy, \" reports the bbc. Egyptian authorities say john cooper died in his hotel room around 11am local time after a \" sharp drop in blood circulation and a sudden stop in the heart muscle \"; the cause of death was \" sudden failure in the heart muscle and respiratory failure. \" just a few hours later, susan cooper began to faint and was taken to the hospital, where she died due to \" drop of blood circulation and respiratory functions. \" local officials say there doesn't seem to be anything criminal about their deaths. An executive for the hotel's parent company says the hotel's other 1,600 or so guests were not ill in unusual numbers, but a woman staying there tells the bbc that she's heard of about 40 people sick with vomiting and diarrhea. \" a reasonable person can't help but wonder if there's a link between that illness and these deaths, \" she says. Past guests also tell the bbc they got sick after staying there. Ormerod, meanwhile, reportedly expressed concern to local officials that a malfunctioning ac may have contributed to her parents'deaths, per the telegraph. Thomas cook, the travel company the coopers went through, issued a statement noting it was \" deeply saddened \" by their deaths and that it has no evidence to support rumors the couple may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The company says it's helping customers fly home or find other accommodations.",

Survivors say no fire alarms were heard. Video posted on social media shows people jumping out of windows to escape. Authorities believe the fire started around 5pm on an upper floor of the busy mall, which has attractions including a skating rink, a petting zoo, and a cinema complex. According to russian media, regional deputy governor vladimir chernov says the fire began in foam rubber in a trampoline room in the children's entertainment complex, the new york times reports. \" the preliminary version is that one of the children had a lighter, \" interfax quotes chernov as saying. \" the fire started from the trampoline pool, filled with foam rubber, which got lit up as gunpowder. \" chernov said fire alarms didn't work and people apparently became trapped in a cinema hall as the blaze spread. Authorities say families of the victims will be paid 1 million rubles each, the equivalent of around $ 17,500, cnn reports. The ap reports that at least 10 injured survivors have been hospitalized. Authorities say the most seriously injured is an 11-year-old boy who jumped out of a fourth-floor window to escape. Health minister veronika skvortsova says the boy's parents and younger brother were killed in the fire.",

The woman, who chose not to be identified, was running in bridgewater around 7: 30am when a man got out of his suv and came toward her. At first, she thought he needed help. \" but when he was coming right at me i was like, ' ok, this is happening, ' \" the 37-year-old tells abc news. A surveillance video shows the man lunge as the woman tries to escape. \" he was grabbing at me, \" but \" i was able to fight and kind of flip him to the ground, \" she says. Though the move also brought the woman to the ground, \" i just kept kicking back behind me … trying to prevent him from getting a further hold of me and getting to a point where he could either assault me or pick me up and get me into the vehicle, \" she says. Just as a driver stopped at the scene, the woman's neighbor, 84-year-old donald prohovich, saw the commotion and came over. Amid his yells, the attacker got back in his suv and fled, but not before his would-be victim snapped a photo, helping police identify a vehicle that crashed a short time later, per boston.com.

In the post, palin says she and one of her daughters traveled across the us after a request to contribute to a \" legit historical documentary, \" and found that somebody she presumes was baron cohen \" had heavily disguised himself as a disabled us veteran, fake wheelchair and all. \" she says she \" sat through a long ' interview ' full of hollywoodism's disrespect and sarcasm \" but ended up removing her mic and walking out. \" i join a long list of american public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick ' humor ' of the british ' comedian'sacha baron cohen, enabled and sponsored by cbs/showtime, \" palin writes. She calls for the proceeds from the show to be donated to charity, saying \" how dare you mock those who have fought and served our country, \" the bbc reports. The show, which promises to explore \" diverse individuals \" from across the political spectrum, will make its us debut sunday, the guardian reports. In a teaser clip tweeted by baron cohen, dick cheney autographs a water jug baron cohen calls a \" waterboard kit. \" according to matt drudge, other guests will include bernie sanders and howard dean.

Residents of crystal city — a municipality of 7,500 near the mexican border — saw the liquid emerge from taps on wednesday. \" it looked like black sludge, \" a resident tells ksat. \" we didn't get a proper warning. They didn't post anything or send out any type of message to warn the residents. It was pretty scary. \" the city says it happened because a raised water tank was emptied and flushed out, causing \" all sediments and deposits sitting on [ the ] lower portion of [ the ] tank to run through distribution lines, \" per a press release. Recently hired water official carlos ramirez says the tank hadn't been cleaned in 20 to 25 years. \" the previous administrations neglected it, \" ramirez says. \" we had to clean their mess. \" ramirez says the texas commission on environmental quality ( which shipped bottled water into crystal city ) declared the water safe saturday, but a tceq rep sees it differently. \" we would like to wait until we have the complete suite of sample results back until we can give the all-clear, \" she says. \" we may have these as soon as tuesday. \" worse, the fbi already arrested most of crystal city's senior officials for allegedly accepting kickbacks and bribes. \" right now, there's not really anyone in charge to oversee and to make people aware of the condition of the water, \" says a school official. Residents are being advised to use bottled water or boil tap water for at least two minutes, the san antonio express-news reports.

It is beautiful, it is surprising and it is emotional. \" it is hard to overstate the hype surrounding the return of mad men, whose long period away from us television screens was caused by complex contractual negotiations prompted by its massive global success. The show has had a massive impact on the us cultural landscape by tracking the lives of characters through the social upheavals of the 1960s. With its meticulous reconstruction of the decade, it has won a fanatical audience and transformed the fortunes of the amc cable network. The programme is known for its lavish sense of 1960s style in its acting, scripts and every detail of the characters ' costumes and attitudes. \" the 1960s have always resonated in america.

Television, like advertising, is typically a swift-moving beast. But it's been a staggering 17 months since mad men aired its last episode. At the time, no one could have predicted that it would be march 2012 before amc aired the highly anticipated fifth season of mad men, which returns this sunday evening with a sensational two-hour season premiere. Neilson barnard the reasons behind the delay are known far and wide, as protracted and very public contract renegotiations behind the scenes of mad men resulted in a longer than expected hiatus between seasons, and the show's devoted audience is only too keen to catch up with the staffers of 1960s advertising agency sterling cooper draper pryce. Strict embargoes on the content of the season premiere ( \"a little kiss \" ) prevent us from spilling too much about the long-awaited return, but creator matthew weiner will surely allow it to be described as gorgeous, provocative, and well worth the wait. Despite its, er, rest, mad men isn't at all sluggish; in fact, season 5 kicks off with an installment that propels the plot,"

The times obtained three pages from what appear to be trump's returns, mailed anonymously from new york city with a return address of trump tower; the paper hired tax experts to examine the pages. Trump doesn't appear to dispute the report, notes politico; the candidate tweeted sunday morning: \" i know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes. \" a former trump accountant, named as the tax preparer in the papers, confirms their authenticity.

Both men, ages 31 and 33, ended up losing a leg from the knee down in the blast, the boston globe reports. Their friend was a quarter-mile from the finish line and walked away unhurt, but the younger son's girlfriend suffered serious injuries and burns. Bill iffrig, 78, of washington, was knocked to the ground when the first bomb went off ( as can be seen in this widely-circulated video ). \" it was only... Feet away from me, \" he tells washington state's herald, adding that he saw what appeared to be a coffee can that looked like it was the bomb casing. But he only suffered a scraped knee, and he got back up and a race official helped him walk the last 12 feet to cross the finish line. Iffrig, an accomplished runner in his age group, finished second in his division. Shortly afterward, officials stopped the race completely. Dr. Vivek shah crossed the finish line, and shortly afterward the bombs went off — so he went into action, tending to victims. \" i've never obviously been in combat, but people i've trained with have been and this is as close as i can imagine it would be, \" he tells abc news. \" just, basically piles of victims.

The 22-year-old american, who spent 17 months in detention in north korea, \" was murdered by the kim jong un regime, \" mccain said in a statement monday. \" in the final year of his life, he lived the nightmare in which the north korean people have been trapped for 70 years: forced labor, mass starvation, systematic cruelty, torture, and murder. \" the us, mccain said, \" cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers. \" the latest: the death could cause lawmakers to ban american tourists from visiting north korea, the washington post reports. The bipartisan north korea travel control act in the house would require americans who want to visit the country to obtain a license, and secretary of state rex tillerson has suggested an executive order might ban travel to north korea. \" there is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life, \" president trump said in a statement. \" our thoughts and prayers are with otto's family and friends, and all who loved him. \" trump said the death deepens his administration's \" determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. \" doctors in cincinnati say warmbier apparently suffered a \" severe neurological injury \" soon after he was convicted of trying to steal a propaganda poster last year, but they have been unable to determine what caused the injury, the new york times reports. The china-based young pioneer tours company, which brought warmbier to china in early 2016, says it will no longer accept american tourists. \" the way his detention was handled was appalling, and a tragedy like this must never be repeated, \" the company said in an email to usa today. Young pioneer tours advertises \" budget travel to destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from. \" former customers tell consumer affairs that gareth johnson, its british founder, drank heavily and could be seen bribing border guards when he led tours to north korea. In warmbier's hometown of wyoming, a cincinnati suburb, the blue-and-white ribbons put up to welcome him home are now there in remembrance, the cincinnati enquirer reports. \" we salute the entire warmbier family, who has faced this unbelievable ordeal with the utmost grace and dignity, \" councilwoman jenni mccauley said.

        "summary": "Twitter changed its star-shaped \" favorite \" icon to a heart-shaped \" like \" icon tuesday. Understandably, this has torn the social-media community asunder. Cnet reports the heart is an attempt to simplify twitter to attract more users and advertisers. Akarshan kumar at twitter explains that the \" like \" heart is universally understood, while the \" favorite \" star could be confusing. \" not everything can be your favorite, \" he adds in a blog post. But not everyone feels that way. The verge points out how versatile the old star was, being used for everything from bookmarking a tweet to supporting a thought to trolling a hater. Fortunately for twitter users afraid of change, gizmodo has simple six-step instructions to replace the \" smarmy \" heart with a star ( or any other emoji ). Now here's a random sample of what verified twitter users — who should expect their blue check marks to get replaced with rainbows or clovers any day now — think about the new hearts. John scalzi: \" hearts are the new coke of twitter, and i for one can't wait to favorite classic something soon. \" megan neuringer: \" hey tweeter hq the hearts are a lot it's like do i loooove a tweet? that's a lot of pressure i feel a tightness in my chest \" lauren lapkus: \" i see the hearts now, and let me tell ya, they're super cute \" el-p: \" what are these hearts im seeing on twitter this is an outrage never mind im used to it now. \" andy richter: \" hearts? you guys suffer from worst case of corporate adhd ever.

        "summary": "Alt-right firebrand milo yiannopolous finds himself under fire for comments he made about relationships between teens and older men, comments that have critics accusing him of supporting pedophilia, which he adamantly denies. The controversy comes just after he received an invitation to speak this week at the conservative political action conference, as the hollywood reporter reported earlier. Coverage: the latest controversy began when a group called the reagan battalion, apparently unhappy with the cpac invite, released videos including this one. ( note: strong language, including a joke yiannopolous makes about his own sexual prowess thanks to a priest. ) you can read a transcript via heavy.com. One quote: \" ( t ) here are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, i certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger.... In the homosexual world particularly. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can't speak to their parents. \" another: \" you're misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don't have functioning sex organs yet.... You don't understand what pedophilia is if you think i ' m defending it because i ' m certainly not. \" in a lengthy facebook post, yiannopolous declares: \" i do not support pedophilia. Period. \" he says the \" selectively edited videos \" are \" part of a co-ordinated effort to discredit me from establishment republicans, \" adding: \" if it somehow comes across ( through my own sloppy phrasing or through deceptive editing ) that i meant any of the ugly things alleged, let me set the record straight: i am completely disgusted by the abuse of children. \" read it in full here. Slate rounds up some of the criticism, including tweets like this one from cnn's jake tapper: \" preying on children is the definition of evil. Justifying it in any way is sick and disturbing. Has everyone lost their minds? \" what's next? \" chances milo speaks at cpac, with hundreds of young attendees: zero, \" says a post at mike allen's axios blog.",

The xinhua-run international herald leader ran an opinion piece accusing tsai of having an \" erratic style, \" per the bbc, and a radical platform that could threaten china's hold on taiwan. \" as a single female politician, she does not have the emotional burden of love, of ' family ' or children, \" read the piece, penned by wang weixing, a chinese official who handles taiwanese matters. \" so her political style and strategy tend to be emotional, [ personalized ], and extreme. \" he also called tsai \" two-faced \" and noted she's \" a complicated person who grew up in the twisted taiwanese society and political environment, \" the hong kong free press reports. And, per the south china morning post, wang tacked on another gem to what shanghaist calls his \" sexist pseudo psychoanalysis \": that tsai was insecure because her dad had more than one wife. On the political front, an attempt by tsai to break away from china wouldn't surprise anyone who's followed her career: the bbc notes her democratic progressive party has been vocal in its push for independence. But it's the tone of the piece ( published tuesday and since removed from xinhua's site, per cnn ) and attack on tsai's lifestyle that's rankling many on social media. \" this was the stupidest and most offensive thing i have read in ages, \" a beijing commenter on the weibo network wrote, per the bbc. Others pointed out other successful single female politicians in asia and accused xinhua of suffering from \" straight man cancer, \" a chinese term signifying a chauvinistic, denigrating attitude toward women, cnn notes. As for tsai, her spokesman issued a \" no comment \" on the matter to the bbc. Interestingly, xinhua's rant against a too \" personalized \" tsai contrasts with a new york times columnist who thinks hillary clinton should be just that.

He was put on full-time oxygen, confined to a wheelchair, fitted with a feeding tube, and entered into hospice care. Christopher's mom, 34-year-old kaylene bowen, said he had a rare genetic disorder and cancer and needed a lung transplant. Now bowen is in jail and doctors can't find anything wrong with christopher, according to nbc dfw. Bowen was arrested wednesday on suspicion of injury to a child, and christopher's father, ryan crawford, says he believes bowen has munchausen syndrome by proxy, wherein a person seeks attention by faking medical conditions in others. Crawford says the behavior started before christopher was even born — with bowen claiming multiple hospitalizations during her pregnancy — and wants to know why it took so long for authorities to step in. \"how do you do 13 surgeries and not question the fifth surgery? the sixth surgery? \" crawford asks wfaa. Crawford says he went to family court multiple times to convince them there was nothing wrong with christopher. In response, he was blocked from visiting his son and told he was in denial about his son's impending death. Cps finally took christopher away from bowen last month after doctors could find no evidence to support her claim the 8-year-old had a seizure. Police say christopher has suffered three life-threatening blood infections due to bowen's actions over the years. Christopher is in foster care, and crawford is seeking custody.",

Kunkel says the hiker's hand was not expected to be reattached: \" from what i understand, it was in pieces, shattered. \"",

        "summary": "The lost remains of don quixote author miguel de cervantes may have finally been found nearly 400 years after the writer's death — and a year after experts began searching for them. Experts working at madrid's convent of the barefoot trinitarians used ground-penetrating radar among other technology to identify what the bbc terms a \" forgotten crypt \" beneath the convent. There, in one of its 33 alcoves, they believe they have uncovered the bones of the \" prince of letters, \" as well as those of his wife and others buried alongside him. Though forensic scientist almudena garcia rubio concedes \" the remains are in a bad state of conservation and do not allow us to do an individual identification of miguel de cervantes... We are sure what the historical sources say is the burial of miguel de cervantes... Is what we have found. \" researchers will try to eliminate which bones aren't cervantes ' using dna analysis; in january, forensic medicine specialist francisco etxeberria explained that in a \" very complex step \" they could look for dna similarities with his sister luisa, who was buried east of madrid. But they acknowledge it may be impossible to determine with certainty which are his. The ap reports the bones likely belong to 15 people, but none appear to show evidence of injuries cervantes suffered, including wounds to his left arm, reuters adds. Either way, the author will be reburied \" with full honors \" in a new tomb in the convent, where he was buried in 1616; the guardian reports, his bones were moved during renovations in 1673 and lost, apparently until now. \" cervantes asked to be buried there and there he should stay, \" an investigator says. ( richard iii is about to be reburied, too. )",

For those who watched, or aren't fearful of spoilers, a rundown of the best analysis, cheers, and tears: \" this post contains spoilers that prove fan theories can sometimes turn out true. It's a weird world. \" so begins peter clark at mashable, in a look at the theory that has been swirling surrounding jon snow's true parentage.

The \" l \" part of the equation ( that is, ned stark's sister, lyanna, being jon's mother ) was confirmed, but in her whispers to ned, she didn't audibly say rhaegar targaryen was jon's father. As for why the fan theory persisted, at vanity fair joanna robinson explains that george rr martin hasn't yet reached a confirmation point in his novels. Thanks to his \" slow progress, the show got the honor of that reveal. \" she then shares the \" clues [ that ] were there all along. \" enter a new theory about another major character's surprise parentage, per mashable.

And then came the \" silence of the opening minutes, \" which rolling stone takes a look at. Again at vanity fair, robinson examines the rise of women in season 6, with an interesting side note about cersei — and \" a prophecy ( that the show has ignored ) \" that we perhaps saw the very first step toward in the last moments of the finale.

        "summary": "Bad news for short men and overweight women: you have \" reduced chances in life \" when it comes to income, education, and job prospects, the washington post reports via a new study in the british medical journal. University of exeter researchers analyzed how genetic variants related to height and bmi in 120,000 brits affected socioeconomic markers including annual household income, levels of education, and job class. The results: men who were three inches shorter than those of the same intellect and background earned about $ 2,100 less per year, as did women who were 14 pounds heavier than their peers. Women who were 28 pounds heavier had an annual household income of almost $ 4,300 less than their counterparts, while short men were less likely to work in a skilled or professional job, reports the guardian. Over a lifetime, the differences in pay can mean \" an entirely different standard of living, \" reports discovery news. \" most people assumed that shorter height and higher bmi were a consequence of poorer nutrition and chances in life, \" study co-author tim frayling tells the telegraph. But this study shows a person's height and weight may determine future successes or failures. Experts believe self-esteem, bias, and discrimination may play a role. Previous studies, for example, found tall people earn more money, are more respected, and viewed as more intelligent and powerful in the workplace. Of course \" many shorter men and overweight women are very successful, \" frayling says. But \" this is the best available evidence to indicate that your height or weight can directly influence your earnings. \" ( at least short guys win at marriage. )",

In this case, it is 30 to 32 generations, or at most 800 years. \" [ among ashkenazi jews ] everyone",
            "If you're european jewish and meet another european member of the community, odds are you're at least 30th cousins. A study by an international team suggests the central and eastern european jewish population, known as ashkenazi jews, from whom most american jews are descended, started from a founding population of about 350 people between 600 and 800 years ago. Further, that group of jews who experienced this \" bottleneck \" was of approximately evenly mixed middle eastern and european descent. The findings bolster the mainstream view that the ancestors of european jews were people from the levant and local europeans. An earlier, 19th-century theory posited that the core of the ashkenazi jewish population is descended from khazars, from the russian steppes, but the genetic evidence makes that even less likely, said study researcher itsik pe ' er, an associate professor of computer science and systems biology at columbia university. [ the holy land: 7 amazing archaeological finds ] the \" khazar theory \" has cropped up in recent times as well, notably in 2013. A paper in the journal genome biology and evolution, by eran elhaik, then a postdoctoral researcher at johns hopkins university, posited that the ashkenazi population descended from people in the caucasus. The team analyzed the genomes of 128 ashkenazi jews, comparing them with a reference group of 26 flemish people"

In an in-depth profile, the guardian explores not just how these people manage to live in the world today but how they think they came to be so sensitive to the modern environment. Like susie molloy, who's lived here since the 1990s and serves as a sort of liaison between the afflicted and fascinated visitors, many are former engineers and chemists. Molloy says she gets calls from people every week looking for a place that won't aggravate their affliction, reports 99 % invisible.

A dentist, real estate agent, and grocer all work with those with environmental sensitivities, including shopping for them and leaving the goods outside so no one has to enter the store. Voices in bioethics reports that the population is a uniquely isolated one in that its sufferers tend to avoid large and populated areas, and thus they tend to advocate for themselves less: \" cases such as this create impetus to ask what classifies as a disability, why it is a disability, and what should be done, if anything, to change this mentality. \" one resident, a former engineer, admits that while he won't stop trying to get through each day, \" i ' ll be relieved when this is all over. \" ( a french woman gets $ 900 a month in disability for wifi sensitivity. )",

The research is \" very exciting, \" an unaffiliated scientist says. \" it opens a new window into the past. \" reporting in the journal nature, the researchers note that the vegetarian, found in present-day spain, had a dental abscess and appeared to be chewing tree bark in an attempt to relieve pain. The telltale clue was salicylic acid, which is found in poplar bark and is the active ingredient in aspirin. What's more, the researchers think this same individual ate molds that functioned as a primitive version of penicillin, suggesting neanderthals had a sophisticated awareness of the bacteria ailing them. Their microbiomes, largely distinct from ours, could even provide clues about which diseases ailed them, and maybe even why they died off. ( here's a new piece in the puzzle of our family tree. )",

But russia's foreign minister, sergey lavrov, today shrugged off the notion of exclusion from the g8. \" if our western partners believe that this organizational format has outlived, so be it, \" he said. \" maybe, for a year or two, it will be an experiment for us to see how we live without it. \"",

        "summary": "President trump promises to outline his tax proposals on wednesday, and the big headline in advance is that he wants to cut the corporate tax rate dramatically from 35 % to 15 % even if that raises the national debt. Here's a look at the ramifications, along with other aspects of what's known about the tax plan: such a tax cut would cost the government an estimated $ 2 trillion over a decade, though treasury chief steven mnuchin maintains the tax plan would \" pay for itself with economic growth. \" still, gop lawmakers worried about the deficit are likely to balk. The wall street journal digs into the political hurdles. Reuters predicts trump also will try to cap the individual rate at 33 % and repeal the alternative minimum and real estate taxes. But the story also notes that the surprise rush by trump to release his plan raises questions of whether this will be genuine tax reform or merely a slew of tax cuts. One legislative hitch: if republicans want to pass permanent tax cuts with only 51 votes instead of a two-thirds majority, they must show that the deficit won't grow over a decade. Which means trump's cuts would almost certainly be temporary, explains new york magazine. House republican leaders such as paul ryan say a tax on imports could raise $ 1 trillion, easing the impact on the deficit, but trump seems to have cooled to the idea of the so-called border-adjustment tax, notes the washington post. Even factoring in the bat, ryan proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to only 20 %. Trump boasted to the ap that he would deliver what might be the biggest tax cut in history to americans. Measuring that is not so simple, and the new york times concludes that calvin coolidge is the current president to beat. Bloomberg takes note of another comment of mnuchin's: trump wants to simplify the tax code to the extent that most people could file their returns on a postcard. So which aide has the most influence on trump in regard to taxes? it's tough to say, but an analysis at marketwatch is betting on former goldman sacs exec gary cohn, who is director of the national economic council.",

In fact, humans might've been directly involved, reports the cbc. While studying nine european plague outbreaks that killed 125,000 people between 1348 and 1813 — considered the second pandemic of the bubonic plague, following the first in the sixth century — researchers at the university of oslo and university of ferrara used mathematical models to compare scenarios of transmission by humans, by fleas carried by rats, and by parasites carried by humans, reports cnn. In seven of nine european cities, the latter scenario best matched evidence in mortality records. The theory is that fleas and lice carried by humans would bite an infected person, then jump to another victim and bite again, quickly spreading the disease, per the independent. Researchers believe this is what led to the deaths of 10,000 people in florence in 1400, 17,000 people in london in 1563-64, and more than 53,000 people in moscow in 1771, according to the study published monday in pnas. Experts believe this may also explain more recent plague outbreaks in africa. But perhaps you shouldn't feel so bad for those misjudged rats after all. The study notes the flea-carrying rodents did help spread the plague in the third pandemic, starting in 1855.

It was previously suggested that rodents, whose fleas can also transmit the bacteria behind the plague, were the main culprits behind europe's second pandemic of the disease that saw a string of outbreaks occur in succession. Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague. Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing. Pneumonic plague is more virulent or",

Dean, lead author on a paper published monday in the journal proceedings in the national academy of sciences. Dean and her colleagues studied nine outbreaks of the plague from 1348 to 1813 in european cities, including barcelona, florence, london, stockholm, moscow and gdansk, poland. A total of 125,000 people died in those outbreaks, sometimes so",

It was previously suggested that rodents, whose fleas can also transmit the bacteria behind the plague, were the main culprits behind europe's second pandemic of the disease that saw a string of outbreaks occur in succession. Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague. Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing. Pneumonic plague is more virulent or",
            "For centuries black rats have borne the brunt of the blame for the spread of the black death, which killed 25 million people across europe during the first deadly pandemic in the mid-14th century. The plague was thought to have been largely transmitted by infected fleas living on rats, which would then bite humans. In total it is thought the disease has killed between 75 – 200 million people. But has rattus rattus been unfairly accused of transferring the deadly bacteria? computer modelling carried out by a research team from the universities of oslo and ferrara suggests the first outbreak may not have been down to the rats, but instead can be \"largely ascribed to human fleas and body lice \". Using mortality data from nine outbreaks of the plague in europe between the 14th and 19th centuries, the researchers plotted how the disease would likely spread by different means.

According to the bbc, moaza al matrooshi was born with a potentially fatal blood disorder and needed chemotherapy, which can permanently damage ovaries. Before chemo, her family made the bold decision to remove matrooshi's right ovary and freeze it — three years before frozen ovarian tissue would be successfully used in a birth. But on tuesday matrooshi gave birth to a healthy baby boy. She's believed to be the first person in the world to give birth using ovarian tissue frozen before puberty. Last year, doctors attached four pieces of matrooshi's frozen right ovary to her nonworking left ovary and another piece to her uterus. Within three months, matrooshi — who had been going through menopause — was having regular periods. Her fertility returned, as well. She describes the birth of her son as \" like a miracle. \" \" i always believed that i would be a mum, \" she says. \" i didn't stop hoping. \" her doctor, sara matthews, says the birth is a \" huge step forward \" that will give girls facing cancer or other disorders hope that they ' ll still be able to start a family. \" we've never known if we could take tissue from a child, freeze it, and make it work again, \" matthews says.

Young recently told the ap that he joined the bloods street gang after his father was shot and killed in a robbery when he was 8, and he hoped to prevent others going down the same road. Before the 2004 robbery, young raped a woman in front of her three children.

Bloomberg reports the company that basically invented the smartphone with its blackberry 850 in 1999 got disastrously outpaced by apple and samsung in the new millennium. Cnn points out that even microsoft's disappointing windows phones currently outsell blackberries, which were so popular at their height that people nicknamed them \" crackberries. \" known for their security, blackberries were once used by everyone from kim kardashian to president obama. But even the us senate finally stopped using them last summer, usa today reports. The company once worth $ 80 billion is now estimated at just $ 4.3 billion. Now, in an attempt to claw back to profitability, blackberry will be outsourcing the manufacturing of blackberry-branded phones to an indonesian company, with manufacturers in china and india likely to follow. Blackberry ceo john chen says the company will \" pivot to software. \" with wednesday's announcement, blackberry stocks rose more than 3 %. Ironically, chen says blackberry phone sales — recently just 1 % of iphone sales — may increase with this move, as they remain popular in places like south africa, nigeria, and indonesia.

As the site notes, trump as a candidate had mocked president obama's decision to include climate change in his own national security strategy of 2015, and a draft statement suggests that trump will shift thinking in the opposite direction. \" us leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to us economic and energy security interests, \" the draft statement reads. It also states that \" much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. \" trump's national security strategy also will emphasize the threat posed by the \" revisionist \" powers of russia and china, reports the new york times. But while the strategy talks about confronting beijing's growing economic clout around the world, it does not deal in detail with the cyber warfare that moscow is accused of waging, notes the newspaper. The national security strategy will be \" as much an economic document as a defense strategy, \" per usa today. The newspaper notes that previous presidents have sometimes given the strategy document short shrift, but that trump is signaling that he's \" personally invested \" in this one by deciding to unveil it himself in a speech.",

During his successful campaign, trump mocked obama's placement of climate change in the context of national security.

            "The trump administration will reverse course from previous obama administration policy, eliminating climate change from a list of national security threats. The national security strategy to be released on monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection, according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft. \"climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system, \" a draft of the national security strategy slated to be released on monday said. \"u.s. Leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to u.s. Economic and energy security interests. Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. \" this matches president trump's vision, sometimes shared using his trademark hyperbole, that the united states needs to emphasize national security and economic growth over climate change. During his successful campaign, trump mocked obama's placement of climate change in the context of national security. Here's a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in hilton head, south carolina, in late 2015: so obama's always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, ok? no",

Machado's friend ryan bychkowski took a photo of the bride handcuffed in her wedding dress as a cop writes up a ticket, while machado tweeted a video of the dejected-looking bride sitting on the ground outside the bar. Police say the 36-year-old bride was charged with assault, the 37-year-old tuxedo-clad groom with mischief. It's not clear what exactly happened in the bar, but one person suffered minor injuries. Witnesses say someone in the wedding party apparently made physical contact with a staff member, punched a window for some reason, the bride got pinned against a wall by bouncers, and things went downhill — all while the other 100 or so patrons of the bar eagerly looked on. According to a tweet from bychkowski, a bouncer explained the story on facebook and claimed bar staff decided to cut off the wedding party and ask them to leave, but on their way out, the groom groped a bartender and all hell broke loose. \" i've seen the odd scrap but never one where there's a girl in a wedding dress bouncing around, \" says bychkowski.

In the post, wright says he hopes his apology won't hurt the reputations of those who have supported him, and he singles out two prominent members of the bitcoin community, jon matonis and gavin andresen. But it doesn't appear that wright will be coming out with any further clarification, given that the post ends with, \" and goodbye. \" wired, which had suggested wright was indeed the creator months before this week's strange turn of events, calls it a \" bizarre conclusion to a bizarre saga that, like most things satoshi nakamoto-related, leaves more questions than answers. \"",

Now imagine this happened to you in the late stages of pregnancy and your unborn child decided that would be the ideal time to make her way into the world. That's exactly what happened to 35-year-old amber pangborn, who made a snap decision to take back roads to her parents ' house when she started to go into labor wednesday night, reports kcra. \" i was told about this back road and people had showed it to me a few times, but i had never driven it by myself, \" she says of her route through california's plumas national forest, where she ran out of gas and lost cellphone service. Little did she know that was just the beginning. First order of business: she gave birth to her daughter, marissa, the next day, by herself. \" i laid out a sleeping [ bag ] in the backseat, lied down, gripped the handle above the back window, and gave birth to my daughter, \" she tells khsl. She didn't cut the umbilical cord right away, fearing her newborn would starve; she survived on three apples and a little water and soda. Then the bee swarms came. \" the meat bees came out and were trying to get the placenta. … i was trying to protect [ my daughter ] from getting stung and i got stung trying, \" she says. Desperate, she started a signal fire using a can of hairspray and a lighter — a fire that quickly whooshed up the mountainside. \" i was looking at marissa and i told her, ' honey, i think mommy just started a forest fire, ' \" she says. But it worked: the us forest service saw the blaze and found them saturday. ( pangborn's story makes this birth on a plane seem like a cakewalk. )",

The snakes, which can grow to 18 feet, were spotted by \" terrified parents \" beside the park's playground for children, says the daily mail. \" i ' m not going anywhere near the park until they call in the experts and figure out why the park is full of snakes — there is no chance my kids are going there to be gobbled up until they sort this out, \" said a 31-year-old father of two. Actually, the reptiles first asphyxiate their prey — which ( at least in captivity ) tend to be little creatures like mice, rats, and rabbits. In a big city, cats and small dogs may be most at risk. An owner who couldn't keep the snakes likely set them free in plashet park, says the mail, leaving them to be grabbed by police with litter pickers and dropped in evidence bags. \" this is certainly the most bizarre call i can think of my officers dealing with during my time in newham, \" said a police official. British papers didn't report on the fate of the snakes. See a video of the police action, or read about a 20-foot-snake in a new jersey lake.",

Still, the oakland settlement is \" in the best interests of jasmine, \" and may help pay for her education, one of her lawyers tells the san francisco chronicle. Oakland mayor libby schaaf adds it was also \" in the best interest of the city to settle this matter quickly and fairly, \" noting the city remains \" focused on rebuilding the public trust that was so damaged by this incident. \" the settlement was approved during a 7-1 vote at a city council meeting on wednesday. The lone dissenter wanted the city to pay more. Officers allegedly gave jasmine information about prostitution stings in exchange for sex and protected her from arrest.",

In what upi deems the \" largest functional brain imaging survey ever, \" researchers from california's amen clinics used a type of 3d imaging to determine that women's brains are decidedly more active than males ' in many regions — especially in those that handle focus and self-control, as well as those that manage mood disorders, per a press release. The findings suggest a possible tie between the higher rates of alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders in women, as well as higher rates of adhd and conduct-related issues in men, who are also more likely to be incarcerated. Scientists say the study is important in advancing our understanding of gender-based brain differences, which can then lead to better, more targeted treatment for various conditions down the road. The study, published in the journal of alzheimer's disease, looked at more than 46,000 single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) scans from 119 healthy subjects and more than 26,000 participants with various psychiatric conditions ( including bipolar disorder and adhd ) to measure blood flow in 128 discrete regions of the brain, both at rest and immersed in a concentration task. Scientists observed increased blood flow in women to their prefrontal cortexes ( the region that handles impulse control and concentration ) and limbic areas ( the mood and emotion managers ), while men's visual and coordination centers lit up more than women's. \" the quantifiable differences we identified between men and women are important for understanding gender-based risk for brain disorders such as alzheimer's disease, \" lead author daniel g.

            "Amman ( reuters ) - syrian government forces killed more than 200 people, most of them civilians, in a village in the province of hama on thursday, opposition activists said. The village of taramseh was shelled by syrian troops and later stormed by pro-government shabbiha militia, they said. Several people in the village were killed by the shelling and more were shot later in the head, execution-style, they added. Syrian television said three security personnel had been killed in fighting in taramseh, and accused \" armed terrorist groups \" of committing a massacre there.

        "summary": "There are six theories under investigation regarding the fate of the missing malaysia airlines flight, reports nbc news, and most will sound familiar at this point: hijacking or pilot suicide, for instance. But there are far more than six theories being floated around, and business insider picks up a particularly fascinating one that henry blodget dubs the \" most plausible \" theory yet. It comes compliments of former pilot chris goodfellow, who makes the case that the pilot was a \" hero \" who was responding, properly, to a fire on board. Goodfellow lays out the timeline on google+. He suggests that not long after takeoff and shortly after the \" good night \" sign-off, the pilots detected a fire onboard, with smoke starting to fill the cockpit. The source? possibly a tire in the front landing gear, which could have blown \" on takeoff and started slowly burning. Yes this happens with underinflated tires. Remember heavy plane, hot night, sea level, long run takeoff. \" the captain then followed his training, and changed course to the nearest feasible airport, in this case, pulau langkawi, and entered the new destination into the flight computer. He then took a sharp turn toward the west. Writes goodfellow, \" we old pilots were always drilled to always know the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Always in our head. Always. \" their priority would not have been to communicate, but to deal with the fire. And their first response would be to turn off electrical \" busses \" in a bid to isolate it. That would have disabled systems like the transponder and acars. ( he cites the 1998 crash of a swissair dc-10 off nova scotia that reacted as such to a fire and saw its transponders shut off as a result — trouble started an hour after takeoff. ) goodfellow's theory then takes a turn for the dark: \" a tire fire once going would produce horrific incapacitating smoke, \" that ultimately caused the pilots to either lose consciousness or die. The plane continued on autopilot until the fuel ran out, or until the fire destroyed the cockpit's controls and the plane crashed.",
