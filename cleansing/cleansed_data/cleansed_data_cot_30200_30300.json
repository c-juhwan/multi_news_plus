        "summary": "Popular chain in-n-out is suing a california startup to make sure customers actually have to put on pants if they want their burger and fries. Eater reports in-n-out filed a lawsuit against doordash, which lets customers order food from hundreds of restaurants through its website and app, on nov. 6 in an effort to bar the startup from delivering its food. In-n-out has charged doordash with trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition, according to boingboing. The lawsuit claims the \" unlicensed delivery business \" uses a fake in-n-out logo on its website to trick consumers into thinking they have an agreement with in-n-out to deliver its food, which is not the case. The lawsuit also states doordash doesn't have proper food safety and handling procedures in place. Eater reports despite doordash apparently stopping in-n-out deliver for the time being, the burger chain is angling for a jury trial. But joe mullin at ars technica isn't so sure in-n-out has a case. As long as customers understand the doordash driver doesn't work for in-n-out, it may not be relevant that they aren't completely clear on any possible legal agreements between the companies. \" third-party delivery services are well understood, \" mullin writes. \" if the burgers come cold, consumers savvy enough to download doordash's app will be savvy enough to blame doordash for their unhappy meal. \" but it's not just in-n-out. Eater reports a number of other restaurants are upset at doordash for using their names, logos, and menus while simultaneously jacking up prices.",

Functioning door-close buttons went out with the introduction in 1990 of the americans with disabilities act, which requires doors to stay open for people in wheelchairs, using crutches, and so forth, explains national elevator industry executive director karen penafiel. Repair people and firefighters still have keys or codes that make the door-close buttons work, but for us regular schmoes the button is a mere tease, quartz reports. \" we can't help but feel a little bit lied to by our beloved elevators, \" laments a blog at the huffington post. But just because door-close buttons don't actually close doors doesn't mean they're completely useless. The times reports they act kind of like a psychological placebo. \" perceived control is very important, \" harvard psychology professor ellen langer says. \" it diminishes stress and promotes well being. \" john kounios, another psychology professor, describes the door-close button as \" mildly therapeutic \" since the door does eventually close, providing the button-pusher with a reward. Kounios says he doesn't think people will ever stop pressing the door-close button — or any of the other buttons in the world. \" i've got nothing else to do while waiting, so why not press the button on the off chance that this one will work? \" he says.

            "But as the new york times reported in 2004, the city deactivated most of the pedestrian buttons long ago with the emergence of computer-controlled traffic signals. More than 2,500 of the 3,250 walk buttons that were in place at the time existed as mechanical placebos. Today there are 120 working signals, the city said. About 500 were removed during major construction projects. But it was estimated that it would cost $ 1 million to dismantle the nonfunctioning mechanisms, so city officials decided to keep them in place. Most of the buttons were scattered throughout the city, mainly outside of manhattan. They were relics of the 1970s, before computers began choreographing traffic signal patterns on major arteries. Abc news reported in 2010 that it found only one functioning crosswalk button in a survey of signals in austin, tex.; gainesville, fla.; and syracuse.

Depending on where you work, you might find the thermostat in a plastic case under lock and key, but if you're lucky you might have control over one. Well, you might think you have control. The air conditioning, heating and refrigeration news reported in 2003 that it asked readers in an informal online survey whether they had ever installed \"dummy thermostats. \" of 70 who responded, 51 said they had."

She was elaborating on comments earlier this month, in italian daily corriere della sera, in which she said of leonardo: \" in france, all he did was die. \" leonardo was born in 1452 in the tuscan town of vinci, italy, and died in amboise, france, in 1519. Borgonzoni criticized how as part of the 2017 arrangement, italy also pledged to program its own exhibits so they won't compete with the louvre mega-show. The louvre declined to comment on italy's objections, nor say which artworks it requested from italy, noting it's nearly a year before the four-months-long exhibit opens on oct. 24, 2019. \" while respecting the autonomy of museums, national interests can't be put in second place, \" borgonzoni tells corriere. \" the french can't have everything. \" ( meanwhile, the leaning tower of pisa's lean has changed. )",

        "summary": "Being a loner can ruin your health as much as obesity, say researchers. The new study out of brigham young university warns that loneliness and social isolation can affect longevity as severely as more common health risks, reports the salt lake tribune. The effect is more pronounced among young people, according to the study in perspectives on psychological science, which crunched data on previous research involving more than 3 million people. It's not enough to rack up facebook friends or surround yourself with superficial acquaintances, say the researchers — it's all about genuine connections. On the other hand, establishing and nurturing such relationships can improve physical health. \"we need to start taking our social relationships more seriously, \" says the study's lead author from byu. That's especially true as more people choose to live alone, with the huffington post citing census bureau stats showing that single-person households have risen from 17 % to 27 % since 1970. \" we're at the highest recorded rates ever on the planet, \" says a co-author. \" with loneliness on the rise, we are predicting a possible loneliness epidemic in the future. \" after controlling for various factors, the researchers concluded that the increased likelihood of death for people who reported loneliness or social isolation, or who lived alone, was around 30 %, reports cbs news. ( another study found that 9 % of people have no close friends. )",

        "summary": "One of the most talked about election topics at the moment is donald trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship for immigrants — the notion that anyone born in the us automatically becomes a citizen. \" i don't think they have american citizenship, \" he told bill o'reilly on fox last night, reports poltico. Trump added that some \" very, very good lawyers \" agree with his position. \" we have to start a process, bill, where we take back our country. \" some related takes: 14th amendment: it states, \" all persons born or naturalized in the united states, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside. \" that may seem clear cut, but cnn explains that the clause about \" subject to the jurisdiction thereof \" provides wiggle room for trump's position. The candidate says he's not interested in amending the constitution and argues he can end birthright citizenship without doing so. Election over? at the washington post, paul waldman writes that \" it's possible that the entire presidential election just got decided \" over this issue. Trump is forcing other gop candidates to state their position on birthright citizenship, and many are lining up behind him in varying degrees. \" the simple fact is that if republicans don't improve their performance among hispanic voters, they cannot win the white house. Period. \" and this might make it impossible. Election not over: trump's plan \" may appeal to the most rapidly expanding electorate, senior citizens, and may have an even greater appeal to the millions of republicans who stayed away from the polls in 2012 as well as the ethnic and blue-collar democrats who crossed party lines to vote republican in the congressional elections of 2014, \" writes edward erler at the national review. \" all of these voters outnumber any increase in the latino vote, \" which typically goes to democrats anyway. But either way: trump's run may have been dismissed as \" merely a spectacle \" early on, but with his immigration plan, \" he seems to have started something even more engrossing: a substantive political debate, \" writes kelefa sanneh at the new yorker. Some still think the issue is too important to be left to trump, \" but perhaps the topic was too politically risky, too, to be broached by anyone else. \"",

        "summary": "The trial of the ex-marine accused of murdering american sniper chris kyle begins today, and the much-watched case is likely to last about two weeks, nbc news reports. Jurors in stephenville, texas, will receive 24-hour-a-day security as they deliberate over what looks to be the trial's key question: whether the accused man, 27-year-old eddie ray routh, is not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Following his arrest, routh, whose lawyers say had post-traumatic stress disorder, told authorities that \" tons of people ( were ) eating my soul. \" referring to kyle, he said, \" i knew if i didn't take out his soul, he would take my soul next. \" in a 911 call after the shooting of kyle and kyle's friend chad littlefield, routh's sister called her brother \" f --- ing psychotic, \" cnn reports. As for prosecutors, they plan to argue that routh was using alcohol and marijuana the day of the murders; they hold that routh's past has been rife with \" self-intoxication \" involving a variety of drugs, wfaa reports. Prosecutors will also argue that routh used a knife to threaten his girlfriend on the day of the incident. Nbc notes three possible outcomes for the case: life in prison, if routh is found guilty of capital murder; 20 years in prison, if he's convicted of second-degree murder; or a not-guilty verdict if jurors believe he was legally insane. He would then likely spend the rest of his days in a mental health facility. Such a verdict carries weighty implications for others with ptsd: \" it's such a big case that it's going to make us look like we're crazy, and we're not... We don't want the civilian world to be intimidated by us, to be scared or to wait for us to come in and shoot up people, \" says a former soldier. \" i feel like that's what this is going to do. \"",

Three portions of mummified legs found more than a century ago in the looted tomb of queen nefertari — wife of ramesses the great, who ruled during egypt's 19th dynasty about 3,300 years ago — were x-rayed by university of zurich researchers and found to have belonged to a middle-aged woman, perhaps with arthritis. Animal fat used in embalming also suggests she died during egypt's 19th or 20th dynasty, leading researchers to conclude the legs are probably nefertari's, who is believed to have died between the ages of 40 and 50 around 1250bc, per live science. Though \" no absolute certainty exists... The most likely scenario is that the mummified knees truly belong to queen nefertari, \" researchers write in plos one, adding that grass and papyrus sandals found alongside the remains are of a style common in the 19th dynasty.

The story cited unnamed people who said the republican pennsylvania representative used thousands of dollars from his congressional office fund to settle the sexual harassment complaint the ex-aide filed last summer to the congressional office of compliance. Ryan's spokeswoman said the allegations must be investigated \" fully and immediately \" by the house ethics committee and that meehan would immediately submit himself to the committee's review. Meehan is being removed from his position on the committee, and ryan told meehan that he should repay any taxpayer funds used to settle, reports the ap.

The accuser's lawyer, alexis ronickher, called the allegations \" well-grounded \" and rejected the idea of doing away with confidentiality.

Mr. Meehan's case sheds new light on secretive congressional processes for handling such complaints, which advocates say are slanted to favor abusers, allowing them to use the vast resources of the federal government to intimidate, isolate and silence their victims. As a member of the ethics committee, mr. Meehan was tasked with being a part of the solution. The panel has initiated investigations into sexual misconduct claims against at least four congressmen in recent months. Two have resigned: trent franks, republican of arizona, and john conyers jr., democrat of michigan. The other two, blake farenthold, republican of texas, and ruben kihuen, a freshman democrat from nevada, remain in office but have said they will not seek re-election. Mr. Meehan has been pushing for protections for domestic violence victims since his time as a local prosecutor. In congress, he has sponsored legislation mandating the reporting of sexual violence, and he is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force to end such violence. This account is based on interviews with 10 people, including friends and former colleagues of the former aide and others who worked around the office. The new york times is not naming the former aide, who followed the recommended procedures for reporting harassment but",

        "summary": "News flash: men will lie to appear more masculine when their masculinity is called into question. So report researchers at the university of washington in a study published last week in the journal social psychology. Men who were led to believe they fall short of the ideals of manliness ( e.g., told their hand-grip strength was less than it really is ) would overcompensate ( e.g., lie about their height, number of past romantic relationships, and athleticism ), while men who were told their grip is average would not. The researchers trot out johnny cash's \" a boy named sue, \" in which the title character becomes scrappy and prone to fighting when his name is mocked, as an example. They also note that women are under pressure to live up to feminine ideals and can similarly exaggerate femininity to demonstrate gender norms. \" this research shows that men are under very strong prescriptive norms to be a certain way, and they work hard to correct the image they project when their masculinity is under threat, \" co-author benoit monin, a professor of organizational behavior and psychology at stanford university, said in the school press release. This level of sensitivity to perceived emasculation can be tough on men themselves and the people around them, reports salon. Meanwhile, other studies have found that unemployed men are more likely to use force against women, while men with baby faces are more likely to commit crimes. ( another stanford professor warns that porn and video games are behind a masculinity crisis. )",

The search intensified after ground-penetrating radar showed a soil disturbance beneath the house. Steven's sons took over the work in the last few months, ultimately finding bones 6 to 8 feet down, near an old well encased in concrete. Suffolk police plan to use dental records or dna testing to identify the remains in a process that could take months. As for the question of who would have killed george, 57-year-old michael, who was an infant when the korean war veteran went missing, tells wabc he has someone in mind. But he wouldn't say more, other than to say the perpetrator is likely dead. Cbs new york reports it asked michael the same thing, and that he didn't want to speculate but did suggest there were troubles in george's marriage to dorothy, who died in 1998. \" i feel great that my dad is finally free from that crappy hole, \" says michael.

Dr. Julius garvey, 82, used what would have been his father's 129th birthday on wednesday to launch a campaign to clear his name. Marcus garvey's 1923 mail fraud conviction still leaves \"a whiff of subversion about the idea \" of supporting his father's teachings, garvey told the national press club, per the ap. Garvey, who died in london in 1940, was a landmark figure in american civil rights and founded the universal negro improvement association in 1914. His fiery black-pride philosophy included the belief that blacks could never achieve racial justice in white america and should therefore separate and return to africa. Critics lined up against him, including naacp founder web du bois, who called garvey \" the most dangerous enemy of the negro race in america, \" according to nbc. Nevertheless, garvey created the black star line shipping company to bring his people — and commerce — to africa. His efforts to solicit donations and stocks from investors by mail prompted an fbi investigation, and garvey was convicted of mail fraud. After serving more than two years in prison, garvey opted to be deported to jamaica, where he was born. Julius garvey, joined by several congressmen and naacp officials, says it's time his father is cleared. \" everyone stands on the shoulders of everyone who comes before.there would be no black president if it wasn't for the civil rights movement, \" said garvey, a new york surgeon.

        "summary": "Uber rolled out self-driving car service in san francisco wednesday and it did not go smoothly. Within hours, the california department of motor vehicles ordered the company to halt the service, saying it was breaking the law because it didn't have the necessary testing permit to \" operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads, \" the new york times reports. Adding to the controversy, an uber self-driving vehicle was filmed running a red light and almost mowing down a pedestrian, though the company later issued a statement saying that the car in question was being driven by a human at the time, reports the san diego union-tribune. The self-driving uber cars, which are being assigned at random to uber customers, come with a driver or engineer at the wheel to monitor the vehicle. Uber — which launched its self-driving service in pittsburgh earlier this year — argues that this means that the vehicles are not true self-driving cars, and are therefore legal. The dmv disagrees, which could set up the kind of legal showdown that marked the service's early years, the san francisco chronicle reports. A university of south carolina law professor who's an expert on the issues surrounding self-driving cars tells the chronicle that if uber refuses to pull the self-driving service, the dmv could seek an injunction or revoke the vehicles'registrations — or police could start ticketing the human \" drivers \" for reckless driving.",

On wednesday afternoon, an uber spokesperson answered press inquiries and told buzzfeed the vehicle in question was being driven by a human and was not carrying any passengers. In a statement, the spokesperson told buzzfeed: \"this incident was due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads"

Business insider sees that comment as an indication that maybe this is just a stunt, noting that in order to not bring harm to the snake, rosolie would have to get out of it without cutting it open, an \" improbable \" feat.

            "Washington ( ap ) — on baby names, at least, divided americans can generally agree: emma and noah are tops. And don't name your child isis. For the second year in a row, emma and noah top the annual list of top baby names, according to the social security administration. That's the third year on top for noah and the second in a row for emma, which was also no. 1 in 2008. The administration released its annual list of top baby names friday, and the top five names for girls and boys in 2015 remained unchanged from the previous year. Noah was followed by liam, mason, jacob and william. Emma was followed by olivia, sophia, ava and isabella. Ava and isabella switched spots from 2014, with ava climbing to number 4. One major change was the girls ' name isis, which had remained steadily in the middle of the pack of the country's top 1,000 names for the last 15 years. In 2015, after the name had emerged as an acronym for the extremist group islamic state, it dropped completely off the list. That's a dramatic shift, says laura wattenberg, baby name expert and founder of babynamewizard.com. \" it's actually quite rare for a name to be eliminated by issues in the news, \" she says, noting that the name adolph was still at no. 555 in the u.s. At the end of world war ii when the nazis and adolf hitler fell. There's another recent example, though: the name hillary dropped off the list in 2009, a year after hillary clinton lost the democratic presidential primary to barack obama. The name was no. 721 in 2008. Hillary remained off the list this year, as did the name of her current democratic primary opponent, bernie, as in sanders. Barack has never appeared in the top 1,000 names, and the popularity of the name of obama's predecessor, president george w. Bush, dropped slightly during his eight-year presidency, from no. 130 to no. 163. The first name of this year's presumptive republican presidential nominee, donald trump, also dropped in 2015, from no. 418 to no. 441. Wattenberg said"

Vittorio missoni, 58, an owner of the family-run label famed for its zigzag knitwear, and his wife, maurizia castiglioni, were aboard the plane, which was missing after takeoff from the island resort of los roques, the company confirmed saturday. The plane was bound for the international airport near the venezuelan capital, caracas, normally a half-hour trip. Venezuelan officials said that four passengers and two crew members were aboard. The interior minister, néstor reverol, said friday night on venezuelan television that the plane, a bn2 islander, took off from los roques at 11: 29 a.m. And that its last known position was 10 nautical miles south of los roques, an archipelago that is a popular destination among wealthy europeans, particularly italians. The missoni family is widely revered in the italian fashion industry for its kaleidoscopic patterns applied over the years to sweaters, home furnishings, beach towels and even water bottles.

To recap: rick perry spent yesterday dodging bullets over his family's ill-named hunting camp, \" niggerhead \"; herman cain rebuked perry on tv for \" a lack of insensitivity \"; now gop commentators are taking aim at herman cain. Why? thank \" the attitude on the right that accusations of racism directed at white people are of far greater consequence than any lingering vestiges of institutional racism nonwhites might face, \" serwer writes. A few samples: \" it also seems to be a slander herman cain is picking up and running with as a way to get into second place, \" writes erick erickson at redstate. Before now, cain's \" big appeal is that he's not just another black race-card-playing politician, \" says glenn reynolds at instapundit. Cain's criticism was \" a cheap shot, and, perhaps a signal that cain is willing to play the race card against a fellow republican when it benefits him, \" writes matt lewis at daily caller. \" the key phrase here is ' fellow republican, ' \" writes serwer. \" because, you see, no one thought cain was ' playing the race card ' when he said in the same program that black people are ' brainwashed ' into voting for democrats. \"",

All those attacks used 11.43-caliber bullets, according to the ap, and a judicial source tells sky news that the same gun was used. The gunman opened fire on a spot where children are picked up for school, and the city is on \" lockdown \" as police hunt for the shooter, who escaped on the scooter. \"this is a medieval city with narrow winding roads, where it is easy for a scooter to outrun a police car, \" said one observer.

        "summary": "The only thing that has moved slower than taylor glacier is progress on solving a 100-year-old mystery about the famous red waterfall nearby — until now. Since 1911, when a scientist first stumbled across antarctica's blood falls, researchers have been scratching their heads about a flow of salty water leading from the glacier to what atlas obscura refers to as the \" five-story, blood-red waterfall. \" but a study published in the journal of glaciology may have unearthed what's behind this \" englacial hydrologic system \" fueling the falls. The direct reason for why the water is red isn't what's been perplexing us: a press release explains that the water plummeting over the side is filled with iron, which causes the brine to turn red when it makes contact with oxygen. It's where this brine is coming from, however, that has remained an unknown. That is, until scientists from the university of alaska fairbanks and colorado college set to work with radar gear and found evidence of lots of salty water buried beneath the glacier, perhaps for up to 1 million years. Much like the echolocation used by bats, the technique the scientists used to send and receive electrical signals in \" grid-like patterns \" through the glacier's ice led them to a find previously thought impossible: flowing liquid water existing in a frozen glacier. Co-author erin pettit explains that \" water releases heat as it freezes, \" which melts surrounding ice and lets the salty water ( with a lower freezing temperature ) flow. The discovery now opens the doors to \" understanding the role of liquid water — salty or fresh — in other extremely cold glaciers or permafrost environments, \" co-author jessica badgeley adds, per a colorado college press release.

            "What is echolocation? echolocation is the use of sound waves and echoes to determine where objects are in space. Bats use echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark. To echolocate, bats send out sound waves from the mouth or nose. When the sound waves hit an object they produce echoes. The echo bounces off the object and returns to the bats ' ears. Bats listen to the echoes to figure out where the object is, how big it is, and its shape. Using echolocation, bats can detect objects as thin as a human hair in complete darkness. Echolocation allows bats to find insects the size of mosquitoes, which many bats",

        "summary": "Whales need to surface in order to breathe, and the narwhal is no different. Every four to six minutes, the arctic whale — including males with a long tooth resembling a horn — must emerge from the depths of baffin bay between baffin island and greenland, where 80 % of all narwhals winter, and find tiny openings in the ice, reports the new york times. \" you don't see open water for miles and miles and suddenly there's a small crack, and you ' ll see narwhals in it, \" says the lead author of a new plos study. \" i've always wondered how do these animals navigate under that, and how do they find these small openings to breathe? \" the answer, it turns out, is remarkable. Narwhals use the most directional sonar of any species, sending up to 1,000 \" clicks of sound \" per second through their heads, then directing the clicks into a beam, focusing on prey like fish and squid in the arctic depths, or sections of open water amid an icy surface. After placing underwater microphones at 11 pack ice sites in baffin bay, per a release, researchers found narwhals made a wide scan of an area through echolocation, but could also narrow their sound beam into \" the most directional biosonar signal reported for any species to date. \" think \" a spotlight rather than a floodlight, \" per cosmos. In directing the signal up, narwhals have a clear \" view \" of surface areas free of ice. \" it is not like a singing humpback whale that spreads the sound widely and can be heard over long distances, \" says an ecologist not involved in the study. The downside: researchers say narwhals ' echolocation may suffer as noisy ships, including those with sonar, enter their habitat. Adds the ecologist: \" narwhals are living a secretive life in the arctic, but this study has unveiled one of the secrets from the deep waters in the arctic. \" ( a narwhal's tusk may suggest the size of its testicles. )",

The narwhal is considered one of the arctic's most sensitive marine mammals: more than 80 percent winter in one place -- baffin bay -- and their summering refuges include lancaster sound, which is expected to become a year-round shipping route as the ice retreats with climate change. To get a baseline of narwhal sonar and its use, the researchers recorded the species ' echolocation beams at 11 pack ice sites in baffin bay, west greenland, in 2013. Hydrophones were placed at depths between 3 and 18 meters. The recordings revealed that narwhal clicks are the most directional sonar signal of any species, which may help to reduce echoes from the water or sea ice surface. The researchers also determined click intensities, and found that narwhals scan vertically with sonar during ascents and descents. Besides characterizing narwhal sonar to provide a reference for future acoustic monitoring in the region, the data gathered in this study might be used to distinguish narwhal sonar from that of belugas, the arctic's other toothed whale",

Source level measurements show narwhal click intensities of up to 222 db pp re 1 μpa, with a mean apparent source level of 215 db pp re 1 μpa. During ascents and descents the narwhals perform scanning in the vertical plane with their sonar beam. This study provides valuable information for reference sonar parameters of narwhals and for the use of acoustic monitoring in the arctic.

Videos of the carnage in deir al-asafir were posted online, reports the bbc, and show a woman weeping over a girl's body, two girls dead in the street, and two lifeless boys in the backseat of a car. \" none of those killed were older than 15 years old, \" an activist tells reuters. Reports of bomblet-spraying cluster bombs being used on rebel-held towns are increasing, though bashar al-assad's regime maintains that it doesn't possess the weapons. The bbc explains that such bomblets are packed with hundreds of metal pieces that can kill those within an 80-foot range. In other syria news: syrian rebels captured a helicopter base just outside damascus yesterday and destroyed government helicopters to prevent them from being used against opposition forces. At least 15 rebels and eight soldiers were killed in the process. An activist calls the seizure a \" blow to the morale of the regime, because it is close to the heart of the capital, \" reports the ap, which notes the base is about 10 miles from damascus. Assad's regime is hard-up for cash — and propublica reports that it got some big help on that front by way of russia, which flew 240 tons of \" bank notes \" into the country via eight moscow-to-damascus flights between july and september, according to flight manifest records.

The crime stoppers reward in the case has risen to $ 54,000, reports myfox 13, but the increased money hasn't helped so far.

        "summary": "It might be the strangest journey to the solution of a math conundrum ever. It turns out that an anonymous post on the online forum 4chan about how to watch a japanese anime series may have helped crack a 25-year-old math problem, reports the verge. Not surprisingly, this one takes some unpacking, and it starts here: in september 2011, a fan of the series the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya posted a question on 4chan about the 14-episode first season. The season deals with time travel, and the episodes did not air in chronological order, a quirk that prompted a debate among fans about the best order in which to watch them. The question that went up on 4chan: if someone wanted to watch them in every possible order, what's the minimum number they'd have to watch? the answer soon came from an anonymous poster: 93,884,313,611, per quanta magazine. \"please look over [ the proof ] for any loopholes i might have missed, \" wrote the poster, but his solution languished in obscurity for seven years. What mathematicians have just discovered is that the proof is not only legit but an important advance in a problem first raised in 1993 in the field of combinatorics and involving \" superpermutations. \" the post didn't provide a complete solution, but last month, sci-fi writer greg egan seemed to solve another key part — in math lingo, he provided the \" upper bound \" answer to the 4chan poster's \" lower bound \" answer. It was egan's post that drew new attention to the 4chan post. Now mathematicians are working to combine the two into one solution. \"it's a weird situation that this very elegant proof of something that wasn't previously known was posted in such an unlikely place, \" says one. ( this solution to a $ 1 million math problem isn't going over well. )",

It calls its system \" recomposition \" and says it \" transforms bodies into soil so that we can grow new life after we die. \" as the moscow-pullman daily news reports, the team is currently in the process of getting the necessary oks to move forward. Most recently, they learned they ' ll be granted wiggle room by the state department of ecology regarding permitted \" air pollution sources, \" a step on the way toward their intended pilot experiment: composting remains in a portion of washington state university's composter. As wsu explains, in 1994 it became the first university in america to build its own commercial-size composting facility. The daily news reports animal remains — carcasses, entrails, and manure — are already processed there. A post on the state's department of ecology website explains the 66-foot-long composter will be divided into three 22-foot parts, which will allow the project to isolate the human testing from the typical composting activities there. Other hoops have been jumped through, but a final decision won't come from wsu on the project until early october. The project's faq addresses a range of questions, including whether bones and teeth can be composted. The short answer: they think so. The seattle times notes the project has run one experiment thus far involving wood chips and a 78-year-old woman's remains. ( read about another green burial idea. )",

Cnn's sources say the trump associates, including business contacts as well as high-level campaign aides, were in \" constant communication \" with the russians, \" raising a red flag \" for intelligence agencies and law enforcement. The times'sources say former trump campaign chairman paul manafort is among those being investigated, though he strongly denies having improper contacts. \" i have never been involved with anything to do with the russian government or the putin administration or any other issues under investigation today, \" he says, adding: \" it's not like these people wear badges that say, ' i ' m a russian intelligence officer.

We want her to complete her treatment so that she can return home knowing she has put this completely behind her. \" meanwhile, cassandra — who also found out yesterday she lost the part-time job she relied on to pay for her phone and save for college and a car — just wants a visit from her mother, whom she hasn't been permitted to see since new year's day.",

            "The wife of disgraced syracuse university assistant basketball coach bernie fine had sex with numerous players over many years, according to an explosive affidavit by one of the ball boys fine is accused of molesting. In the court papers, robert davis, one of the former ball boys, says he overheard laurie fine and the wife of another coach talk about performing oral sex on players, and the \"specific size and physical attributes \" of their private parts. The university fired fine in late november after espn reported that it had an audiotape in which laurie fine acknowledged she feared her husband had molested davis but felt powerless to stop it. Davis also told espn the coach's wife initiated sex with him when he was a high school senior. The coach has not been charged with any crime because the local prosecutor determined the statute of limitations had run out. See the court documents the new affidavit was filed in new york state supreme court on monday by attorney gloria allred, who filed a lawsuit last month on behalf of davis and his stepbrother michael lang. The suit charged that syracuse coach jim boeheim defamed them when he said they lied about being sexually abused by fine, boeheim's longtime assistant. \"i believe boeheim deliberately chose to ignore what he knew was improper behavior, or actually knew precisely what was happening and did",
            "An affidavit filed in a slander suit against syracuse university and basketball coach jim boeheim says the wife of fired assistant bernie fine had sex with players, and several people associated with the program knew about it, including fine. In the affidavit, bobby davis, a former ball boy with the men's team, says he was present on several occasions with basketball players when he heard them speaking of having sex with laurie fine. Davis said players joked about it and it seemed to be an openly known fact that laurie fine had sex with basketball players. A lawyer for laurie fine said the accusations were \" disgusting. \" after davis and his step-brother, mike lang, accused bernie fine of molesting them when they were boys, boeheim vehemently defended his longtime friend and assistant coach.

            "The wife of disgraced syracuse university assistant basketball coach bernie fine had sex with numerous players over many years, according to an explosive affidavit by one of the ball boys fine is accused of molesting. In the court papers, robert davis, one of the former ball boys, says he overheard laurie fine and the wife of another coach talk about performing oral sex on players, and the \"specific size and physical attributes \" of their private parts. The university fired fine in late november after espn reported that it had an audiotape in which laurie fine acknowledged she feared her husband had molested davis but felt powerless to stop it. Davis also told espn the coach's wife initiated sex with him when he was a high school senior. The coach has not been charged with any crime because the local prosecutor determined the statute of limitations had run out. See the court documents the new affidavit was filed in new york state supreme court on monday by attorney gloria allred, who filed a lawsuit last month on behalf of davis and his stepbrother michael lang. The suit charged that syracuse coach jim boeheim defamed them when he said they lied about being sexually abused by fine, boeheim's longtime assistant. \"i believe boeheim deliberately chose to ignore what he knew was improper behavior, or actually knew precisely what was happening and did",

Ryan duke, 33, was charged with murder thursday in connection with the disappearance of tara grinstead in october 2005. According to wsb-tv, someone came into the sheriff's office a few days ago with a tip that led to new interviews in the case, which then led to probable cause to arrest duke. Grinstead, who was 30 when she went missing, was last seen helping miss sweet potato pageant contestants, then going to a cookout with a friend. After she was reported missing two days later, authorities found her house locked up, her pets and car at home, and no signs of foul play. Despite interviewing more than 200 people after grinstead's disappearance, authorities never came up with a suspect or person of interest, 11alive reports. Investigators say duke was never even \" on our radar. \" duke was a student at the high school where grinstead taught history; he graduated three years before she disappeared. Prosecutors say duke killed grinstead with his hands in her home, then removed her body, which has never been found. Officials aren't giving a motive or saying how or if grinstead and duke knew each other. Duke is also facing charges for burglary, assault, and concealing a death. Grinstead's family says his arrest has brought them some amount of closure. ( a woman's fatal shooting in 2001 continues to perplex: was it an accident or murder? )",

The contest had been seen as do-or-die for rubio, and it turned out to be die: he suspended his campaign in an evening address to supporters. Both cnn and the ap called the state as soon as the last polls closed at 8pm eastern, with trump up by nearly 20 points in the winner-take-all contest. In the other big race, however, kasich got a much-needed win in his own home state of ohio. Kasich beat trump by around 11 %, and he received a rousing cheer from supporters when he promised, \" i will not take a low road to the highest office in the land, \" per reuters. Trump, meanwhile, praised rubio: \" he's tough, he's smart, and he's got a great future. \" in the other three states voting tuesday night, trump racked up victories in illinois and north carolina, and with 99 % of precincts in, he had an 0.2 % lead over ted cruz in missouri. Earlier, he won the northern mariana islands caucus with 73 % of the vote. ( click for democratic results. )",

For trump, the republican front-runner, florida's all-or-nothing contest represents a momentous win, giving him 99 additional delegates — the largest in the quintet of contests taking place tuesday. His victory deals a devastating blow to florida sen. Marco rubio, who many in the republican establishment had backed in the hope of derailing trump's dash to the nomination.

That's according to early results of exit polls conducted for the associated press and television networks for edison research. Only about 4 in 10 republican voters in each state want all immigrants in the country illegally to be deported.

The violence began on july 12, the climax of a protestant celebration of a 17th-century victory over catholics, when thousands of parades marking the victory take place across northern ireland. One such parade was banned from passing by the catholic district of ardoyne in north belfast, and protestants have been protesting at the decision since then.

Accomplished mountaineers kyle dempster and scott adamson set out to climb the north face of baintha brakk ii, also known as ogre ii, on aug. 21, and they were due back at camp a week ago, kutv reports. Intense snowstorms around the 23,000-foot mountain have made it impossible for a rescue helicopter to get close enough to search for the men, who tried to conquer the peak last year but turned back after adamson fell near the summit and broke his leg. If a helicopter can spot the men — who would have run out of food and fuel by now if they're alive and stranded — a rescue team is standing by. \" it's a remote area in pakistan, not like you see with teams of people in the himalayas, \" a rep of black diamond equipment, which sponsored the climbers, tells cnn. \" the cook is at the base camp now with two american climbers and four german-austrian climbers [ who ] were on the same glacier and they are the rescue group. \" the men were last seen aug. 22, when their cook spotted their headlamps around halfway up the peak, according to a gofundme page to help with rescue costs, which has raised more than $ 170,000.

        "summary": "Eric holder described the cybercrimes charges against five chinese military officers as a \" wake-up call \" and china is certainly paying attention: government officials have summoned the us ambassador in beijing, suspended a cybersecurity agreement made with the us last month, and denounced the charges as an \" absurd \" move that has \" severely damaged mutual trust, \" reports the bbc, which notes that it is \" extremely unlikely \" that any of the accused will ever be sent to the us to face charges. The government's internet information agency was also quoted as saying, \" the us is the biggest attacker of china's cyberspace. \" more: federal officials say the five people charged, all members of the chinese military's secretive unit 61398, were part of a hacking campaign that gave chinese industries an advantage at the expense of american firms, reports the huffington post. They allegedly used screen names like \" uglygorilla \" and \" kandygoo \" as they tricked their way into computer networks. How they reportedly tried to gain access in many cases: by sending \" spearfishing \" messages that appeared to come from \" trustworthy senders. \" according to the indictment, the targeted entities included westinghouse electric co., us steel corp., the united steelworkers union, and solarworld, the ap reports. The hackers are accused of stealing proprietary information including design specifications for westinghouse pipes and pricing and strategy information from solarworld. In the case of the latter company, the indictment claims the hackers stole thousands of email and attachments during a period in which solarworld was \" an active litigant in trade cases against chinese solar manufacturers. \" officials say that beyond unit 61398, the nsa and other agencies are tracking at least 20 other chinese hacking groups targeting the american government and us industries. \" if you look at all the groups that we track in china, this is just the very tip of the iceberg, \" a co-founder of security firm crowdstrike tells the new york times. \" the indictments are just one piece of a broader puzzle. \"",

Unlike that presidential debate, no clear winner is being anointed. Some highlights: testy early: ryan goes after obama's response to the libya attack in particular and foreign policy in general. Biden breaks in: \" with all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey, because not a single thing he said was accurate. \" one of the things ryan said: obama's mideast policy is \" making the world more chaotic and us less safe. \" unemployment: ryan points out that unemployment in biden's hometown of scranton is 10 %, up from 8.5 % since obama took office. \"that's how things are going all across america, \" ryan said. \" that's not how things are going, \" biden chimed in. Ryan's line \" might have been one of the most powerful punches he threw all night, \" writes rosalind s. Helderman at the washington post. 47 percent: obama didn't address the matter at his debate, but biden did. \"these people are my mom and dad, \" he said. \"they pay more effective tax than gov. Romney pays with his federal income tax. \" the hill laugh line: referring to romney's 47 % remarks, ryan said that as biden well knows, \" sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way. \" ( but \" i always say what i mean, \" retorted biden, who added that romney's \" soliloquy \" on the 47 % was no mere mistake. ) taxes: \"there aren't enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending, \" ryan said of his opponents. Addressing the camera, he said, \"watch out middle class, the tax bill is coming to you. \" biden, on the other hand, said the ryan-romney plan is the one that would hit ordinary americans. \"the middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now. \" ryan zings: \" i know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but i think people would be better served if we don't interrupt each other, \" he said in a clear reference to obama's debate performance.

Asked whether he ' ll ever open his account again, baldwin replied, \" never. No. I went to jimmy gandolfini's funeral, and when i was there i realized jimmy gandolfini didn't have twitter. Jimmy gandolfini was so beloved as a person, and he was so admired as an actor, and he didn't give a f --- about social media. I really learned a lesson at the funeral. I said to myself, this is all a waste of time.... It's just another chink in your armor for people to come and kill you. I stopped and said to myself, i ' m going to try where i just don't do this anymore. \" ( baldwin's twitter account is actually back online, so maybe he's just not planning to tweet from it anymore. ) from there, baldwin segues into a fantasy that his expected daughter with wife hilaria will have no idea he was ever a celebrity: \" i have one dream in my life and that is that this daughter i ' m having — she comes to me about seven or eight years from now, she has a friend, and she's at her house and she says,'daddy, susie's mom says you used to be on tv. Daddy, is that true?'she has no knowledge of me as a public person. That would be heaven for me. \" but will he really quit acting? \" i'd love to if i could, yeah. That would be the greatest thing in the world, \" he says. But only if he \" could find something else to do, \" he adds. ( at the monday event, baldwin was reportedly acting strangely and talking with an accent — click for the details. )",

He oversaw the selection process that chose dozens of young, conservative judges to fill vacancies on the federal bench. With mcgahn's help, trump has been able to install no fewer than 29 appeals court judges and 52 district court judges — \" a record for any administration this early in its term, \" according to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell — as well as kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on the supreme court. But mcgahn also clashed with trump repeatedly in his time as white house counsel, especially over the robert mueller investigation, the washington post reports. Last year, mcgahn reportedly told trump he would quit rather than follow an order to have mueller fired. Washington attorney pat cipollone is set to replace mcgahn, and he is likely to be a busy man: along with the mueller investigation, which he has already been informally advising the administration on, his office will have to deal with multiple subpoenas and other requests if the democrats win control of the house in the midterm elections.

With pressure expected to drop steeply friday evening, another bomb cyclone is a distinct possibility. Experts are warning of flooding, strong winds, and heavy rain. With tides already high due to the full moon, storm surges of up to 4 feet and waves as high as 8 feet are possible. Eastern massachusetts and southern maine are expected to get the worst of the flooding, and boston harbor may see its highest peak tide levels in at least 58 years. The massachusetts governor has activated 200 national guard members, and coastal communities are being warned of potential evacuations. The national weather service is also warning of hurricane-force winds for most of massachusetts. Meanwhile, up to 5 inches of rain is predicted for some areas, and blizzard conditions are possible in parts of pennsylvania. Power outages and flight delays are likely.

As of this writing, $ 4,746,660 has been pledged to the green party's quest to have votes recounted in michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania. At the washington post, david weigel calls it \" the largest donation drive for a third party in history, \" but he's not too optimistic that it will amount to much, especially as plenty of cold water has been thrown on the argument that results \" may have been manipulated or hacked \" in those states. Among the reasons why: the fundraising page explains that in 2004, the green and libertarian parties demanded a recount in ohio. \" the page expresses success: \" an election administrator went to jail. We also exposed the profound problems with dre machines, which helped launch an election integrity movement. \" but weigel notes the vote remained virtually unchanged, with john kerry picking up fewer than 300 votes; george w. Bush won the state by 118,457 votes. And a recount might not really be much of a recount in pennsylvania, which mostly uses direct record electronic machines. \" in other races where those machines have been probed...

The benefits start wednesday at stores in florida and will expand nationwide this summer, the ap reports. Prime members will get an additional 10 % off sale items and exclusive deals on certain groceries. This week in florida, for example, prime members can get $ 2 off a pound of organic strawberries, half off on wild halibut steaks, or buy-one-get-one-free cases of sparkling water. An amazon vp tells the wall street journal the 10 % discount will apply to hundreds or even thousands of items. As for the other specials, \" it ' ll be a good mix of produce, meats, and seafood \" each week. To show that they're prime members, shoppers can scan the whole foods app at the register or give the cashier their phone number. Since it bought whole foods last year, amazon.com inc. Has cut prices on some groceries, started offering same-day delivery to prime members in several cities, and extended its 5 % cash-back amazon rewards credit card to whole foods purchases. But turning its prime membership into the whole foods loyalty program could drive more people to its stores. Amazon said last month that it had more than 100 million paid prime members worldwide. That was before it announced it's raising the price to $ 119 a year, up from $ 99. Prime members get fast shipping from amazon.com and other perks, like access to its video streaming service. Analysts believe the growth rate of prime membership is slowing as it has mostly saturated wealthier us households; adding benefits like the whole foods discounts could encourage some of the 40 % of amazon shoppers who aren't prime members to join.",
