This week, however, park police dismantled it on a technicality, reports the washington post. The move drew so much attention given the shelter's reputation as a fixture in dc that it was back up within hours. What happened is that a staffer who was supposed to be at the vigil all night left early. ( he's a vet struggling with ptsd, says a picciotto supporter. ) park police then moved in, citing a rule that \" a 24-hour vigil requires no permit but must be continuously occupied. \" when the shelter was awol yesterday morning, picciotto and her supporters got help from dc congressional representative eleanor norton, who pulled some strings and helped get it put back into place. And picciotto is back in action, too. \" now more than ever we need to communicate to people the danger of the nuclear bomb, \" she says, per the la times.",

        "summary": "Goalkeepers, it seems, fall victim to a classic problem faced by gamblers — and during a penalty shootout, it could cost them the match. The \" gambler's fallacy \" is the mistaken idea that, given a pair of outcomes, a string of one means the other is \" due \" to occur. For instance, as discover notes, if you have a series of coin flips that land on heads, you might think a tails has got to be coming soon. Goalies appear to think that way when it comes to penalty kicks, science reports. When a player takes a penalty shot, a goalie essentially has to guess where the ball is going to go with little information. To fend off opponents, goalies should ideally choose randomly, thus preventing the other team from figuring out a pattern. But when researchers reviewed major international games from 1976 to 2012, they found that goalies tended to go in the direction opposite where the ball was last kicked. Knowing that could help kickers score more goals, science notes. ( as for gamblers, it may help to be aware of the fallacy — which helps fuel apparent losing streaks, this study suggests. )",

            "You see it happen in all the major soccer tournaments: as a penalty shot is being taken, the goalkeeper leaps in one direction and the striker deftly kicks the ball into the opposite corner. Such fruitless dives are inevitable because the goalie has no time to see which way the kick is going — he has to start the dive before then if he is to have any chance of saving it. The best strategy would be to choose randomly, but, according to researchers in the united kingdom, goalkeepers aren't very good at that. Instead, they fall victim to a misjudgment called the gambler's fallacy. Strikers taking penalties should take note, the researchers say, because they could score more goals against goalies that make this mistake. Penalty kicks, as the name implies, are normally a punishment for a serious infringement of the rules, such as a deliberate foul on an attacking player in the goal area. The ball is placed on a spot 11 meters from the goal. A player from the team that was fouled runs up and has a free shot at goal. In knockout tournaments, such as the world cup, if the score is tied at the end of a match, the winner may be decided by a penalty shootout. The two teams take turns shooting at goal — using a different player for each kick — and the winner is the side with the highest score after five shots each. ( if they're still tied, they keep shooting. ) previous studies on penalty kicks have indicated that goalkeepers must make up their minds which way to move before they see the ball fly off the kicker's foot, either by watching the body movements of the kicker to anticipate his kick or simply by committing to one direction or the other. Cognitive neuroscientist patrick haggard of university college london says that because a kicker may try to disguise his true intentions, by and large the goalkeeper's decision is a simple guess. Game theory — a branch of mathematics that deals with competitive systems such as sport, economics, and ecology — says the best strategy is to decide randomly, as any regularity could be exploited by the kicker. Haggard and his ph.d. Student erman misirlisoy looked at keepers'dive patterns in all 37 penalty shootouts in world cup and european cup matches between 1976 and 2012. They noticed that, after a ball had been aimed to one side, keepers were more likely to dive the other way",

Between 2000 and 2007, 13 autochthonous cases — meaning victims contracted it here, as opposed to while traveling elsewhere — of leishmaniasis cropped up in texas and oklahoma, compared to just 29 cases spanning almost the entire 20th century, the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene reported in 2012. Why? the tropical disease is moving north, likely due to climate change, reports national geographic. What's more, because leishmaniasis has heretofore been largely confined to impoverished realms, effective treatment isn't really available. \" it has not been a priority for drug development, \" says dr. Peter jay hotez, dean of baylor college of medicine's national school of tropical medicine. Twenty-some people in a group of explorers \" who plunged into nearly impenetrable honduran rainforest in order to groundtruth the legend that it concealed a fabled ' white city ' \" contracted the parasitic disease, per national geographic, thanks to the tiny sand fly, its vector. And while these numbers may sound low — outbreak news today reports on \" scores \" of patients going to the hospital in tripoli just last week — the centers for disease control calculates that there are somewhere between 1 million and 2 million new cases a year throughout the world. \" in south sudan, visceral leishmaniasis killed 10 times as many people as died in the ebola outbreak of 2014-15 — but it was silent, no one has covered this, \" says hotez.

        "summary": "A common narrative has emerged in the wake of robert mugabe's ouster in zimbabwe: his undoing can be blamed on wife grace's greedy grab for power. Actually, this narrative is being cast as a \" tale of two wives, \" writes zimbabwe-born novelist panashe chigumadzi in a washington post op-ed. The idea is that if mugabe's first wife, sally, hadn't died in 1992, she would have kept robert mugabe's abuses in check. Instead, the narrative goes, sally was replaced by grace, who has been manipulating the now 93-year-old mugabe for decades toward her own ends. It's a convenient tale for mugabe's own zanu-pf party as it seeks to rebrand itself while \" sweeping all that went wrong into a grace mugabe-sized hole. \" for one thing, the idea that sally would have restrained her husband is a stretch. She was by his side, after all, during some horrible abuses in the 1980s, writes chigumadzi. As for grace, she is clearly \" no saint. But she has also done nothing without robert mugabe's endorsement ( and indeed that of many others in the party ). \" if she went too far in trying to solidify herself as her husband's successor, that's more on him than her. No, the one true villain in zimbabwe's tale is robert mugabe, who ruled by the gun and was ultimately ousted by it. To say otherwise \" is at best simplistic and at worst misogynistic, \" writes chigumadzi. Click for the full column.",

            "En español by amanda gardner healthday reporter sunday, march 21, 2010 ( healthday news ) -- for the first time in humans, scientists have successfully used a gene-manipulation therapy to enter tumor cells and block the production of toxic proteins that are causing cancer, researchers report. \" they're basically putting an instruction booklet into the cell saying, ' we don't want this protein expressed for now, ' \" explained gregory adams, co-leader of the developmental therapeutics program at fox chase cancer center in philadelphia. \" it's pretty amazing. It's potentially huge. \" \" this is something we've been waiting to see, \" he continued. \" this directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein, \" added dr. Len lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the american cancer society. \" this is one step away from getting into the actual dna. \" as reported online march 21 in nature, this is the first time the process, known as rna interference ( rnai ), has been shown to work in humans.

The latest: in a wednesday night interview with bill o'reilly, trump didn't come close to budging. The hill recounts the many ways o'reilly tried to convince him: he said \" turn the other cheek, \" and trump replied, \" eye for an eye. \" o'reilly ended the interview by asking trump a question that the two had apparently agreed wasn't to be asked, per politico. If he does indeed skip, the new york times reports he might not be the only one. Still not using the word \" bimbo \" himself, politico notes that trump retweeted a follower's shot at megyn kelly over a provocative gq photo shoot she did: \" and this is the bimbo that's asking presidential questions? \" ted cruz apparently didn't spend wednesday fighting zombies. Politico reports he hunkered down for debate prep, aware that if trump is out, the target is on his back. Cruz also turned up the heat on his \" mano a mano \" debate invite to trump, reports the guardian. Cruz has named a place, time, and potential facilitators and \" sweetened the deal \" by noting two super pac donors will hand $ 1.5 million to veterans charities if trump shows. What the trump camp had to say about the money, to tom llamas of abc: \" desperate, \" \" dirty. \" at the new york times, maggie haberman has the \" most intriguing possible explanation \" for trump's planned no-show: he knows he's ahead in iowa and \" wants to play out the clock \" rather than face tough questions.

        "summary": "Conventional wisdom about forestry has been chopped down and sent through the chipper by new research that shows large, old trees grow much faster than their younger counterparts — and speed up their growth as they age, becoming stronger as the years go by. Researchers studied measurements of more than 670,000 trees from 403 species on every continent but antarctica and were amazed to find that the accelerated growth happened in almost every species, with some old trees growing so fast they added mass to their trunks and limbs equivalent to a whole mid-sized tree every year, the national monitor reports. The study suggests that trees simply don't suffer decline in old age, but are killed only by things like disease, insects, lightning — or loggers, livescience notes. In some old-growth american forests, the biggest trees comprised 6 % of the forest but accounted for a third of the growth. The study has huge implications for forest management and carbon capture, the lead researcher, a us geological survey forest ecologist, tells the los angeles times. \" it's the equivalent of managing a sports team, \" he says. \" you need to know who your star players are. It turns out they're not the 20-year-olds. They're the 90-year-olds. \"",

Not so when it comes to trees, according to a study co-authored by researchers out of the university of nebraska-lincoln.

While speaking at the human genome editing summit in hong kong, he jiankui was asked if his trials included other pregnancies like that which resulted in the birth of twins lulu and nana, whose dna he claims to have altered to make them resistant to hiv. The answer was yes, but it's murky: the ap reports he said the pregnancy was in its early weeks and therefore unclear if it will last. Reuters describes he as calling it a \" potential \" pregnancy but then answering in the affirmative when asked if it was a \" chemical pregnancy, \" which means an early miscarriage. Reuters reports the status of the pregnancy is unclear. \" i feel proudest, \" he said of his work. The bbc reports that he said seven couples — in each case the father was hiv-positive — voluntarily agreed to participate in his trial, and that he zeroed in on hiv, rather than a fatal inherited disease, because no vaccine exists for it. But a bioethicist points out to npr that the twins ' risk of inheriting hiv was next to nil because the mother was not infected. An ethics expert was one of many condemning the choice: \" this experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit. \" the dna changes are inheritable: as npr puts it, \" a mistake could introduce a new disease that could be passed down for generations. \" officials in china's guangdong province, as well as he's employer, southern university of science and technology of china, are investigating.",

Phil bronstein, the executive chair of cir, spent a year talking to the anonymous shooter ( referred to as \" the shooter \" ), ultimately producing a nearly 15,000-word piece titled, \" the man who killed osama bin laden... Is screwed. \" the headline encapsulates the two-fold nature of the piece: recounting the \" most definitive account \" ( verified by a number of sources, including other seals ) \" of those crucial few seconds \" in which the shooter put three bullets into bin laden's head; and tackling this incongruity: \" that a man with hundreds of successful war missions, one of the most decorated combat veterans of our age, who capped his [ 16-year ] career by terminating bin laden, has no landing pad in civilian life. \" bronstein catalogs the absent opportunities, like the $ 25 million bounty on bin laden's head that won't go to the team and the movies and books from which it won't benefit; and the single offer from seal command that he could drive a beer truck in milwaukee under a new identity. And while a private security job might be a valid route, \" many of these guys, including the shooter, do not want to carry a gun ever again for professional use. \" bronstein also catalogs what the shooter lacks: pension ( he left service 36 months short of the necessary 20 years ), healthcare ( though he battles arthritis, eye damage, tendonitis, and blown disks ), protection for his family ( from a retaliatory attack ), disability benefits ( he's waiting ), a healthy marriage ( he and his wife have split, under the pressure of a job that took him away as many as 300 days a year ), and communication from the va ( computer-generated form letters aside ). And as cir's executive director explains in an editor's note, while the shooter faces \" exceptional \" issues upon his re-entry to society, they're \" similar to those many veterans face when leaving the service. \" see the full piece for many more fascinating details, or read about an unusual development at the site of bin laden's assassination.",

Rumors of a deal for panera have been swirling for days, with starbucks one of the companies reportedly interested. On wednesday, the st. Louis chain revealed that it was actually jab, an investment fund based in luxemburg that has quietly become a starbucks rival. In a separate q&a with the ap, panera founder and ceo ron shaich says that he plans to stay on as ceo and that customers should see no difference. Shaich opened a boston cookie store in the early 1980s and expanded to more than 2,000 bakery-cafes with annual revenue of $ 5 billion in sales. Jab will pay $ 315 per panera bread co. Share. That's a 14.5 % premium to the company's tuesday closing price of $ 274. The transaction, which includes approximately $ 340 million of debt, is expected to close in the third quarter. It still needs the approval of panera shareholders. Once the deal is complete, panera will become a privately held company.",

The cover features a weeping prophet muhammad holding an \" i am charlie \" sign under the headline \" all is forgiven. \" there are no more depictions of muhammad inside, though one typically irreverent cartoon features two jihadis in heaven asking where the \" 70 virgins \" are while the slain charlie hebdo staff are seen enjoying an orgy in the background. There are fears the cover cartoon could raise tensions further, but supporters call it a tribute to the slain cartoonists, the new york times reports. \" i have no worries about the cover, \" renald luzier, the cartoonist who drew it, told reporters. \" we have confidence in people's intelligence, and we have confidence in humor. The people who did this attack, they have no sense of humor. \" a new video from al-qaeda in yemen, meanwhile, was aired today claiming it \" chose the target, laid out the plan, and financed the operation \" as \" vengeance for the prophet, \" reports the bbc. ( more on that here. ) new video shows the gunmen boasting of having avenged the prophet.",

        "summary": "Dogs might be better than humans at ignoring bad advice, suggests a new study out of yale. In the experiment, researchers trained dogs to get a treat out of a box by moving a lever and then lifting the lid. Then they left the dogs on their own, and a significant number of them soon figured out the truth: there was no need to move that lever; they merely needed to lift the lid and get their treat. That's interesting in and of itself, notes a post at new york, but it's far more interesting when contrasted with a similar experiment conducted several years ago with kids. In that one, the human subjects went right on pulling that lever, because they had been instructed to do so. \"humans often fall prey to the bad advice of others, \" says lead author laurie santos of yale's canine cognition center in a release. \"children tend to copy all of a teacher's actions, regardless of whether they are necessary or not. \" the dogs, however, were all about ruthless efficiency. Don't be too hard on the humans, though: the researchers behind the study in development science say it's vital kids follow seemingly useless commands. As time explains, \" for a species with as elaborate a social system as ours, efficiency in learning is not necessarily a good thing. \" for instance, a child who learns to wash his hands before eating is delaying his meal, but for good reason.

According to a new study, both domesticated dogs and one species of wild dog do a better job than human beings and chimpanzees of ignoring bad instructions and eliminating unnecessary steps when trying to solve a problem. It's a difference that says a lot about the social order of all of the species.

            "Correction appended sept. 27, 2016 dogs don't wear pants — and it's hard to know how things would work out if they tried. But one thing is clear: if dogs did wear pants, they would use either a belt or suspenders, but definitely not both. That, in some ways, puts them ahead of us. According to a new study, both domesticated dogs and one species of wild dog do a better job than human beings and chimpanzees of ignoring bad instructions and eliminating unnecessary steps when trying to solve a problem. It's a difference that says a lot about the social order of all of the species. The study, published in the journal developmental science and led by angie johnston and paul holden of the yale university canine cognition center, was designed to explore the learning behavior known straightforwardly as overimitation, a feature of our",
            "Photo: li kim goh/getty images when my brother and i were younger, one of our favorite winter activities was to go outside with the family dog, make a bunch of snowballs, throw them somewhere in the distance, and then cackle our sadistic little hearts out as the dog ran around trying to find snowballs on the snowy ground. What can i say? kids are jerks sometimes. To his credit, at least, the dog always got bored of the whole thing pretty quickly. Which, as a matter of fact, speaks to one of science's newest findings about our canine pals: they have no patience for your human nonsense. Specifically, a study recently published in the journal developmental science found that when you give a dog bad directions, it ' ll learn pretty quickly to ignore them. For the study, which recruited 40 pet dogs of varying",

Police in charlotte, nc, say around a dozen officers were injured late tuesday and early wednesday after a man was shot and killed in the parking lot of an apartment complex tuesday afternoon, cnn reports. Police say they were searching for somebody at the complex when they saw keith lamont scott, 43, leave his car holding a gun. Police say scott — who was not the man they were looking for — was approached by officers after he got back in the car and was shot dead when he emerged from the car with a gun again. Police say scott \" posed an imminent deadly threat, \" but family members give a very different account of the shooting to wccb. They say scott was sitting in his car reading a book while he waited for his son to get off a school bus, and police mistook the book for a weapon. Brentley vinson, the officer involved in the shooting, has been with the force since 2014 and is on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated. Sources tell the charlotte observer that vinson, like scott, is african american. The washington post reports that tear gas and rubber bullets were fired during tuesday night's protests and protesters shut down traffic on i-85 early wednesday.",

So-called \" super-spreaders \" are a small group of people who, for whatever reason, turn out to be the major driver behind the spread of diseases, and scientists report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that super-spreaders are more responsible for the ebola epidemic in west africa than previously thought. So far they know a few things; ebola super-spreaders tend to be younger than 15 or in the 40-to-55 age range, for instance. In applying a mathematical model to cases in and near freetown, sierra leone, researchers from princeton and oregon state university mapped out a transmission network and ended up with this estimate: just 3 % of sufferers were responsible for 61 % of infections, reports the washington post. While most cases exhibited short infection periods and didn't infect many others, \" a small number had longer infectious periods and generated more infections, \" one researcher tells the bbc. Now the big question is what makes these people so prone to infect others? it's possible that the major factor is behavioral, with super-spreaders tending to be caregivers who are in more contact with sick people with weakened immune systems. In that case, researchers say the better question might be, \" what are the scenarios where super-spreading might occur? \" the researchers write that if super-spreaders had \" been identified and quarantined promptly \" during the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak, roughly 17,500 of the 28,600 infections might have been prevented.

It was like he was walking out of a forgotten dream. Remember that quest we began nearly 10 years ago? remember \"dead or alive \"? obama spoke quickly, recalling the trauma of 9/11 and the unity. \"we went to war against al-qaeda, \" he said — waking a memory. That's right. That's the enemy. Al-qaeda is vague and formless and dispersed. The u.s. Never waged such a war against such an enemy before. \"we went to war against al-qaeda, \" obama said, and with nearly 10 years of struggle under our belts we realize now what a weighty declaration that is. He spoke of \"tireless work \" over many years all around the world. But",

But bin laden had an option. He could have surrendered. He refused, and the navy seals did what they were trained to do. The first head shot surely ended it, but they gave him a \"double tap \" — a term i hadn't heard until this morning — to make sure. [ update: this reuters story says the seals were ordered to kill, not capture. ] this was an extraordinary job by the military and u.s.

And what seemed like the horrifying opening offensive in a new and terrifying war stands instead as an isolated case — a passing moment when al qaeda seemed to rival fascism and communism as a potential threat to our civilization, and when osama bin laden inspired far more fear and trembling than his actual capabilities deserved. Photo now the man is dead. This is a triumph for the united states of america, for our soldiers and intelligence operatives, and for the president as well. But it is not quite the triumph that it would have seemed if bin laden had been captured a decade ago, because those 10 years have taught us that we didn't need to fear him and his rabble as much as we did, temporarily but intensely, in the weeks when"

            "Spencer platt / getty images president obama walked down an empty corridor to the east room of the white house on sunday night to announce the killing of osama bin laden. It was like he was walking out of a forgotten dream. Remember that quest we began nearly 10 years ago? remember \"dead or alive \"? obama spoke quickly, recalling the trauma of 9/11 and the unity. \"we went to war against al-qaeda, \" he said — waking a memory. That's right. That's the enemy. Al-qaeda is vague and formless and dispersed. The u.s. Never waged such a war against such an enemy before. \"we went to war against al-qaeda, \" obama said, and with nearly 10 years of struggle under our belts we realize now what a weighty declaration that is. He spoke of \"tireless work \" over many years all around the world. But",
            "In his final moments, osama bin laden had a choice — something his victims weren't given. On the airliners, in the towers, at the pentagon, innocent people suddenly had no way out. But bin laden had an option. He could have surrendered. He refused, and the navy seals did what they were trained to do. The first head shot surely ended it, but they gave him a \"double tap \" — a term i hadn't heard until this morning — to make sure. [ update: this reuters story says the seals were ordered to kill, not capture. ] this was an extraordinary job by the military and u.s. Intelligence. \"justice has been done \": that's precisely the right tone. No need for cowboy talk or triumphalism. Americans shouldn't gloat: the message needs to be that this was justice,",
            "But the wave of further violence that seemed inevitable in those fraught months after 9/11 never materialized within our borders. And what seemed like the horrifying opening offensive in a new and terrifying war stands instead as an isolated case — a passing moment when al qaeda seemed to rival fascism and communism as a potential threat to our civilization, and when osama bin laden inspired far more fear and trembling than his actual capabilities deserved. Photo now the man is dead. This is a triumph for the united states of america, for our soldiers and intelligence operatives, and for the president as well. But it is not quite the triumph that it would have seemed if bin laden had been captured a decade ago, because those 10 years have taught us that we didn't need to fear him and his rabble as much as we did, temporarily but intensely, in the weeks when"

        "summary": "Just one week after defense chief james mattis told a senate panel the us is \" not winning in afghanistan, \" a new report reveals that the us wasted $ 28 million on the wrong kind of uniforms for afghan army soldiers. In 2007, the pentagon allowed the afghan defense minister to pick expensive woodland-camouflage patterns from a private company rather than free camouflage schemes from the government, reports usa today. This despite the fact that forest makes up only 2.1 % of afghanistan's land area. The revelation is in a newly released report from afghan special inspector general john sopko. \"this is just simply stupid on its face, \" he tells the newspaper. \" if he thought pink or chartreuse was it, would we have done that? \" a decade ago, us military consultants decided the afghan army needed a more distinct uniform, in part to make it harder for the taliban to stage attacks in counterfeit uniforms, reports the military times. The consultants showed then-afghan defense chief abdul rahim wardak pictures of \" forest \" uniforms they found on the internet, and he \" liked what he saw, \" according to the report. The pentagon bought more than 1.3 million of the uniforms and 88,000 extra pairs of pants \"without conducting any formal testing to determine the pattern's effectiveness for use in afghanistan. \" the report comes at a sensitive time: afghan troops are in the midst of a multi-front conflict with both the taliban and an isis offshoot, and earlier this month president trump gave mattis the authority to increase troop levels.",

Sugar? yes, according to professors at uc san francisco, sugar should be regulated like tobacco and alcohol in order to cut down on ailments like heart disease, high blood pressure, and fatty liver disease, the los angeles times reports. \"for both alcohol and tobacco, there is robust evidence that gentle 'supply side ' control strategies \" such as \" taxation, distribution controls, [ and ] age limits \" are beneficial to society, they write in the journal nature. Sugar also \" meets the same criteria \" as alcohol for government regulation, they say: it's unavoidable, it's toxic, it can be abused, and it's bad for you. Canada and a few european countries are already taxing certain artificially sweetened foods, and denmark is considering a sugar tax. So the usda should at least stop listing fructose on its \" generally recognized as safe \" list, they argue: \"the food industry knows that it has a problem. With enough clamour for change, tectonic shifts in policy become powerful. \"",

Moments later, she was being pulled from her car by officer bryan richter and thrown to the ground — twice. According to the austin american-statesman, the incident happened in june 2015, but video of it didn't surface until this week. King had gotten out of her car during the stop, but richter told her to get back in and close the door. Seconds later, king was being violently arrested. In his report, richter said king had an \" uncooperative attitude \" and may have been reaching for a weapon. But king tells kvue she was in fear for her life. \"i didn't know what was going to happen, \" she says. \" i literally didn't understand what was happening. \" but that wasn't the end of king's ordeal. On the way to jail, another white officer, patrick spradlin, told king, who is black, that police are nervous around black people because of their \" violent tendencies. \" spradlin said black people can be \" very intimidating \" in their \" appearance \" and he doesn't blame white people for being afraid of them. Police chief art acevedo apologized to king on thursday. He says he is \" highly disturbed and disappointed \" by her treatment and called spradlin's comments racist. An investigation has been launched into the incident, but because it has been more than six months since it happened, spradlin and richter can only be punished with a written reprimand. King had been charged with resisting arrest, but those charges were later dropped.",

The 68-year-old actor and his wife grace hightower, 56, had a daughter via surrogate on friday and while a new baby is always cause for celebration, the span between de niro's oldest and his youngest is 40 years.

When a woman has a baby at an older age, she is often taken to task as \" too old \" or \" bad for the baby \" or any number of other things, so why don't men get the same scrutiny? de niro's five other children are almost all grown. His daughter drena, 40, and son raphael, 35, are with former wife diahnne abbott and then he has 16-year-old twin sons julian and aaron, born via surrogate with ex-girlfriend toukie smith. Finally there is eliot. The fact is, de niro could live to be 90 and his daughter could know him for only 23 years. Personally, that is my biggest problem with older people becoming parents. When you lose a parent young, you never get to know them as well as you might have otherwise. With de niro the energy factor is likely not as big a deal given his wife is younger and she has many older siblings to help care for her. And since money is also not an object, they can certainly afford round-the-clock care if they need it. Really, it is a factor of time. New babies take enormous energy and time and"

The two precincts outstanding weren't open on saturday, and the more than 8,000 voters in areas of the island of hawaii that suffered the most devastation from tropical storm iselle late last week will have the option of voting by mail over the coming weeks if they didn't take advantage of early voting. That could lead to a frenzied push by both camps to corral voters in those areas — though hanabusa would have to win the vast majority of the mail"

Following a federal judge's order that all children under age 5 be reunited with their parents by july 10 — and all others by july 25 — lawyers for the government on friday petitioned for an extension of those deadlines, nbc news reports. Us district judge dana sabraw set the deadline last week in a ruling that said the situation has reaching \" crisis level. \" per the ap, health and human services secretary alex azar said thursday that 3,000 children are believed to have been separated, but that includes kids who may have lost parents along the journey, not just parents who were detained at the border. Azar said dna testing is being used to determine parent-child relationships but that inconclusive tests can hold up the process. In the justice department filing, the government said it has identified 101 children under 5 years old who were separated and is the midst of identifying older children. About 40 parents of children in the under 5 age group are in homeland security custody and another nine are in the custody of the us marshals service. \" the government does not wish to unnecessarily delay reunifications or burden class members, \" the justice department filing reads. \" at the same time, however, the government has a strong interest in ensuring that any release of a child from government custody occurs in a manner that ensures the safety of that child. \"",

        "summary": "China has been told that if it wants to bring its fugitives home from the us, it needs to go through proper channels and not send undercover agents on tourist visas to put pressure on them. The obama administration has warned beijing about the use of covert agents in the us as part of its anti-corruption campaign, reports the new york times. Officials tell the times that as part of what beijing has dubbed operation fox hunt, teams of agents have been sent to find \" economic fugitives \" living in the us and persuade them to return to china, using methods including threatening children or grandchildren who are still in the country. An expert at the university of nottingham's china policy institute tells the times that the use of covert agents to pressure people abroad has a long history under the chinese communist party, which he says see itself as ruling all chinese people, no matter if they live abroad or have foreign passports. \" the party believes if you're of chinese ancestry then you're chinese anyway, and if you don't behave like one you're a traitor, \" he says. The warning on chinese agents comes weeks before president xi jinping visits the us, reports voice of america, which notes that the us and china have no formal extradition treaty and bringing one in might be on the agenda during xi's state visit.",

Cnn, however, advises you take the news with a grain — or spoonful — of salt, this after it actually saw the government documents that establish flores ' july 16, 1890 birth date. It, along with kpcc, runs down five reasons why flores is probably a good decade or two younger than is being claimed: though flores has a birth certificate and a national identity card bearing his birth date, neither are original. Bolivia didn't keep records of live births in 1890. In what cnn describes as a \" red flag, \" flores is a man. Gerontologist stephen coles ( who actually looks into these claims for the guinness book of world records ) says the lion's share of supercentenarians are women. He notes that just two of the 57 people verified to having lived past 110 are male, with the oldest man on record having lived to 116. The gerontology research group that coles heads up tracked down what it says is flores ' baptismal certificate — which establishes his age as an impressive but not record-setting 107. He not only still walks at 123, but does so without a cane. His sole living child is 67 — that's a pretty significant generation gap.

        "summary": "In what is surely one of the most gripping experiments currently underway, scientists in australia have been watching a beaker containing pitch, a tar derivative, since 1927. The researchers ' goal in the planet's longest-running experiment — which holds a place in the guinness book of world records — is to show that solids can flow like liquids. And flow this solid did, with the ninth drop finally occurring at the university of queensland over the weekend, phys.org reports. As new scientist reports, drop no. 9 hasn't actually detached from the pitch above it, but has collided with the eighth drop on the beaker's bottom. Between 1930 and 1988, one drop fell an average of every eight years, says professor andrew white. But \" the 2000 ( eighth ) and 2014 ( ninth ) drop each took about 13 years to fall, and each collided into the decades-old pile of drops in the beaker before it could break away from the funnel, \" white says, explaining that the eighth drop didn't actually break free until this year. This marks the first time anyone's actually seen a drop occur, thanks to three webcams that are trained on the experiment and streaming a live feed. The scientist who spent 52 years hoping to see one never managed to do so, though there were near misses, including a very-ill-timed webcam outage in 2000. He died in august. ( a similar experiment underway in dublin since 1944 finally caught a drop on camera last year. )",

After a wait of more than 13 years, the ninth drop of pitch collided ever so slowly with the eighth drop in the bottom of the beaker. The experiment was set up in 1927 to demonstrate that solid materials — pitch shatters if hit with a hammer — can flow like liquids. Pitch drop custodian professor andrew white said seven drops had fallen between 1930, when the experiment began, and 1988, at an average of one drop every eight years. \" two things changed after that – the 2000 ( eighth ) and 2014 ( ninth ) drop each took about 13 years to fall, and each collided into the decades-old pile of drops in the beaker before it could break away from the funnel, \" he said. The eighth drop ran into the seventh drop in 2000, but took almost 14 years to tip over. \" it was still connected to the ninth drop but almost broke free this year. \" the connection had become thin, stressed and light grey – but now that the ninth drop has run into it the whole cycle starts again, \" professor",

Meanwhile, protesters were met for the first time by an organized group of people from the opposing side who are for the controversial budget-repair bill, and gov.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators converged inside and outside the capitol yesterday, the fifth day of protests, as democratic senators remained out of the state, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. One democratic state senator, with backing from public employee unions, said the unions would submit to the financial sacrifices the bill contains as long as they kept their collective bargaining rights, but walker, through a spokesperson, refused to negotiate. And as protesters yelled slogans like \"kill the bill, \" pro-walker demonstrators responded with slogans including \"pass the bill \" — but the protests remained peaceful and no arrests were made. Protests continued today, as walker reiterated his refusal to compromise, the ap adds, noting that 68,000 people turned out yesterday.

But the \" most colorful \" parts, per the miami herald, came when trump tried to tie together hillary clinton's email issues, hacked dnc emails released friday by wikileaks, and russia, which the clinton camp says was behind the dnc hack to bolster trump ( an assessment experts have said looks likely, per politico ). \" russia, if you're listening, i hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, \" trump said, posting a similar tweet a short time later. \" i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. \" when an nbc reporter prodded trump on whether he was asking the us ' one-time biggest foe to hack clinton, trump replied, \" that's up to the president \" before telling her to \" be quiet, \" per the new york times. Some on twitter asked if trump's request — which the times called \" an extraordinary moment \" — amounted to treason, and reaction from clinton's side was swift. \" this has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent, \" adviser jake sullivan says. \" that's not hyperbole, those are just the facts. This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue. \" vp nominee mike pence helped trump double down, adding that democrats are hyperfocusing on the source rather than \" the basic fact that they've been exposed as a party \" that \" rigs \" elections. Politico lists other trump lines from the presser, including remarks about \" sleazeball \" and \" pervert \" anthony weiner, noting, \" i don't know who putin is. He said one nice thing about me. … i never met putin. \"",

Along with other symptoms, green, who suffered a pulmonary embolism once before, tells the telegraph he realized it wasn't a panic attack. A ct scan confirmed his worries, and he was rushed to the hospital and put on blood thinners to \" reverse the clot damage, \" he says. His doctor told him if he had waited longer \" it would have been fatal. \" heartwatch creator david walsh calls it \"truly humbling \" his app played a role. He tells the telegraph he designed the software two years ago after his father died at age 56 from a heart condition. The latest applewatch software alerts wearers if their resting heart rate rises above 120 beats per minute, per cnbc.

        "summary": "An iowa father and son are dead after tangling with a deadly aspect of hog farming: their manure pit. Typically situated below a barn, the manure's noxious fumes don't escape easily, and the hydrogen sulfide — along with methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide — can be a deadly mix. Unfortunately this proved to be the case for the second midwest father-son duo this month when iowa farmers gene and austin opheim were repairing a pump and equipment fell into the manure pit. Austin, 32, went into the pit to retrieve it but was quickly overcome by the fumes, and his father, gene, 58, went in to save him, reports the des moines register. \" ( gene ) was carrying austin on his back and bringing him up and he got almost to the top and he got overcome, and down they went, \" says the sheriff. The pair are described as so close they were \" like glue. \" earlier this month, another father and son in wisconsin fell into a similar trap when they tried to retrieve a broken wheel from a hog manure pit. And in 2007, a family of four and a hired hand all died from fumes at a dairy farm. The tragedy multiplies when family members try to step in and help one another, one expert says. In the opheims ' case, fire and rescue were called to the scene and the men were both removed from the pit, and they were later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, reports cbs local. In his obituary, gene is said to have loved farming, and always carried a tape measure, pliers, and pocket knife. Austin's obituary notes that he married his kindergarten crush, brandi, and leaves two children, addison and aidyn. ( another recent death involving manure was more criminal in nature. )",

            "Tianjin, china — officials grappling with the toxic fallout from a series of deadly explosions that rocked this northern port city last week found themselves struggling on thursday to explain thousands of dead fish that washed up on a riverbank less than four miles away from the blast site. News of the die-off coincided with reports that wastewater runoff near the site of the explosions contained hundreds of times as much cyanide as the maximum level allowed by law. Sodium cyanide, a chemical widely used in gold mining operations, can be toxic to humans even in minuscule quantities. The authorities have acknowledged that at least 700 tons of sodium cyanide were stored at the warehouse that exploded on aug. 12, killing more than 100 people and injuring hundreds more.",

Npr reports that the prime-time speech was written by stephen miller, who wrote trump's inaugural address, though the white house says the tone of this speech will be a lot more optimistic. An administration official tells cnn that trump wants to speak to the country directly and solve \" real problems for real people. \" a roundup of coverage: a preview of policies trump delivered to governors on monday suggests he will use the speech to set out an agenda that includes repeal and replacement of obamacare, cuts to federal regulations, and a $ 54 billion boost in military spending, reports the los angeles times. Politico reports that trump's special guests at the session will include the widow of supreme court justice antonin scalia and the families of three people who were murdered by undocumented immigrants. The tv audience for the address has been steadily shrinking over the years, but the bbc predicts a big rise in ratings this year, because with both houses of congress under gop control, the policies trump sets out are likely to become law — and with trump, the speech is \" unlikely to be boring. \" politico has a list of 11 talking points circulated by the white house ahead of the address. Among them: \" it will be a speech addressed to all americans as americans — not to a coalition of special interests and minor issues. \" astrid silva, a dreamer brought to the us illegally as a child, will deliver a spanish-language democratic response to the address, the ap reports. Former kentucky gov. Steve beshear will deliver a response to trump in english. Congressional republicans will be looking to trump for guidance, though the new york times predicts that his budget proposals, which are expected to leave programs like medicare and social security untouched, will set a \" battle for control of republican ideology \" with house speaker paul ryan. Presidential communication expert richard vatz tells voice of america that at this point, trump is unlikely to tone down the strong comments he has been making since he started running for president. \" people have been predicting for a long time that he will change his tone, but it hasn't happened and i see no reason to think it will now, \" he says. Bloomberg reports that investors are hoping for policy specifics, including on trump's proposed tax cuts — and if they don't get them",

An ontario judge issued the ruling, clearing ghomeshi of four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking in incidents said to have taken place with three different women — including canadian actress lucy decoutere — in late 2002 through the summer of 2003. Ghomeshi, who was fired by the cbc in october 2014, didn't take the stand during the eight-day, judge-only trial and no evidence was put forth by his legal team to directly refute the women's claims. But judge william horkins found the complainants were \" less than full and frank and forthcoming \" and \" demonstrated, to some degree, a willingness to ignore their oath to tell the truth, \" per the guardian. That was enough to generate reasonable doubt, he wrote. And the offensive against the complainants was aggressive. Per the toronto sun, ghomeshi's attorneys produced emails the first unnamed woman sent to him a year after two alleged 2002 assaults, including an email with a picture of her in a bikini — which she says she sent to ghomeshi to \" bait \" him into talking about the assaults. Decoutere, meanwhile, says ghomeshi slapped her and pushed her against a wall, \" cutting off my breath. \" but his lawyers threw in her face a six-page handwritten love letter she had penned to him ( which she noted didn't mean the assaults didn't happen ). And the third woman hid that she performed a sex act on ghomeshi after her alleged assault in july 2003 — but she said she had simply been embarrassed about it and didn't think it relevant. Ghomeshi's second trial, tied to a charge of sexual assault at work in 2008, is set to start june 6.",
