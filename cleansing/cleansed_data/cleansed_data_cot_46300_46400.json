Yakub memon, who raised funds for the attack, made travel arrangements, and obtained weapons and vehicles for car bombs, was the only defendant in the plot to be executed — a rare outcome in india, where only four people ( including memon ) have been executed since 2000, the times notes. Of the 100 people who've been convicted in connection with the crime, 10 others received death sentences that were commuted to life in prison, the ap reports. The main suspects, mobsters dawood ibrahim and memon's brother ibrahim, are still on the run. But there are many who don't think memon should have gotten the death penalty. Social activists and even government officials protested the sentence, with some claiming that muslims and other minority groups receive worse treatment in the penal system than the hindu population. His lawyers also said that memon surrendered of his own free will in nepal, while a retired intelligence official wrote in a 2007 column that was just published last week that \" there is a strong case for having second thoughts about the suitability of the death penalty \" based on memon's willingness to cooperate. But the judge who sentenced memon tells the times of india that even if he did surrender, that doesn't qualify \" as an act of repentance or remorse. \"",

But a \" minor \" eruption in 1538 was still plenty serious, releasing enough material to form a new mountain. An italian philosopher of the time described that eruption thusly: \" at the second hour of the night, this mount of earth opened like a mouth, with a great roaring, vomiting much fire and pumice and stones. \" now activity is picking up at campi flegrei. Uplift started in 2005, and an alert level for the volcano was raised in 2012, requiring seismic monitoring, afp reports. Recent years have seen increases in minor seismic activity and ground deformation. On tuesday, researchers published a study in nature stating that the caldera is nearing a \" critical degassing pressure \" that \" can drive volcanic unrest toward a critical state. \" it's still impossible to say when another eruption may occur, but researchers are hoping to spur more research and monitoring at campi flegrei for the sake of the residents of nearby naples, for whom an eruption \" would be very dangerous. \" ( meanwhile, the biggest volcano on earth may be waking up. )",

            "The critical degassing pressure during magma decompression the decompression of fresh magma results in the selective release of dissolved volatiles depending on their solubilities28. This means that while barely soluble co 2 dominates deep degassing3,29,30, more-soluble h 2 o prevails at shallower depths31. Given this selective release of volatiles from magma and the different capacities of these two species to carry thermal energy, the pattern of heat transfer to overlying rocks and hydrothermal systems will be complex and will vary as the unrest progresses. Several saturation models have been reported in the literature25,28,32,33,34,35,36 that can be used to investigate magma degassing in an h 2 o – co 2 system. Whereas most of them predict the h 2 o and co 2 solubilities over narrow ranges of silicate melt composition, one of the models25 can be extended to any silicate melt composition. Here we use that model to predict h 2 o – co 2 partitioning during magma"

She's kidding, of course, and says her 5-minute mockumentary aims to prove a point: that contouring, and unrealistic images of women in social media generally, have gone too far. \" i didn't want to shame anyone that wants to body contour, \" she tells today. \" it definitely has a place in photo shoots, and maybe even special occasions. But just the thought of applying makeup so heavily all over your body... The time it'd take, and impracticality of it. It rubs off on clothes and furniture and wears off if you sweat or as you walk. \" morello admits to contouring her face ( shaping it with makeup, in other words ) in most of her videos, but she's not alone in saying the trend has gone too far. Some people are even contouring their toes — \" seriously, \" sighs yahoo! beauty. And kim kardashian, who helped popularize contouring, tells vogue she's pretty much over it. \" i think right now it's more about non-touring, like real skin with less make-up on it, \" she says. As for reaction to her video, morello says that while most people got the joke, some called her a hypocrite who profits from, well, vanity, and others body-shamed her for being \" fat, \" saying she's an example of why a first date should be to the lap pool.

They hadn't seen each other since just after christmas when on jan. 22 derusse allegedly kidnapped hmm at her sister's austin apartment complex, forcing her into a car with a bb gun he'd made to look real; police described it as \" very realistic, \" kxan reports. During their three-state trek, derusse not only allegedly handcuffed hmm but also set her up with a neck pillow and a sleep mask so that she would look like a willing passenger in his car simply taking a nap, and didn't remove them for 400 miles. Hmm's father reported his daughter and her car missing, and her gps revealed that the car was in kansas. Police stopped derusse on jan. 23 before he reached the b&b, and he told officers hmm was his \" fiancee \" and they were driving her car. During a private conversation with an officer, though, she revealed what really happened. Derusse eventually confessed and told officers about his proposal plan; they found an engagement ring in the car. He was arrested and has been charged with kidnapping in federal court; he faces life in prison. ( this proposal also went very, very wrong. )",

The story has a graphic explaining what's happening below ground to try to plug the leak.

            "A campaign for diet coke carrying the theme \"you're on, \" which the coca-cola company introduced in north america only three months ago, is being turned off after being mocked in social media. The ads are to be replaced on wednesday with a campaign for the summer reviving the theme \"just for the taste of it, \" which introduced diet coke in 1982 and has returned at least three times since. The replacement campaign begins with print ads and commercials. The \"you're on \" ads presented diet coke as a pick-me-up for young strivers, akin to an energy drink. A billboard described it as \"how go-getters get going. \" a print ad said: \"you've got an 8 a.m. Interview, a perfect black suit and three letters in your future: c.e.o. \" and in a television commercial that ran most recently on saturday, an announcer proclaimed: \"when it",

( gothamist has collected some prime tweets along these, er, lines. ) and while one imagines no such connection to cocaine is implied, you can understand the snarky reaction.

That corollary, of which we should be reminded from time to time, is this: popular entertainment from hollywood is – to greater or lesser extent – propaganda. And miller has his part in that, thanks to films such as 300 and sin city. Perhaps you have had this thought before. Perhaps you have had it often. I can remember politics dawning on me while watching a steven seagal vehicle, under siege, in 1992. I was in my early 30s. The film was without redeeming merit – there's no other way to put it – and it was about a \" ruthless enemy \" and the reimposition of the american social order through violence and rugged individualism.

That corollary, of which we should be reminded from time to time, is this: popular entertainment from hollywood is – to greater or lesser extent – propaganda. And miller has his part in that, thanks to films such as 300 and sin city. Perhaps you have had this thought before. Perhaps you have had it often. I can remember politics dawning on me while watching a steven seagal vehicle, under siege, in 1992. I was in my early 30s.

Shared recently by her former classmates — including one who wrote a widely read essay targeting shen, who denies the allegations — gao's story is seen as an example of the abuse suffered by women in china, per the times, and universities including peking, which shen left in 2011, have responded with promises to do better.

Peking university, meanwhile, says shen received a \" warning penalty \" after police found he'd \" violated teachers ' morality \" in 1998, per the telegraph. The school is now promising to institute new rules on sexual harassment, reports global news, but student activists are cautious. One tells the times that peking has \" shown no sense of introspection about the unequal power dynamics between students and teachers \" since gao's death. \" merely resolving one or two specific cases is meant to gag the public, \" she adds.

Some 23 % of republicans support cain's nomination, putting him in a virtual tie with mitt romney, who is at 24 %, a washington post-abc news poll finds. That's the best he's done in wapo-abc polls all year. What's more, 70 % of republicans say the allegations won't affect their vote, and 55 % don't see the charges as a \" serious matter. \" that doesn't mean cain is out of the woods, however. Some 37 % of republicans and 42 % of gop-leaning independents call the scandal serious, and republican women are twice as likely as men to agree that it could make them less likely to vote for cain. Romney has a strong lead among those concerned about the allegations — details of which keep rolling in. Several sources have provided accounts of an accuser's story to politico and the new york times; one says the woman felt \"her job was at risk \" if she rejected a suggestive comment from cain.

Papenheim's family says it can't afford the $ 40,000 or so they estimate it will cost to bring her body back to the us, as well as for funeral and burial costs; a gofundme set up to help them defray those expenses had brought in more than $ 20,000 as of friday morning.

( ap ) — authorities called in a mobile dna lab and anthropologists to help identify the dead as the search went on for victims of the most destructive wildfire in california history. The overall death toll from the outbreak of fires at both ends of the state stood at 25 sunday and appeared likely to rise. The worst of the blazes was in northern california, where flames reduced the town of paradise, population 27,000, to a smoking ruin days ago and continued to rage in surrounding communities. The number of people killed in that fire alone, at least 23, made it the third-deadliest on record in the state. Butte county sheriff kory honea said the county was bringing in more rescue workers and consulted anthropologists from california state university at chico because in some cases \" the only remains we are able to find are bones or bone fragments. \" \" this weighs heavy on all of us, \" honea said. Authorities were also bringing in a dna lab and encouraged people with missing relatives to submit samples to aid in identifying the dead. The sheriff's department compiled a list of 110 people unaccounted for, but officials held out hope that many were safe but had no cellphones or some other way to contact loved ones.

        "summary": "George zimmerman's trial has moved on from key witness rachel jeantel, with today seeing a handful of people take the stand. The day's standout testimony, largely per the orlando sentinel: zimmerman neighbor john good, described by the ap as having \" perhaps the best view of the struggle, \" said he heard noise while watching tv on the night trayvon martin was killed and stepped outside to investigate. He described seeing a mma-style scene unfold. In his telling, the two men were \" tussling \" on the ground, with the person on top in a straddle position and throwing punches \" ground and pound \" style. He described the person on top as darkly-clad, with the one on the bottom in either red or white, and having lighter skin. Per the evidence, trayvon was in a dark-colored sweatshirt and zimmerman was dressed in red that night. When asked if he believed trayvon was on top, good replied, \" correct... That's what it looked like. \" neighbor jonathon manalo, who was the first one to step outside and took cellphone photos that night that were shown to the jury today, described \" blood running down [ zimmerman's ] nose from both nostrils and over his lips. \" he said zimmerman's demeanor was calm, and said zimmerman asked him to call his wife. \" just tell her i shot someone, \" manalo recounts zimmerman as saying. He said zimmerman told him at the time that the shooting was in self-defense. When asked if that \" seemed completely true, \" manalo replied, \" yes. \" the sentinel notes that some big names have yet to take the stand. Among them: trayvon's parents, the medical examiner, and lead sanford police investigator christopher serino.",

Hundreds of troops and dozens of military vehicles had reached al-arish, the main administrative center in north sinai, security sources said on thursday. Armored vehicles, some equipped with machineguns, could then be seen driving out of al-arish towards the border settlement of sheikh zuwaid - which had been targeted by aircraft on wednesday. The troops saluted passersby and flashed victory signs, or filmed their departure with video cameras. But residents interviewed later in shaikh zuwaid and surrounding villages said they had seen no sign of fighting. In al toumah, a village surrounded by olive fields"

        "summary": "For four years now, georgia high school custodian carolyn collins has been quietly making sure the students at her school have what they need. It started when, as she was getting ready to take out the trash, two students knocked on the cafeteria door and asked to wait inside. They were homeless, living in their mother's car, and had been dropped off at tucker high, about 25 miles outside atlanta, hours early to get ready for the day in one of the school's bathrooms. Moved by their plight, collins, 54, made sure they got some breakfast — and then came up with her plan, the washington post reports. She bought $ 200 worth of food, toiletries, socks, underwear, and school supplies and asked school administrators to give her space to set up a \" giving closet. \" she was soon running it out of a 15-foot by 6-foot storage room, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. Now, collins still spends a few hundred dollars a month on items to stock the closet, but teachers, students, and community members also donate supplies, including clothes, shoes, book bags, and more. She also got thousands to spend on the students during a segment on steve harvey's show last month. Many students at the school live in poverty, and collins estimates she's opened up the closet for about 150 students over the years, letting them take what they need. \" if a student needs something and it's not in the closet, ms. Collins will go out of her way to get it or find somebody else who can, \" says the school principal; she's even been known to help with prom wear. Collins, whose son was killed during a robbery six years ago, says she wants to make sure no student feels the need to turn to crime. She hopes to someday open more giving closets.",

            "In a small storage room off the tucker high school cafeteria, custodian carolyn collins is changing lives. \"the giving closet, \" as it has been named, is stuffed with shampoos and school supplies, snacks and shoes. Noticing significant homelessness among students, collins — who has worked for the school eight years — said she started collecting items as a way to give students needed supplies, clothes and toiletries they could not otherwise afford. \"i help them with … little things we take for granted, \" she said at the school wednesday. She got the idea for the closet on sept. 24, 2014, when someone began banging on a cafeteria door at the school around 6 a.m. She asked the students, a boy and a girl, what they were doing at school so early.

Noticing significant homelessness among students, collins — who has worked for the school eight years — said she started collecting items as a way to give students needed supplies, clothes and toiletries they could not otherwise afford. \"i help them with … little things we take for granted, \" she said at the school wednesday.

The girl told collins they were homeless and living in a car, with a parent and two other siblings. She collected snacks to last them until lunchtime and began developing the plan to make items available for students.

        "summary": "Japan's supreme court issued a ruling wednesday that maintains a longtime civil rule some say is unconstitutional and discriminatory: forcing married couples to officially choose one surname, the bbc reports. Presiding justice itsuro terada said that the surname mandate wasn't discriminatory, since a couple could choose to use either the husband's or the wife's surname, though the japan times notes that studies over the past four decades show that 96 % of couples use the man's name. Terada also noted that women often used their maiden names informally anyway, which would mitigate any distress they felt over losing their maiden name on paper. The one-name system is \" deeply rooted in our society, \" terada said, and \" enables people to identify themselves as part of a family in the eyes of others. \" women's rights activists disagree, saying not only is the surname rule inconvenient for women professionals, it's also an emotional transition that can bring on depression and loss of identity, the times notes. Some couples are even opting to simply stay in common-law relationships rather than marry so the woman can keep her surname, the new york times notes. It hasn't always been this way. Japanese women traditionally kept their maiden names, but a strict 1898 feudal law forced women and kids to answer to male heads of household, per the bbc. That system was nixed in 1948, but the surname restriction stuck. On a somewhat more progressive note: a second rule barring japanese women from remarrying until six months after a divorce to avoid paternity confusion was deemed unconstitutional, per the times. That waiting period has now been cut to 100 days. ( an alternate view: don't judge a woman who chooses to take her husband's name. )",

        "summary": "Popeye knew a thing or two about building muscle, maybe even more than we realized. Per national geographic, scientists have appropriated the cartoon character's favorite snack — a spinach leaf — to help create new human heart muscle. In doing so, they circumvented a tissue issue that's plagued this type of regenerative medicine and carved a path toward facilitating organ repair down the road. The study published in the biomaterials journal details that challenge: even though researchers have been able to formulate human heart tissue in a lab, working up the vessels to deliver nutrients to that tissue has been problematic. \" the main limiting factor … is the lack of a vascular network, \" study co-author joshua gershlak says in a video on the study. Which is where popeye's plant food comes in. Scientists at worcester polytechnic institute took a spinach leaf — with its own system of tiny veins to keep it fed and hydrated — removed its plant cells, and then immersed the leaf in a bath of human cells, using the leaf as a \" scaffolding \" of sorts. They pumped fluids and microparticles through the leaf's veins to demonstrate how oxygen could one day similarly flow through such a vascular system to keep human heart tissue healthy. The researchers were even able to see clusters of the cells \" beating \" within the leaf. \" it was definitely a double take, \" gershlak says, per the washington post. He and co-author glenn gaudette, both bioengineers, came up with the idea while eating lunch one day ( which included spinach ) and talking about the dearth of donated organs.

Plant scaffolds were recellularized with human endothelial cells that colonized the inner surfaces of plant vasculature.

But there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so, even if the act is offensive. But that is exactly what happened friday. A court in moscow sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band pussy riot to two years in prison. In my two decades monitoring human rights in russia i've never seen anything like the pussy riot case -- the media attention, the outpouring of public support, the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members.

Highlights, as per politico: sen. Dick durbin: \" the bottom line is this: there is so much we can do to help the iraqis help themselves. Because only iraq can save iraq. When it comes to kurds, they have been the grownups in this neighborhood. \" and further: \" i can tell you this: escalating it is not in the cards. \" rep. Peter king: the islamic state is \" more powerful now than al-qaeda was on 9/11. \" it's \" a direct threat to the united states of america, and what dick durbin just said and what president obama has said, is really a shameful abdication of american leadership. \" sen. Lindsey graham: \" if he does not go on the offensive against isis, isil, whatever you guys want to call it, they are coming here. This is just not about baghdad. This is just not about syria. And if we do get attacked, then ( obama ) will have committed a blunder for the ages. \" sen. Ben cardin: \" i don't think we can take out isis from a military point of view from the use of our airstrikes. That's not going to solve the problem. The fundamental problem is whether the iraqis believe they have a representative government so that sunnis feel comfortable with the government in baghdad. There is not a us military solution to this issue. We're not going to use our military to take care of what the iraqis should be taking care of. \" former national security adviser james jones: \" the kurds are our best friends in the region, and we can't let kurdistan fall, \" he said, adding that it's \" ludicrous \" that the kurdistan regional government is classified as a terrorist group.",

As dana mackenzie writes for nautilus, it was a question that guardian math blogger alex bellos fielded so frequently that he decided to turn the tables on his readers with favouritenumber.net, a website that asked people to select their favorite, and explain why. The victor, per the 30,025 responses bellos analyzed: 7. Though 1,123 numbers received nods, almost half of respondents professed to loving a number between one and 10. Indeed, from that range only \" one \" and \" 10 \" failed to qualify for the top 10, replaced by 11 and 13. Speaking to pri, bellos says our seven obsession is an ancient one, dating back to babylon. \" you go back to the earliest writers we have, and there are more sevens there than any other number. \" but bellos wasn't just interested in the what — he wanted to suss out the why. The most popular reason given for selecting a number was that it was the participant's birthday. But someone born on the 10th was \" a lot less likely to choose \" that 10 as his favorite than someone born on the 13th, he found. That's because we want an \" exceptional \" number, bellos posits. Even numbers feel vague, which could be why he says 110 is the best candidate for least favorite number. He tells nautilus, \" we use round numbers to mean approximate things. When we say 100, we don't usually mean exactly 100, we mean around 100. So 100 seems incredibly vague. Why would you have something as your favorite that is so vague? \"",

Several democrats have denounced the comments as racist. Ryan says he was simply being \" inarticulate. \" here's what people are saying: ryan was simply \" speaking of a true thing that must never be said, \" write the editors of the national review. And who's more racist, ryan \" for criticizing those conditions, \" or \" the people who run new york city's public schools or those who govern detroit — the people who help create those conditions? \" \" paul ryan was just telling the truth, \" agrees john hinderaker at power line, pointing out that labor force participation among african americans is at a record low. \" it is impossible to overstate not just how dishonest, but how vicious \" these attacks are, he writes. Ryan just expressed concern about \" very real human problems \" and urged action to fix them. \" there's a history here that the republican party can't ignore, \" argues ian haney lopez on bill moyers'site. The gop has used coded racial language for years — two different rnc chairs have even apologized for it. Ryan either \" uncritically adopted the charged rhetoric of his party without understanding its racial undertones, \" or deployed that rhetoric tactically to stoke racial tensions. Krugman agrees, and takes it further, using ryan's comments as an example of racism he sees baked into gop rhetoric. \" race is the rosetta stone that makes sense of many otherwise incomprehensible aspects of us politics, \" he writes. Why does the gop block spending on medicaid while opposing cuts to medicare? \" well, what do many medicaid recipients look like … and how does that compare with the typical medicare beneficiary? mystery solved. \" many have denounced ryan for citing charles murray, author of the controversial book, the bell curve, which argued that black people have lower average iqs than white people, and that the difference was partially genetic. But andrew sullivan calls that, and the attacks on ryan, a \" smear. \" murray, he argues, is an unfairly maligned \" intellectual adventurer, \" willing to \" speak things we only talk about in our own heads. \" ryan, for his part, seems eager to smooth the incident over; he",

The move comes after the woman gave birth unexpectedly at her home in july 2016. The newborn, the woman's fourth child, was found in a plastic bag with head wounds apparently inflicted with scissors and died from the effects of asphyxiation days later at a hospital, reports the cbc. The mother, whose name has not been released, was diagnosed with non-psychotic pregnancy denial and dissociative amnesia. It was the second time she had failed to recognize she was pregnant, though in the other case she was alerted to the pregnancy during an unrelated hospital visit at 32 weeks and there was no harm done to the resulting child, reports the montreal gazette. If she gets pregnant again, her sentence means \" there will be no more denial of pregnancy as there was the last time, \" her lawyer, joseph la leggia, tells the cbc. He tells the gazette his client is voluntarily taking pregnancy tests each month. The sentence will also see the woman serve 20 months of house arrest and three years of probation for infanticide. Quebec's youth protection service previously found the woman was an excellent mother who posed no risk to her other children. ( a mother of three had amnesia for a decade. )",

The british cybersecurity researcher — who's keeping anonymous to protect himself — found a nonsensical website address in the code for the ransomware holding victims'data hostage and causing chaos around the globe. He spent less than $ 11 to register the domain with the hope of monitoring the spread of the ransomware. But it turns out, registering the domain was a \" kill switch \" added by the creators of the ransomware in case they ever wanted to stop it themselves. For a more in-depth explanation, check out the 22-year-old's blog titled \" how to accidentally stop a global cyber attack. \" but while the spread of the ransomware has been halted for now, the world's computer systems are far from in the clear. Cybersecurity expert matt suiche says whoever is behind the attack — their identity is still unknown — can simply update the ransomware and start again. \" i'd even say this update probably already happened, \" he tells abc news. There were 75,000 individual attacks across 99 countries friday.

Gravity probe b showed this to be correct. In 1905, albert einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all observers. This was the theory of special relativity. It introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time. Einstein then spent 10 years trying to include acceleration in the theory and published his theory of general relativity in 1915. In it, he determined that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is felt as gravity.

        "summary": "Have a fussy baby? researchers believe they have the solution: a simple lullaby specifically designed to make babies happy. Though it's a simple tune, the process behind \" the happy song \" was actually quite complicated, per time. The song is the result of plenty of research into infant musical tastes, which revealed infants would likely respond best to an upbeat song in a major key that was simple and repetitive, but also used various musical devices for an element of surprise, child development expert caspar addyman writes at the conversation. Once a list of requirements was agreed upon, addyman and musical psychologist lauren stewart enlisted grammy winner imogen heap, who has an 18-month-old daughter, to create four test melodies. Two were slow and two were fast. When played for parents and their babies, the majority favored one upbeat tune in particular. Heap then included favorite sounds voted on by parents, including \" boo, \" animal noises, and laughter, along with her own high-energy voice and plosive sounds with pop, like \" pa \" and \" ba, \" which babies seem to prefer, according to a youtube video. When 20 infants heard the final version of \" the happy song, \" they were \" entranced, \" addyman writes. This \" wasn't the most scientific as tests go, \" but \" i can definitely, confidently say from a scientific point of view something's happened here. \" researchers next plan to look at physiological responses to the song, which came in at 163 beats per minute. Listen to \" the happy song \" here. ( this is the world's oldest known melody. )",

One industry group, swine management services, says the death rate increased from 5.8 % to 10.2 % from 2013 to 2016, per national hog farmer. \" this makes you wonder what has changed, \" says ron ketchem of sms. Many of the sows appear to be dying from prolapse, the collapse of the pig's vagina, rectum, or uterus, explains the guardian. So what's going on? the industry is trying to figure that out, with one theory being that booming demand for pork in the us has led industrial-scale farms to adopt unhealthy breeding practices for the sows, including confined quarters, in order to keep them churning out the average 23.5 piglets a year. \"they're breeding the sows to produce a lot of babies, \" renowned animal behaviorist temple grandin tells the guardian. \" well, there's a point where you've gone too far. \" a soon-to-be-departing official with compassion in world farming adds that the pigs also are being bred to have less fat, which is in sync with consumer demand but not with biology in terms of producing a lot of piglets. \" their bones are weak and they don't have enough fat to support the reproductive process, \" she says. \" we've bred them to their limit and the animals are telling us that. \" at treehugger, katherine martinko's suggestion for concerned consumers is to skip supermarket pork and find a small, local farmer.

            "New york ( ap ) — a 6-week-old baby died thursday when her stroller accidentally plunged down an empty elevator shaft in a brooklyn building. The infant's mother was waiting with the stroller on the 23rd floor of an apartment building in coney island around 11: 40 a.m., officials said. When the doors opened, the woman stepped forward and both she and the stroller fell down the shaft and landed on the elevator car, which was out of service eight stories below, police said. A mechanic who had been working on the elevator heard the mother's screams and helped pull her to safety, police said. The circumstances of exactly where the elevator was when the woman and stroller landed on it were unclear. The baby girl, identified as areej ali, of brooklyn, was pronounced dead at coney island hospital. The mother was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries",

His best effort could not save the adorable cherub with the big eyes and the painfully short life. A shocking accident sent the infant and her mother plunging eight stories down an elevator shaft thursday morning atop a car under repairs — but without any posted warning signs, residents said. The 21-year-old mom, identified by sources as aber al-rahabi, survived and areej was mortally injured just 90 minutes after work started on the failing elevator in a coney island building with a long history of code violations and elevator complaints.

Conservatives are relishing the \" not easy \" part, considering the couple bought a $ 2.85 million residence in washington and a $ 1.7 million house in new york state, and put chelsea through top-notch universities ( see a sample tweet here ). But not all of their income came from speaking gigs, the washington post reports: hillary's memoir living history sold well, and bill received almost $ 16 million in benefits and pensions from the federal government. Plus the gigs kept them from working as lobbyists, \" as so many people who leave public life do, \" said hillary. While she has given talks to high-flyers like goldman sachs and silicon valley tech leaders, she waived all costs to address the united methodist women conference in kentucky. \" i happen to have given lots of free speeches, \" she added.",

The 6.1 quake caused widespread panic on the indonesian resort island, and witnesses say the roofs of some homes collapsed, ap reports. The quake, centered 60 miles southwest of the island, was not strong enough to trigger a tsunami, but it was felt on islands hundreds of miles away. It hit the day after the island marked the anniversary of the terrorist bombings that killed 202 people nine years ago. In the island's main tourist areas, visitors say they were told to run for their lives as cracks began to appear in buildings. A tourist from california says the quake was unlike any she had felt in her home state. \" it started at my feet and went all though my heart and head — it made me nauseous, \" she told australia's abc. \" my first reaction was to get out of the house. I was very confused when the roof started shaking. \"",

Rather than pull over, troopers say carlos sped up and tried to elude them. That's when robinson finally woke up, wondering why they were driving so fast. Carlos explained to him they were being chased by police and refused to stop the car when robinson told him to. Carlos allegedly eventually crashed robinson's 2016 hyundai sonata into a guardrail, with both men sustaining minor injuries. Carlos has been charged with unlawfully fleeing a police officer, driving without a license, and several traffic violations. Robinson was released without charges.

But just why is it so healthy? researchers are explaining that the healthy bacteria in our digestive systems love dark chocolate. When they munch on it, the process releases compounds that reduce cardiovascular inflammation. That cuts our heart disease and stroke risk, io9 reports. The experts reached their conclusions by studying how cocoa powder interacts with digestive enzymes and bacteria contained in our feces, the los angeles times reports. They learned that certain molecules from the chocolate can't be absorbed by our bodies on their own. Fortunately, once those molecules get to our colons, the bacteria take action. \" these little guys say, ' hey — there's something in there that i can use, ' and they start to break it down, \" says louisiana state researcher john finley. About two tablespoons a day of cocoa powder appears to offer a health boost, he says. Unfortunately, the sugar and fat in chocolate candy aren't so good for us — so finley opts to put cocoa powder on his oatmeal.

It was the result of a 2016 vote that saw more than 100 countries in favor of a un general assembly resolution to kick off such talks, which are aimed at ultimately establishing an international treaty that would prohibit the development and possession of such weapons, cnn reports. By extension, using them would also be banned. The ap reports austria, brazil, and ireland were at the forefront of the effort. Wondering where the us is? boycotting. Us ambassador nikki haley was present monday — but remained outside the general assembly hall with other boycotting nations in a sign of opposition. One big quote: \" as a mom, as a daughter, there is nothing i want more for my family than a world with no nuclear weapons. But we have to be realistic. \" her view is that the nearly 50-year-old nuclear non-proliferation treaty is doing its job, with the us slashing its nuclear arsenal by 85 % under it, and that north korea is too big a loose cannon for this to be a responsible or feasible endeavor. \" north korea would be the one cheering, and all of us and the people we represent would be the ones at risk, \" she said. By the guardian's count, 113 countries are participating, but 40 are boycotting, and that list includes the us, china, france, britain, russia, india, pakistan, israel, and north korea, which the paper points out are the nine states known to have nuclear weapons.",

            "Rome ( reuters ) - a fire bomb exploded outside the offices of italian tax collection agency equitalia in the northern city of verona on friday, police said. Another device planted in the entrance failed to explode, and was made safe by firemen after the first blast smashed glass doors at the tax office in the early hours of friday morning, a police spokesman said. Nobody was hurt. Equitalia offices have been the target of a series of threats and attacks this year. The agency is widely associated with tax hikes imposed by the technocrat government of mario monti, who has cut spending and led a crackdown on fiscal evasion in a bid to cut public debt that has made italy a focus of the euro zone crisis. Tough methods adopted by equitalia have made it a focus of ill-feeling, particularly in italy's economically prosperous north where tax increases are apt to be seen as props for poorer and corruption-riddled southern regions. The image of such agencies was further tarnished this week, when the head of a different tax collection agency and four employees were arrested on charges of stealing 100 million euros ( $ 130 million ) from revenue they gathered. ( $ 1 = 0.7689 euro )",
            "Rome students clashed with italian police in widespread protests on friday against austerity measures imposed by prime minister mario monti's government. Thousands of university and high school students marched in major cities, including rome, milan and naples, chanting slogans and carrying banners such as \" save schools not banks \". The protests were the latest in a string of strikes and large-scale street protests against monti's spending cuts and economic reforms. \" the protest is to renew the political class, to get rid of those who are corrupt, \" said giulio bianco, 18. \" the politicians make the ordinary people pay. These are heavy sacrifices, and it is a risky policy to keep imposing them, \" the high school student from rome said. Up to six policemen were wounded in rome, police said, after students wearing motorcycle helmets and carrying home-made shields pelted them with stones and tried to rush a police van before being driven back in a baton charge. Tv pictures from bologna showed students throwing eggs at a branch of unicredit bank and trampling on a bnp paribas flag, while in palermo protesters burnt copies of political manifestos. Young people have borne the brunt of rising joblessness in italy, where the youth unemployment rate is 35 percent, more than three times the overall level. \" we are worried about our prospects and about the future of our country, \" madalina ursu, 19, told reuters.
