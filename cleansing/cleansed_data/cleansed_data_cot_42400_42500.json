        "summary": "An amtrak train headed to new york city derailed and tipped over in philadelphia last night, killing at least six people and injuring scores more, at least five of them critically. The cause remains unclear. \" it is an absolute disastrous mess, \" said mayor michael nutter. The train had seven cars, including the engine, and six of them overturned, reports the new york times. More than 140 people went to hospitals to be evaluated or treated, and it remained unclear this morning whether any passengers were still trapped. Train 188, a northeast regional whose route originated in washington, dc, was carrying 238 passengers and five crew. It had left philadelphia's 30th street station minutes before the accident, which occurred about 9: 30pm near a curve in the tracks, reports the philadelphia inquirer. No word yet on how fast it was going. Disaster also struck here 72 years ago: the derailment took place near the same spot as one in 1943 that killed 79 people, one of the deadliest accidents in us rail history, notes the inquirer. Passengers: \" i was looking at my computer when i felt the car start to shake and the lights flipped, flashed, \" recalls one, who was injured by dislodged chairs in the crash. Another adds, \" they told us we had to run away from the train in case another train came. \" why amtrak trains derail: generally speaking, it's about \" crumbling infrastructure, \" reports the washington post. Northeast corridor: it's a mess today. No amtrak trains will run between new york and philadelphia, reports the ap. Images: nbc philadelphia has a collection of photos here.",

        "summary": "The rumor mill continues to churn out news of jay leno and conan o ' brien's futures at nbc, with the network releasing just two vague statements. The latest: nbc has given o ' brien an ultimatum, sources tell tmz: move to the midnight slot or get out. Though nbc could technically block him from moving to another network for two years, sources say they will let him go if he gets another offer, and give leno a full hour. The los angeles times reports leno is on board with the plan and o ' brien is not; tmz says o ' brien is angry but considering the offer; and the new york times reports that while everyone is still in talks, an agreement is basically in place. The change-up is expected after nbc's winter olympics coverage ends in march. Sources tell the wrap nbc execs are concerned local stations will start bailing on the jay leno show this spring if the line-up remains as-is. While nbc scrambles to find new 10pm programming, dateline, usa dramas, unaired reality shows, and current hourlong dramas will probably be used as short-term replacements. One problem for nbc: o ' brien's contract includes a $ 40 to $ 45 million penalty fee if the network forces him out of the tonight show. One senior nbc exec says o ' brien's show will keep that title — leno is said to be more interested in the time slot — and leno will keep the jay leno show title. Meanwhile, even if leno ends up with a half-hour show, sources say his salary will not be cut in half. Nbc's first statement yesterday expressed support for leno and seemed to deny rumors that his show had been canceled; its second stated, \"we remain committed to keeping conan o ' brien on nbc. \"",

Saudi arabia must explain the suspicious arrival in the country of 15 security officials just before khashoggi's disappearance, and turkey must produce clear evidence to back up its claims. \" the united states, too, should demand answers, loud and clear, \" says the editorial, noting that president trump has been on good terms with the de facto saudi leader, crown prince mohammed bin salman. \" the united states must now make a concerted effort to determine all the facts about mr.

Mr. Khashoggi went to the consulate sept. 28 in a first attempt to take care of some routine paperwork and was told to come back the following week.

If true, this is a horrific crime, the assassination of a journalist in his own country's consulate on foreign soil — something without precedent in modern times. So far, we have no proof. Turkish president recep tayyip erdogan on sunday said the events are \"very, very upsetting, \" but he stopped short of confirming reports of a murder. Saudi arabia continues to insist that mr. Khashoggi left the consulate after a brief visit tuesday, but it has provided no evidence to back that up. Amid the conflicting statements, an ominous timeline emerged in some of the accounts. Mr. Khashoggi went to the consulate sept. 28 in a first attempt to take care of some routine paperwork and was told to come back the following week. Then 15 saudi officials entered istanbul, \"specifically for the murder, \" according to sources quoted by the post's kareem",
            "Peter bergen is cnn's national security analyst, a vice president at new america and a professor of practice at arizona state university. He is the author of \" the osama bin laden i know: an oral history of al-qaeda's leader. \" see more opinion at cnn. ( cnn ) jamal khashoggi, a prominent saudi writer, vanished on tuesday after entering the saudi consulate in istanbul to obtain paperwork so he could marry his turkish fiancée. He has not been seen or heard from since. As a columnist for the washington post, khashoggi was a frequent critic of the saudi regime. Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the united states. On saturday, turkish officials told the washington post that khashoggi was murdered at the saudi consulate. Cnn has not been able to independently confirm these reports and a saudi official has denied them. Earlier in the week, saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman had told bloomberg news that khashoggi had left the consulate unmolested, but if that was the case, why hasn't he contacted anyone? media outlets around the world have reported on khashoggi's mysterious disappearance. If khashoggi had left the consulate unharmed, it's inconceivable he wouldn't have informed his fiancée, family, friends and colleagues at the washington post. I have known khashoggi for"

The feature — which microsoft incorporated to make for a harder hack into devices in government, corporate, and other sensitive industries — has a 1 in 100,000 \" false accept rate, \" meaning that it's safer than any password, cnn money reports. Although the feature isn't being marketed to average consumers, microsoft says anyone can use it, especially if you already have a fingerprint reader on your device.

Celebs pop in to \" explain an esoteric bit of financial jargon, \" kuntzman writes. \" it's not only funny, but … it may be the greatest legacy of the big short. \" both bale and carell deliver \" oscar-worthy performances, \" he adds. \" at the end, your brain hurts and you feel sick to your stomach … but that queasy, empty feeling is the point, \" writes ao scott at the new york times. \" there is no happy ending to this story, \" yet \" the teams conspiring to short the market are impossible not to root for, and the work of the movie's sprawling ensemble is never less than delightful. \" the big short is \" a true crime story and a madcap comedy, a heist movie and a scalding polemic, \" scott writes. It's \" terrifically enjoyable. \" rafer guzman disagrees. \" with energetic pacing and zippy dialogue, the big short is often entertaining — a screwball comedy with an angry streak, \" he writes at newsday. \" if only the film could sustain that tone. \" he argues it's all a bit \" muddled \" and it's not clear who the heroes of the story actually are. \" in the end these financiers made money on our losses. That's a difficult pill, and the big short doesn't have quite enough finesse to make us swallow it. \" laughs are somewhat expected from the director who brought you anchorman. But the big short manages to be funny \" without diluting the complications — or the gravity — of its subject matter \" and while reminding viewers that \" millions of americans suffered because of the actions of a few, \" writes kenneth turan at the los angeles times. That's no small feat. In fact, \" the film packs in so much information and comedy, it would be fun to see it twice. \"",

        "summary": "With super tuesday just a day away, these are the hurdles bernie sanders needs to clear to remain a viable candidate against hillary clinton: he's got to connect with minority voters. And quickly. The new york times has clinton — who killed sanders by an 87-to-13 margin among black voters in south carolina — poised for \" a sweep of the south, \" as black voters make up the majority in key super tuesday states. And though sanders'strategy seems to be to win states with a heavier white population, a dem strategist tells usa today sanders can't give up the minority vote. \" if you can't win non-whites in this party, you cannot win the nomination, \" he says. Among sanders ' biggest issues: many black voters just don't know him, and the social media outreach his campaign has heavily leaned on isn't reaching older voters. Significant wins in at least five non-southern states. Per politico, sanders needs these wins to \" prove that super tuesday isn't his final stand. \" colorado, minnesota, massachusetts, and oklahoma, and his home state ( all where he's invested in tv ads ) are what he's banking on, plus a nail-biter in virginia. He would still need clinton to not win by a landslide in states with larger african-american populations to keep the delegate count within reach, though the times notes he'd likely have to \" win nonblack voters by one-third as much as mrs. Clinton wins black voters \" to stay in the game. If he pulls this off, that would give him the momentum to head into what fivethirtyeight calls more the \" favorable terrain \" of western states in late march — followed by the \" big blue finale \" of new york, pennsylvania, and california. It all comes down to the delegates. An analyst for the \" cook political report \" lends more dire-sounding specifics with the numbers, telling usa today that super tuesday is \" critical \" for sanders. \" if clinton were to match patterns of support she's received in primaries to date, she would win between 75 and 100 more delegates than sanders on march 1, \" he explains. \" that would mean that sanders would need to win approximately 58 % of the remaining pledged and undeclared superdelegates to tie hillary clinton by the end of the primaries. That's virtually impossible. \" sanders ' campaign is hoping to gain the lead in pledged delegates, as \" the pressure on the superdelegates not to go against the will of the voters is going to be enormous, \" his senior media adviser says.",

            "Surgionsville, tenn. ( ap ) — an east tennessee couple faces a murder charge, accused of forcing the man's 5-year-old daughter to drink more than 2 liters of grape soda and water, causing her brain to swell and rupture, authorities said. According to the hawkins county sheriff's office and the autopsy report, alexa linboom was brought in to the emergency room on jan. 1, 2012, by her father, randall vaughn, and his wife, mary vaughn. The girl was blue and unresponsive with \" an abnormal body posture that indicates severe brain damage, \" according to the autopsy, which was completed in july 2013. The vaughns were arrested on wednesday and were being held at the hawkins county jail on a $ 500,000 bond each. Officials did not know whether the vaughns had hired an attorney. Their arraignment was scheduled for friday morning. An investigation revealed the girl had been forced to drink approximately 2.4 liters of water and soda over one to two hours as punishment. The massive intake of fluid caused her brain to swell and herniate. According to the autopsy, when she was forced to drink all that liquid, she began vomiting, urinated on herself and asked to take a bath. \" outside of the bathtub, she tried to eat oatmeal with assistance then started clenching her hands. \" she arrived at the hospital about 2 to 3 hours later. \" caretakers told hospital staff that during the ride to the hospital, she sat up in the vehicle and played patty cake, \" according to the autopsy. She was transported by air to a regional hospital where she was pronounced brain dead two days later. The autopsy states that the girl had moved to tennessee to live with her father about three months before her death. The move was prompted by allegations of neglect at her previous home. A pediatric check-up about three months before her death had shown no significant problems. She was taken to an outpatient clinic about a month before her death for excessive thirst, urination and eating, but nothing was found to be wrong with her. According to the autopsy, \" other adults who had regular contact with the child before and after her move to tennessee describe her as a normal, healthy child and did not notice any unusual eating, drinking habits and that she did not wet her pants at school. \" an obituary for the child said, \" some of the things that brought enjoyment to her life was coloring,"

( ap ) — an east tennessee couple faces a murder charge, accused of forcing the man's 5-year-old daughter to drink more than 2 liters of grape soda and water, causing her brain to swell and rupture, authorities said. According to the hawkins county sheriff's office and the autopsy report, alexa linboom was brought in to the emergency room on jan. 1, 2012, by her father, randall vaughn, and his wife, mary vaughn. The girl was blue and unresponsive with \" an abnormal body posture that indicates severe brain damage, \" according to the autopsy, which was completed in july 2013. The vaughns were arrested on wednesday and were being held at the hawkins county jail on a $ 500,000 bond each. Officials did not know whether the vaughns had hired an attorney. Their arraignment was scheduled for friday morning. An investigation revealed the girl had been forced to drink approximately 2.4 liters of water and soda over one to two hours as punishment. The massive intake of fluid caused her brain to swell and herniate. According to the autopsy, when she was forced to drink all that liquid, she began vomiting, urinated on herself and asked to take a bath. \" outside of the bathtub, she tried to eat oatmeal with assistance then started clenching her hands. \" she arrived at the hospital about 2 to 3 hours later. \" caretakers told hospital staff that during the ride to the hospital, she sat up in the vehicle and played patty cake, \" according to the autopsy. She was transported by air to a regional hospital where she was pronounced brain dead two days later. The autopsy states that the girl had moved to tennessee to live with her father about three months before her death. The move was prompted by allegations of neglect at her previous home. A pediatric check-up about three months before her death had shown no significant problems. She was taken to an outpatient clinic about a month before her death for excessive thirst, urination and eating, but nothing was found to be wrong with her. According to the autopsy, \" other adults who had regular contact with the child before and after her move to tennessee describe her as a normal, healthy child and did not notice any unusual eating, drinking habits and that she did not wet her pants at school. \" an obituary for the child said, \" some of the things that brought enjoyment to her life was coloring,"

        "summary": "They may not have sorted out how santa's reindeer can fly, but scientists say there is an optical explanation for just how beneficial it is that rudolph's nose burns red and bright. Reporting in the journal frontiers for young minds, a dartmouth anthropology professor says that arctic reindeer are ( at least among mammals ) uniquely qualified to see ultraviolet light — a useful trait in the darker winter months when the sun is low on the horizon and casts more uv light than usual. The reflective tissue in their eyes turns a deep blue to help them see in the dark. The problem is fog extinguishes this hue, reports phys.org. Rudolph's glowing red nose, then, solves this conundrum when it's time to steer santa's sleigh through the fog. Unfortunately, that red nose comes with an unfortunate side effect. Because reindeer's noses are so vascular, a glowing one would likely cause excessive heat loss with potential for hypothermia. \" it is therefore imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to help rudolph replenish his energetic reserves on christmas eve, \" the anthropologist advises. While he adds that the frequency of fog is on the decline thanks to climate change, kids can still help the reindeer's odds by providing chocolate chip cookies in case santa's team encounters any on the big night, reports red orbit. Another hypothesis floating around is that rudolph's nose is infected — and thus inflamed — with parasites. \" such contrasting hypotheses invite testing, \" reports the plos ecology blog, \" and it is hoped that future research on the optical properties of arctic light and fog will shed, dare i say, new light, on the extraordinary biology and sensory ecology of reindeer. \" ( check out how fast rudolph has to fly. )",

            "Lately, pundits and punters seem bullish on donald trump, whose chances of winning the republican presidential nomination recently inched above 20 percent for the first time at the betting market betfair. Perhaps the conventional wisdom assumes that the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in paris will play into trump's hands, or that republicans really might be in disarray. If so, i can see where the case for trump is coming from, although i'd still say a 20 percent chance is substantially too high. Quite often, however, the trump's-really-got-a-chance! case is rooted almost entirely in polls.

            "Lately, pundits and punters seem bullish on donald trump, whose chances of winning the republican presidential nomination recently inched above 20 percent for the first time at the betting market betfair. Perhaps the conventional wisdom assumes that the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in paris will play into trump's hands, or that republicans really might be in disarray. If so, i can see where the case for trump is coming from, although i'd still say a 20 percent chance is substantially too high. Quite often, however, the trump's-really-got-a-chance! case is rooted almost entirely in polls.

Why does it happen? experts aren't sure. \" our best guess is that it occurs when the body doesn't shut down for sleep in the correct sequence, \" sharpless says. \" instead of shutting down, certain groups of neurons actually get activated and have us perceive the bursts of noise. \" it appears to be most common in women older than 50, emaxhealth reports, but it's by no means limited to that group; in fact, it may occur in 10 % of people, the mail notes. According to emax, the \" best treatment \" is simply learning that the disorder won't hurt you. ( another thing that actually exists, according to science: \" short man syndrome. \" )",

A band's pyrotechnic display ignited the ceiling with a flare that sent patrons running for the single exit — but bouncers suspected them of skipping on their bar tabs and initially blocked the way, reuters reports. Only when flames swept across the ceiling were partygoers allowed to run for it. Soon shirtless patrons outside were helping firefighters smash windows and walls in a desperate attempt to save people trapped in the club, reports the guardian. \" smoke filled the place instantly, the heat became unbearable, \" said one survivor. \" people could not find the only exit. They went to the toilet thinking it was the exit and many died there. \" officials would spot several safety violations, such as the flare and a locked exit, and said the club may have exceeded capacity by 1,000 people, cnn reports. As rescue workers laid out bodies in a nearby gym, workers and officials wept with family and friends of the victims. \" it's the saddest, saddest day of my life, \" said the mother of a 22-year-old victim. \" i never thought i would have to live to see my girl go away. \"",

        "summary": "Ibtesam alkarnake's water broke while traveling from a refugee camp in jordan to her new home in canada. But the syrian refugee told no one, not even her husband and four children, reports the edmonton journal. It was \" brute determination on the mom's part to have the baby in canada, \" pastor doug doyle, who welcomed the family in fort mcmurray, alberta, on tuesday, tells the cbc. Perhaps alkarnake feared her labor might prevent the trip, as so many other things had threatened to do. For one thing, some members of doyle's fort city church were hesitant to sponsor a syrian family when the idea was first proposed in 2015, says doyle. Then a wildfire spread through fort mcmurray last year, destroying 2,400 buildings and forcing 90,000 people to evacuate. But the townhouse set aside for the alkarnake family was spared by the fire, which allowed church members to realize that the refugees were \" fleeing the flames of their city, \" doyle says. So after the church raised $ 70,000, the alkarnakes left a camp of 100,000 refugees in jordan, spending about 24 hours in the air on three separate flights to get to their new home. Ibtesam kept quiet all the way. Ten hours after setting foot in canada, she gave birth to a 6-pound baby boy. The canadian government says about 40,000 syrian refugees have been settled in canada since november 2015, including 14,000 who were privately sponsored. About 12,500 syrian refugees were accepted in the us in the fiscal year ending in september, per pew research.",

        "summary": "Whole libraries have been written trying to explain how leonardo da vinci produced some of the world's most revered paintings. Now a new study suggests he had a biological edge: an eye disorder that affected his depth perception. In jama ophthalmology, researchers make the case that da vinci had a rare condition known as strabismus, which allowed him to better present a 3d world on a 2d canvas, reports ars technica. The condition is known as being \" walleyed, \" per the washington post. As live science explains, it generally means that one of da vinci's eyes wandered instead of focusing on the same thing as the other eye, which led him to favor the non-wandering eye. He would thus be \" seeing the world monocularly, with much reduced depth cues, \" says study author christopher tyler of city university of london. That may not sound ideal for painters, but \" the image they're seeing is much closer to what they want to paint on the canvas, \" tyler explains to the post. Da vinci could apparently control the wandering eye as needed, and thus \" he'd be very aware of the 3d and 2d depth cues and the difference between them. \" other artists such as rembrandt, degas, and picasso also were believed to have strabismus to some extent. Tyler's team figured this out by looking at six artworks, either by da vinci or others, that are believed to be likenesses of da vinci himself. ( among them was da vinci's salvator mundi, the most expensive painting ever sold at auction. ) tyler took eye measurements of those images, and the results pointed to strabismus. ( elsewhere on the da vinci front, it's possible that a physical condition also explains the most famous smile in art history. )",

        "summary": "The dna from a single infant is shining a light on the true origins of the first americans. The headline-generating research relies on the dna of a child buried roughly 12,600 years ago, and establishes that the first north americans were born to humans who came to the new world from asia. The origins of the clovis people, who fashioned distinctive stone tools, had been contested, with some believing they were descendants of southwestern europeans. \" this shows very clearly that the ancestry of the very first americans can be traced back to asia, \" says michael waters, a co-author of the study, which also indicates that the clovis people are direct ancestors of today's native americans. The clovis skeleton was uncovered in 1968 in the anzick burial site in western montana and belongs to a boy between 12 and 18 months; it's \" the only known clovis burial, \" waters tells livescience. National geographic reports that the process of collecting the dna was no simple feat: bone shavings from the skull were used to reconstruct the genome, but no more than 2 % of the collected dna was human. \" the rest of it came from bacteria that invaded the skeleton after death, \" explains another researcher. The eventual genome was similar to those of ancient siberian people and east asians ' ancestors, which seems \" to fit quite nicely with an early occupation of the americas about 2,000 years before the onset of clovis, \" says waters. But there were also similarities between it and that of 52 native american populations from canada and south america. One challenge in establishing whether native americans from the us are direct descendants of the clovis: they've been hesitant to share their dna, and that of their ancestors, with scientists. Livescience notes that the child's remains will be reburied.",

The accompanying photo shows a young man with dyed red hair, matching the description of the arrested holmes. At the top of the profile is the question, \" will you visit me in prison? \" in his intro, holmes says he's \" looking for a fling or casual sex gal. Am a nice guy. Well, as nice enough of a guy who does these sort of shenanigans. \" meanwhile, it appears that holmes began his methodical planning months ago, about the time he withdrew from a neuroscience graduate program at the university of colorado school of medicine, reports the denver post.

Situated on a private wooded lot in a wealthy neighborhood near akron, the three-bedroom home is priced at $ 295,000. The home was first listed two years ago before being pulled off the market. Realtor rich lubinski said it failed to sell then because of the depressed housing market and its notorious past. \" if you can get past that little problem, you ' ll have a wonderful place to live, \" said chris butler, the home's current owner. ( peta, meanwhile, thinks it should become a vegan restaurant, notes the akron beacon journal. ) butler bought the house in 2005, well aware of its history. He said he was drawn to the house by its 1950s style and wooded lot. Dahmer and his parents moved into the house in 1968 when he was 8 years old. Ten years later, he committed his first murder there, killing a hitchhiker he had brought home and then burying the remains in the woods. Dahmer moved to wisconsin in 1982 and went on to kill 16 more people before his crimes were discovered in 1991. He was killed in prison in 1994 by a fellow inmate.

Shakuntala devi, aka the \" human computer, \" died at the age of 83 in bangalore, leaving behind a legacy of jaw-dropping computational genius. Her colorful story begins at age three, when her lion-tamer father discovered her prodigious talent for memorizing numbers. Major public performances began at the age of six, taking her from what she once described to the times of india as the semi-slums to locations around the world. Among her feats, as also recounted by the new york times and the telegraph: 1977: she extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds; a univac computer tasked with performing the same calculation did so in 62 seconds. 1980: she entered the guinness book of world records after multiplying two 13-digit numbers — and voicing the 26-digit solution — in a total of 28 seconds. She famously gave answers ( once on the bbc, another time at the university of rome ) that were different from the ones the interviewers had; she was correct on both occasions. An american researcher who studied her abilities asked her to find the the cube root of 61,629,875, and the seventh root of 170,859,375.

She once calculated the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in her head in less than a minute, and in june 1980, at imperial college, london, accurately multiplied two random 13-digit numbers in a few seconds. The sum, picked at random by the computer department, was 7,686,369,774,870 x 2,465,099,745,779. After 28 seconds she correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730, a feat that earned her a place in the guinness book of records. Her ability to solve complicated arithmetical problems with apparent ease and astonishing speed had stunned observers since the 1970s, when her unexplained brain power made even sophisticated digital devices of the day seem inadequate by comparison. Witty and sharp-minded, she possessed exceptional powers of retention and appeared to harness the power of several mnemonic devices in her brain. In 1988 she visited the united states, where the educational psychologist professor arthur jensen tried to unlock the secret of her abilities. At stanford university he monitored her performance in several mathematical tasks involving large numbers and subjected her to a series of tests.

These dolls \" normalize submissiveness and normalize sex between adults and minors, \" are \" intrinsically related to abuse of minors, \" and lead to \" the exploitation, objectification, abuse, and rape of minors, \" the bill states. Although some experts have said using such dolls might actually cut down on pedophilia, those who voted for the bill disagree. \" once an abuser tires of practicing on a doll, it's a small step to move on to a child, \" bill sponsor rep. Dan donovan says, while fellow house republican bob goodlatte notes the child sex dolls \" desensitize the user, causing him to engage in sicker and sicker behavior. \" a release from donovan's office reports the uk seized 128 of the dolls, and 85 % of the men who imported them were found to have child porn. Goodlatte notes the dolls not only can be made to look like a specific child, they can also be given certain facial expressions, like fear or sadness. More than 166,000 people have signed a petition in support of the ban; the uk and australia have passed similar laws. \" i am saddened that there are people in this world who would create realistic child sex dolls and distraught that there are people in this world who would buy them, \" goodlatte says.

The arizona cardinals have added jen welter to the team's ranks. Her position, per espn: \" assistant coaching intern for training camp and the preseason to work with inside linebackers. \" it's another feather in the cap of a pretty remarkable-sounding woman. Here's a sample of welter's résumé, by way of the cardinals: the 37-year-old has a master's degree in sport psychology and a phd in psychology; was a collegiate rugby player; and played 14 seasons of pro football as a linebacker, most with the women's football alliance. In february 2014, she logged another first: playing a non-kicking position in a men's pro league ( she played running back and special teams for the texas revolution ). At espn, josh weinfuss looks at the man behind the move: that would be coach bruce arians. Writes weinfuss, \" this is a typical arians move. It's risky and it's bold, just like his offense....

The announcement turns the islamist-drafted charter into the country's first constitution after the uprising that forced hosni mubarak out of office after nearly 30 years of authoritarian rule. The opposition had campaigned against the constitution, charging that it will usher in islamic rule in egypt and restrict freedoms. It has vowed to challenge the results. Judge samir abou el-maati, the head of the electoral commission, denied allegations that judicial supervision was lacking in the vote. The official results closely mirror unofficial results announced by the muslim brotherhood, the main group that backed the charter."

        "summary": "Donald trump has a web of international business interests with few rivals in american history, let alone presidential history, warn ethics experts getting ready to take on a trump presidency. According to a washington post analysis, at least 111 trump companies have business interests in 18 countries and territories, including china, turkey, and saudi arabia, creating potential conflicts of interest all over the world. \" there are so many diplomatic, political, even national security risks in having the president own a whole bunch of properties all over the world, \" warns richard painter, the chief ethics lawyer of the george w. Bush administration. A roundup of coverage: the guardian reports that a coalition of watchdog groups has asked trump to put his business holdings in a \" genuine blind trust, \" meaning that an independent trustee would sell all his assets and put the proceeds in investments that would not be disclosed to trump. The trump organization has said control of trump's assets will be handed to his children, not an independent outsider. The new york times reports that the developers behind the trump towers pune project in india flew to new york and met briefly with trump last week. The developers say that contrary to reports in indian newspapers, they did not discuss business with the president-elect. Ethics lawyers, however, say that the meeting created the impression that trump and his partners are trying to profit from his position in a way that \" is unprecedented in modern history. \" the los angeles times reports that in a fox news sunday appearance, mike pence said lawyers are working on creating the \" proper separation \" between trump and his business interests. \" i ' m very confident working with the best legal minds in the country that the president-elect and his family will create the proper separation from his business going forward, \" he said. The ap looks at the roles of trump's three eldest children — don jr., ivanka, and eric — and notes that when they enter trump tower every day, it's never clear whether they're going to business offices, campaign offices, or their father's penthouse residence.

In the last decade, at least 82 people have attempted suicide by leaping off it, and 22 have died. The bridge, which connects perth amboy and sayreville along route 35, was the subject of a march held last weekend in which locals called for the erection of a barrier, reports my central jersey. The sept. 28 event followed roughly a week after giancarlos taveras, 16, is believed to have jumped from the span; his body was found on rocks below. And in the days since the march, two more attempts have been made. Around 8pm on monday, a fisherman heard a splash, followed by cries for help. Some 40 minutes later, 19-year-old daury hernandez-gomez was pulled from the water; nj.com reports he had left his cellphone on the bridge above before jumping. He suffered a broken pelvis. On wednesday, another teen who reportedly planned to end her life was saved by first responders, including an off-duty firefighter, who removed her from the bridge, reports nj.com. Perth amboy officials have long asked njdot to install a suicide barrier; though the bridge is state-owned, city officials are typically the first to respond, creating a financial burden. Officers claim that a number of factors — no barrier, parking adjacent to the bridge, light traffic, and a style of railing that functions as a sort of stepladder — contribute to the problem.",

In an interview set to be broadcast on bbc one in mid-june, stephen hawking says, \" i would consider assisted suicide only if i were in great pain or felt i had nothing more to contribute but was just a burden to those around me, \" the telegraph reports. \" to keep someone alive against their wishes is the ultimate indignity. \" hawking has spoken before about his support for assisted suicide, notably in a bbc interview last year in which he said, \" we should not take away the freedom of the individual to choose to die \" and admitted he had tried to kill himself once by not breathing after a tracheostomy ( \" the reflex to breathe was too strong, \" he noted ). Assisted suicide is still illegal in the uk, though the guardian notes the department of public prosecutions wouldn't likely prosecute family or friends who helped a loved one end his or her life. But the world doesn't have to worry about losing hawking just yet: the 73-year-old says he's not really in pain, just discomfort when he wants to adjust positions, the telegraph notes. And he tells the program's interviewer that he's still got a lot to offer: \" i am damned if i ' m going to die before i have unraveled more of the universe, \" he says, per the guardian. But the paper notes hawking also advocates for euthanasia safeguards and has pointed out he thought he wanted to die in 1985 after a particularly brutal bout with pneumonia; his then-wife jane wouldn't disconnect his life support. His best-selling a brief history of time came out three years later. ( competent patients in canada can now seek a doctor to help them end their own lives. )",

Silver argues that democrats will never have a better chance to pass reform, and that it would \"take a miracle \" to pass the public option. \"i don't know how many times you can bang your head against the wall before this sinks in. \" silver began by posting 20 somewhat serious, somewhat sarcastic \"questions for bill killers \" at fivethirtyeight.com, which markos moulisas ( dailykos ) and jon walker ( firedoglake ) happily answered, saying they aren't happy with the individual insurance mandates, want better cost controls, and think democrats could get a bill with a public option using reconciliation. Silver thinks the subsidies for the poor trump most concerns, doubts the efficacy of reconciliation, and says further public option talk \"begins to smack of the first stage of grief. \"",

Zeid ra ' ad al hussein, a member of the jordanian royal family and the first muslim to be named high commissioner for human rights, on tuesday urged the security council to back efforts to overturn the islamic state's \"ideology of violence. \" his speech was equally a message to the muslim world. \"it is also disturbing how few to nonexistent have been the public demonstrations of anger in the arab and muslims worlds over the crimes being perpetrated in iraq — notwithstanding the clear condemnation by many arab and islamic governments, \" mr. Al hussein said. Citing the opinion of muslim clerics, he said the group had violated shariah in many instances, through conversions, the reintroduction of slavery and the killing of civilians. He said islam also prohibited the killing of diplomats and emissaries, which could be extended to journalists and aid workers. His comments come as an american-led coalition expands military action against islamic state strongholds in iraq and syria, but has so far been unable to stop its killing rampage.

Directed by david twohy, riddick is the third in the series, but critics are torn as to whether its main character should live to fight another day, or be left to die on the dusty planet he now inhabits. Rene rodriguez at the miami herald isn't messing around, calling riddick \" a modestly budgeted bone universal pictures threw at diesel so he would keep starring in fast and furious pictures. Those movies are bank; riddick is rank. \" oh, and then there's this: \" unlike good science fiction, riddick doesn't have a single intriguing idea or concept. \" stephanie merry at the washington post doesn't think it's so bad. \" riddick can be cheesy and silly, not to mention excessively violent, but it's also fun, \" she writes. \" the story moves quickly along, and even when the outcome is plain, the journey remains entertaining. Diesel looks like an oaf but makes for a winning anti-hero. \" with a headline like \" riddick is better off lost in space, \" it's clear that claudia puig, writing for usa today, disagrees. \" if only audiences, like the title character in riddick, were equipped with luminescent extra-vision eyeballs. Then it might be possible to muddle through the dark and incoherent action scenes.... Move along, there's nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot. \" evening out the field, kyle smith at the new york post writes, \" the movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated john carter, it's just a pared-down yarn of survival: die hard on a planet. \" still, he admits the \" cgi can be laughably bad. \"",

        "summary": "It's an otherwise unremarkable image of the photo-op variety, showing president trump shaking hands with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in the oval office on wednesday. But it's causing a fuss because of how it came to be. The meeting was closed to the media, but russia's state-owned tass news agency posted photos of the get-together soon after it ended. Tass also distributed them to the ap, reports usa today. That surprised white house officials, who thought only official government photographers were supposed to be present, and had members of the us press corps questioning why they were shut out while the russian media was allowed in. The explanation is that russia apparently doesn't make a distinction between an official government photographer and a tass photographer. \" we were not informed by the russians that their official photographer was dual-hatted and would be releasing the photographs on the state news agency, \" a white house official tells the washington post. The newspaper talks to former intelligence officials who see allowing a fully equipped tass photographer into the oval office as a security risk, given the possibility of him planting a bug of some sort. It notes an exchange on twitter in which former deputy cia director david cohen was asked whether it was wise and he responded succinctly, \" no it was not. \" politico adds some context, noting that former president obama's white house took flak for closing meetings to the press and releasing \" official \" photos later — a practice the white house correspondents ' association likened to the \" white house's own soviet-style news service. \" ( lavrov had an unusual reaction to james comey's firing earlier in the day. )",

        "summary": "This year's republican national convention was the wildest in decades — and with legions of disgruntled bernie sanders supporters, dozens of planned protests ( including a fart-in ), and the sudden resignation of dnc chief debbie wasserman schultz on the eve of the convention, things could get just as crazy for the democrats this week. A roundup of coverage as delegates gather in philadelphia: npr looks at some of the protest groups that have obtained no fewer than 28 permits for marches and rallies. They include \" black men for bernie \" and the \" poor people's economic human rights campaign, \" which is stocking up on beans ahead of a planned \" fart-in \" to be held as hillary clinton accepts the nomination. The wrap lists the \" fart-in menace \" as one of three ways that the convention could go wrong for clinton. The others are bill clinton veering badly off-message — or having nothing go wrong, which would leave hillary with no way to \" demonstrate her resilience and ability to roll with adversity. \" a full list of speakers and caucus meetings at the wells fargo center can be found here. Sanders speaks monday night, followed by michelle obama. The hill looks at the story hillary clinton's campaign plans to tell over the four days of the convention, finishing with a speech thursday night that clinton ally rep. Emanuel cleaver says will be her most important ever — and possibly the most important at a democratic convention since jfk in 1960. The protests, most of them involving sanders supporters, began sunday, and the ones to follow are expected to be bigger than anything seen at the rnc, the ap reports. They will also be hotter, with the region in the grip of a heat wave that will bring temperatures over 100 monday. Politico looks at democrats ' efforts to calm the \" chaos \" in the party following the leak of dnc emails that revealed an anti-sanders bias. Insiders say party leaders hope to get things under control before there is a \" ted cruz moment. \" sanders has called for unity, but some of his supporters still hope for a contested convention and may seek to nominate an alternative candidate to tim kaine for vice president, the washington post reports. The dnc won't be dealing with nearly as many high-profile no-shows as the rnc, reports politico, but one big name who won't be there is al gore. The 2000 nominee, who has yet to formally endorse clinton, says he has \" obligations in tennessee. \" but there will be an unexpected high-profile speaker: michael bloomberg.

( photo: andrew gombert, european pressphoto agency ) new york — hillary clinton launched her presidential campaign in earnest saturday with a speech and rally in a setting that evoked a revered democratic past as much as — if not more than — the party's desired future. To explain her vision of prosperity, she cited two voices from the depression: president franklin d. Roosevelt and her mother. Speaking on an island in the east river named for fdr, she echoed some of that president's anti-wall street rhetoric, repeatedly criticizing populist targets such as hedge fund managers, tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that stash profits overseas. \" you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of america's kindergarten teachers combined, and often paying a lower tax rate, \" clinton said. \" so, you have to wonder: ' when does my hard work pay off? when does my family get ahead?

If there was a clear theme to clinton's remarks, it was the \"four fights \" she vowed to wage on behalf of \"everyday americans \": building an economy for tomorrow, strengthening america and our core values, and revitalizing our democracy, in the campaign's boiled-down language.

Michael monday, usa today hillary clinton arrives to make her official launch address on roosevelt island in new york on june 13, 2015. ( photo: andrew gombert, european pressphoto agency ) new york — hillary clinton launched her presidential campaign in earnest saturday with a speech and rally in a setting that evoked a revered democratic past as much as — if not more than — the party's desired future. To explain her vision of prosperity, she cited two voices from the depression: president franklin d. Roosevelt and her mother. Speaking on an island in the east river named for fdr, she echoed some of that president's anti-wall street rhetoric, repeatedly criticizing populist targets such as hedge fund managers, tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that stash profits overseas. \" you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of america's kindergarten teachers combined, and often paying a lower tax rate, \" clinton said. \" so, you have to wonder: ' when does my hard work pay off? when does my family get ahead? ' \" and echoing the \" four freedoms \" roosevelt declared in a 1941 speech, clinton identified \" four",
            "Seven years after she left the presidential stage thanking supporters for putting \"18 million cracks \" in the highest glass ceiling, hillary clinton kicked off her campaign saturday with a wink to her past, pointing out that she was launching under blue manhattan skies, \"with absolutely no ceilings. \" with 1 world trade center rising behind her podium on new york city's roosevelt island, clinton embraced the historic nature of her run explicitly, stating with pride that while she isn't the youngest candidate in the race, \"i will be the youngest woman president in the history of the united states, and the first grandmother as well. \" story continued below in a 45-minute speech that often felt more like a state of the union address than a rousing campaign rally, clinton ranged widely, throwing in homages to past democratic presidents, attacks on today's republicans, appeals to women, lgbt groups, climate activists, workers, and a hodge-podge of other traditional progressive causes. If there was a clear theme to clinton's remarks, it was the \"four fights \" she vowed to wage on behalf of \"everyday americans \": building an economy for tomorrow, strengthening america and our core values, and revitalizing our democracy, in the campaign's boiled-down language. Her candidacy, she said, would be a battle \"for everyone who"

        "summary": "It's just your ordinary tale of a pizza delivery guy who used to play in the nfl and is now a state lawmaker chasing after the men who robbed him and inadvertently helping crack a murder case. The bizarre tale centers around 37-year-old napoleon harris, who played linebacker for the raiders and other teams years ago. Harris is not only an illinois state senator now, he's also the owner of two beggars pizza franchises, and when an order came in before closing on sept. 6, he opted to handle the delivery himself, reports the daily southtown. It turned out to be an ambush at a vacant house in harvey, police say. When harris showed up at the address, one man greeted him on the porch while three others jumped out and attacked him. At this point, it's relevant to point out that harris is 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds. \"they put a chokehold on the senator, but to no avail, \" says sean howard, who doubles as a spokesman for harris and the harvey police, per cbs 2. \" they were really trying to choke him to death, and he was just too strong. \" they did manage to get his wallet, however, before fleeing in a vehicle. Harris followed them to a lumberyard and called police. The assailants escaped on foot but left behind the vehicle, which had blood in it that police traced to a man in georgia who had been reported missing. His body would be found in georgia a few days later, per the atlanta journal constitution. Harris'descriptions helped police track down his assailants, and three of them are being in held in connection with the georgia killing. Charges are pending against the fourth man.",

            "Four men planning to rip off a pizza delivery person of some cash instead found themselves face-to-face with a local state senator who formerly played linebacker for several national football league teams. Officials in harvey worked with law enforcement officials in fulton county, ga., along with the fbi, in providing information related to the attack on state sen. Napoleon harris, d-harvey, and that helped in the investigation of a missing man later found killed in georgia. Harris was once a prep football star at thornton high school who later went on to play for the oakland raiders, kansas city chiefs and minnesota vikings. Aside from now serving in the illinois senate, harris owns beggars pizza franchises in orland park and harvey. On sept. 6, he was working at the restaurant at 369 e. 147th st. In harvey when one last call came in for a pizza delivery. Because it was closing time, harris decided to make the delivery himself. When harris, who declined comment thursday about the incident, arrived at the house in the 15800 block of paulina avenue, he encountered a man sitting on the porch. Suddenly, according to harvey police spokesman sean howard, three other men came charging out of bushes and attacked harris. Howard said harris was struck by the men, who also tried putting him in a chokehold. But harris, who is 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, was able to fight them off. Howard said the men did manage to get the money in harris ' wallet, along with the pizza, before they fled in a chevrolet tahoe. Harris was shaken up by the attack, but howard said the senator was able to regain his senses, get in his car and follow the tahoe until its occupants abandoned the vehicle at a lumberyard in south holland. Harris had his cellphone with him and was able to call harvey police to report the incident. Police wound up converging on the lumberyard, where they discovered blood in the vehicle, which turned out to be registered to lester \" roy \" jones, a man who had been reported missing in georgia. Forensic tests done by the illinois state police revealed the blood was from jones, who later turned up dead. Howard said harvey police provided their information to georgia law enforcement officials, and also provided a tip that the suspects had gotten on a bus leaving chicago for atlanta.

The women were killed alongside their husbands in deir ezzor and mayadin over the past two days.

However, the observatory says kurdish female fighters have only been beheaded after they died in battle, per afp. Other female isis captives have been stoned to death. \" this is the first time the observatory has documented women being killed by the group in this manner, \" the chief says. The terrorist group reportedly covered up the women before beheading them in front of a crowd. Earlier this week, the observatory said it had recorded 3,027 isis executions; some 1,787 civilians were among those killed, including 74 children. Among the latest suffering brought about by isis: eight people, including two minors, were crucified after being accused of breaking the ramadan fast \" with no religious justification. \" they reportedly hung from the crucifixes for a day as children were urged to taunt them, reports reuters.

The trial of 27-year-old eddie ray routh, accused of murdering navy seal chris kyle ( on whom the movie was based ) and friend chad littlefield at a shooting range in 2013, will begin there tomorrow. Residents are bracing for more publicity amid the conversation of what caused one veteran to kill another — and whether routh will be able to get a fair trial, the new york times reports. \" we've never had anything like this in this town, \" says the owner of a bar across from the courthouse. With the movie out and the trial set to begin, everybody's talking about the case, which is part of why routh's lawyers contend there's no way he ' ll get a fair shake. In a denied request to move the trial out of erath county, they pointed to the movie's popularity ( many locals receiving jury summonses had seen it, the times notes ), a pre-jury-selection bomb threat, and kyle's hero status in the area as proof that routh won't find a sympathetic ear. Routh, a marine veteran who reportedly told authorities before the shootings that he had post-traumatic stress disorder, has pleaded not guilty, and attorneys have indicated they ' ll use an insanity defense. But a cbs news legal analyst thinks routh's changed appearance since his arrest — he's put on some weight and wears glasses — won't help that case. He looked \" crazy \" at the time of the shooting, says rikki klieman. \" what he looks like today is a reasonable person. \"",

Barry clifford brought up a 110-pound silver bar from a wreck off madagascar believed to be the scottish pirate's flagship, the adventure galley, reports the bbc. Clifford presented the bar to madagascar's president in a ceremony thursday, and he swears there's more where that came from. \" i know the whole bottom of the cavity where i found the silver bar is filled with metal, \" he says. \" it's too murky down there to see what metal, but my metal detector tells me there is metal on all sides. \" he says he's sure it's kidd's loot, though october films, a british company filming clifford's search, was more reserved, saying that \" further analysis of the ingot will be required. \" the us ambassador attended the ceremony and seemed swayed, making a point to say the find could be \" great for tourism. \" skepticism should be expected, given the countless claims about kidd's treasure over the centuries. As the headline on a backgrounder about the new find at the daily beast asks, \" how many times are we going to find captain kidd's treasure? \" the un has taken notice of the claim, though not necessarily in a good way. Unesco is worried that clifford and the film crew might be trampling a valuable archaeological site and plans to send a team, possibly to take control of the site, reports afp.

Duarte has been fighting legal battles since 2012, when he hired someone to plow 450 acres of land he had purchased near red bluff in central california, usa today reports. Because the area included wetlands, the us army corps of engineers ordered work to stop and sued duarte for failing to obtain a permit and for allegedly carrying out \" deep ripping \" that went as far as 3 feet down, disturbing waters considered to be \" waters of the united states \" under federal regulations. A pacific legal foundation lawyer says this is the first case he knows of where a farmer had to get a permit from the army corps of engineers to grow crops. \" we're not going to produce much food under those kinds of regulations, \" he says. Federal prosecutors say duarte violated the clean water act because his activities deposited dirt into wetland streams. The case is scheduled to go to trial in august, though duarte says the trump administration has made it clear it considers the rule involved to be \" dead, \" the modesto bee reports. He says unless the case is dropped, he will take it to the highest court possible to make sure other farmers aren't \" shaken down by government agencies. \" ( meanwhile, a study finds that it is indeed possible to grow potatoes on mars. )",

        "summary": "In the current political climate, there's no way we can pass a bill increasing aid to the working poor. But we could very likely pass an increase to the federal minimum wage, writes paul krugman in the new york times. Such an increase is overwhelmingly supported by the public, across all political parties. Inflation-adjusted wages for retail workers not in supervisory positions have gone down nearly 30 % since 1973, leaving many of them to rely on food stamps and medicaid for their most basic needs. And before you start raising an argument, know that the evidence is \" overwhelmingly positive, \" showing that wage hikes help workers while having \" little or no adverse effect on employment. \" and keep in mind that nearly 60 % of minimum wage workers in the us are in food service or sales, which means there's no \" threat of foreign competition \" to worry about: \" americans won't drive to china to pick up their burgers and fries. \" also in the times, economist arindrajit dube argues for a minimum wage increase. The pay rate is \" currently near a record low, \" and if it were just middle-class teenagers affected by that, the issue wouldn't be as urgent. \" but in reality, the low-wage work force has become older and more educated over time, \" and it's time for a change.

Nixon, we even implemented more direct forms of wage controls. These direct interventions, however, were temporary, and unions have become rare in most parts of the united states — virtually disappearing from the private sector. This leaves minimum wage policies as one of the few institutional levers for setting a wage standard. But while we can set a wage floor using policy, should we? or should we leave it to the market and deal with any adverse consequences, like poverty and inequality, using other policies, like tax credits and transfers? these longstanding questions take on a particular urgency as wage inequality continues to grow, and as we consider specific proposals to raise the federal minimum wage — currently near a record low — and to index future increases to the cost of living.

A woman has been charged with dui after crashing into the infield and causing injuries, reports the daytona beach news-journal. It happened early saturday, as fans were camping out on an area of the racetrack ahead of sunday's big race. Police say 43-year-old abbie kinney blew twice the legal limit after driving her pickup through the infield, hitting four people and six rvs. One of those injured suffered a broken leg, reports fox 35. \" we heard a loud bang behind us, as soon as we turned around, she was on top of us, \" says one of the injured spectators. \" i got lucky.

        "summary": "Donald trump will be officially elected president of the united states on monday unless the electoral college does something unprecedented — and leaves him \" unpresidented. \" some 538 electors will meet across the country and 306 of them are supposed to vote for trump, reflecting the election outcomes in their states, though there has been a strong movement calling for them to deny trump the presidency — and for the electors supposed to vote for hillary clinton to instead vote for a more acceptable republican. It would take 38 gop rebels to keep trump out of the white house, which is an outcome seen as extremely unlikely. Most of the voting will take place in state capitols, where protests are expected. A round-up of coverage: republican electors say they have received thousands of letters and emails pleading with them to vote against trump, the ap reports. \" the letters are actually quite sad, \" says lee green, a republican elector from north carolina. \" they are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force. \" insiders in battleground states tell politico that while it will be interesting to see how many electors decide to defy election results, there is almost no chance it will change the final outcome. Most of the 160 republicans and democrats surveyed believe there will be 10 or fewer faithless electors; just one thought there would be more than 37. The new york times takes a look at how the electoral college works, and at whether faithless electors will be punished if they vote against the election results. The times notes that electors can be party officials or people with a connection to a candidate: bill clinton is among this year's new york electors. Npr looks at what happens next: the states submit a certificate of vote to the federal register, listing the votes for president and vice president. The votes will be tallied at a jan. 6 joint session of congress, which will be presided over by joe biden. When a candidate gets to 270 votes, they will be declared the next president — and if that candidate isn't trump, expect chaos. If no one gets a majority, choosing a president will be up to the house of representatives. While the vote won't be officially counted until jan. 6, mic reports that we should know the outcome before then: it notes the ap produced the results at 6pm et on voting day in 2012 ( though that year was a little \" less contentious \" ), and that the office of the federal register website will publish verified votes as they're received.
