Mcilroy, a four-time major champion, says trump shot \" around 80, \" business insider reports. Mcilroy is currently sidelined from competitive golf with a stress fracture in his rib but says he decided to tough it out when he got the invite saturday night to play with the president. Mcilroy isn't the only professional golfer to have weighed in on trump's game. Tiger woods has previously said trump \" takes a pretty good lash \" for a man his age. But like anything having to do with trump, sunday's golf game wasn't without controversy. Usa today reports mcilroy took some heat on the internet; some pointed out that he had ducked out of the most recent olympics because they were \" too political. \" on trump's side, the white house was caught downplaying how much golf the president is playing, according to politico. The white house originally reported trump had only played \" a few holes \" on sunday, but mcilroy's comments led a spokesperson to admit that trump decided to \" play longer \" — a full 18 holes. Trump routinely blasted barack obama for playing golf while president.",

        "summary": "After failing to get congress — or mexico — to cough up enough cash for a wall along the mexican border, president trump has been looking into getting the pentagon to pay for it, reasoning that it has plenty of money under the new federal budget, insiders say. The sources tell the washington post that trump, worried that failure to build the promised wall will cause supporters to desert him, has been privately pushing defense secretary jim mattis, among others, to make the wall a military-funded project because of national security fears. But officials say the military is unlikely to pay for the wall, and even if the pentagon was willing, it would require an act and the move would not get 60 votes in the senate. In a tweet tuesday, trump argued that the military is \" rich \" and building a border wall is all about national defense because there are \" enemy combatants pouring into our country. \" \" build wall through m! \" he urged. Trump wants $ 25 billion for the wall, but the latest spending bill allocates just $ 1.6 billion, with restrictions on how it can be spent. \" first mexico was supposed to pay for it, then us taxpayers, and now our men and women in uniform? \" senate minority leader chuck schumer tells the post. \" this would be a blatant misuse of military funds and tied up in court for years. \" cnn reports that press secretary sarah huckabee sanders declined to comment on possible military funding tuesday. The \" continuation of building the wall is ongoing, and we're going to continue moving forward in that process, \" she said.",

After a tip, police spotted matthew camped out on a sliver of sand on the remote bolivar peninsula — the site of a mass grave used decades ago by serial killer dean corll and accessible by a single road, the ap reports. Matthew is one of many to hole up on the spot ( among others: famed french pirate jean lafitte, rumor has it ), where some stay for months. \" we get lots of weird folks, \" says a local. \" it seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote. \" more on the case from the washington post and the daily progress: matthew initially said he was \" george carr, \" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at liberty university in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \" basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and matthew was saying she had, \" says an attorney with the lynchburg commonwealth attorney's office. Searchers have scoured much of charlottesville, va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland. They've asked area real estate agents to inspect any vacant buildings or properties they represent, and have told the public to be on the lookout for graham's iphone 5s with a pink case or unexplained tire tracks. Authorities are also looking to identify some of matthew's favorite fishing spots. Matthew has declined to fight his extradition, and virginia police have been sent to retrieve him.

        "summary": "Iowa sen. Chuck grassley is taking flak over comments he made about why the gop aims to scrap or least mitigate the estate tax. In speaking to the des moines register, grassley said the tax often derided by republicans as the \" death tax \" is unfair because it taxes earnings twice, first when people earn the money and again when they die and try to pass it on to their heirs. Then came the more controversial part: \" i think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies. \" as npr notes, that triggered a flurry of online criticism from those who viewed grassley's remarks as elitist. This tweet is typical of the reaction: \" i ' m sure those folks would love to invest, but they're a bit preoccupied just trying to make ends meet. \" the washington post notes that it also caught the attention of former hillary clinton spokesman jesse ferguson, who tweeted, \" [ i ] f we gave that money in middle class tax cuts, they'd just waste it on hookers and blow. Right? \" but it wasn't just democrats taking issue. At the conservative hot air site, ed morrissey says the comment \" is everything right and wrong with the current republican tax-reform effort in a nutshell. \" grassley's first criticism of the \" double dip \" problem with the estate tax is spot-on correct, he writes. \" in the very next breath, however, grassley commits the same sin that has plagued the tax system for decades, which is congress'desire to commit social engineering through it. \" the house tax plan would eliminate the tax entirely in 2024, while the senate version would double exemptions to $ 11 million for individuals and $ 22 million for couples.",

And live science. The enzymes have been nicknamed the \" phantom menace \" by researchers because they can be tough to detect. In a report issued this week, the cdc says it identified 43 cases in the us involving the superbug between june 2010 and august of this year, mainly involving people who had traveled overseas, though some cases are thought to have been transmitted in the us. \" this is a tricky drug-resistant bacteria, and it isn't easily found, \" cdc director thomas frieden tells the post. \" what we're seeing is an assault by the microbes on the last bastion of antibiotics. \" the number of cases is small but rising, frieden says, warning that what has been detected so far could just be the \" tip of the iceberg. \" an infectious disease specialist tells live science that while the bacteria shouldn't be a major worry for the general public right now, doctors and patients should be aware that the best way to combat antibiotic resistance is to try to be more sparing in the use of antibiotics.

Fidel castro diaz-balart, nicknamed \" fidelito, \" was 68. Castro-diaz balart, who was born during castro's brief, pre-cuban revolution marriage to mirta diaz-balart, headed cuba's national nuclear program from 1980 to 1992 and was serving as a scientific adviser for the cuban council of state at the time of his death, reuters reports. Castro diaz-balart was born in 1949. His mother took him to live in the us after she divorced castro in 1953. She sent him to visit his father after he took power in 1959 and he never returned him, cnn reports. Castro diaz-balart trained as a nuclear physicist in the soviet union and spoke russian, spanish, english, and french fluently. Paul hare, a former british ambassador to cuba, tells reuters that castro diaz-balart seemed \" thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond cuba \" when he met him at a dinner in boston two years ago. \" but he seemed a bit weary about having to be a castro, rather than himself, \" hare says. The bbc reports that he was related on his mother's side to prominent anti-castro regime politicians in the us, including his cousin, republican rep. Mario diaz-balart.

I ' m not, however, mis-stating it. Encounters between movie stars and the journalists who cover them are edgy, deeply. They are, by their very nature, transactional: the journalist offers the star, usually with a new project or venture to promote, exposure; the star offers the journalist revelation, a couple of juicy details with which to titillate readers. Use and be used, give and take, a mutual hustle and the way of the world. Couldn't be clearer, right? where"

        "summary": "If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a national institutes of health study published tuesday in the bmj that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the nurses ' health study ii over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \" never \" to \" six or more times a day. \" the researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35 % of american women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8 % of their caloric intake. Study author dr. Cuilin zhang recommends to cbs news that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes — which cbs reports affects as many as 8 % of pregnancies — by 9 % to 12 %. As for why women should care, zhang tells the bbc that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \" can adversely affect the fetus \" and put the mother at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. ( one country has told its women not to get pregnant right now. )",

What's more, he's said to have obtained the papyrus in east germany in 1963 — a bit fishy since he was living on the other side of the berlin wall at the time. Another papyrus reportedly owned by laukamp and given to harvard is fake, a researcher has asserted. It looks a lot like the \" gospel, \" with similar handwriting and ink. Other experts are raising doubts, rather forcefully. \" when is this papyrological pantomime, this keystone coptic, this academic farce, this philological burlesque finally going to stop? \" asks a brown university researcher.

Meanwhile, harvard university, which announced the papyrus'discovery, has fallen silent on the artifact, not responding to requests for comment on new developments suggesting the find is a forgery.

            "This papyrus, said to be from ancient times, says that jesus had a wife. Its discovery was announced in 2012 and new information uncovered by live science casts doubt on its origins. The \" gospel of jesus's wife, \" a papyrus written in coptic and containing text that refers to jesus being married, is looking more and more like it is not authentic, research is revealing. A growing number of scholars have denounced the business card-sized papyrus as a fake, with recent op-eds appearing in the wall street journal and on cnn. Meanwhile, harvard university, which announced the papyrus'discovery, has fallen silent on the artifact, not responding to requests for comment on new developments suggesting the find is a forgery.

Gen. Keith alexander said he'd go over all 50 cases with congress, but wouldn't release the information to the public because it would give away nsa secrets. More from the hearing, courtesy of politico and cnn's liveblog. Alexander said 90 % of those cases were disrupted by the prism web spying program. The nsa said that while it has assembled a massive database of call tracking information, it has targeted fewer than 300 numbers or other \" identifiers \" within it. Deputy attorney general james cole stressed that the nsa must get permission from the secret fisa court to access phone data, and must have evidence linking their target to a terrorist organization. \" this is not a program that's off the books that's been hidden away, \" cole said. But cole also said that the fourth amendment didn't apply to phone records, and that people shouldn't expect privacy for them. Nsa deputy director chris inglis said that just 22 people at the nsa are authorized to query the phone database. Alexander said the nsa has neither the legal authority nor technical ability to \" flip a switch \" and listen to a phone conversation. The nsa brass wasn't exactly facing an inquisition. Committee chairman mike rogers painted the nsa as a victim of \" a constant public drumbeat \" accusing it of a \" laundry list of nefarious things … all of them wrong. \" he said public trust was waning thanks to \" inaccuracies, half-truths, and outright lies. \"",

Usa today reports 157 pregnant women in the continental us and another 122 in us territories tested positive for the virus, which can cause miscarriages and birth defects. It's unclear how much of the reported increase is due to the spread of zika and how much is due to the cdc now counting women who tested positive but don't show symptoms, according to cnn. So far, none of the women were infected by mosquitoes in the us. Most got it while traveling to other countries, while a handful contracted zika through sex.

In 2013, the company landed in hot water over an unexpected surge in gifts needing delivery, resulting in some 1.3 million packages that weren't delivered by christmas eve. This year, things went the opposite direction: the company hired an extra 100,000 seasonal workers, consumerist notes, but the uptick in business didn't quite pan out as hoped. The result of all this is new costs for consumers. Ups plans a surcharge for residential deliveries, set to take effect over the course of a few years, reuters reports. \" we absolutely will charge our customers more for the extra costs that we had in peak, \" ceo david abney tells the wall street journal. Home deliveries can place a special burden on the company, it says, because homes typically get just one package at a time, whereas a business might receive a pile. Customers may end up seeing higher shipping costs at online retailers, as well as more emphasis on pickup locations like amazon lockers in retail stores, consumerist notes.",

Ups also reported that fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but forecast earnings within the range of estimates. Ups, the world's largest package delivery company, warned in late january it would report a fourth-quarter profit below its forecast and market expectations.

Now 23 sommeliers who thought they'd joined the upper ranks last month will have to do it over again. The court of master sommeliers, americas announced tuesday it would invalidate the results of the blind tasting administered in st. Louis because of \" clear evidence \" of cheating. An unnamed court master \" breached the confidentiality \" of the test by releasing \" detailed information concerning wines in the tasting flight \" ahead of time, the court says, per the washington post. The offending master ( unnamed ) will be stripped of title and court membership, and 23 of 24 newly minted masters must retake the 25-minute tasting test — in which they're asked to identify six wines, down to the year, grape, and region, per the san francisco chronicle — before next summer. \" it's a tremendous amount of waste and heartbreak for everybody who passed in an honest way, \" says the sole member of the 2018 class to keep his title, having passed the tasting portion last year. \" there are people who have put relationships, marriages, parenting of their children on hold so they can make sure they're professionally successful at this. \" cms board chairman devon broglie is sympathetic. \" i can only imagine how hard it hit everyone to learn that something they worked so hard for was tainted by the actions of a single individual, \" he says.

But new research suggests that simply feeling younger than your age — even when accounting for other longevity factors, such as alcohol intake, wealth, illness, education, and smoking — improves longevity, reports medical news today. Studying 6,489 participants in the english longitudinal study of aging, researchers report in the journal jama internal medicine that mortality was only 14.3 % among those who felt younger than their age, but was 18 % for those who felt their age, and 24.6 % for those who felt older. \" someone who feels younger is possibly healthier than someone who feels older — they have fewer diseases, they may be more mobile, \" a researcher tells cbs philadelphia. The study couldn't connect self-perceived age with death by cancer, but did establish a strong link between self-perceived age and fatal cardiovascular disease. Factors that speed up self-perceived aging include becoming a parent at an early age, experiencing stress, and developing serious health problems such as cancer. Still, more than 66 % of participants say they felt at least three years younger than their chronological age. According to the study, older people who feel old may well slow the aging process by adopting a fresh outlook: \" interventions may be possible, \" the authors say. \" individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviors and attitudes toward aging. \" ( other research suggests soda can age our cells as much as cigarettes. )",

In iran's reading, obama offered face-to-face talks and promised to lift sanctions if rouhani demonstrates a willingness to \" keep your commitments and remove ambiguities. \" but washington's interpretation is much less dramatic; an official says obama wasn't necessarily promising leader-to-leader talks, or any specific sanction action. Rouhani wants to strike a quick deal in the next six months, before parliamentary elections begin. The normally politically powerful military is currently defanged, and ayatollah khamenei appears to be on board. In the meantime rouhani's on a charm offensive. He wrote an op-ed in today's washington post in which he offers to \" help facilitate dialogue between the syrian government and the opposition, \" and promises an attempt to \" move beyond impasses \" with regard to iran's nuclear program. He's on the interview circuit as well, with one coming up with charlie rose. Next week he ' ll give his first un address, and for once the us may not walk out, the post reports.

        "summary": "The pilots killed in this week's crash of a ups plane in birmingham got two automated warnings that they were coming in too low, says the ntsb. But they didn't have much time to process them — the first came 7 seconds before impact, reports the wall street journal. Three seconds after the first \" sink rate \" alarm sounded in the cockpit, one of the two pilots said the runway was in sight, but the plane soon clipped power wires and slammed into a hill. A veteran pilot was at the controls: cerea beal had 8,600 flying hours with ups — 3,000 alone in a300 cargo planes, the type that went down — and before that served as a maine helicopter pilot. But it's unclear whether he had ever landed at this particular runway before at birmingham-shuttlesworth international airport. Authorities say it's tricky because it's not equipped with the electronics for a full instrument landing and thus requires a visual approach. The crash occurred in the pre-dawn dark, while it was raining. \" when i heard they were using runway 18, it caught my attention because of that hill, \" a commercial pilot tells ap. \" it's sad, but it didn't surprise me. \" a longer runway at the airport with a more modern landing system had been closed for maintenance. The co-pilot was previously identified as 37-year-old shanda fanning.",

It is paul's lucrative and decades-long promotion of bigotry and conspiracy theories, for which he has yet to account fully, and his continuing espousal of extremist views, that should make him unwelcome at any respectable forum, not only those hosted by jewish organizations. Paul's exclusion caused an uproar, with critics alleging that his stand on israel had earned the rjc's ire; an absolutist libertarian, paul opposes foreign aid to all countries, including the jewish state. \"this seems to me more of an attempt to draw boundaries around acceptable policy discourse than any active concern that president dr.

With more than 650 restaurants to chipotle's 1,900-plus, moe's southwest grill is now the new king of that particular category, according to a harris poll survey that queried nearly 100,000 consumers on more than 3,800 brands ( including about 60 restaurants ). And chipotle, in the top spot for three years running before it fell victim to a slew of recent food-safety issues, didn't merely drop to second place — it plummeted to fifth, behind taco bell, qdoba, and baja fresh. Competition in the category has been fierce, with mexican eateries all trying to one-up each other in serving up healthier menu items with more selection. Usa today notes that moe's is especially known for the ample variety of ingredients used to create build-your-own tacos, burritos, and other fare. But it's almost as if chipotle gave up, debuting few new menu items and taking a halfhearted approach to alerting consumers to steps it's taken to address the hundreds of illnesses — the new york post helpfully documents the norovirus, e. Coli, and salmonella count — that have resulted from chowing down its food. \" i just don't think they did enough to convince customers that chipotle food was safe to eat, \" an equity research analyst tells usa today. Plus, moe's made sure to capitalize on chipotle's woes, taking out a full-page ad in usa today on feb. 8, for instance, reminding everyone its restaurants were open — chipotle shut down that day to review food-safety protocol with staff, eater notes. \" moe's [ now ] has an opportunity to continue to convert that brand equity into restaurant visits, closing the visitation gap with chipotle, \" the ceo of analytics company placed insights tells usa today.

The 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the state's new rules, which essentially require clinics to have hospital-level building codes, reports the dallas morning news. ( think room and doorway sizes, air-sterilization systems, etc. ) prior to today's ruling, the state had 17 abortion clinics — down from 40 in 2013 — but only seven of them currently meet the requirements. An eighth, in mcallen near the mexican border, was granted limited exemptions. Barring a move by the supreme court, the state can begin enforcing the new rules in about three weeks, reports ap. Except for mcallen, those that would remain open are in major cities. A woman in el paso would have to make a 1,300-mile round trip to san antonio or cross the border into mexico, and the ap notes the court found the latter option ok. \" although the nearest abortion facility in texas is 550 miles away from el paso, there is evidence that women in el paso can travel the short distance to santa teresa ( in mexico ) to obtain an abortion and, indeed, the evidence is that many did just that, \" the court wrote.",

Bill has penned a love note to his wife nearly every day since 1974. Bresnan tells the asbury park press that \" kris \" was initially a student of his in a six-week prep class for the series 7 exam; when they started commuting on the same long island railroad train, he began by jotting notes to her on napkins. It grew from there to, by today's count, 10,000 letters, organized chronologically in some 25 boxes. The couple, who say they've never had a fight in all those years and prefer to talk it out instead of argue, call the collection their \" love diary. \" the signature of each letter bears an infinity sign. Some of the notes are short and sweet — \" thank you for being you and loving me, \" scribbled on a postcard in december 1989 — but sometimes bill goes big, reports abc news. In the 50 days leading up to kris ' 50th birthday, for instance, he sent a series of 50 special cards. But in the end, bill says, the key is to focus on and treasure each other, not phones and other distractions; he says dinner each night is eaten by candlelight, with romantic music as a backdrop. As for this valentine's day, \" we ' ll probably have a nice dinner, a special bottle of wine, and a piece of chocolate, \" he says. \" we're past the craving for jewelry and expensive nonsense. We just enjoy simply being together. \" as for his letter-writing habit, he expresses a single qualm to cbs new york: \" as i get older, my biggest fear is the day i forget to give it to her. \" ( one couple's love letters from wwi were recently uncovered. )",

Cnbc reports it could make online shopping easier, as mastercard found 53 % of people forget their password at least once a week, leading a third of online shoppers to just give up on buying anything. The next step for mastercard is using people's heartbeats to verify their identity. People's hearts create their own signature electric signal, and masercard is testing out a bracelet that monitors it continuously and sends that information to nearby devices to authenticate the user.

Kenny davenport tells cbs miami that he told pembroke pines police sgt. Jennifer martin that he couldn't serve her not because she was a cop, but because the drive-thru was so busy he had to ask his manager for help. The 19-year-old says the manager then made the bad joke about davenport not wanting to serve martin because she was a police officer. When the manager eventually brought the officer some food, she decided she didn't want to eat it. Davenport says he didn't disrespect martin and he would never refuse to serve an officer. \" she hungry, i ' m gonna give her some food, \" he says. The manager involved has been fired and the police department says it has received an apology from the ceo of arby's and now considers the matter closed, reports local 10 news.

Virginia tech's massey herbarium tweeted last week it had ided a giant hogweed ( aka heracleum mantegazzianum ) plant in clarke county, later updating that count on facebook to 30 plants. The plant holds what fox news deems a \" toxic sap, \" which prevents human skin from protecting itself from the sun's rays, leading to severe burns that can be worsened by sweat. New york state's department of environmental conservation lists other hazards that can result from coming in contact with the plant ( as well as some photos of terrible burns ), including long-term sunlight sensitivity, oozing blisters, scarring, and even permanent blindness if the sap makes its way into one's eyes. And it doesn't take a lot to fall prey to the poison of the giant hogweed, which resembles an umbrella or mushroom made up of white flowers: a simple brush up against its bristles can spur a reaction as soon as 15 minutes later, with \" sensitivity peak between 30 minutes and two hours after contact, \" per the dec. It's difficult to stop the spreading of the invasive plant, which is native to the caucasus region near russia and was introduced to the us sometime in the early 20th century. Virginia environmental officials are warning the plant may have been spotted in other parts of the state and for people who come across it to not let their bare skin make contact.

They still had the bike, so she asked if he could at least bring her the guardian ride bell from her husband's motorcycle. He did, but it wasn't enough. \" she called me up crying and said ' i really want that ring back. I don't know what it's going to take, ' \" said tim allen, her high school friend.

Kendrick was found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat at his school in january, in what was originally ruled an accidental asphyxiation. But his parents were suspicious and had him exhumed and examined by a private doctor. That doctor found evidence of \" non-accidental \" trauma, and now reveals that every organ from kendrick's pelvis to skull — including his brain, lungs, heart, and liver — is missing, cnn reports. Newspapers were stuffed into the cavities the organs should have occupied \" like he was a garbage can, \" his mother says. The georgia bureau of investigation, which conducted the first autopsy, says it put all the organs back in afterward. But the funeral home that embalmed kendrick tells the family's attorney that before it got the body the organs \" were destroyed through natural process, \" and then \" discarded by the prosecutor. \" the county sheriff, meanwhile, says the death is a closed case and refuses to discuss it. Yesterday, cnn revealed photos and video from the scene of kendrick's death that raise serious questions about investigators ' work, showing among other things blood stains on the wall that weren't investigated. \" they know something happened in that gym, \" kendrick's father says, \" and they don't want it to come out. \" click for more on the case.",

It comes from a newly released survey by the federal reserve of about 4,100 americans. In total, 31 % had saved no money for retirement, though the figure improved to 19 % for those ages 55 to 64. What's more, 20 % of people over 60 said retirement planning hadn't even crossed their minds, which probably explains why 24/7 wall st. Calls this \" the next crisis. \" another depressing find: some 40 % of non-retirees 45 and over have had to delay their pre-recession retirement plans. The problem doesn't just boil down to poor planning. \" many respondents, particularly those with limited incomes, indicated that they simply have few or no financial resources available for retirement, \" researchers say. In particular, a quarter of respondents said they were \" just getting by, \" while 13 % said they were struggling, cbs news reports. About 45 % of people said they planned to rely on social security to pay the bills in retirement, while 25 % gave the following answer: \" i don't know. \" just as many said they expected to work as long as they could, and another 18 % planned to get a part-time job after retiring.",

He ' ll tackle \" questions of any kind, \" a company rep says per the guardian. \" after so long, i want to exchange emails with readers, \" murakami is quoted as saying by shinchosha, with the rep adding to reuters that \" he likes to engage with readers, but there's so much interest it's hard for him to interact well. This should be smoother. \" marukami once referred to himself as \" an endangered species [ that ] may get intimidated and bite \" if people got too close to him, the new statesman reported in 2013. No one's sure where the self-banished murakami — often brought up as a possible nobel prize candidate — lives, though the guardian notes he \" spends much of his time \" in the us; the new statesman claims he resides in both japan and hawaii. Some of the qs he may receive will likely touch on some of his favorite topics, including cats and the yakult swallows, a pro japanese baseball team. Or they may be more fitting for a writer known for what the guardian calls \" intricately-crafted tales of the absurdity and loneliness of modern life \": \" we expect there to be some rather strange questions, \" the rep says, per reuters. \" which ones he answers depends on him. \" ( hopefully it will turn out better than this lad-mag column. )",

            "In his address to the nation almost two weeks ago, president obama promised to use force against the armies of islamic state \" wherever they are, \" and he specifically mentioned syria. But monday night's airstrikes in that country came sooner and with more force than expected, targeting not only islamic state but also the khorasan group, an al qaeda offshoot thought to be plotting attacks on americans. This major offensive raises questions about whether the united states ( and a few arab allies ) are planning a prolonged air campaign in a country whose leadership did not invite intervention. Coupled with his successful lobbying of congress to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train supposedly moderate syrian rebels, the airstrikes mark a major reversal for obama. Until recently he has assiduously resisted american entanglement in syria's civil war, and for good reason. The conflict pits president bashar assad, a secular dictator with innocent blood on his hands, against an assortment of opponents whose division into moderate and extremist factions isn't nearly so neat or stable as some advocates of u.s. Intervention suppose. Obama changed his mind about intervention in syria for the same reason he decided to launch airstrikes in iraq and augment the u.s. Military presence in that country: a sickeningly swift sequence of events in which islamic state fighters routed iraqi forces, terrorized christians and other minorities and seemed poised to attack baghdad. Obama also was influenced, understandably, by the horrific beheadings of two american journalists.

            "In his address to the nation almost two weeks ago, president obama promised to use force against the armies of islamic state \" wherever they are, \" and he specifically mentioned syria. But monday night's airstrikes in that country came sooner and with more force than expected, targeting not only islamic state but also the khorasan group, an al qaeda offshoot thought to be plotting attacks on americans. This major offensive raises questions about whether the united states ( and a few arab allies ) are planning a prolonged air campaign in a country whose leadership did not invite intervention. Coupled with his successful lobbying of congress to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train supposedly moderate syrian rebels, the airstrikes mark a major reversal for obama. Until recently he has assiduously resisted american entanglement in syria's civil war, and for good reason. The conflict pits president bashar assad, a secular dictator with innocent blood on his hands, against an assortment of opponents whose division into moderate and extremist factions isn't nearly so neat or stable as some advocates of u.s. Intervention suppose. Obama changed his mind about intervention in syria for the same reason he decided to launch airstrikes in iraq and augment the u.s. Military presence in that country: a sickeningly swift sequence of events in which islamic state fighters routed iraqi forces, terrorized christians and other minorities and seemed poised to attack baghdad. Obama also was influenced, understandably, by the horrific beheadings of two american journalists. The result was his promise of a long-term campaign to \" degrade and ultimately destroy \" islamic state. Obama said that wouldn't require u.s. Combat forces.

Christensen, 28, who is being held without bond, had tentatively been set to go to trial feb. 27 in federal court in urbana on a charge of kidnapping resulting in a death stemming from the disappearance of 26-year-old yingying zhang, whose body has not been found. The decision to seek the death penalty — which required the approval of u.s. Attorney general jeff sessions — means that the trial will likely be delayed for months. The death penalty was abolished in illinois state court in 2011 after years of allegations of deep flaws in the state's justice system.

He was sentenced to death in 2005 on charges that he shot a disabled nurse and former patient, joyce brannon, to keep her from testifying against him. He did not testify in his own defense during his trial. His lawyers said prosecutors told the jury his decision not to testify showed a lack of remorse for what he did.

( ap ) — a teenager fell from a stopped gondola ride at an upstate new york amusement park saturday night, tumbling into a crowd of park guests and employees gathered below in an effort to catch the victim before she hit the ground.; the warren county sheriff's office said late saturday the unidentified 14-year-old girl from greenwood, delaware, is at albany medical center in stable condition with no serious injuries. The accident happened on the \" sky ride \" at six flags amusement park, about 55 miles ( 88.51 kilometers ) north of albany, new york, just after 8 p.m. Saturday. The sheriff's office said in a statement that the girl was riding the attraction with a child relative, and fell about 25 feet from a stationary two-person car. The ride was stopped by an operator after word was received that there was a rider in distress, officials said. Authorities say the girl fell from the car and struck a tree before landing in the crowd. She was treated by park emergency medical staff and transferred by ambulance to glen falls hospital before being taken by helicopter to the medical center. Officials inspected the ride and said it was in proper working order. The park said in a statement that the safety of guests is a top priority. \" there does not appear to be any malfunction of the ride, but we have closed the attraction until a thorough review can be completed, \" a park official said. Authorities also said an unidentified 47-year-old man from schenectady, new york, who was a guest at the park, was treated and released from a hospital for a back injury sustained when he attempted to catch the falling girl. No additional information was immediately available.",

Romney boasted during the debate that his tax bill is \" entirely legal and fair, \" adding: \" i ' m proud of the fact that i pay a lot of taxes. \" newt gingrich, who supports a 15 % flat tax, quipped during the debate that he wants to bring americans'tax rate \" down \" to romney's. But romney pointed out that gingrich wants a 0 % tax on capital gains, and that under such a strategy, he would pay \" no taxes. \" romney has released nearly 550 pages of tax documents, including the 2010 returns for three family trusts and a foundation, after criticism from rivals for failure to bare his income earlier and following a sound trouncing in south carolina by gingrich.",

Unlike americans who rely on a paycheck, romney earns most of his income from investment profits, dividends and interest. The returns for 2010 and estimates for 2011 showed that he will pay a total of $ 6.2 million in taxes on income of $ 42.5 million. Romney and his wife ann paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent in 2010 and expect to pay a 15.4 percent effective tax rate when they file their returns for 2011. Those rates are far below the top income tax rate on wages, which is 35 percent, because the u.s. Tax code in recent years has favored investment income over wage income. Targeting popular unease with rising u.s. Income disparity, president barack obama on tuesday night in his annual state of the union speech at the capitol will put efforts to make the tax code fairer at the center of his reelection campaign. Obama will renew his appeal for a \"buffett rule \" to ensure that the ultra-wealthy pay their \"fair share \" of taxes. This idea is backed by multibillionaire warren buffett.

The company sent up the spy satellite for the national reconnaissance office aboard a falcon 9 rocket at 7: 15am from nasa's kennedy space center in florida, reports usa today. Nine minutes later, the rocket returned to cape canaveral. Details of the spy satellite's mission are classified, reports space.com, which adds that about the only thing known is that it will be in a low-earth orbit. The orlando sentinel sees monday's launch as a milestone because spacex has previously focused on cargo missions to the international space station or commercial telecom satellites. The launch of a government payload, then, marks the start of a new era of competition between spacex and united launch alliance, which had cornered the market on government launches in recent years.",
