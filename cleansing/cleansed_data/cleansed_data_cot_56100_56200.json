        "summary": "The state known as america's waiting room is moving up in the ranks: according to census data, florida has officially deposed new york to become the third most populous state in the union, reports the washington post. The sunshine state is now home to 19.9 million residents, compared to 19.7 million in the empire state, but it's the difference in growth that's notable: florida took in 293,000 new residents in the year ending july 1, or about 803 a day. New york managed just 51,000. Florida likely pushed past new york sometime in the spring, notes the ap, but it takes the census to make it official. Interestingly and unsurprisingly, former new yorkers make up about 10 % of new floridians. Other demographic nuggets, per the ap: don't look for florida to mess with texas, america's no. 2 state with 27 million people, or no. 1 california's 38.8 million souls. The rest of the 10 most populous states: illinois, pennsylvania, ohio, georgia, north carolina, and michigan. Six states lost population: alaska, connecticut, illinois, new mexico, vermont, and west virginia. North dakota was the fastest-growing state, with a 2.2 % jump that stood solidly on the shoulders of its energy boom. It's still the fourth least-populous state.",

            "Florida added an average of 803 new residents every day over the last year to become the nation's third-most populous state, the u.s. Census bureau said tuesday. At almost 19.9 million residents, florida has supplanted new york, which clocked in at 19.7 million residents. New york's growth has been much slower than that of the sunshine state: florida's population grew by 293,000 over the year, while new york's population expanded by just 51,000 residents. Overall, the census bureau's annual report showed the u.s. Population increased by three-quarters of a percent between july 1, 2013 and july 1, 2014, to 318.9 million residents. The report shows 44 states and the district of columbia added population over the last year. Six states — illinois, west virginia, connecticut, new mexico, alaska and vermont — lost population over that period. Puerto rico lost more of its population, 1.3 percent, or 47,000 residents, than any state. The fastest-growing states were mostly in the west and the south, with the exception of north dakota, where an energy boom is attracting new residents in droves. Of the nearly 2.4 million new u.s. Residents, 2 million moved to the south and west, while about 300,000 live in midwestern or northeastern states. North dakota grew by almost 2.2 percent over",
            "Orlando, fla. ( ap ) — it's official: florida has surpassed new york in population to become the third-most populous state in the union. Figures released tuesday by the u.s. Census bureau show that florida has at least 19.9 million residents. The number is likely higher because the census uses the population as of july 1 to create its estimate. New york had 19.7 million residents. Florida added almost 300,000 new residents from 2013 to 2014, or a little more than 800 new residents a day. By contrast, new york grew by only 51,000 over that time period. Florida likely reached the milestone sometime last spring, but it wasn't official until the census said so. An associated press analysis earlier this year showed that ex-new yorkers represented about 1 in 10 new florida residents. Migrants from other countries made up about a quarter of florida's new residents. Florida has a way to go before it catches up with california and texas, the largest and second-largest states. California has 38.8 million residents; texas has 27 million residents. The other states rounding out the 10 largest in the nation are: illinois, pennsylvania, ohio, georgia, north carolina and michigan. North carolina slipped by michigan for the ninth spot on the list.

His apparent plan was to address the nation during the evening news broadcast, but reuters credits a \" quick-thinking security guard \" with leading him into an empty studio instead. Video shows him pacing and complaining that \" this is taking too long \" before several officers enter the studio and arrest him without a struggle. While he was pacing, the man said, \" the things that are going to be said ( pause ) those are very large world affairs. We were hired by the security service. \" he also had a letter threatening the detonation of radioactive bombs if he didn't get on the air. A nos reporter said the man told him that he was from a \" hackers ' collective, \" without elaboration, reports ap. Though he didn't get on the air, the man did manage to disrupt the national news.

Both dogs are alive, averill notes, but the state report doesn't specify how high their lead levels were, or what symptoms they had. And indeed, it's challenging to diagnose dogs with lead toxicity, as symptoms such as \" mental dullness, \" arthritis, and lethargy can mimic those of other illnesses, averill says. Instead, he mentions keeping an eye on variations in a pet's routine to help pinpoint if something's wrong. He does note to cbs, however, that the \" vast majority \" of lead tests on area dogs have come back negative, and he says they're relying on local veterinarians with \" boots on the ground \" to look out for suspicious cases. In the meantime, while averill gives the ok to bathe pets in flint-area tap water, he says they should be drinking filtered or bottled water or, as a last resort, melted snow. \" it would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight flint water, \" he notes.

Gleeson, along with fellow researchers, published the most accurate map of earth's groundwater supply to date on monday in nature geoscience. The study found there is about 14.3 million cubic miles of groundwater left on earth. But that's not as encouraging as it sounds, according to reuters, because no more than 6 % of it is renewable within a human lifetime. \" that's never been known before, \" says gleeson, who adds that people are going to need to manage that resource better as water demands grow amid ongoing drought. \" groundwater can and should be thought of as a very useful buffer to climate extremes, \" he says. \" it's a valuable and strategic resource for mitigating the extreme impacts of climate. \" the amount of groundwater less than 50 years old is enough to cover every continent with approximately 10 feet of water, according to the study. But while that young groundwater is more quickly replenished, it's also more easily polluted by people and impacted by climate change, reuters reports. The rest of earth's groundwater — which can be millions of years old — is much deeper underground and can be extremely salty and contain harmful elements, according to the press release. The next step is to figure out how dire the situation is. \" since we now know how much groundwater is being depleted and how much there is, we will be able to estimate how long until we run out, \" gleeson says.

Ghonim said he felt uncomfortable after a group of people called out at his wife and he wanted to leave, reports the los angeles times. But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for vicki ghonim's death: then-19-year-old morrad ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from antigua last year, was on monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was leon martinez. Police got to martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the whittier daily news. A dna test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to martinez, who said ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of martinez's relayed meeting a man days before vicki's death who said he and his child's mother — a student at john glenn high, as vicki was — were having issues and planned to separate. In late january, the daily news painted a picture of a confident defense, given that in exchange for testifying, martinez will not serve life without parole for the murder, but instead 28 years to life. \" this is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates mr. Ghonim... And promised to send him to hell, \" said one of ghonim's lawyers, noting that ghonim's second wife talked to police. Ghonim could be handed life without parole at his dec. 19 sentencing.",

Now a research team says the alarming results are in: children living near the nuclear plant have thyroid cancer rates that are 20 to 50 times higher than those found in children elsewhere, the ap reports. Per a study being published in the november issue of epidemiology, of the 370,000 or so kids 18 and under in the fukushima region who received thyroid exams since the disaster, 137 of them have suspected or confirmed cases of thyroid cancer, a number that rose by 25 from last year, the ap notes. \" this is more than expected and emerging faster than expected, \" lead author toshihide tsuda tells the ap. Thyroid cancer cases in children outside the prefecture are estimated to be around one or two out of every million kids per year. Children's thyroids are particularly vulnerable to cancer — radioactive iodine released during nuclear meltdowns can cause it — because they're growing so quickly, npr notes. Tsuda and his team claim that the numbers aren't simply the result of a \" screening effect \" — in which more routine checkups like the ones in fukushima have simply found tumors earlier and more often — as the japanese government has suggested. Other experts, however, aren't so sure how accurate tsuda's study is and note the complexity of studying such an issue. The director for columbia university's center for radiological research, for example, tells npr that just tying certain geographic areas to higher cancer rates doesn't prove anything without looking at individual radiation exposure, a claim that's echoed in a report by the world health organization.

        "summary": "In medieval times, pilgrims flocked to england in quest of st. Anne's well, which was said to cure ailments and wash away sins. Archaeologists now say they've rediscovered that large sandstone well on a private farm near liverpool using only a 1983 photo and a description, reports the liverpool echo. When archaeologists arrived at the site, there was little evidence of the well at all as \" it had become completely filled with earth, \" says a rep for historic england. Once excavated, however, it was \" found to be in reasonable condition, \" per an archaeologist. Legend has it that the supposed mother of the virgin mary herself descended the medieval well's three steps and bathed in its 4-foot-deep pool, located near a priory of monks, reportedly giving the water the ability to cure eye and skin diseases, per seeker and sciencealert. But the well — believed to have healing properties into the 19th century — also features in a more ominous legend suggesting it's cursed. During a dispute over the well in the 16th century, the prior reportedly cursed the estate manager of a neighboring landowner, whom he believed had a hand in the monastery being seized by the king. The prior said a \" year and a day shall not pass ere st. Anne thy head shall bruise \" — then the prior himself collapsed and died, according to an 1877 newspaper recounting of the legend. The estate manager is said to have disappeared after a night of drinking, only to be found dead in the well with \" his head crushed in. \" sciencealert points out the discovery has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. ( these ancient greek tablets also told of a curse. )",

        "summary": "The man accused of detonating a bomb in a subway corridor near times square monday morning carried the device strapped to himself on a 55-minute subway ride from his brooklyn home, law enforcement officials say. Akayed ullah, who came to the us from bangladesh in 2011, injured himself and three others in the blast. Law enforcement officials tell the new york daily news that the 27-year-old, who says he was inspired by isis, decided to set off the bomb in a commuter-packed passageway connecting three stations after seeing a christmas poster. The pipe bomb was packed with explosive powder and detonated with a broken christmas light, authorities say, but the explosion was not powerful enough to turn the pipe into deadly shrapnel. After the blast, ullah was subdued by four port authority police officers. Ullah, who's expected to face numerous federal charges, was hospitalized with serious burns, while another three people received minor injuries. Law enforcement officials tell the new york times that ullah, who apparently worked for a car service after arriving in the us and more recently worked as an electrician, has told them he was radicalized online and found bomb-making instructions on the internet. Ullah came to the us on a preferential visa for people with relatives already in the us, and president trump says the attempted terrorist attack is another reason to tighten immigration rules, the washington post reports. \" today's terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security, \" he said monday.",

            "New york — a 27-year-old man detonated a crude pipe bomb strapped to his body inside a crowded manhattan subway passage monday morning, according to police — sending terrified commuters running for the exits and counterterrorism officials racing to unravel the second terrorist attack in the city in less than two months. Authorities identified the suspect as akayed ullah, an immigrant from bangladesh who came to the united states in 2011. The attack — which left the suspect wounded but otherwise caused only minor injuries to three commuters — immediately rekindled public debates about terrorism, public safety and immigration. The pipe bomb, affixed to ullah's clothes with velcro and zip ties, detonated about 7: 20 a.m. As he walked in an underground passageway from the subway station at 42nd street and eighth avenue to a nearby station at seventh avenue, police said. The attack brought monday's morning commute in crowded times square to a standstill as a massive police response locked down the area while authorities searched for other bombs. Ullah told investigators that he was inspired by propaganda from the islamic state terror group, according to law enforcement officials. The fbi and the new york police department were investigating, and charges in federal court were expected to be filed against ullah soon. Security video shows a man walking down the crowded tunnel, seemingly just another ­passerby until a giant puff of smoke knocks him to the ground. For a moment he is still and then starts to move his leg, clearly in pain. Ullah sustained burns and cuts to his hands and abdomen, authorities said",
            "On the surface, akayed ullah seemed to be an ordinary member of a bangladeshi enclave in brooklyn. He often prayed at a mosque in an unassuming brownstone in the kensington section of the borough, where a few thousand of his countrymen reside. Like many immigrants in new york, he made his living — at least for a while — driving for a car service. But on monday morning, mr. Ullah, 27, strapped a pipe bomb to his body and set out to detonate it in a times square subway station, the police said, not only causing chaos among crowds of commuters, but also leaving behind a trail of mystery that baffled those who knew him. \"he was a good guy, \" said mohammad yousuf, a cabdriver who prayed with mr. Ullah at the mosque. \"i can't believe he would do anything like this. \"",
            "Wires ran from the suspect's jacket to his pants with something on his body under his coat, sources said. He was reaching for a cell phone. The officers cuffed him and took the backpack and anything else that might be a threat."

Ullah told investigators that he was inspired by propaganda from the islamic state terror group, according to law enforcement officials. The fbi and the new york police department were investigating, and charges in federal court were expected to be filed against ullah soon. Security video shows a man walking down the crowded tunnel, seemingly just another ­passerby until a giant puff of smoke knocks him to the ground. For a moment he is still and then starts to move his leg, clearly in pain. Ullah sustained burns and cuts to his hands and abdomen, authorities said",
            "On the surface, akayed ullah seemed to be an ordinary member of a bangladeshi enclave in brooklyn. He often prayed at a mosque in an unassuming brownstone in the kensington section of the borough, where a few thousand of his countrymen reside. Like many immigrants in new york, he made his living — at least for a while — driving for a car service. But on monday morning, mr. Ullah, 27, strapped a pipe bomb to his body and set out to detonate it in a times square subway station, the police said, not only causing chaos among crowds of commuters, but also leaving behind a trail of mystery that baffled those who knew him. \"he was a good guy, \" said mohammad yousuf, a cabdriver who prayed with mr. Ullah at the mosque. \"i can't believe he would do anything like this. \"",
            "Wires ran from the suspect's jacket to his pants with something on his body under his coat, sources said. He was reaching for a cell phone. The officers cuffed him and took the backpack and anything else that might be a threat."

        "summary": "Verizon yesterday unveiled its new \" share everything \" plans, in which families will share one data allowance on a family plan rather than each member having his or her own data allowance on separate plans. Despite the fact that verizon is touting this as a money-saving opportunity for families, critics run the numbers and say it's actually not: dan rowinski of readwriteweb finds that one hypothetical family of four will likely pay exactly the same amount per month, or may save at most $ 10 per month. The problem? data may be cheaper under the new plans, but \" you pay more per device, \" he explains. \" verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change. \" troy wolverton goes a bit further in the mercury news, calling the new plans \" a crummy deal for many consumers. \" he finds that many users will actually end up paying more, since the only real price breaks are on talk minutes and text messages — \" services [ consumers ] are already using less. \" \" overall, the move appears to be a price hike tarted up to look consumer friendly, \" he writes. All the critics concede that the new plans are certainly simpler to understand, but on zdnet, matthew miller is \" disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price. \" if sprint gets its lte network running, it will be an \" attractive \" option for individual unlimited plans at $ 80 per phone, he notes. On cnet, roger cheng points out that verizon is now \" forcing \" unlimited voice and text messages with these plans. \" under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever, \" he writes. \" it's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do — all for a higher price. \" the new plans roll out on june 28, and the only way to keep your existing plan is to upgrade to new phones at full cost, with no discount.",

        "summary": "Abortion opponents in north dakota have one-upped their peers in arkansas. Less than two weeks after the latter state banned abortions after 12 weeks, north dakota lawmakers approved a ban after six weeks, reports the bismarck tribune. They also voted to outlaw abortions when a genetic defect is discovered — down syndrome, for example — or when parents don't like the sex of their fetus. Gov. Jack dalrymple hasn't said whether he will sign the measures, but proponents have enough votes to override even if he vetoes them, reports ap. Which means it's a safe bet that the state will soon have the strictest abortion laws in the nation. Lawmakers picked six weeks because that's when a heartbeat can be detected by transvaginal ultrasound, the intrusive procedure that set off controversy in virginia last year, reports the new york times. Arkansas picked 12 weeks because a heartbeat can be detected with an abdominal ultrasound at that point. Assuming the north dakota bills become law, expect legal challenges to follow. No other state, for example, has a law that outlaws abortions over a genetic defect. Of the 1,247 abortions performed in the state in 2011, 75 % would be illegal under the new legislation, according to a research group that backs abortion rights. That could well mean that the state's only abortion clinic, in fargo, would have to close its doors.",

        "summary": "A former prime minister of norway was caught up in the chaos at us airports this week, though it's not clear which president's actions caused the issue. Kjell magne bondevik, the country's pm from 1997 to 2000 and 2001 to 2005, flew from europe to dc's dulles airport tuesday to attend the national prayer breakfast — and was detained for an hour, the guardian reports. The problem? customs agents looked at his passport and saw he traveled to iran in 2014. He says officials told him he was being held because of a law then-president obama signed in 2015 that requires citizens of certain countries ( including norway ) to have a visa to enter the us if they've visited specific countries ( like iran ) since 2011. But there are exceptions ( abc 7 explains in greater depth ), and bondevik says he's never before experienced any trouble coming into the us with that passport stamp. Further, his office checked with the us embassy in oslo before this trip to ensure he would have no issues.

        "summary": "The little red hen restaurant in rural virginia found itself squarely in the middle of a big beltway brouhaha after sarah huckabee sanders was turned away on friday night, and now the owner gives the washington post the backstory. Stephanie wilkinson was home when her chef called around 8pm to say that sanders had walked in with a group, and wondered what to do. Wilkinson drove to the restaurant, confirmed that it was indeed sanders, and asked her staff, \" tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave. \" wilkinson notes that some of her employees are gay. \" they said ' yes. ' \" wilkinson says she asked sanders to step outside, and though \" i was babbling a little... I explained that the restaurant has certain standards... Such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation. \" asked to leave, sanders said, \" that's fine. I ' ll go. \" sanders ' group elected to clear out with her, and offered to pay for their entrees, which were being prepared; wilkinson opted not to charge the group. Usually, politics aren't on the menu at the red hen, wilkinson says. \" i ' m not a huge fan of confrontation. I have a business, and i want the business to thrive. This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals. \" that business was mired firmly in controversy saturday, with trolls of both flavors clogging the red hen's yelp page ( which now has two stars ), its reservation line, and even shouting from the sidewalk in lexington. The restaurant opted not to open saturday night, writing in an email that \" we would like to avoid exposing our patrons to any potential unpleasantness from outside entities. \"",

            "I've generally been of the view that the earlier that the republican primaries and caucuses begin, the better off mitt romney's campaign will be. This is a pretty straightforward case: mr. Romney is a well-prepared candidate and leads the field right now according to most polling and non-polling indicators. It isn't a very large lead, and as chuck todd notes, i'd be a little bit careful in anointing any candidate with the \"inevitability \" label when he's still polling at just 20 or 25 percent. But it's a lead nevertheless, and the sooner the voting begins, the less chance there will be for another candidate like gov. Rick perry to gain a firmer footing as his campaign gains experience. ( earlier voting dates have also made it much harder for additional candidates like new jersey gov. Chris christie to enter the race. ) mr. Romney's campaign evidently agrees with this thinking: it pushed for an earlier date for the nevada caucuses, according to reporting by the las vegas review-journal and the des moines register, which were recently moved to jan. 14 from feb. 18. But there is one potential wrench the works — which could cause the plan to blow up on mr. Romney and harm his chances of winning the nomination. That is if new hampshire were to move",

The doctor breached guidelines that limit surgeons from performing more than 30 sterilizations a day, said the official, who asked not to be named because details of the investigation are private. He also failed to disinfect the instruments before using them again, the official said. \"it's a case of negligence, \" raman singh, the state's chief minister, told reporters at a news conference today, adding that the doctor, r.k.

            "New delhi ( ap ) — eight indian women have died and 20 others were in critical condition tuesday after undergoing sterilization surgeries in a free government-run program to help slow the country's population growth. A total of 83 women, all poor villagers under the age of 32, had the operations saturday in a hospital outside bilaspur city in the central state of chhattisgarh, officials said. All 83 surgeries were conducted within six hours, said the state's chief medical officer, dr. S.k. Mandal. \" that is not usual, \" he said. He declined to comment further on what might have gone wrong until autopsies are conducted on the victims. Each of the women had received a payment of 600 rupees, or about $ 10, to participate in the sterilization program, mandal said. The women were sent home saturday evening after their surgeries, but more than two dozen were later rushed in ambulances to private hospitals after becoming ill. By tuesday, eight of the women had died — apparently from either blood poisoning or hemorrhagic shock, which occurs when a person has lost too much blood, state deputy health director amar singh told the press trust of india news agency. Twenty other women were in critical care, according to the district magistrate, siddharth komal pardeshi. \" their condition is very serious. Blood"

The house of bishops backed the changes 129-26 on tuesday. The church, which is the american member of the anglican communion, was seen as a trailblazer when it elected an openly gay bishop in 2003 and is now the third major protestant group to allow gay marriage in all congregations, after the united church of christ and the presbyterian church, which voted to redefine marriage earlier this year, the ap notes. It took a week of debate at the church's general convention to bring in the changes, which include ditching terms like \" wife \" and \" husband \" for gender-neutral language, the deseret news reports. The final product of the negotiations was a compromise that allows clergy to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies, which means that although such ceremonies may begin in some areas this fall, they are unlikely to be held in more conservative dioceses, episcopal priest george conger explains at the washington post. \" what the bishops did agree on was to hold conflicting stances in tension and allow each side to honor their consciences, \" he writes.",

Never mind that anyone on a normal chair would barely be able to see over the top – here was another small triumph of the new spanish revolution, the gathering of angry spaniards of all colours, ages and persuasions that is sweeping across the country and beyond its borders. The table that arrived in madrid's puerta del sol square was part of the swirl of creative chaos, naive enthusiasm and pent-up frustration that has transformed it into a makeshift camp for thousand of protesters who call themselves los indignados, the indignant ones. Tents and mattresses, armchairs and sofas, a canteen, portable toilets and solar panels have sprung up in a remarkable display of organisational prowess. And the mass of people jostling around, each pursuing their own dream or demand, or just watching others doing the same, seemed more like something transported from the arab spring in north africa than from europe. As the protests continued to swell on friday, with 60,000 people defying authorities to obey the campaign's \" take over the square! \" slogan in dozens of spanish cities, and with copycat demonstrations across europe, the question was whether this was the new may 1968 – a youth-led popular revolt",

The protesters are angry with the government's economic policies and the country's high youth unemployment rate. Spain's electoral commission had ordered those camped out in madrid to leave ahead of sunday's elections. But, as the ban came into effect at midnight, the crowds started cheering and police did not move in. The protest began six days ago in madrid's puerta del sol as a spontaneous sit-in by young spaniards frustrated at 45 % youth unemployment.

            "The arrival of the table, a battered piece of formica bashed on top of four rough, oversized legs, raised a cry of joy. Never mind that anyone on a normal chair would barely be able to see over the top – here was another small triumph of the new spanish revolution, the gathering of angry spaniards of all colours, ages and persuasions that is sweeping across the country and beyond its borders. The table that arrived in madrid's puerta del sol square was part of the swirl of creative chaos, naive enthusiasm and pent-up frustration that has transformed it into a makeshift camp for thousand of protesters who call themselves los indignados, the indignant ones. Tents and mattresses, armchairs and sofas, a canteen, portable toilets and solar panels have sprung up in a remarkable display of organisational prowess. And the mass of people jostling around, each pursuing their own dream or demand, or just watching others doing the same, seemed more like something transported from the arab spring in north africa than from europe. As the protests continued to swell on friday, with 60,000 people defying authorities to obey the campaign's \" take over the square! \" slogan in dozens of spanish cities, and with copycat demonstrations across europe, the question was whether this was the new may 1968 – a youth-led popular revolt",
            "Image caption young people are angry that, despite qualifications, there is no work thousands of people have taken part in protests across spain's main cities, defying a government ban on political protest ahead of local elections. In madrid, some 25,000 protesters occupied a main square. Others gathered in barcelona, valencia and seville. The protesters are angry with the government's economic policies and the country's high youth unemployment rate. Spain's electoral commission had ordered those camped out in madrid to leave ahead of sunday's elections. But, as the ban came into effect at midnight, the crowds started cheering and police did not move in. The protest began six days ago in madrid's puerta del sol as a spontaneous sit-in by young spaniards frustrated at 45 % youth unemployment. The crowd camping out in the square overnight grew and the protest has spread to other cities across the country.

        "summary": "Donald trump was pretty pleased with his performance against hillary clinton at monday's debate, even though scientific polls — not the easily manipulated online polls that trump is citing — show most americans pick clinton as the clear victor. Even some of his own campaign advisers don't feel he was on point enough during the head-to-head, though they're framing it as \" missed opportunities \" rather than total failure. And so the strategy for oct. 9's debate is reportedly getting an overhaul, with more role-playing practice, facts study, and even rehearsing how to move around the stage for the town-hall-style event, per the new york times. What these advisers, who spoke anonymously to the paper, are worried about, however, is whether trump will agree to this prep. Complicating things: some say he actually was drilled on how to combat clinton on certain issues and that he just chose not to. Others point the finger at trump's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people ( up to a dozen, some with not much political acumen ) giving him conflicting suggestions. Sources say his debate training was \" unconventional, \" with trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates. Trump himself told fox news he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against clinton on the debate stage, such as the subject of benghazi. Trump's pulling back — he stopped attacking clinton and even grew \" subdued \" as the debate proceeded — has got to change the next time around, frustrated aides say. Instead, he has to set clinton's vulnerabilities in his sights and stick to his plan for the whole night. \" it clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes [ in the new york debate ], and that came through loud and clear, \" a senior political strategist tells the times.",

        "summary": "If you like bananas, it's time to start savoring them while you still can. A deadly fungus that's been killing the plant since the 1960s has jumped continents, moving from where it ravaged crops for decades in southeast asia to parts of south asia, australia, the middle east, and africa — and that's just since 2013, reports quartz. The so-called \" panama \" disease is spreading thanks to a single clone of the fusarium fungus, also called tropical race 4, scientists report in the journal plos pathogens. Worse still, one of the world's most popular bananas, the cavendish, is particularly susceptible to this strain. The soil-borne fungus travels up the plant's roots, ultimately killing the plant and infesting entire banana plots, which are then contaminated for years. Entire swaths of banana plantations in australia, china, the philippines, jordan, mozambique, pakistan, and beyond have been infested in the past two years, putting many farmers and families out of business and cutting them off from a major food source, reports physorg. Right now the only way to fight the disease is through strict quarantine, so researchers are trying to spread the word about effective measures in the hopes of getting a step ahead of the fast-spreading fungus before it hits latin america, where most of the world's bananas are grown. Once it lands there, notes quartz, \" the days of the iconic yellow fruit are numbered. \" ( some researchers hope it's possible to genetically modify bananas to resist the fungus. )",

        "summary": "After months of painstaking work in the sands of california, archaeologists have managed to restore a sphinx and other relics from a lost age — 1920s hollywood. The sphinx, one of 21 used in cecil b. Demille's 1923 movie the ten commandments, has been restored after it was excavated from california's guadalupe-nipomo dunes. Demille left an enormous set buried there, but what the san luis obispo tribune calls the \" lost city of demille \" started to be uncovered as sands shifted in the 1990s. The relic goes on display at a nearby cultural center today, and livescience notes that in humid conditions, working with the plaster sphinx archaeologists call nora wasn't easy and she's not quite as good as new: there's a bullet hole in her stomach, as well as graffiti reading \" may 1930, \" and her head — along with the rest of her top half — is still in the sands. Guadalupe-nipomo dunes center executive director doug jenzen tells the tribune that after the first sphinx they tried to remove crumbled, they spotted what looked like a \" giant white buffalo wing \" sticking out of the sand and found nora. He notes that other artifacts on display, including tobacco tins and \" cough syrup \" bottles that probably held bootleg liquor, show that a lot of people had a \" pretty good time \" making the silent film. Also on display: a blackened piece of toast from the film camp. \" it's definitely not edible anymore, \" jenzen says. The 10.5-foot-long sphinx body, the toast, and a sphinx head found during a previous excavation will be unveiled at a 1920s-themed party tonight, reports the lompoc record.

Plaza had a cup in her hand ( which she dropped en route back to her seat ) and had the name of her upcoming film, the to do list, written on her chest; many speculated on twitter and elsewhere that she was drunk at the time. Producers later asked her to leave. Even so, vulture seems skeptical. \" if it wasn't planned, why the heck was she sitting in the front row? \" writes jesse david fox. \" a bit too convenient for something that wasn't rehearsed or planned, no? \" and jezebel notes that it was also \" the most exciting thing that happened \" during the show.

        "summary": "Many roman catholics saw journalist james foley — who was kidnapped, tortured, and beheaded by isis — as a symbol of enduring faith under horrible circumstances. Then it came out that he had converted to islam in captivity. Now what? \" the answer is we can't assess it, \" says a jesuit preist who calls foley \" a good and holy man \" but casts doubt on his conversion. \" we cannot look at what is in someone's soul. \" foley's story is further complicated by his own apparent confusion, the new york times reports. First kidnapped in libya in 2011, foley says he prayed with muslim cellmates who opposed the gadhafi government. After washing himself, he was told he had converted. \" so, from then on out, i prayed with them five times a day, \" he says in a youtube video. \" but it was difficult. I was thinking, ' jesus, am i praying to allah? am i violating my belief in you? ' \" he adds. \" i don't have an answer to that. I just know that i was authentically with them, and i was authentically praying to jesus. \" kidnapped again in syria in 2012, he converted to islam in captivity and appeared sincere about it, freed hostages say. But people are debating whether foley, once an altar boy in a catholic family, converted for himself or his captors ( as this getreligion article attests ). \" i believe, much like in libya, jim ' converted ' for the purpose of surviving, \" says one of his brothers. Pope francis has apparently called foley a martyr and says other christian martyrs are being \" tortured, massacred \" today, ansa reports. Yet foley's mother, a eucharistic minister, seems unsure: \" only god and jim know what was going on in his heart, \" she says.",

Start with this: all life on the planet weighs about 550 gigatons, notes science. The new study breaks down that figure, including these highlights: plants account for an astounding 82 % of the planet's biomass bacteria make up 13 % — leaving just 5 % for everything else beyond plants and bacteria fungi ( think yeast, mold, and mushrooms ) make up 2 % ocean life makes up a surprisingly small 1 % chicken and other poultry make up 70 % of all birds on the planet; only 30 % are wild livestock ( mostly cows and pigs ) make up 60 % of all mammals; humans account for 36 % of mammals, leaving only 4 % as wild \" the fact that the biomass of fungi exceeds that of all animals sort of puts us in our place, \" says harvard biology professor james hanken, who wasn't part of the study, per a release at phys.org.",

The bearded, banjo-playing protest singer gained fame with the weavers in the ' 40s and is best known for popularizing songs like this land is your land and we shall overcome, as well as writing or co-writing folk classics like if i had a hammer and turn, turn, turn, the bbc reports. He spearheaded the american folk revival of the ' 50s and ' 60s and was an inspiration and mentor to many younger singers including bob dylan and joan baez. But activism was as important to seeger as music. A lifelong believer in causes like civil rights, racial equality, and anti-militarism, he saw folk music and community as \" inseparable, and where he saw a community, he saw the possibility of political action, \" a new york times obituary notes. Blacklisted in the mccarthyite ' 50s, his activism continued until the very end. At a 90th birthday tribute concert — a benefit to clean up new york's hudson river — bruce springsteen introduced him, saying, \" he's gonna look a lot like your granddad that wears flannel shirts and funny hats. He's gonna look like your granddad if your granddad can kick your ass. At 90, he remains a stealth dagger through the heart of our country's illusions about itself, \" usa today reports.",

Per tmz, the songs in question are the ones michael jackson once held the rights to; his estate sold the rights to sony last year for $ 750 million. Mccartney has been trying to get sony to transfer the rights to him by 2018; as abc news explains, he's been notifying sony and the prior rights holders of his intention to reclaim the rights since 2008. A mccartney rep explains, per rolling stone, that the suit is attempting \" to confirm his ownership \" of the songs \" which are granted to him by us copyright law. \" as rolling stone and variety explain, the us copyright act says that for works in which creators transferred their interests before 1978, rights can be reclaimed by the creators 56 years after the original copyright date as long as termination notices are served to the current rights holder; next year will mark 56 years since mccartney started writing songs with john lennon, and his suit notes that at the time the songs in question were created, he and lennon typically transferred their rights to publishers in exchange for royalties. The hollywood reporter, which says the case \" could become one of the most important legal battles in the music industry this decade, \" has more detail on the ins and outs of the law.",

The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former christie aide bridget anne kelly and former port authority executive bill baroni. During the trial, a man christie appointed to port authority testified that both he and baroni told christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony ( the lanes were closed from sept. 9 to sept. 13, 2013 ).

Law enforcement sources told the los angeles times that jace confessed to fatally shooting his wife, april, multiple times around 8: 30 p.m. Monday at their home in the 5400 block of brynhurst avenue. April jace, a well-liked financial aid employee at biola university, had walked in the door just 10 to 15 minutes earlier after picking up the couple's sons from baseball practice. Los angeles police said in a statement that the motive for the shooting \" is believed to be domestic violence \" — an accusation levied against michael jace nearly two decades ago when he divorced his previous wife, jennifer bitterman.

            "Allegations by los angeles police that \" shield \" actor michael jace shot his wife to death at their hyde park home monday night shocked longtime neighbors who described the couple as loving and friendly, but it isn't the first time he's faced accusations of domestic violence. Law enforcement sources told the los angeles times that jace confessed to fatally shooting his wife, april, multiple times around 8: 30 p.m. Monday at their home in the 5400 block of brynhurst avenue. April jace, a well-liked financial aid employee at biola university, had walked in the door just 10 to 15 minutes earlier after picking up the couple's sons from baseball practice. Los angeles police said in a statement that the motive for the shooting \" is believed to be domestic violence \" — an accusation levied against michael jace nearly two decades ago when he divorced his previous wife, jennifer bitterman.

        "summary": "The supreme court heard arguments on california's prop 8 yesterday; today, the federal defense of marriage act is on the docket. What to expect: what is today's case about? doma defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman, meaning that gay couples who legally wed in states that allow gay marriage are denied federal benefits. The high court must decide if the federal government can constitutionally do that. The specific case being considered involves edith windsor, 83, who married partner thea spyer in 2007. When spyer died, windsor was hit with a $ 363,000 estate tax bill because their marriage wasn't recognized. She's suing for a refund. Will windsor be there? she is expected to be, but her health is declining, usa today reports. How many people are affected? there are about 133,000 married gay couples not currently recognized by the feds, reuters reports. The washington post points out that while yesterday's case involved people not yet married, today's involves people who are. What are the tax implications? if the supreme court strikes down doma, taxes for some same-sex couples might actually go up, politico reports. The so-called \" marriage penalty \" means that when couples whose incomes are similar file a joint tax return, they don't get as many tax breaks as they would have had they filed separately. That \" penalty \" could end up applying to gay couples who currently skirt it. How will yesterday's session affect today's? it may not. Yesterday's case could potentially involve a much broader ruling; the court could theoretically strike down prop 8 and also extend gay marriage rights to all states. But the justices seemed wary of doing that. So, reuters notes, that case may have little bearing on today's, since doma is a much narrower question. And, as npr reports, it's also \" a much clearer question, \" and the themes that come up today aren't likely to be similar to yesterday's. The only two expected outcomes: is doma constitutional or not? when is a decision expected? late june. A ruling on the prop 8 case is expected at the same time. Is there a possibility there won't be a decision? yes. The obama administration refuses to defend doma in court, so house republican leaders are defending it. The court could decide that those members have not suffered an injury that would allow them to bring the case, and could thus decide not to rule on it.",

Astronomers believe it is possible the asteroid's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart. They do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once. Scientists using the pan-starrs survey telescope in hawaii announced their discovery of the asteroid aug. 27. P/2013 p5 appeared"

        "summary": "After her 16-year-old son failed to make the varsity soccer team, a disappointed mother went a step or two further than most parents might. She filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that the teen is a victim of age and gender discrimination, fox 2 reports. The family says the rules at missouri's ladue high school state that if a junior doesn't make it onto the varsity team, he can't play again on the junior varsity team; that way, students in lower grades can use the jv team to develop the skills they need to try out for varsity. The family wants the boy placed on the jv team, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. They first appealed the coach's decision to district administrators and the superintendent, both of whom sided with the coach; they then complained to the department of education's office of civil rights, but ultimately sued because the office had no power to force the school to place the boy on a team. The boy reportedly wanted to take the case to federal court. The family's lawsuit claims that the girls'soccer team does allow juniors to play on jv, which is where the sex discrimination comes in. \" there are many schools across the country that have this policy that you either make varsity as a junior or you're out of the program, \" says the boy's stepfather, who is also one of the lawyers handling the case. \" if someone said ' cut all the blacks,'that would be illegal. And it's illegal for age too. \" he adds that per stats and rankings, the boy should have made varsity. But the coach testified in court that the only reason he said positive things about the boy's skills was to build up his self-esteem rather than making him feel worse after he had already failed to make the team, and he also testified that the school doesn't actually have a policy preventing juniors from playing on jv teams. He said it depends how many spots there are on the team and how many kids want to play. The judge is set to decide monday.",

District judge john ross denied a request by a parent in the ladue school district for a temporary restraining order that would allow their child to play soccer on the high school junior varsity team. St. Louis, mo — the mother of a ladue high school student took her case to the federal courthouse after her son, called john doe in legal documents, did not make the varsity soccer team and was not allowed to play on the j.v. Team. The woman's attorney said the issue is age and sex discrimination. Friday morning ladue school officials said if a junior does not make the varsity team, the boy cannot play again on the junior varsity team. The school said this is to allow lower grade students a chance to develop their skills so that they will be prepared to try out for varsity. The mother of a ladue junior who did not make the varsity cut does not think that's fair. She believes her son, who already played on the j.v soccer team, is good enough to play again on the same team. The coach sent the family an email that said their son was on the bubble when it came to picking varsity team members. He wrote the boy has holes in his technical ability and game decision making. The family appealed the coach's ruling to the superintendent who decided the family's complaint was unsubstantiated. The mother's suit claims her son is the victim of age and gender discrimination because she says the rules are different for the girls'soccer team. In the courtroom testimony from the coach indicated the seven juniors cut from the varsity team were not good enough to play with on the j.v. Team. He said the reason he said nice things about john doe was to build his self-esteem and not punch him in the gut after being cut from the varsity team. The lawyer for john doe also introduced documents that he said show players performance ratings given by coaches show that john doe is better than some of the boys who made varsity. Also in courtroom testimony, it was revealed that ladue does not have a policy keeping juniors from playing j.v. Sports. It depends on how many kids go out for a certain sport and how many spots are on the team.",

        "summary": "Greece's top court has declared that sunday's referendum on a bailout is constitutional, meaning the vote with huge implications for all of europe will proceed. The latest polls show a dead heat, reports ap, as leaders on both sides try to rally support — especially prime minister alexis tsipras, whose political life may be at stake. \"i ask you to say no to ultimatums, blackmail, and fear-mongering, \" he said in a tv address. \"no to divisions, no to those who want to spread panic. \" he sought to downplay the notion that a \" no \" vote could lead to greece leaving the euro zone. Instead, he said, the referendum is about giving him more leverage to get a better deal from creditors. It's the only way greece can \" live with dignity in europe, \" he said, per the bbc. The washington post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote, but a story in the new york times casts it in more personal terms. It's largely become a referendum on tsipras himself, and the story suggests that's why european leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to greek banks this week. The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. \"i don't see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence, \" says a us economist. \"when you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people. \" tsipras initially said he would step down if the \" yes \" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position.",

Per usa today, the lead plaintiff, larimer county sheriff justin smith, calls the case a \" constitutional showdown \" and says he doesn't know whether to enforce his own state's mandate or the us constitution ( pot's still not legal on a federal level ). \" [ they're ] asking every peace officer to violate their oath, \" smith says, per usa today. \" what we're being forced to do … makes me ineligible for office. \" meanwhile, sheriffs in kansas and nebraska who've joined the suit complain that tokers driving back from colorado are running up overtime bills as police have to handle a significant increase in drug arrests. This isn't the first group to take legal measures against the state. The attorneys general in nebraska and oklahoma filed a lawsuit against colorado last year, saying the free flow of pot across state lines is hurting communities. \" left unchallenged, i am confident colorado's law will cause long-term harm to nebraska families, \" that state's ag, doug peterson, wrote in an open letter, as per the la times. And two lawsuits filed last month by an anti-drug group express similar complaints and add racketeering charges into the mix, the huffington post noted in february. Larimer county's sheriff says the doj's mostly hands-off policy in dealing with the new rules amounts to showing folks \" how to violate federal law but not get prosecuted, \" usa today notes.

The crime, which brought strong condemnations from the obama administration and european officials, threatened to throw the conflict between israelis and palestinians beyond the control of leaders who were calculating how to respond to the last outrage without further escalating tensions on the ground. But in the space of a few hours, the mood shifted from communal grief over the deaths of the young israelis to fears of ascending communal violence. The abduction followed a night of mayhem by jewish extremists, about 200 of whom marched through jerusalem chanting \"death to the arabs \" and assaulting arab israelis found on the streets. A few hours later, shortly before 4 a.m., muhammad hussein abu khdeir, 16, was forced into a car by two men",

The blueprint also would cut business tax rates down to no more than 15 %, as well as levy a one-time 10 % tax on overseas profits, which trump's campaign thinks will encourage corporations to bring money back home, the wall street journal notes. Trump says the tax benefits would be funded by reducing or ending \" redundant \" deductions and loopholes ( mostly for the wealthiest, but also in certain cases for middle-class filers ), as well as from newly reaped tax revenue from a healthier economy, the ap notes. \" my plan will bring sanity, common sense, and simplification to our country's catastrophic tax code, \" trump said in an interview with the journal. \" it will create jobs and incentives of all kinds while simultaneously growing the economy. \" ( read further details about the plan here. )",

David blankenhorn, who wrote the future of marriage and argued for california's proposition 8 as an expert witness, revealed his new opinion in the times yesterday: \" whatever one's definition of marriage, legally recognizing gay and lesbian couples and their children is a victory for basic fairness, \" he wrote. He also hopes that by embracing gay marriage, he can \" help build new coalitions bringing together gays who want to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same. \" reaction is, of course, mixed: \" he has thrown marriage under the bus for the sake of the homosexual movement, \" said peter sprigg, a senior fellow at the family research council. Sprigg blamed blankenhorn's position on a desire not to be seen as anti-gay. \" blankenhorn's current position closely parallels my own, \" writes reihan salam in the national review.

The plant combines a vine growing cherry tomatoes with roots growing white potatoes — but it's not genetically engineered. Rather, it's created by grafting, in which the tomatoes are \" spliced onto potato rootstock, \" the oregonian explains, noting the process works well for tomatoes and potatoes because they are closely related. Technically, you could try to do it at home, but it requires the plant stems you're joining be the same thickness. Supernaturals grafted vegetables is the company handling the grafting process in the us, and home gardeners can purchase the non-gmo plant in a 2.5-inch pot from the territorial seed company. \" people have been grafting tomatoes and potatoes for a while, but mostly as a novelty, \" territorial's marketing director tells opb, noting that before this plant was commercialized, it was necessary to research varieties to find ones that \" complement each other well. \" now, purchasers can expect to harvest some 500 red cherry tomatoes and 4.5 pounds of potatoes from each plant. Back in 2013 when the plant was only available in the uk, stephen colbert featured it on his \" the craziest f#?ing thing i've ever heard \" segment, calling it \" unnatural \" and noting, \" the only time tomatoes and potatoes should meet is at the bottom of a styrofoam clamshell. \" ( read about a tree that grows 40 different fruits. )",

Speaking to the columbus dispatch editorial board ( in all-important ohio ), romney sought to convey the notion that sick people wouldn't be left high and dry with the repeal of obamacare. His quote: \"we don't have a setting across this country where if you don't have insurance, we just say to you, 'tough luck, you're going to die when you have your heart attack. No, you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it's paid for, either by charity, the government, or by the hospital. We don't have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don't have insurance. \" it's that last part getting the most attention: white house: if romney understood middle-class struggles, \" he wouldn't claim that no one in this country dies because they don't have health insurance when, in fact, experts estimate that 26,000 people die prematurely every year because they don't have coverage. \" see the hill for more on that. Thinkprogress: emergency rooms don't cut it as a last resort. \" hospitals may treat patients for emergency medical conditions regardless of legal status or ability to pay, but patients with chronic conditions that don't require emergency interference are often unable to access needed care, \" writes rebecca leber. She cites a study putting the yearly death toll as a result at 45,000.

        "summary": "A canadian woman looking for her missing daughter since she went missing as a toddler almost 40 years ago received a facebook message in early august that may change her life, the ottawa citizen reports. The private message sent to liliane cyr, who maintains a facebook page dedicated to finding her daughter yohanna, who disappeared from their montreal apartment in 1978, was from a us woman who started off asking a very specific question about a birthmark on yohanna's finger, followed by this: \" i ' m not 100 % sure, but i think i might be your daughter. \" the woman told cyr that the discovery that her birth certificate was a fake, an odd lack of early childhood photos, and fuzzy memories of a plane ride led her to suspect something was amiss in her past. The montreal gazette tells the story of what happened the week yohanna disappeared, with 20-year-old cyr leaving 18-month-old yohanna in the care of aaron lewis guay, her us boyfriend at the time, while she was out of town for work. Guay met up with cyr a few days later without the baby, first telling cyr his mom was watching yohanna, then saying the toddler had drowned in the tub and he'd buried her. Guay was charged with kidnapping, but he denied his original story and a judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence to go on with the case; he was released and disappeared. Cyr says she's trying not to get her hopes up, but she notes that photos of the woman resemble yohanna. Dna tests are in the works.

Irving police seized the project as part of their investigation into whether ahemd had tried to use it as a fake bomb to intimidate others. \" the follow-up investigation revealed the device apparently was a homemade experiment, and there is no evidence to support the perception he intended to create alarm, \" irving police said in a statement on sept. 16. \" no charges will be filed and the case is considered closed. \" though police had closed their case, conversation was just beginning about whether the arrest was a sign of local bias against muslims. The mohamed family received an outpouring of support — including from president obama and mark zuckerberg — as well as intense criticism. On wednesday, representatives for the family announced that the high school freshman and his siblings were no longer enrolled in the irving school district — citing \" religious persecution \" — and would instead be homeschooled."

        "summary": "The christmas miracle that wasn't. Last year on christmas day, lottery dispensers at convenience stores and gas stations across south carolina started doing something remarkable. For two hours they spewed out winning tickets of up to $ 500 like candy. Lottery officials quickly figured out the problem, and cashiers began seeing the message, \"transaction not allowed, \" when customers went to collect their prizes, reports the washington post. But before the bonanza was over, 71,000 of the $ 1 holiday cash add-a-play tickets had been dispensed, with the errant prize money totaling about $ 35 million. So, what happens to all the winning tickets that were rejected? they are worth exactly $ 1, the state lottery board announced on wednesday. The winners will not get their prize money, but they can get a refund. After a five-month investigation, lottery officials found the problem was caused by coding errors, reports npr. The officials say intralot, a greece-based ticket vendor, did not run proper testing procedures before releasing the game. \" while [ the state lottery ] is mindful of the magnitude of this decision on its players, any other decision would not comply with the law, \" officials said, per the new york times. Players holding winning tickets are not happy. Nicole coggins, who thought she had won $ 18,000, has filed a class-action lawsuit against the lottery commission and the vendor, one of two lawsuits that have been filed, according to the post. \"we think it's a breach of contract if the commission decided to deny them their rightful winnings, \" her lawyer says. \" it's not fair, \" coggins tells the times. \" it's not right. \"",

Manafort's health concerning confinement, \" his lawyer, kevin downing, told the judge, asking that the sentencing be sped up so manafort, if kept in prison, could be moved to a facility better able to manage his maladies.

Judge ts ellis had earlier struck down the manafort legal team's request that their client be permitted to wear a regular suit to friday's hearing, with ellis noting \" defendants who are in custody post-conviction are, as a matter of course, not entitled to appear for sentencing or any other hearing in street clothing, \" per nbc. Ellis gave manafort a sentencing date of feb. 8, where he ' ll hear his fate on eight counts of tax evasion and bank fraud. The judge also dismissed 10 additional charges on which the jury deadlocked during the trial, though cnn notes if manafort doesn't keep cooperating with robert mueller's investigation, those charges could be reinstated.

In addition to manafort, mueller's team has kept interviewing witnesses, gathered a grand jury weekly to meet in washington on most fridays, and kicked up other still-secret court action. Plus, the discussions between the president's legal team and the special counsel's office have intensified in recent weeks, including after the special counsel sent questions about possible collusion between the trump campaign and russian government.

        "summary": "Environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt says he needs to fly first-class because of a toxic environment — the political one. He says he wasn't involved in the decision to put him in first class when he travels, which he says was made after some unpleasant interactions with travelers opposed to administration policies. \" we live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment, \" he tells the new hampshire union leader. He says his security team and the administration \" place me on the plane where they think [ it's ] best from a safety perspective. \" he was speaking days after the washington post reported that pruitt, whose predecessors mostly flew coach, has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in first-class and military jet travel costs, including $ 90,000 during a busy stretch in early june. Pruitt's government-funded travel is being reviewed by the epa's internal watchdog, which says the results of its investigation should be released by the summer, the ap reports. Earlier this week, epa spokesman jahan wilcox claimed pruitt had a \" blanket waiver \" allowing him to choose first class whenever he travels, but he retracted the statement after politico pointed out that federal rules require a waiver for every taxpayer-funded first-class trip when it's for security reasons. Wilcox, whose earlier statement was criticized by both democrats and republicans, now says pruitt \" submits a waiver to fly in either first or business class \" for every trip he makes. ( pruitt is the first epa chief to be accompanied by a 24-hour security detail. )",

They take libido enhancers when they get older. And, if a partner their own age isn't doing it for them, they consider trading them in for a younger, prettier tiger. Bbc news reports india's alipore zoo is having a difficult time getting its 10-year-old white tiger vishal to mate. The zoo has tried vitamins and even de-worming him; nothing seems to be working. Experts are blaming the fact that vishal was born in captivity, meaning he doesn't have much experience with females and might not understand the biological signals his body is sending, according to the times of india. Plus, vishal is at the outer limits of breeding age for tigers. This is apparently frustrating to rupa, a female white tiger the zoo has assigned to breed with vishal. While in heat, rupa will chase, touch, and scratch vishal, but he \" runs away with his tail between his legs, \" a veterinary consultant tells the times. Zoo staff have been trying to mate the two tigers for six months, and it's important they succeed because the zoo's tiger population is getting older and hasn't had a birth in more than a decade. Now, staff are considering trying vishal out with a much younger bengal tiger named rani, who is described as having \" a very beautiful face, \" the bbc reports. Ouch, rupa.",

Vishal, the 10-year-old white tiger, has so far spurned the advances of tigress rupa, living in the adjoining enclosure, an official told the bbc. Libido enhancers have also failed to spur him into action, he said. Experts blame his \" shyness \" on the fact that vishal has been bred in captivity. \" for the past six months we've been trying to mate vishal, \" dayanarayan banerjee, who retired as the senior veterinary officer at the zoo and is now working as a veterinary consultant there, told the bbc. \" we have de-wormed him to improve his overall health. We have given him libido enhancers, including vitamin d, a and e. But he is shy and no libido has been noticed in him, \" he said. Mr banerjee says this is the first time an attempt has been made to mate vishal - the only male in the breeding age in the zoo - but perhaps he is a bit too old to mate. \" the most suitable age for a tiger to mate is when he is five-six years old.

Vishal, the 10-year-old white tiger, has so far spurned the advances of tigress rupa, living in the adjoining enclosure, an official told the bbc. Libido enhancers have also failed to spur him into action, he said. Experts blame his \" shyness \" on the fact that vishal has been bred in captivity. \" for the past six months we've been trying to mate vishal, \" dayanarayan banerjee, who retired as the senior veterinary officer at the zoo and is now working as a veterinary consultant there, told the bbc. \" we have de-wormed him to improve his overall health. We have given him libido enhancers, including vitamin d, a and e. But he is shy and no libido has been noticed in him, \" he said. Mr banerjee says this is the first time an attempt has been made to mate vishal - the only male in the breeding age in the zoo - but perhaps he is a bit too old to mate. \" the most suitable age for a tiger to mate is when he is five-six years old. Seven-eight-year-olds",

Kerry and obama have suggested that the us won't wait that long, in part because the un inspectors are charged only with determining whether chemical weapons were used, not who employed them. The us says it already is sure that bashar al-assad is the culprit. Putin, though, told reporters that it would have been foolish for assad to order the aug. 21 attack because his troops have the upper hand in the war. \" in these conditions, to give a trump card to those who are calling for a military intervention is utter nonsense. \"",

The official fed statement on the matter was predictably vague, but yellen wasn't: \"you know, this is the kind of term it's hard to define, but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing. \" the markets interpreted that to mean interest rates would go up sooner than expected and immediately tanked. \" a more experienced central-bank head would have obfuscated and said something vague, \" writes john cassidy at the new yorker. He calls yellen's debut \" awkward, \" but notes that ben bernanke and alan greenspan got similarly tripped up in their early days. Yellen wasn't trying to change policy, and investors drew a \" remarkably dumb conclusion \" in thinking otherwise, writes clive crook at bloomberg. Still, yellen needs to be careful in what she says. \" investors always want more information, but they're not always good at sifting useful information from noise, \" he writes. \" the fed could help them by recognizing that sometimes less is more. \" adds peter coy at businessweek, referring to the fed's rate-setting committee: \" it's a fair bet that other fomc members will be suggesting to yellen that she stick closer to the script next time she addresses reporters. \"",

        "summary": "A tip from the nypd: \" don't put your cellphone under a pillow when sleeping or when charging your device \" — unless you want to set your head on fire. Deputy inspector wilson aramboles of the nypd's 33rd precinct shared that message on twitter on monday alongside photos of a charred phone, battery, and pillow. It isn't clear if the photos are tied to a recent accident or an old one; gothamist reports they might be from a 2014 incident in which a texas teen's samsung galaxy s4 started a fire under her pillow. Either way, they \" really do drive home the point, \" notes the san francisco chronicle. Cell phones need room to breathe, especially as they heat up while charging. While keeping a hot phone away from flammable materials like a pillow might seem like a no-brainer, some people choose to sleep with their phones nearby and rely on features like vibrating alarms. \" it is recommended that you leave these types of devices on a hard surface so the heat can dissipate. The batteries heat up, they could melt — in some cases, explode — and cause a fire, \" a fire chief told nbc connecticut last may after a teen's phone set fire to his bed. ( an exploding cell phone actually killed a man in china. )",

Manafort's lawyer says his client never received the payments and any suspicions are \" probably heavily politically tinged. \" in other coverage: the hill reports that there doesn't appear to be any love lost between manafort and former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski: lewandowski, who was fired after clashing with manafort, tweeted a link to the nyt ukraine story minutes after it first appeared. The ap reports that trump plans to deliver a major foreign policy speech in ohio monday that will focus on \" realism, \" with policies including destroying isis without engaging in \" nation-building \" — and on new ideological tests for people seeking to enter the us.
