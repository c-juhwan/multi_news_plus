Bimla nayyar never recovered and died two months after the 2012 procedure, reports the detroit news. Now a jury has awarded her family $ 21 million over what its attorney calls \" the most shocking abuse i have ever seen. \" oakwood hospital plans to appeal, saying, \" we're very concerned about how the details of this case have been portrayed, \" but it did not elaborate because the case is still in the courts. Nayyar's family maintains that hospital workers mixed up her ct scan with one from another patient who actually did need brain surgery. Attorney geoffey fieger says doctors removed the right side of her skull, and \" poked around in her brain before realizing they had the wrong patient. \" the family also accuses the hospital of trying to cover up the mistake. The size of the award is remarkable given the patient's age, suggesting that the family made a strong case, an attorney not involved tells the detroit free press.",

All the chatter is making investors nervous that regulations of some sort might come about, reports the wall street journal. \"he's wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after amazon with antitrust or competition law, \" one source tells axios. Taxes seem to be trump's big issue, and cnbc digs into the issue. Amazon now collects sales tax from customers in every state that has such a tax on products it sells directly, but the president may be referring to goods sold by third-party sellers. Generally, no taxes are collected on those, an issue that might be straightened out in the supreme court this year. As for the usps, amazon gets the same deal as other bulk sellers, writes chris isidore at cnn, and one of the sources quoted by axios says aides have explained to the president \" that the post office actually makes a ton of money from amazon. \" still, rhett jones of gizmodo suggests that the idea the usps is \" essentially subsidizing \" amazon's shipping isn't entirely far-fetched.",

The newest development, per the guardian: a 21-year-old suspect in custody told a spanish court that plans for even bigger attacks had been in the works, including the bombing of barcelona's sagrada familia church. Spanish media reports mohamed houli chemlal was one of the suspects in an alcanar house that blew up just hours before the two terror attacks, killing two of his associates, and police say that home had been turned into a bomb-making site. Chemlal, appearing in court with three other suspects, said the group had originally hoped to kill hundreds at various barcelona tourist sites, per the london times. Chemlal reportedly admitted to the court that he'd known about the attack plans \" for at least two months \" and that those plans were streamlined after the alcanar house accidentally exploded, per the bbc. Court officials also told spanish media that chemlal and the other three surviving suspects confirmed the men in the terror group had been radicalized by ripoll imam abdelbaki es satty, who's said to have died in the alcanar explosion. Besides the four surviving suspects and the two who died in alcanar, six other suspects were shot dead, including five involved in the cambrils attack and suspected van driver younes abouyaaqoub. In addition to the 13 civilians killed in barcelona and a woman killed in cambrils, one person was also killed when abouyaaqoub reportedly stabbed a man to death during a carjacking while trying to make his escape after the barcelona attack.",

            "The white house is catching plenty of flak for its nomination of chuck hagel as defense secretary. Not just from republicans seeking to fight the nomination, but from other corners decrying the lack of diversity at the top of president obama's cabinet. The washington post ran a story monday that noted the discrepancy between a president who made women's issues core to his reelection campaign and yet named new top advisers — john f. Kerry as secretary of state, chuck hagel at defense and john brennan at the top of the cia — who were all white men. On tuesday, the new york times ran its own story featuring a cringe-inducing photo from the oval office that looks more like the makings of a corporate softball team than the president's top group of advisers.

        "summary": "The tsatsos family has been grieving since july, when 19-year-old son darryl was killed in a three-car crash in a suburb of detroit. Now their nightmare has doubled: darryl's 18-year-old brother, ryan, was killed by a hit-and-run driver over the weekend near the college where he was a freshman, the detroit news reports. Ryan and darryl were paul and julie tsatsos ' only children, the paper notes. \" no arrests have been made yet in the death of ryan tsatsos, \" a michigan state police rep said monday. \" we are following up on tips. We are aware that the family lost their other son three months ago. This is a terribly tragic situation. \" their ongoing nightmare started in the early hours of july 26, after a deputy tried to pull darryl over for speeding, the news reports. Even though the officer eventually gave up the chase, a few minutes later he came upon an accident scene, where darryl's car had slammed into two other vehicles, killing darryl ( the other drivers weren't seriously injured ). In ryan's case, he was walking with friends early sunday near central michigan university when a car plowed into him going as fast as 80mph, throwing him 30 feet into a ditch, wjbk reports. The station notes ryan reportedly pushed one of his female friends out of the way when they heard the car. A gofundme page to help the family has raised nearly $ 45,000. Meanwhile, dad paul tsatsos says a wind chime given to the family after darryl's death has been ringing louder than ever. \" to me, that's darryl telling me again, ' i've got ryan, ' \" he tells wjbk. ( another michigan family suffered a similar loss — but with more than two lost. )",

His face shrouded in a black cloth, he clenched his fists as the first jolt of 1,750 volts was sent through his body for 20 seconds. After a second jolt that lasted 15 seconds, zagorski was pronounced dead at 7: 26pm. Zagorski — who chose pickled pig knuckles and tails as his final meal — was the first inmate to be executed by electric chair in tennessee since 2007 and the first in the us since 2013. He was sentenced to death for the april 1983 murders of john dotson and jimmy porter. Prosecutors said zagorski shot the men, slit their throats, and stole their money after they went to him to buy marijuana. During his murder trial in 1984, he told defense lawyers he wanted the death penalty and banned them from contacting his family, the tennessean reports. His attorney, kelley henry, says she tried to smile as the shroud was put over his head because he said he wanted her smiling face to be the last thing he saw. During the execution, she says, zagorski pulled against the straps so hard his pinkies were broken. ( the man who built tennessee's electric chair had concerns about the execution. )",

She's also made the ethically precarious choice to become a voice in the right-to-die debate, and it's personal: as the washington post reports, the 78-year-old rehm ran smack into the question of how to end life with dignity last year when her husband of 54 years, john, after a physically devastating battle with parkinson's that would only get worse, decided his time had arrived. But because the couple lived in maryland, which is not a right-to-die state, his doctor refused to help him end his life. And with diane rehm's high profile, her husband felt he could not ask her to help him. Which left john rehm just one option: stop eating and drinking. He did. His death took 10 days. \" i feel the way that john had to die was just totally inexcusable, \" rehm tells the post. \" it was not right. \" rehm is publicly working with end-of-life organization compassion &amp; choices, and she's using her story — which she recounted to nbc last year — to help raise funds for the cause; she tells the post she'd testify before congress if asked. \" she brings gravitas, she brings her experience, and she brings a level of reason and sanity to this discussion that is severely lacking when you look at the opponents of death with dignity, \" says an expert with the university of vermont, which is in one of only three states with right-to-die laws on the books. Rehm has also discussed the subject on her show. \" as strongly as i feel, i don't want to use the program to proselytize my feelings, \" she said, but with cases like brittany maynard stoking national debate, she says, \" i do want to have more and more discussion about it because i feel it's so important. \" ( elsewhere today, an old right-to-die case may come back to haunt jeb bush. )",

Louis have created a new map of the human brain that includes 97 areas never before identified. They published their findings wednesday in nature. A professor at yale calls the new map — which wired says \" sort of looks like a page from an adult coloring book \" — a \" huge leap in neuroscience. \" the map gives new detail to the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for motion, senses, emotions, and problem solving. Scientists hope it will help clarify how different parts of the brain impact human behavior, popular science reports. For example, researchers could use the map to find what areas are different between the brains of people with and without learning disabilities. Scientists created the new map by combining three different imaging techniques used on the brains of 210 young adults. \" no one's done this across the whole human brain, \" the study's author, matt glasser, tells wired. The result is a map of 180 cortical areas in each of the brain's hemispheres — more than half of them completely new. In fact, they're not even sure what some of them do. For example, one cortical area is activated by relaxing but deactivated by math problems for some reason. While the new map doubles the amount of mapped areas in the brain, the scientists behind it think further research will reveal even more.

But neuroscientists have been blundering around with blurry brain maps, which sometimes aren't very detailed, or omit important functions. That's why a new map is so exciting — it shows nearly 100 areas that hadn't been reported before. The map, described in a study published today in nature, is a detailed look at the part of the brain that handles all your senses, as well as your motion — plus some other functions like problem solving and emotional regulation. It's called the cerebral cortex, and it's the brain's outer layer of nerve tissue. Think of it as \" a sheet about the size of a large pizza, and about the thickness of the cardboard under the pizza, \" says david mccormick, a neuroscience and psychology professor at yale. The map was assembled using data from the human connectome project, an effort funded by the national institutes of health to better understand how the human brain works by compiling as much neural data as possible. \" to understand the brain and to fix it, we really need to know the circuit diagram and all the parts, how they work and how they interact, \"",

Scientists use them to agree on what they're studying in the first place, say, by pointing to something called the \"anterior cingulate cortex \" and having other people know what they're talking about.

This brain-mapping business is not a new endeavor. The first attempts, in the early 20th century, relied on surgeries, brain lesions, and morbid pipe-through-the-head accidents to tease out which part of the brain controlled what ( looking at you, phineas gage ).

            "Washington the united states will put into circulation a newly designed $ 100 bill in october that aims to thwart counterfeiters with advanced security features, the federal reserve said on wednesday. The new greenbacks still bear the portrait of benjamin franklin, an 18th century luminary who helped found the new american republic. The changes in design are mostly in anti-counterfeiting features such as a blue three-dimensional security ribbon and alternating images of bells and the number 100 that move and change as the viewing angle is tilted. The new notes, which cost slightly more to produce, also feature a bell image inside a picture of an inkwell that changes from copper to green when tilted, as well as a large \" 100 \" that does the same. Under prior plans, the bill was supposed to enter circulation in february 2011, but \" its introduction was postponed following an unexpected production delay, \" the fed said in a statement. The $ 100 note is the most frequently counterfeited denomination of u.s. Currency outside the united states, due to its broad circulation overseas. The billions of older-design $ 100s already in circulation will remain legal tender after the new notes are released. In recent years, u.s. Officials have been trying to combat the continued production of extremely high-quality counterfeit $ 100 notes they say are produced in north korea, dubbed the \" supernote,",

The $ 100 bill, a prime target for counterfeiters, will in its new version feature advanced security features such as a blue 3-d ribbon running through the middle and a disappearing image of the liberty bell. Benjamin franklin's face will still be printed off-center on the front of the bill. The new note was originally slated to begin circulating in 2011, but problems including unwanted creases in bills delayed production until this year.

            "Washington the united states will put into circulation a newly designed $ 100 bill in october that aims to thwart counterfeiters with advanced security features, the federal reserve said on wednesday. The new greenbacks still bear the portrait of benjamin franklin, an 18th century luminary who helped found the new american republic. The changes in design are mostly in anti-counterfeiting features such as a blue three-dimensional security ribbon and alternating images of bells and the number 100 that move and change as the viewing angle is tilted. The new notes, which cost slightly more to produce, also feature a bell image inside a picture of an inkwell that changes from copper to green when tilted, as well as a large \" 100 \" that does the same. Under prior plans, the bill was supposed to enter circulation in february 2011, but \" its introduction was postponed following an unexpected production delay, \" the fed said in a statement. The $ 100 note is the most frequently counterfeited denomination of u.s. Currency outside the united states, due to its broad circulation overseas. The billions of older-design $ 100s already in circulation will remain legal tender after the new notes are released. In recent years, u.s. Officials have been trying to combat the continued production of extremely high-quality counterfeit $ 100 notes they say are produced in north korea, dubbed the \" supernote,",
            "The federal reserve said wednesday that a newly designed $ 100 bill would begin circulating in october, more than two years after the initial target date. The $ 100 bill, a prime target for counterfeiters, will in its new version feature advanced security features such as a blue 3-d ribbon running through the middle and a disappearing image of the liberty bell. Benjamin franklin's face will still be printed off-center on the front of the bill. The new note was originally slated to begin circulating in 2011, but problems including unwanted creases in bills delayed production until this year. Photos: top 10 richest people ever led by 14th century african king the new $ 100 bill is the latest efforts by the federal reserve to outwit counterfeiters with increasingly sophisticated designs. In 2003, the government began rolling out $ 20 bills with peach, blue and green backgrounds, the first time in modern american history where notes included colors other than green and black. Redesigns soon followed of the $ 5, $ 10 and $ 50 bills. The government posted an online video about the new $ 100 bill.

        "summary": "\" i can't even \" may be a millennial catchphrase, but it seems bob dylan got there first a half-century ago. As chris willman points out in his billboard review of the newly released bootleg series box set, the scene took place during a january 1966 recording session as dylan grew frustrated at his band's takes on the song \" she's your lover now. \" he complained that it was \" ugly, \" adding, \" i can't. I can't even. \" wonders willman, \" did bob dylan just invent the 21st century catchphrase ' i can't even '? i think he did! \" the not-so-serious assertion has prompted some others to consider the question. In a language blog at slate, ben zimmer cites another's blogger's observation that \" i can't even \" reflects a \" stylized verbal incoherence mirroring emotional incoherence, \" and observes that dylan \" was certainly experiencing emotional incoherence \" at the time. Dylan's \" i can't even \" wasn't as \" stylized \" as the modern version, he notes, citing this saturday night live skit as an example of the latter. Still, \" it's also easy to draw a straight line from his use to this one, \" writes david graham at the atlantic. \" it's a clear ancestor. In other words: it turns out that the new bob dylan turned out to be … millennials. \" of course, how you'd draw a line from 1966 lament to modern phrase is a little tricky — \" she's your lover now \" didn't see the light of day until an earlier set of bootleg recordings was released in 1991 — but dylan \" has been influencing culture for decades, so it's not entirely outside the realm of possibility, \" writes david britton at the daily dot. If nothing else, he seemed at least to be ahead of his time on it. ( linguists also are taking note of this modern grammatical shift. )",

        "summary": "A week from saturday, a 130-year-old bell from a church erected by slaves will ring to herald the grand opening of a 400,000-square-foot dc museum that's been talked about since 1915, npr reports. The idea for that museum, the smithsonian's national museum of african american history and culture, was first bandied about by black civil war veterans shortly after the turn of the century, but funding issues and politics kept it from being built for decades — until support was permanently reinvigorated in 2003, hundreds of millions of dollars were raised ( including from celebrity donors such as samuel l. Jackson and michael jordan ), and ground was broken on the national mall in 2012. On thursday, the new york times reviewed the museum, which npr notes is mostly underground, with the bottom level set up to simulate the darkness of slavery. Some snippets from the times on this \" data-packed, engrossing, mood-swinging must-see \" that both \" uplifts and upsets \": art critic holland cotter comments on the building's outward aesthetics — and at first glance, he admits it \" looks rusted and a little shaggy, like a giant magnet bristling with metal filings. \" but all good things come to those who keep observing, with ever-changing textures that mesmerize and \" significant trans-atlantic references \" that add context to african-american history. The galleries are spread over five floors, with the three underground \" history \" levels — featuring some of the \" oldest and most disturbing material \" — devoted to the themes of slavery, segregation, and the year 1968, a watershed moment in the civil rights movement. Among the haunting artifacts: a lockable iron neck-ring that could only have fit a child. Cotter praises the inclusion of devastating items such as these, noting that it \" means you can't just select a comfortable version of history. \" and that somber feel continues with lynching photos, a kkk hood, and the \" potentially most upsetting object of all \": a coffin that once held the body of 14-year-old emmett till, said to have been murdered for flirting with a white woman. Cotter notes the museum has a grief counselor available to help those who may have a difficult time. The \" uplift \" is evident in the plentiful multimedia displays dedicated to black revolutionary patriots and wwii's tuskegee airmen, black entrepreneurs, and the heroes and movements found in the uppermost \" 1968 to today \" level, including those for shirley chisholm, the black panthers, and black lives matter. A \" communities \" gallery boasts relics from famous black sports figures such as carl lewis and gymnast gabby douglas, and \" culture \" and \" music",

        "summary": "Prince charles and duchess camilla, who met more than 30 years before they finally tied the knot, have become the poster couple for passionate rekindled romances. Now quartz is reporting on a handful of possible explanations as to why such a flame can burn brighter years later. In the ' 90s, dr. Nancy kalish of california state university in sacramento studied 1,001 people who'd rekindled an old romance and found that 72 % were still with their \" lost love \"; 71 % called it the most intense romance they'd ever had, and 61 % said things got hot faster than they had in any other relationship. Kalish told cosmopolitan earlier this year that the top reason teens call it quits is due to parental disapproval, and of the people she studied, all but 18 % were adolescents during the initial romance, reports the sydney morning herald. But clinical psychologist dr. Joe carver cautions that \" suddenly you feel 17 again — and in love, \" when really, \" you actually have no knowledge or understanding of this individual in 2015. \" and as for 2015, or, at least, this social-media-infused century: in 2004-2005, kalish redid her study with 1,300 new participants. In her prior study, 30 % of the people involved were married ( and therefore carrying on an affair ); this time, 62 % were married and cheating to be with their lost love. From kalish's website: \" because of the high extramarital rate, successful reunions for this group was low: only 5 % of the lost love couples married each other; one or both of the affair partners chose to remain married. \" would your rekindled love work? in the washington post, kalish writes that \" successful rekindlers \" are those who first dated when they were 22 or younger, grew up in the same place, were together at least a year, and were torn apart by \" situational factors, \" like a move or parental disapproval.

The late-night host got his chance sunday night and brought his a-game to go with the a-list attendees, with usa today noting he came out \" comfortable and swinging. \" some of his best lines from the night: kimmel brought a bevy of political riffs, though one in particular looked forward to tomorrow's twitter feed, per abc news: \" some of you will [ win tonight ] and give a speech that the president of the united states will tweet about in all caps during his 5am bowel movement. \" he also tweeted to the president live during the show: \" hey @realdonaldtrump u up? \" continuing in that vein, kimmel took on the president's focus on \" fake news, \" pointing out that if the new york times or los angeles times or even \" the medieval times \" was in the building that they'd have to leave, per the huffington post. \" we have no tolerance for fake news, \" he said. \" fake tans we love. \" kimmel also thanked trump: \" i mean, remember last year when it seemed like the oscars were racist? it's gone. Thanks to him! it has been an amazing year for movies: black people saved nasa and white people saved jazz. That's what you call progress, \" he said, per deadline. \" this is meryl's 20th oscar nomination … she wasn't even in a movie this year, we just wrote her name in out of habit, \" he said of streep, nominated for florence foster jenkins. Another political quip, on spotting isabelle huppert, nominated for elle: \" i ' m glad homeland security let you in tonight. We are very welcoming to outsiders here in hollywood, \" kimmel told the french star, adding \" we don't discriminate against people based on what countries they come from. We discriminate against them based on their age and weight. \" he joked about andrew garfield's loss of 40 pounds for his role in silence, calling it \" an astonishing physical transformation that has been attempted since by every actress in every role ever. \" new york notes that tina fey and amy poehler made a very similar quip at the 2014 golden globes. Kimmel continued his comedy feud with matt damon, praising him for doing something \" unselfish, \" per digital spy: \" he could have starred in manchester by the sea but he didn't: he gave that role to childhood friend casey",

        "summary": "More questions are arising about the us raid on osama bin laden's compound as cia director leon panetta indicated that there was a video feed blackout during the critical confrontation with the al-qaeda leader, reports the telegraph. Live-feed cameras mounted on the helmets of the us fighters apparently switched off or failed to transmit for as long as 25 minutes, panetta suggested in an interview with pbs. That raises the question of what exactly president obama and his aides were watching so intently in the situation room in a photo that has gone viral on flickr. \" in fact they had little knowledge of what was happening in the compound, \" notes the telegraph. Panetta didn't offer further details. \" once those teams went into the compound there was a period of almost 20 or 25 minutes where we really didn't know exactly what was going on. And there were some very tense moments, \" panetta said. \" we had some observation of the approach, but we did not have direct flow of information as they were going through the compound. \" there was a \" firefight going up that compound, \" panetta added in a version of events he has since amended. If bin laden had \" thrown up his hands and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him, \" said. \" but they had full authority to kill him. \" pakistani officials have reported that bin laden was captured, and then killed, according to the telegraph.

It had been reported that obama and his team were able to watch live streaming video of the raid, though the bbc now reports that \"obama is understood to have seen real-time footage of the approach to the compound but no direct video feed from the operation itself. \" regardless of which parts of the raid the national security team did or didn't see, the technology behind streaming video live from helmet-mounted cameras isn't actually all that complicated. The bbc has a short video detailing how such a camera system may have been used during the bin laden raid as explained by gerald fairbairn, a security communications expert from a company in the uk called indicomm: \"for soldiers wearing cameras on their helmets with a video link back to command center, from what we've seen in the past they have a small box that they ' ll probably drop down which will be able to receive live imagery from about five or six helmet cams. And that will be transmitted directly to the helicopter and, again, that would be transmitted up to a satellite which would then beam straight down to the white house. \" fairbairn adds, \"this is very similar to your house wi-fi but this is a lot bigger and a lot more powerful. \" from the sounds of it, each of the helmet cams have a transmitting device which relays video to a nearby box that acts as a repeater to again relay the video to a transmitter on a nearby helicopter, which then shoots the footage up to a satellite. The white house is locked on to the satellite's position and pulls the footage down to its own video screens. I'd guess that the repeater box may not be necessary if the helicopter's within close enough range of the soldiers already, but it doesn't hurt anything to sit in the middle",

        "summary": "A newly discovered dinosaur in venezuela may help us understand how species survived a mass-extinction event about 200 million years ago, phys.org reports. Based on two leg-bone fossils, paleontologists say tachiraptor admirabilis was fairly small ( 5 or 6 feet, tip to tail ), ran on two feet, and ate meat. \" tachiraptor probably preyed upon any smaller animal he could catch, \" says max langer, the study's lead author, discovery reports. That likely made life harder for the only other dinosaur yet found in venezuela, the laquintasaura, a plant-muncher that may have moved in herds to protect it from tachiraptors, langer says. Tachiraptors date back to the early jurassic period, right after a horrific event decimated about 84 % of all living things and wiped out several kinds of dinosaur ( sinking sea levels, extreme temperatures, and volcanic eruptions possibly set off the disaster ). Tachiraptors may have survived by sticking to a humid, tropical equatorial belt that ran from the americas to northern africa — because the continents were still joined in a huge land mass we call pangaea. That belt \" played a pivotal role in the radiation of the different dinosaur groups, \" langer says. So why have only two dinosaurs been found in venezuela, a fossil-rich area? mostly due to lack of digging, and the rich vegetation that covers sites in northern regions of south america.

            "The dinosaur, laquintasaura venezuelae, is the first to be discovered in northern south america and shares its name with the la quinta formation in venezuela where it was found. Measuring up at about a metre long and 25 centimetres tall laquintasaura would have been about the size of a small dog and was largely herbivorous- though the curve of some of its teeth suggest it might have also feasted on insects and small prey. Scientists unearthed laquintasauras tangled together in small groups including juveniles and fully grown adults. The dinosaurs found together probably died at the same time say the scientists which could mean they were living in herds- a complex social interaction so far not seen in this sort of dinosaur until the late jurassic around 40 million years later. 'it is fascinating and unexpected to see they lived in herds, something we have little evidence of so far in dinosaurs from this time,'says lead author dr paul barrett. Laquintasaura belongs to the 'bird-hipped ', or ornithischia, group of dinosaurs which later gave rise to stegosaurus. At the moment the other dinosaur group - saurischia - dominates scientists ' understanding of early dinosaur evolution because they are discovered more often. Bird-hipped dinosaurs in the late triassic have been considered fairly rare with only three known species. More have been discovered from the early jurassic but scientists question the accuracy of the aging of",

        "summary": "The world's biggest religious complex, some four times the size of vatican city, is cambodia's angkor wat, built in 1150 but long lost to history. Archaeological work since the 19th century has uncovered pieces of it, but it wasn't until last year that researchers got a detailed sense of how the site once looked — thanks to some high-tech lasers, the bbc reports. In just two weeks, experts were able to map about 140 square miles in the area; they offer a brilliant picture of what the bbc calls \" the greatest medieval city on earth. \" its population approached 1 million before its rulers left it behind in the 15th century. To achieve their findings, archaeologists sent a helicopter over the area. It carried a sensing technology called lidar, which shot lasers over the jungle in four-second intervals, the bbc reports. Lidar can \" see \" right through the plant growth, china topix notes. And it revealed tiny changes in the topography of the site, allowing researchers to discover the hidden remains in the region — including what's left of the city of mahendraparvata, thought to have been built 300 years before angkor. \" you have this kind of sudden eureka moment where you bring the data up on screen the first time and there it is — this ancient city very clearly in front of you, \" one expert says. The results showed lost temples, roads, and incredible hydraulic systems that allowed citizens to use monsoon water to their benefit. Floods, however, eventually drove people away. Another \" lost city \" turned up recently in mexico.",

That left smith on the side of the road, selling $ 5 bags of kindling he collected by chopping stumps to pay off helen's remaining medical bills. Last week, smith got the attention of jessica pittman when he removed his hat for a passing funeral procession, the bbc reports. She took a picture and posted it on facebook, asking gulfport residents to stop by and get a bag of wood. Her post went viral and dozens of new customers started showing up, buying wood and leaving donations. \" it overwhelmed me, \" smith tells the sun herald. Then it got bigger. Smith's son started a gofundme page, and donations came pouring in from all over the world. The page has raised more than $ 50,000 for the man a neighbor calls \" wonderful \" and \" kind. \" pittman says she can't believe this all started with a facebook post. \" although it will not lessen the heartache of losing his wife, i am thankful it will at least take a little worry off of his plate, \" she says. ( strangers were moved to help an elderly popsicle vendor, too. )",

Other highlights, as per the atlantic and time: light bulbs. Production of 40 and 60-watt incandescent bulbs is officially over as of today, marking another step in the switch to more efficient bulbs that began with the phasing out of 100 and 75-watt bulbs. Drones. Illinois has moved to head off the use of unmanned aircraft in the state, restricting when law enforcement can use them to gather data and making it illegal for animal rights groups to use them to interfere with hunters or fishermen. Voter registration. They're still too young to smoke the state's legal pot, but colorado 16-year-olds will now be able to pre-register to vote when they get their drivers licenses — a law that actually makes it easier to vote, bucking the trend seen in numerous other states. Shark fin. Delaware may not be a vital link in the shark fin trade, but the state has made it illegal to sell or distribute them there, a move aimed at protecting endangered shark species and ending the inhumane practice of finning. Gun control. Measure introduced in connecticut after the sandy hook school shooting will now take effect, including registration of assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. California has also tightened gun controls with new measures including a 5-year ban on firearms possession for anyone who makes serious threats of violence to psychotherapists. Placentas. New mothers in oregon are now allowed to bring their placentas home with them — for ritual burial or for food, depending on their culture.",

Surgeons have removed three tumors from her brain and two from her abdomen, but they found another on her adrenal gland. They hope to start a treatment called full targeted therapy, attacking the mutated cells. The treatment is dangerous for fetuses, so the twins will be delivered first, kept in a neonatal unit for a few months, and tested for cancer in case it spread to them. \" we are taking this one day at a time, \" her husband says. \" she is the strongest person i know, and i have to be strong for her, too. \" their gofundme page has already blown past its $ 5,000 target and is approaching $ 23,000.

Danielle currently lives in goddard, ks with her husband, tyler and their two year old daughter, taylor. It all started seven years ago when tyler noticed a strange mole on danielle's back. She went to a dermatologist who took a biopsy of the mole and said it was benign. Within a year, the mole had grown back and still looked odd.

Implying that it's an act of defiance against some corrupt authority figure, on the other hand, appears to work wonders, as researchers focusing on healthy eating report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. They write that by harnessing teens'tendency to rebel, they were able to align \" healthy behavior with values about which adolescents already care: feeling like a socially conscious, autonomous person worthy of approval from one's peers. \" a co-author explains to the guardian that the study worked by making \" healthy eating seem like the rebellious thing that you do, you make your own choices, you fight back against injustice. \" in a randomized trial, researchers assigned 489 eighth-graders at a texas middle school to one of two groups: one that read an article about how the body processes food that recommended a diet lower in sugars and fats, and the other that read about the cynical practices of food companies ( such as making unhealthy foods more addictive ). The next day, the kids in the latter group were more likely to choose healthy snacks like fruit and carrots instead of oreos and doritos at a long-planned celebration in a different class. The co-author says that eating healthily had become \" a high status thing to do \" for those teens. The new york times likens the findings to a highly effective anti-smoking campaign from 2000 that \" framed smoking as an act of corporate submission \" to a corrupt tobacco industry.

While the party has long celebrated thomas jefferson and andrew jackson at such dinners, the pair's own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson's role in driving native americans out of the southeastern us — the \" trail of tears \" — also is a factor. Democrats in georgia, connecticut, missouri, maine, new hampshire, and other states have scrapped their jefferson-jackson affairs or are considering doing so. In iowa, a democratic leader said it's all about making sure the party lives up to the values of \" inclusiveness, diversity, and equality. \" the new york times also has taken notice: controversy over the confederate flag may be generating bigger headlines, its story observes, but the efforts by democrats \" to remove jefferson and jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of american politics: democrats'shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity. \"",

Epstein, though, isn't talking about google bombs, in which outsiders try to rig results. What if the folks inside google — if not the current leaders, but the next generation 20 years from now — subtly changed their algorithms to give an edge to a favorite candidate? it would be nearly impossible to detect, and the very possibility should have us worried, argues epstein. Others agree. \" elections are won among low-information voters, \" says eli pariser, former president of ­moveon.org. \" the ability to raise a negative story about a candidate to a voter... Could be quite powerful. \" epstein will formally present his findings this spring at a psychology forum, but google disputes the premise. \" providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of google's approach to search from the very beginning, \" it says. \" it would undermine people's trust in our results and company if we were to change course. \" ( click for the full story, which notes that epstein's research was prompted by a public beef he had with the company. )",

Population grew by 2.3 million, reaching 313.9 million people. That growth of 0.75 percent was higher than the 0.73 percent rate in 2011, ending five years of slowing growth rates. Nevertheless, growth levels remains stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937, restrained by reduced childbirths. Over the last year, the economy has shown improvement, with the unemployment rate declining modestly and u.s. Migration edging up after hitting a record low in 2011. As a result, states including texas, north dakota, colorado, oregon, maryland and virginia posted notable population gains as many young adults moved out from their parents ' homes, seeking to test the job market in areas with thriving economies in energy or technology. Still, the nation continues to get older, due to aging baby boomers and fewer people in their child-bearing years. Newly released census projections now show that u.s. Growth may have largely peaked, barring a significant and sustained increase in new immigrants. The numbers put u.s. Growth in the",

Before his contract as interim president was approved last month, raymond burse asked how many employees earned less than $ 10.25 per hour and volunteered to take a pay cut to bring their salary up to that level, reports the lexington herald-leader. The board agreed to cut his annual salary from $ 349,869 to $ 259,744. \" this is not a publicity stunt, \" he says. \" you don't give up $ 90,000 for publicity. I did this for the people.

Some of the 24 workers involved, including groundskeepers and custodians, had been making the federal minimum wage of just $ 7.25 per hour. Burse, who was ksu president from 1982 to 1989 before becoming a general counsel at ge, says he will take more pay cuts if more workers are hired at minimum wage. Burse says he has high expectations for his staff and wanted to give them something in return, reports the washington post, which notes that a bill to raise kentucky's minimum wage to $ 10.10 failed in the state senate earlier this year. \" i didn't have any examples of it having been done out there, and i didn't do it to be an example to anyone else, \" burke says. \" i did it to do right by the employees here. \"",

That's what australian hunter stephen moreen, 20, did when a 6-foot croc grabbed his arm and dragged him under in a remote area about 200 miles southwest of darwin, australia, the bbc reports. It helped to be \" a little bit tipsy \" during the struggle, he admits. Moreen says he was wading in the water to grab a goose he'd just shot when the crocodile attacked: it did \" the death roll, \" he tells abc australia. \" lucky for me when [ he ] went underwater i saw him and poked his eye. He let go. Once he let go he ran for the bank. My cousin-brother shot him. \" moreen's sister-in-law then applied first aid, and he drank a few carlton dry beers to ease the pain, 9 news reports. \" i wasn't too worried until i saw the scars, \" he says. \" it made me cry. I ' m fine, i ' m alive. It could have been bad. It could have got my leg. \" dragged in about waist deep, moreen says the crocodile scratched up his back, ripped the flesh on his arm, and punctured it three times. When doctors and medical staff arrived to treat him, moreen was \" conveyed in a mildly intoxicated state to the clinic where his wounds were cleaned, \" a police official tells nt news. Moreen then drove himself to a hospital yesterday for further treatment. ( read about a woman who committed suicide by crocodile. )",

According to highly redacted fbi documents released yesterday by the justice department, the family of \" an allegedly wealthy international businessman \" connected with the saudi royal family abandoned their house in sarasota, fla., on or around august 27, 2001. They left behind valuable items — including furniture, clothes, and three cars, broward bulldog notes — so it seems they left without much preparation. The businessman's name is blanked out, but a separate fbi form names esam ghazzawi, adviser to a top saudi prince and owner of the sarasota house, where he lived with his daughter and her husband. Law enforcement sources have already pointed to evidence that hijack pilot mohamed atta, former al-qaeda leader adnan shukrijumah, and other suspected terrorists had visited the house, but the fbi never revealed ghazzawi's name to congressional investigators or the 9/11 commission. Ghazzawi's son-in-law, abdulaziz al-hijji, said last year they only moved so al-hijji could work at the saudi oil company aramco in england. He called the 9/11 attacks \" a crime against the usa and all humankind. \" ( freedom of information litigation filed by broward bulldog got the latest documents released, and up to 80,266 more fbi pages could be made public at the discretion of a us district judge in florida. )",

Andrea constand accuses cosby of drugging her and sexually assaulting her at his home near philadelphia. He argues that the encounter was consensual. A round-up of coverage: prominent defense lawyer barry slotnick tells nbc news that the case will be very difficult to prosecute — especially if the judge doesn't allow cosby's dozens of other accusers to take the stand. \" this case is over with. Too much time has passed, \" he says. \" the major question the jury will have for the accuser is, ' where have you been and why did you settle? ' i think cosby's position is going to be ' yes, i had sex with her and it was consensual. ' \" cnn recaps the allegations and looks at how cosby's legal troubles have snowballed over the last few years. Even if he is acquitted in the constand case, he will still face multiple civil lawsuits, including defamation suits stemming from his efforts to discredit his accusers. The ap looks at what will happen next. With defense lawyers fighting to keep evidence like a deposition from constand's 2005 civil lawsuit out of the trial, it could be more than a year before cosby goes on trial. Experts say that since the pennsylvania supreme court has allowed the case to proceed this far, cosby's death is one of the only things that could prevent it going to trial. \" if he were to pass away before his conviction is final, it will not count as a conviction in most jurisdictions, \" fordham law school expert james cohen tells usa today. \" and therefore, whatever small chance his reputation has of surviving it would not be further diminished by a felony conviction. \" cosby's lawyers tuesday gave what the ap calls a \" blistering preview \" of the questions constand is likely to face. Brian mcmonagle argued that constand voluntarily accepted the pills cosby gave her — and, while asking the judge to dismiss the case, said that she \" accepted a dinner invitation, spoke to him on the phone... And visited him in canada at a concert \" in the year between the alleged assault and her first call to police. In an opinion piece at the washington post, alyssa rosenberg notes that some people will continue to consider cosby innocent whether he is convicted or not — and wonders",

The $ 500 million, 105,000-square-foot \" giga-mansion \" will, indeed, likely be the only one of its kind, seeing as la has tightened up building regulations since niami started working on it, the guardian reports. \" one made for the one, \" reads the tagline of a promotional video for the house featuring a wealthy host with a red ferrari hosting a party with many beautiful women.

But as soon as it cuts to her, we know that there is great danger afoot. She's surrounded by burly, drunk men — \"where's your beer? \" one slurs at her — as we see countless possible sources of danger mingling and chugging beer behind her, recalling the many filmic instances in which the audience is aware of a greater danger than the character onscreen. The camera soon whip-pans to a woman in extreme physical distress to the left — sarah is her name, we discover — but burch continues to report, bravely holding her ground despite our knowledge of what is coming. Finally, there it is: the vomit, which soars in unexpectedly from offscreen. But the video freezes at the moment of impact, such that not only do we get a jump-scare but we must also listen to the audio of the aftermath, left only to imagine what horrors were unfolding. More vomit? did the \"where's your beer guy \" return? is sarah okay? \"we need to pull her out of there, \" one of the anchors says from the safety of his desk in hollywood. The rescue mission might make for a good sequel, if audiences can handle a return to the regurgitated hell of hermosa beach. Submit your great job, internet tips here.",

        "summary": "For jessica kirkpatrick, an astrophysicist-turned-data-scientist, information helps bridge gaps. But when she tried to use it to narrow the gender wage gap in her new role as chief data scientist at hired, she learned that more data isn't always helpful — and that's at least in part down to human behavior. As quartz reports, after staging an experiment on the site that armed male and female applicants with a range of average salaries in their fields, the women put themselves on the lower half of the salary curve and the men with comparable skills and experiences put themselves on the upper half. Suddenly, women were asking for almost 10 % less money than men; women in the control group who didn't see the salary range were actually asking for 4 % more than their male counterparts. In hindsight, kirkpatrick says the results aren't surprising. Women are historically less aggressive negotiators who play down their achievements, and what hired calls the \" expectation gap \" for salary widens as the ratio of men to women in a role increases — and as a woman's length of time in the workforce increases. Hired found that women with less than five years of work experience are asking for higher salaries than men and receive 8 % more in salary offers, but this trend reverses within six years. And, as forbes notes, the inequities ( including promotions ) compound like interest over time. In a recent hired blog post, the current trend suggests that at this rate, women won't receive equal pay for their work until the year 2152.

        "summary": "One of the hiroshima anniversary stories making headlines today tells the tale of a japanese family's bonsai tree that survived the blast despite being just two miles from where the bomb hit. The best guess is that tree, now 390 years old, lived because it was up against a wall in the family's nursery and perhaps shielded, reports national geographic. As it turns out, you can see it for yourself: a renowned bonsai master donated the tree to the national arboretum in dc in 1976, though incredibly, its hiroshima connection wasn't revealed until 2001, when two japanese brothers visited to see how their grandfather's tree was doing, reports the washington post. Some other great reads and videos about the anniversary: what else survived: the bbc provides a short video tour of sites that survived the bombing, including a tram car now used by tourists. Your hometown: pri has a tool that allows you to see how things would turn out if the hiroshima bomb were dropped on your hometown. Changing attitudes: the christian science monitor suggests that public opinion is shifting away from the notion that dropping the bomb was justified.

        "summary": "Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are the only known mammals in the world to sport scales. But people are eating them and using their scales for their perceived medicinal value, and now all eight pangolin species are nearing extinction. Just a few days ago, officials in vietnam found 1.4 tons of dried pangolin scales in a cargo ship from africa, where four of the species are found, reports scientific american. The other four are found in asia, where the appetite for pangolin meat and scales appears strongest. In fact, an estimated one million wild pangolins have been killed in the past decade alone, meaning they're the most-trafficked group of species anywhere. Last week, the red list of endangered animals upgraded all eight species of pangolin to threatened status, with the chinese and sunda pangolins listed as critically endangered, the final step before extinction, and the indian and philippine pangolins upgraded to endangered. The four african species were upgraded from \" least concern \" or \" near threatened \" to \" vulnerable, \" likely the result of poachers largely depleting the asian populations and turning to africa for more, reports the guardian. \" in the 21st century, we really should not be eating species to extinction, \" one conservationist says.

To those who might doubt romney's projection that his plan would make north america energy independent by 2020, the presumptive republican presidential nominee had a simple message: \"it is achievable. \" \"this is not some pie-in-the-sky kind of thing, \" romney told a modest crowd outside a truck warehouse in new mexico. \"this is a real, achievable objective, and i have a chart that's still, despite the wind, still holding up up here. \" while romney stressed the idea of independence, the plan relies heavily on imports from canada and mexico, two of the world's biggest oil producers. Hence the use of the phrase \"north american \" before energy independence. With storm clouds rolling in, romney turned to a bar graph propped perilously next to him on a makeshift easel to make the sale. But first, this: \"these guys have held it up with about every piece of weight you can think of, \" romney said. \"you can't read the writing, it's too far back, but i can read it even from here so i ' m going to tell you what it says.",

To those who might doubt romney's projection that his plan would make north america energy independent by 2020, the presumptive republican presidential nominee had a simple message: \"it is achievable. \" \"this is not some pie-in-the-sky kind of thing, \" romney told a modest crowd outside a truck warehouse in new mexico. \"this is a real, achievable objective, and i have a chart that's still, despite the wind, still holding up up here. \" while romney stressed the idea of independence, the plan relies heavily on imports from canada and mexico, two of the world's biggest oil producers. Hence the use of the phrase \"north american \" before energy independence. With storm clouds rolling in, romney turned to a bar graph propped perilously next to him on a makeshift easel to make the sale. But first, this: \"these guys have held it up with about every piece of weight you can think of, \" romney said. \"you can't read the writing, it's too far back, but i can read it even from here so i ' m going to tell you what it says.",
            "Republican mitt romney, seeking to refocus his presidential campaign on the economy after days of distraction, is promoting energy proposals aimed at creating more than 3 million new jobs and opening up more areas for drilling off the coast of two politically critical states, virginia and north carolina. Republican presidential candidate, former massachusetts gov. Mitt romney speaks during a campaign stop at leclaire manufacturing, wednesday, aug. 22, 2012, in bettendorf, iowa.

( ap photo/carolyn kaster ) ( associated press ) romney's pivot to energy, a key component of his jobs agenda, comes as the national debate has turned away from the gop candidate's jobs message and toward issues like rape, abortion, welfare and medicare 2 1/2 months before election day. President barack obama's campaign also began a new push on the economy thursday with a television advertisement featuring former president bill clinton. In the ad, clinton speaks directly to the camera and says voters face a \" clear choice \" over which candidate will return the nation to full employment. \" we need to keep going with his plan, \" clinton says of obama in the ad"

Influential london mayor boris johnson has added his voice to those calling for a new vote if fresh evidence emerges, though foreign secretary william hague says parliament \" has spoken \" and won't be asked to vote on the same issue twice, the bbc reports. Among other us allies, israeli leaders have gone silent on the issue since president obama decided to ask congress to support military action. The country's leaders earlier spoke strongly in favor of a strike, but now fear lobbying too hard could backfire. \" it would be a mistake to overplay the israeli interest, \" a former israeli ambassador to the us tells the new york times. \" it's bad for israel that the average american gets it into his or her mind that boys are again sent to war for israel. They have to be sent to war for america. \" in australia, meanwhile, opposition leader tony abbott — on course to become prime minister in next weekend's election — has caused an uproar by describing the syrian civil war as \" baddies versus baddies. \" with eyes now on congress, the washington post looks at where lawmakers stand on syria and finds them split into 5 groups: the \" do it now, already \" caucus; the \" want bigger military action \" caucus, which includes sen. John mccain; the \" happy to debate but reserving judgement \" caucus, which is the largest grouping; the skeptical caucus; and the anti-military action caucus, which is made up of a strange alliance of anti-war liberals and tea party conservatives.",

        "summary": "Scientists are celebrating after a days-old orca calf was spotted off the west coast of washington state's san juan island on saturday. The calf was born into one of three pods of southern resident orca whales, known as \" j pod, \" which happens to have the best record when it comes to keeping calves alive, reports the seattle times. Dubbed j53, the calf was seen frolicking in haro strait with princess angeline, or j17, a 38-year-old whale who is believed to be the calf's mother and is also a grandmother, reports komo news. Why all the fuss? well, the baby whale is the sixth born since december and is part of a baby boom that's raising hopes that the endangered population is rebounding. Before december, scientists hadn't recorded a single successful birth in three years. \" it's great news. We've got a bit of a brady bunch out there right now, \" says michael harris of the pacific whale watch association, who adds that another three to six whales may be pregnant. Harris says researchers don't yet know the sex of the calf but are hoping for a girl. Only one female has been born since december and females typically live into their 90s, while males live to about 60. Though the orca population dipped to 77 last year, harris says it now sits at 82 after the death of a 50-year-old female orca a few weeks ago. He credits the healthy number of chinook salmon — another endangered species that makes up 90 % of the orcas'diets — with the baby boom, but says \" a very difficult run \" predicted for next year could bring problems.

Two years of robust chinook salmon runs are being credited for the baby boom. Whale watchers and researchers have high hopes for the survival of the newest baby orca spotted near the san juan islands late saturday afternoon, according to the pacific whale watch association. The baby was born into j pod, one of three pods of southern-resident orca whales, and the pod most experienced at keeping babies alive, said michael harris, the association's executive director, on sunday. \"it's fantastic, it's great news. We've got a bit of a brady bunch out there right now, \" harris said of the latest addition, dubbed j53. The baby is the fourth born into j pod this year. First spotted off the west coast of san juan island, j53 was a bit of a surprise and is the fourth calf born to j17 — a 38-year-old whale who is a grandmother to other orcas, j46 and j47, harris said.

The baby orca was seen in haro strait traveling with j17, also known as princess angeline. 38-year-old princess angeline is part of j-pod, and is believed to have birthed j53. This is her fourth calf, and she's grandmother to j46 and j47. \" the wide range of ages of the mothers has really been fascinating to us, \" explained michael harris, executive director of pwwa, representing 36 operators in bc and washington said in a press release. News of another calf is creating hope that the endangered southern resident orca population is on the right track. The baby boom follows three years without a successful birth. \" this year we've had the youngest mother on record give birth, a 10-year-old, and three of the oldest.

Whale watchers and researchers have high hopes for the survival of the newest baby orca spotted near the san juan islands late saturday afternoon, according to the pacific whale watch association. The baby was born into j pod, one of three pods of southern-resident orca whales, and the pod most experienced at keeping babies alive, said michael harris, the association's executive director, on sunday. \"it's fantastic, it's great news. We've got a bit of a brady bunch out there right now, \" harris said of the latest addition, dubbed j53. The baby is the fourth born into j pod this year. First spotted off the west coast of san juan island, j53 was a bit of a surprise and is the fourth calf born to j17 — a 38-year-old whale who is a grandmother to other orcas, j46 and j47, harris said. The birth was confirmed saturday night with photos taken by the crew on the maya's legacy, one of 36 operators in the whale-watch association in british columbia and washington. Photos of j53 have shown",
            "Seattle -- the year 2015 continues to be a population boom for puget sound's endangered orcas as another new calf was spotted on saturday. Designated j53, it's the sixth calf born into population since last december, the center for whale research confirmed. The baby orca was seen in haro strait traveling with j17, also known as princess angeline. 38-year-old princess angeline is part of j-pod, and is believed to have birthed j53. This is her fourth calf, and she's grandmother to j46 and j47. \" the wide range of ages of the mothers has really been fascinating to us, \" explained michael harris, executive director of pwwa, representing 36 operators in bc and washington said in a press release. News of another calf is creating hope that the endangered southern resident orca population is on the right track. The baby boom follows three years without a successful birth. \" this year we've had the youngest mother on record give birth, a 10-year-old, and three of the oldest. Now we've got a grandma having a baby. Forty is definitely the new 30 among the southerns, \" harris said. The latest birth raises puget sound's orca population to 82, harris said. The 83rd member is l-pod whale lolita, who is currently in captivity in miami"

        "summary": "The mediterranean diet is seen as one of the world's healthiest. Now, however, a new report suggests a surprising irony: kids who live in the mediterranean region are among the most overweight children in the world. For example, 43 % of 9-year-old boys and girls in cyprus are overweight or obese, reports the guardian, while the figure in greece, spain, and italy is just slightly lower. The problem isn't the mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruit, vegetables, fish, and olive oil, and has been heralded for its health benefits, says study author dr. João breda of the world health organization. Instead, the issue is that mediterranean kids no longer eat the diet themselves and consume too much sugar, salt, and fat. Plus, they don't get enough exercise. \" the mediterranean diet for the children in these countries is gone, \" said breda. \" those who are close to the mediterranean diet are the swedish kids. The mediterranean diet is gone and we need to recover it. \" specifically on obesity, rates for the nations of cyprus, greece, italy, malta, san marino and spain — 18 % to 21 % for boys, and a bit lower for girls — were higher than in the us, where 17 % of kids are considered obese, reports cnn. The study looked at 250,000 children from 34 countries between 2015 and 2017. Breda says the results weren't all bad. Researchers have seen a slight decline in childhood obesity rates in greece, italy, and spain since the study period. This \" conveys a strong sign of hope that if we do the right things and implement powerful solutions, the problem can be solved, \" he says. ( the mediterranean diet can be pricey to follow. )",

In a paper published in the journal of anatomy, they confirm the existence of the knee's anterolateral ligament.

To put segond's theory to the test, dr. Steven claes and dr. Johan bellemans dissected the knees of 41 cadavers. Science daily reports they found the all — which sits toward the front and side of the knee, and connects the femur and anterolateral tibia — in 40, or 97 %, of them. ( you can see a somewhat grisly photo here. ) but the news isn't just neat, it's potentially quite useful: the surgeons say their findings help explain why those who have treated an acl injury still have issues, specifically experiencing \" pivot shifts, \" in which the knee gives way. Based on the all's structure and location, the doctors assert that an all injury may be what causes the pivot shift. The men plan to next develop a method of repairing injured alls.

Analysis of a mineral called jadeite that was embedded in fragments recovered after the explosion show that the asteroid's parent body struck a larger asteroid at a relative speed of some 3,000 mph ( 4,800 kph ). \" this impact might have separated the chelyabinsk asteroid from its parent body and delivered it to the earth, \" lead researcher shin ozawa, with the university of tohoku in japan, wrote in a paper published this week in the journal scientific reports.

His study in plos one concludes that female mammals have the innate ability to determine the sex of their offspring. It's not a conscious decision — the expectant moms somehow factor in a host of environmental and societal factors. The upshot is that if they think a male would grow up to play a dominant role in the pack, they ' ll have a boy and thus lots of offspring. If they're not so sure, they ' ll go with a girl, who likely will have at least a few babies even if she's not a dominant member of her group. \"which means females are really the ones controlling the situation, \" says stanford biologist joseph garner, whose team analyzed nine decades of breeding records from mammals at the san diego zoo. \" if i ' m producing nothing but daughters, i ' m making a safe bet — i ' m going to make the average, \" he explains to science daily. Sons, however, are \" high risk, high reward \" because non-dominant males might get shut out from breeding entirely. High reward, indeed: females who produced the most males had up to 2.7 times the number of grandchildren as those with even numbers of male and female offspring, livescience reports. Though there isn't much evidence on how the theory applies to us, garner says humans \" are definitely doing this, too... There's no question. \"",

People there with the hereditary condition — marked by a reduction or faulty distribution of melanin, which lends pigment to one's eyes, skin, and hair — have been raped, harassed, and slain, with at least 18 albinos murdered during that timeline ( cnn notes that four, including a baby, were killed in april alone ) and five albinos still missing. And, in a gruesome twist, the body parts culled from these murders are often sold to witch doctors and others to feed superstitious beliefs, fetching as much as $ 75,000 for a \" complete set \" ( including all four limbs, ears, nose, tongue, and the genitals ), per the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies. This macabre practice and treatment of albinos overall arises from the rampant superstition surrounding the condition: a dangerous belief that having sex with an albino woman can cure hiv has led to rapes, while another myth centers on albino bones containing gold, magical traits, or medicinal properties, the post notes. And what is local law enforcement doing to protect the albino population in malawi? not much, per amnesty international, which claims in a new report that the government and police are doing almost nothing to educate citizens or keep the albino population safe from \" albino hunters. \" the problem is getting so bad, in face, that one albinism expert tells al jazeera she fears the worst: albino extinction in certain areas of southern africa, a possibility even put forth by the un, per cnn.

Along with the two surviving baby penguins were thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs. Researchers say the problem was more summer sea ice than usual, which forced adult penguins to trek dozens of extra miles to hunt for food. It's not the first time a tragedy like this has affected the colony of 40,000 adélie penguins in east antarctica. In 2013, there were more than 20,000 breeding pairs and not a single surviving chick, according to the independent. Record summer sea ice was a problem then too, as was \" unprecedented \" rain that left chicks wet and frozen. The likes of the two \" catastrophic breeding events \" of the past four years hadn't been seen prior in more than 50 years of observation. While antarctica as a whole is seeing record low sea ice, that hasn't been the case around the adélie penguin colony after a chunk of ice the size of luxembourg broke off in 2010 and changed ocean currents and ice formation. One researcher now says \" the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis. \" two-dozen nations and the eu will vote on the creation of a marine protected area next week to at least keep krill fisheries away from the colony, whose main food source is krill, the bbc reports.
