        "summary": "With the republican plan to replace obamacare in retreat, the next phase of the fight hinges on the wonky-sounding factor of \" cost-saving reduction payments. \" as the new york times explains, these are subsidies paid by the federal government to insurers to defray costs for lower-income policy holders. President trump, referring to them as \" bailouts, \" has threatened to end them, a move that would roil the markets. Gop sen. Lamar alexander has implored trump not to do that, and he says the senate health committee will start work in september — with democrats — on legislation to \" stabilize and strengthen the individual health market \" for 2018. A similar bipartisan push to shore up the markets is underway in the house. In the meantime, uncertainty about the subsidies and other factors is already pushing up projected premiums for 2018, reports the wall street journal. In the worst cases, the newspaper cites requests by big insurers to raise premiums 30 % in idaho, west virginia, south carolina, iowa, and wyoming, and hikes of 20 % in new mexico, tennessee, north dakota, and hawaii. These are preliminary rate requests and could change by the time they're finalized at the end of september. Trump has made no secret that he'd like to see the affordable care act \" implode, \" and cutting off the subsidies is one way to help make that happen. Whether he can do so legally, however, is a matter still being hammered out in the courts, notes the washington post. In fact, a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that attorneys general from 16 states who support the subsidies can weigh in on the case, which doesn't bode well for trump's threat.

Flair is 68 now and out of the ring — in fact, he's currently recuperating from an undisclosed life-threatening health scare, notes the charlotte observer — and for years wrestling fans expected one of his sons, especially reid, to continue the family legacy. But in the wake of reid's death from a drug overdose in 2013, something unexpected has happened: that legacy is being carried on by flair's 31-year-old daughter, charlotte. Indeed, she has become the \" standard-bearer for the women's revolution inside wwe's big business, \" writes schilling in a profile. It's safe to say few predicted this. When charlotte first began to wrestle, she was forbidden from using the family stage name of flair. ( her real name is ashley fliehr, with \" charlotte \" borrowed from the city in which she was born. ) she recalls being booed out of an arena as recently as 2015 by fans who thought she was coasting on her father's reputation. \" so that night, when i went to the hotel, i was crying.

        "summary": "It's been two weeks since sandy slammed the nj/ny region, and she's still making news, some good, some bad. The latest: gas rationing will be a thing of the past in new jersey as of 6am tomorrow. Chris christie, who instituted the odd-even days on nov. 3, said there are no longer any lines, and there is enough gas, reports the star-ledger. Gov. Andrew cuomo has revealed the figure he'd like the federal government to hand over to help his battered state: $ 30 billion. The new york times breaks down some of what that would go to, from $ 3.5 billion for bridge, tunnel, and subway repair to $ 1 billion for police and emergency workers ' overtime. It could be a tough sell, reports the times, as congress, which isn't too sweet on the idea of additional spending these days, would have to ok the figure. Not yet a thing of the past: power outages. As of today, more than 70,000 customers of long island power authority are sans electricity. And they may not get it back anytime soon. Lipa says some 46,300 of those customers suffered water damage to electrical panels and wiring; their service can't be restored without an inspection and possibly repairs, reports the ap. And two lighter stories from the ap, both with a slightly macabre streak: disaster tourists have been on the scene in staten island, gawking at the destruction. One homeowner said she felt \" violated. \" another says \" it's like we're at the zoo. \" how to spot a gawker? look for the camera... And clean clothes and shoes. And new york city's comedians are starting to use the storm as fodder. A sample joke about nyc post-sandy, compliments of dave attell. \" it was dark. Toilets were backing up....

In making the case for federal aid, the governor's advisers provided a staggering inventory of need as the city and state continued to rebuild in the storm's deadly wake: $ 3.5 billion to repair the region's bridges, tunnels and subway and commuter rail lines; $ 1.65 billion to rebuild homes and apartment buildings; $ 1 billion to reimburse local governments for overtime costs of police, fire and other emergency personnel; and several billion dollars in federal loans and grants to affected businesses. In all, hurricane sandy caused more than $ 50 billion in damage in the new york region, according to cuomo administration officials, making it the country's costliest storm other than hurricane katrina, which devastated the gulf coast region in 2005.

The mummified pleistocene canid — almost certainly an extinct species — is believed to have been killed by a landslide near the village of tumat, according to science alert. A member of the research team studying the puppy says it was \" preserved from nose to tail, including the hair. \" but an autopsy conducted after washing \" thousands of years of mud and dirt \" off the tumat puppy at the geological institute in moscow revealed an even more surprising degree of preservation: the canid's brain is still 70 % to 80 % intact, discovery reports. Scientists, who've never before been able to study such a well-preserved specimen, are hoping to find ancient bacteria in the puppy's stomach and learn about ancient parasites from the ticks in its fur. But hwang woo-suk, who the telegraph describes as a \" controversial korean scientist, \" wants to go even further. Hwang, who's building a cloning facility in china, took samples of the tumat puppy's muscle, skin, and cartilage in the hopes of bringing back the extinct species. \" he was very excited, \" science alert quotes a member of the research team as saying. Archaeology reports that researchers believe the tumat puppy was once someone's pet, as tools, evidence of a fire, and the remains of butchered animals were found nearby.",

Per usa today, o'donnell tweeted a link on saturday to an online game that invites players to \" push trump off a cliff again, \" an apparent maga riff. And users can do just that, not only sending trump over a precipice, but also choosing alternate demises for the president, such as watching him plummet into hot lava, get devoured by a t. Rex, or fall down a nyc manhole ( play this version long enough and a giant \" t \" falls into the street, ostensibly from trump tower ). As he falls into whichever abyss the user has chosen, he yells phrases such as \" bye! \" and \" i ' m really rich! \" per huffpo, the game was designed by california app creator justin hook, whose twitter bio notes he used to write for the fox animated series bob's burgers. The game has already been played nearly 3 million times ( and the site's counter continues to quickly rise in real time ) since it was apparently launched last wednesday, when hook tweeted: \" if you've ever felt like pushing trump off a cliff, then this zen game i built is for you. \" trump supporters and conservatives in general aren't amused. \" gross, \" noted a tuesday post on sean hannity's blog, which called o'donnell a \" rabid-leftist \" and accused her of sharing \" heinous anti-trump content \" in the past. Meanwhile, a young conservatives post laments that \" sadly, violence has become an acceptable form of dissent for liberals these days, \" cataloging kathy griffin's brouhaha and a trump-themed shakespeare play as examples.",

The initiative, which will go into effect next month, slaps a 2 % tax on food with little or no nutritional value, including soda, chips, and cookies, and is paired with the elimination of a 5 % sales tax on fresh fruit and vegetables, mother jones reports. Navajos say the move, which was approved last fall despite lobbying from the beverage industry, should serve as a model for other tribes, reports the guardian, which notes that around a third of navajo nation residents are diabetic or pre-diabetic and more than 50 % in some age groups are obese. But eating healthy isn't easy on the huge reservation, which includes parts of arizona, utah, and new mexico: there are just 10 full-service grocery stores in an area the size of west virginia, and much of their inventory consists of junk food, advocates say. The $ 1 million a year that the tax is expected to raise will be used for projects like community gardens and farmers markets to make healthy eating easier. Navajo nation council delegate jonathan nez tells mother jones that the new tax has already started a conversation on \" how to take better care of yourself, how to return back to the way we used to live, with fresh produce, vegetables, and fruit along with our own traditional unprocessed foods. \" ( another big problem for the navajo: old uranium mines. )",

        "summary": "Hackers helped themselves to $ 81 million from the federal reserve bank of new york last month — but the massive theft could have been far worse if not for a typo, reports reuters. Investigators say the heist began when the hackers breached the security systems of bangladesh bank and then, posing as the bangladeshi bankers, requested dozens of large transfers from the new york fed. About $ 81 million had gone through to entities in the philippines before red flags up went because the hackers had written \" fandation \" instead of \" foundation \" on one of the transfers. Routing bank deutsche bank caught the error, got suspicious, and alerted the bangladesh central bank, which put a stop to the transfer. In total, hackers had put in almost three dozen transfer requests and planned to steal another $ 850 million to $ 870 million. A bangladeshi official tells the wall street journal that \" some \" money has been recovered, but the hackers — who experts suspect are from outside bangladesh and spied on bank workers to gain information on the bank's systems — remain at large. The fed, however, may face consequences. Bangladesh's finance minister says the country is considering a lawsuit against the american bank for not stopping the transactions earlier. \" we kept money with the federal reserve bank and irregularities must be with the people who handle the funds there, \" he tells bloomberg. \"it can't be that they don't have any responsibility. \" a rep for the fed says \" the payment instructions in question were fully authenticated \" by money-transfer system swift.

        "summary": "When your pilot announces your flight's cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, that shouldn't be a manchurian candidate-like cue for someone's actual feet to emerge. It's not clear if that's why jessie char suddenly found a fellow passenger's tootsies poking into her row of seats during a jetblue flight from long beach, calif., to san francisco on tuesday, but whatever the reason, char felt compelled to share her experience via twitter. People reports on what happened, with char first posting about her luck at having no one sitting next to her. \" my two favorite people to sit with on a plane, \" she tweeted, showing a pic of the two empty seats beside her. Then, a few hours later, a more-cryptic message — \" you guys will never guess what happened next \" — followed by a photo of what people describes as \" squirming digits with cracked red nail polish. \" \" the toes were in full wiggle, \" char noted, per today. \" today, i flew on the set of a nightmare, \" she added on twitter. She tells people she didn't bother ratting out the owner of the feet, whom she described as a \" very short \" woman in her mid-40s. \" we were in the section with extra legroom, so there was no way she didn't have enough room for her legs, \" char says, noting the woman even used one of her feet at one point to open the window shade. The feet finally disappeared back into their rightful row about 10 minutes later when a flight attendant came strolling down the aisle, char says. She hopes her viral tweet will keep others from doing this, adding: \" i tried not to breathe super heavily \" while the feet were around.",

A virginia state delegate is proposing a bill that would require some members of school staff to carry guns, the washington post reports. Robert g. Marshall's bill is in direct response to the recent rampage, and he proposed it after gov. Bob mcdonnell first brought up the idea of allowing school staff to carry concealed weapons. Under marshall's proposed law, gun-toting employees would need to have permits and be certified in safety. Concealed carry is currently legal in virginia, but not at schools. In tennessee, state sen. Frank niceley plans to introduce a similar bill. His would require all schools to have at least one armed staffer, preferably a secretly-armed teacher — so that a gunman wouldn't know who was armed. The bill would also allow schools to pay to train such teachers. Tennessee gov.

But the 41st anniversary of her death monday finally brought \" closure. \" los angeles police say klaas ' killer has been identified as kenneth troyer, who died in 1982, using a controversial dna-testing technique. Authorities say troyer — seen walking near klaas ' home in the days before the crime — sexually assaulted and strangled the 32-year-old mother of two in her home, reports the los angeles times. She died five days later. Troyer has been linked to other sexual assaults in california, police say, but was never required to submit his dna to a database. However, police were able to compile a dna profile in 2009 and began searching for similar dna among relatives of convicts, known as \" familial dna, \" as a \" last resort \" in 2011, per the washington post. Last year, their efforts led them to troyer, who escaped from prison, where he was serving time for burglary, on the sixth anniversary of klaas ' assault in 1982 and was later shot and killed. \" familial dna search is the only reason troyer was identified in this horrific crime, \" a sheriff tells the ap. \" i couldn't be more blown away with the technology, \" says klaas ' eldest son, adding he can now \" experience the joy of closure. \" \" i always had hope that i would find out [ who killed klaas ], \" adds bill medley. \" it's just nice to close the book on this. \" ( a trial for a 1984 murder is ongoing. )",

( associated press ) los angeles ( ap ) — more than four decades after the ex-wife of righteous brothers singer bill medley was raped and killed, officials announced monday they used dna to identify a suspect in the slaying: a man who was killed by police in 1982. Los angeles county sheriff jim mcdonnell said investigators believe kenneth eugene troyer was responsible for the january 1976 slaying of karen klaas. The 32-year-old was attacked jan. 30, 1976, as she returned to her home in the hermosa beach neighborhood, was sexually assaulted and strangled with her pantyhose. She never regained consciousness and died a few days later at the hospital. Investigators used a controversial dna testing technique, known as familial dna, to compare a sample of dna that was collected at the crime scene and were able to identify a \" first-degree relative \" of troyer, sheriff's capt. Steve katz said. Officials would not identify the relative and would only say the sample they used was in a state database of convicted felons. The technique, which has raised ethical issues in the forensics community, allows investigators to search law enforcement databases to identify likely relatives of the person who may have committed the crime. Law enforcement officials have argued the technique can provide investigators with valuable leads. \" because of the familial dna search, detectives were able to link troyer's dna and positively confirm his identity as the killer, \" mcdonnell said monday as he stood alongside medley and more than a dozen other law enforcement officials. \" familial dna search is the only reason troyer was identified in this horrific crime. \" troyer, who had been suspected of committing several other sexual assaults in california, was shot and killed by police after escaping from a california prison in 1982, mcdonnell said.

        "summary": "Nancy pelosi continues to face a revolt from within her own party. Sixteen house democrats released a letter monday vowing not to vote for her as speaker, the washington post reports. It's unclear exactly how many democrat votes pelosi will need to prevail in her bid to once again serve as speaker of the house, since four races remain undecided; if the current leads hold in those races, democrats ( who are currently confirmed to have won 232 seats ) will have won 233 seats. That's a 16-seat majority, meaning pelosi could only afford to lose 15 democrat votes. The post does more math: one of the letter's signers, ben mcadams, is actually trailing his republican opponent and may not end up getting a vote; but there are also at least six other democrats who have publicly expressed opposition to pelosi but did not sign the letter. \" we are thankful to leader pelosi for her years of service to our country and to our caucus, \" the group of 16 writes. \" however, we also recognize that in this recent election, democrats ran on and won on a message of change. \" it continues, \" our majority came on the backs of candidates who said that they would support new leadership because voters in hard-won districts, and across the country, want to see real change in washington. We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise. \" politico frames pelosi's speaker bid as being \" in serious jeopardy, \" but not everyone is convinced; allies predict pelosi will \" wear down \" her opponents.

The only problem is, he didn't know cylvia hayes had had three previous marriages, not two — and that the third one was to an ethiopian immigrant looking to get his green card, the oregonian reports. \" seventeen years ago, i made a serious mistake by committing an illegal act when i married a person so that he could retain residency in the united states, \" she said in an emailed statement yesterday. \" it was a marriage of convenience. He needed help, and i needed financial support \" ( she reportedly received about $ 5,000 ). Such a marriage is a federal crime if the government determines the marriage is a \" sham \" just so one of the parties can stay in the us, the oregonian notes. Questions arose after willamette week started digging around and found court records about the unacknowledged third marriage. Hayes, who held a tearful press conference yesterday, says in her statement she was in a \" difficult and unstable period \" in which she \" was associating with the wrong people \" when she married abraham b. Abraham in 1997; she was 29, he was an 18-year-old who wanted to get his math degree.

If he has a take-home test, he can usually google the answers. In a typical day, he says, \"i just play sports, maybe go to the gym. Eat. Probably drink a little bit. Just kind of goof around all day. \" his gpa? 3.3. His story illustrates a growing problem with undergrad business programs across the country: seen as a \" default major \" by many, more students are gravitating toward business degrees — and finding themselves able to skate through the curriculum. In a lengthy collaborative article, the new york times and the chronicle of higher education examine the problem. Business is the most popular field of study in the us, with more than 20 % of all bachelor's degrees awarded annually falling under the business umbrella, but business majors spend fewer than 11 hours a week studying outside of class — less time than students in any other broad field. They also, ironically enough, score lower on the gmat — the entry exam for mba programs — than students in other majors. Some of the blame lies with students, many of whom choose to study business out of a desire to get a job rather than a desire to actually learn about business. But professors also contribute to the problem by assigning too many group projects and often not having a clear idea of what the students in their classes should learn.

        "summary": "Russian men have an unfortunate tradition of drinking themselves to an early death. As bleak as the number are — life expectancy for russian men was 65 in 2012, compared with 76 in the us and 74 for china, notes quartz — researchers have spotted improvement of late. And oddly, they attribute it to a short-lived crackdown on booze three decades ago, one that seems to have permanently shifted a large number of men away from vodka and hard liquor to beer. As they explain in a post via northwestern university's kellogg insight, it began with restrictions put into place in the soviet union by mikhail gorbachev in 1985. Among other things, he substantially raised the price of vodka, resulting in a 60 % drop in sales. The cost of beer also went up, but less so, and its sales fell 29 %. The restrictions were abandoned when the soviet union collapsed in 1991, but, along with an exploding international beer market around that time, they seem to have left a lasting mark on males who came of age back then. To this day, consumers who were between 16 and 22 when the rules were in place — at least in urban areas where illicit moonshine was harder to come by — generally prefer beer over harder alcohol. Since the early 2000s, male mortality rates in russia have dropped by about a third, and the researchers attribute 60 % of that effect to this shift away from vodka. The lead researcher says it's particularly compelling that the policy most affected younger men whose preferences were still forming. \" there are lots of studies showing that an intended policy didn't work at all, \" he says. In this case, though, it appears that for many men, it did. ( in the us, craft brewers have a hops problem. )",

Not only does alcohol lead russian men to die on average 12 years earlier than american men; it also causes them to die sooner than their counterparts in highly impoverished nations such as bangladesh and north korea ( by five years and two years, respectively ). In fact, the world health organization has found that every fifth death among russian men is due to alcohol abuse. This can come in many forms, such as alcohol poisoning, drunk-driving accidents, or a booze-fueled homicide. But some russian men appear to be escaping the worst of these effects, thanks to a short-lived government restriction on alcohol that ended 25 years ago. How could a brief and long-defunct intervention be affecting public health today? that is the question at the core of recent research from lorenz kueng, an assistant professor of finance at the kellogg school. To find the answer, he investigated soviet-era alcohol policy, historic patterns in russian moonshine consumption, and present-day alcohol preferences. \" public policies aimed at young consumers can affect them both in the short- and long-term by changing their consumption preferences. \" related reading sizing up the nightlife a study of status distinction goes together like guilt and pleasure guilty pleasures may be the best kind surveying sensitive topics new tools help",

Less than two weeks after the legalization of recreational marijuana across canada brought news that us border officials would bar pot-smoking canucks from heading south, the first canadians have been turned away, reports the cbc. \" it is a fairly serious concern, \" says mayor roy ludwig of estevan, saskatchewan, 10 miles north of a north dakota border crossing. Ludwig says several area residents have been questioned by us officials about past cannabis use. He describes \" a couple of cases \" where residents have been turned away, including one involving a man who admitted to smoking marijuana 30 years ago ( when it wasn't legal ), \" thinking it was amusing, \" per global news. \" he was then taken in, had his vehicle searched, and was turned away. \" \" as long as they are not under the influence should they be penalized for something that is legal in their country? \" ludwig asks. \" it seems a little harsh. \" us customs and border protection doesn't agree. A rep tells npr the agency is simply enforcing federal law deeming marijuana a controlled substance. The rep adds there hasn't been \" a noticeable spike \" in canadians turned away at the border this year, though ludwig worries that could change. \" are they going to have to lie? i hope it doesn't come to that, \" he says. A toronto immigration lawyer tells the cbc his advice: don't lie. Rather than risk a permanent ban from the us for lying to agents, canadians who partake should refrain from answering marijuana questions. They may not get into the us, but at least they won't get into trouble. ( an illegal toke came an hour into legalization. )",

Treasury officials haven't released any details on the source of the donation, which brought public contributions toward the debt to a total of almost $ 3.9 million for the last fiscal year, according to official figures. Contributions to the public debt reduction fund trickle in throughout the year, usa today reports, though they amount to just a drop in a bucket big enough for king kong to bathe in: the debt now stands at more than $ 18.6 trillion, and forbes estimates that the interest alone grows by around $ 1 million per minute. The debt donors in the first six months of the year included five republican members of congress and three democrats who gave a total of almost $ 56,000, usa today notes. The biggest giver, rep. Chris gibson, a new york republican, hands over $ 4,357.37 every month. \" he donates his military pension, so he is not — to use the term we use in new york — double-dipping, \" his press secretary says. \" it's cumbersome.

Although there is little question about the outcome, there will certainly be a great deal of finger pointing as politicians from both sides of the aisle attempt to use the issue to gain political points with their constituents. In this article, we will explain the debt ceiling; examine a few rules that govern it, discuss the current national debt, and reveal what could happen if congress fails to raise it. Debt ceiling 101 the debt limit — a.k.a. The debt ceiling — is the maximum amount of debt that the department of the treasury can issue to the public and to other federal agencies. Congress has raised the debt ceiling 74 times since march 1962 and even suspended it on occasion. The government's debt ceiling is very similar in concept to an individual's credit card limit, with a few wrinkles. One wrinkle is that not all of the government's debt is subject to the debt ceiling. Which debt is subject to the ceiling? which type of debt is subject to the debt ceiling and which is not? according to the congressional budget office, there are two types of debt subject to the statutory limit: debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts. Debt held by the public consists of u.s.",

        "summary": "Black box data from the doomed lion air flight that crashed in indonesia last month, killing all 189 on board, shows the pilots struggled mightily to regain control of the boeing 737, the new york times reports. From almost the moment it took off, \" the pilots fought continuously until the end of the flight, \" says an official with the crash investigation. Jagged lines in graphs contained in a preliminary report crash investigators are preparing to release wednesday show the airplane's nose being pushed down at least two dozen times, the pilots pulling it back up each time, before its final, fatal nose-dive into the java sea. The black box data is consistent with the theory so far on what happened to flight 610: sensors on the fuselage sent incorrect information to the plane's anti-stall system and, due to that erroneous information, the system forced the nose down again and again. The maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or mcas, was a new computerized system installed on boeing 737 max planes, the latest generation of the 737; the automated system was meant to force a plane's nose down if it went too high in order to prevent the plane from stalling. But pilots have complained that boeing did not warn them that, in case of a nose being forced down improperly, the mcas requires a different response from pilots than the system used on older plane models. Boeing has said the problem could have been addressed using existing emergency procedures and insists 737 max planes are safe, bloomberg reports. As for the potentially malfunctioning sensor, the doomed plane had experienced incorrect data readings on its three previous flights — even after the sensor was replaced, cbs news reports.

A south korean cable tv channel broke the news thursday, saying the apparent defection of 12 waitresses and their manager from a restaurant in china in 2016 was not made by choice. \" it was luring and kidnapping, and i know because i took the lead, \" says heo kang-il, the former manager. \" i blackmailed them and told them to make a choice: ' if you return home, you die, and if you follow me, you live. ' i am now remorseful for what i did. \" three women appeared with him, their faces blurred, and confirmed his story. \" i want to go home, because living like this is not the life i wanted, \" said one of the women. \" i miss my parents. \" like heo, the women were among thousands of north koreans who took foreign jobs to send money back to their government. Heo says south korea's intelligence service then offered him big rewards to take the women south, but the rewards never came. And critics say the south only engineered the defections to trumpet them before parliamentary elections, reuters reports. Now south korea is in a tricky position after refusing north korea's many demands to have the women repatriated. But for heo, it seems to be revenge. \" they had me believe that this was a big patriotic operation, \" he says. \" but they used me and then shot me in the back. \"",

The defection of 12 waitresses and their manager from a north korean restaurant in china was one of the biggest mass defection cases involving north koreans in years.

After a year of sharply rising tension and fears of war over north korea's defiant nuclear and missile tests, inter-korean relations have improved dramatically this year. The two koreas held their first summit in years in late april. North korea and the united states are due to hold their first ever summit in singapore on june 12.

It turns out north korea has just 28 domain names, including sites for state-owned air koryo and kim il sung university and what looks to be a social networking site called friend, reports motherboard. To put that in perspective, there are an estimated 1 billion websites worldwide and more than 140 million.com and.net domains. \" we knew about most of these, but weren't sure what else existed, \" a north korean researcher tells the bbc. \" when north korea brings up a new website they never publicize it.

Bothell high school shop teacher calvin pygott, 63, was found by a fellow teacher in the hall outside his classroom. He claimed he had been knocked unconscious from behind and woke up covered in blood with a head wound and a zip-tie around his neck. According to q13, school was closed for a day and extra security was brought in. At the time, the district superintendent called it a \" really difficult and emotionally wrenching \" experience for staff, kuow reports. But pygott told q13 in may that he wasn't going to let it \" turn me into a victim. \" that's probably true, as it looks more likely to turn him into a criminal. Police say there were holes in pygott's story from the beginning. On wednesday, he was asked to take a polygraph test, then invited to make a new statement. Pygott allegedly confessed to staging the whole thing: injuring himself, placing the zip-tie around his neck, and leaving a note that said \" this man is not god. \" pygott was placed on administrative leave thursday and could be charged with making false statements and obstruction. It's unclear why pygott, who created an award-winning carpentry program, would fake an attack on himself. Police haven't said whether he told them his motivation.

The ap reports that no cause of death has been determined for the 56-year-old former child star, and an autopsy is pending. The harrison county sheriff's office says emergency workers found her around 4pm after receiving a call about an unresponsive female. The recent life of moran, best known for her role as joanie cunningham, is as mysterious as her death, reports the indianapolis star. She moved to indiana with husband steve fleischmann in 2011, but is believed to have struggled with homelessness after being kicked out of the trailer they shared with fleischmann's mother. Moran is believed to have died in her mother-in-law's trailer park, where she had apparently been living again in recent months. Neighbors at the park in corydon, ind., tell people that she was always friendly, but \" kind of hibernated at the end \" and hadn't been seen outside much lately. Former donna reed show actor paul petersen, founder of a support group for former child actors, says moran's troubles were \" many and complex \" and at least six former child stars tried to reach out to her in the week before her death, reports the new york daily news. \" oh erin...

        "summary": "Twenty months after washington voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use, the first licenses for legal sales will be issued today, and sales will start tomorrow, as early as 8am. Seattle will have just one pot shop to start; vancouver will have as many as three; tacoma could have four. Why the difference? many would-be operators weren't ready for the inspections and other requirements regulated by the washington state liquor control board, the new york times reports. The first wave will see only about 20 licenses distributed of the 334 that could eventually be doled out — and the stores that do open won't have much product, because marijuana growers were just issued their own licenses in march and haven't produced much. What they do have to sell won't be edible; no marijuana food producers will be licensed by the state until the rules are revisited. What does that mean for customers? high prices — an ounce of dried marijuana, the legal maximum you can buy, will probably cost you at least $ 400 — and probably rationing, with some retailers only allowing each person to buy a tiny fraction of an ounce. You can't get it any cheaper or in any greater quantity by growing it at home — the law doesn't allow home growing. And you ' ll have to know where to look if you want to go shopping: stores can only have one small sign outside, with no products visible from the street or sidewalk, the seattle times reports, and they can't be near schools, parks, or libraries. If you do find one, you can't bring anyone under 21 inside with you, but you can bring tourists — they can make purchases the same as a washington resident, but they might have a hard time finding a place to actually smoke the pot, as it can't be consumed in \" view of the general public. \" for more info, see the ap's q&a.",

Mitchell \" has a personality that is much larger than i've ever encountered, \" testified a former cop who ran into mitchell, his wife, and smart on the street. \" he gave me a look that was so intimidating, so encompassed, he stopped me before i could say hello. \" jurors also watched a tape of a two-hour interrogation of mitchell after his arrest. In it, he tells cops that smart was \" delivered to us \" \" by the power of god \" and derided the authorities ' case against him, saying \" it mattereth not...

            "The man charged in the 2002 abduction of elizabeth smart told investigators that heaven was his home and god had delivered him a young girl to become as his wife, according to recordings of a police interview after his arrest. Brian david mitchell, 57, told police his name was immanuel david isaiah. He referred to smart by the religious name \" shear jashub \" but refused to say he had kidnapped her. \" by the power of god she was delivered to us, \" mitchell said repeatedly to police. The account came during a two-hour tape played for jurors monday as mitchell's federal trial on charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor across state lines entered its third week. In the recording, mitchell fends off questions about smart's abduction and whether they had sex by spinning religious phrases and comparing his situation to that of apostles who suffered for following jesus christ, or to the persecution heaped on christ himself. \" it mattereth not what you are saying and how good you think this case is against me, because god has the power to deliver me, \" mitchell said during the interview. Smart was 14 when she was taken from her home at knifepoint on june 5, 2002. She was recovered march 12, 2003, after motorists spotted smart on a suburban salt lake city street with mitchell and his now-estranged wife, wanda eileen barzee. In her testimony last week, smart said mitchell used a jagged-edged knife to threaten her life and that of her family, before taking her and keeping her tethered on a metal cable. She said she endured nearly daily rapes during her nine months of captivity, was forced to use drugs and alcohol, and was taken against her will to california. Now, 23, smart also said mitchell proclaimed he was a religious prophet who would usher in the second-coming of jesus christ. \" you want to accuse me of being a diabolical, evil criminal.... I am a servant of the lord, \" mitchell insisted to police. \" she's had a glorious experience. \" police scoffed at mitchell's responses and said christ would not have lied about his identity, threatened to kill children or taken a young girl by force to have sex. Fbi agent george dougherty called mitchell a hypocrite and a fraud in the interview. \" you are not a servant of jesus christ and you need to get over that, \" dougherty said, his voice rising.

This summer, the international space station will become host to the coldest spot in the universe when nasa delivers a chamber that is more than 100 million times colder than deep space, which is itself far chillier than the lowest temperatures on earth. The cold atom laboratory, about the size of an ice chest, is scheduled to fly to the iss in august after a few more tests at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, reports space.com. The lab will be equipped with lasers, a vacuum chamber, and an electromagnetic knife capable of almost freezing atoms in place at a temperature just a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, which is -459.67 degrees fahrenheit, reports yahoo. The goal isn't to see how violently a person can shiver, since no human could survive such conditions. Rather, at this state, atoms are expected to form a \" superfluid \" state of matter known as a bose-einstein condensate and converge into waves. This has been witnessed on earth, but gravity limits the effects to fractions of a second. In space, scientists believe a bose-einstein condensate will be visible for five to 10 seconds. These atoms could \" have the potential to unlock many mysteries beyond the frontiers of known physics, \" a deputy project manager says. \" especially exciting \" is the prospect of detecting dark energy, per a release. Cal experiments could also lead to improvements in sensors, quantum computers, and atomic clocks. ( next: an inflatable shield for mars? )",

She is suing steve for a lengthy list of things, including child endangerment, torture, conspiracy against rights, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract and even \" soul murder. \" the lawsuit states: \" soul murder is achieved by a combination of torture, deprivation and brainwashing. \"",

Pay me $ 60 million! steve harvey's ex-wife sues, he owes me $ 60 million for murdering my soul exclusive 6: 08 am pt -- steve's attorney brandon williams tells tmz, \" mr. Harvey vehemently denies any allegations set forth in the lawsuit. The complaint is meritless, frivolous and the allegations are completely false. We will vigorously defend/counterclaim against the complaint. \" steve harvey has caused his second ex-wife much more than mental anguish... According to a new lawsuit she's filed he damaged her \" soul \" and now owes her $ 60 million. Mary harvey and steve's infamously bitter divorce was finalized back in 2005, but according to docs filed wednesday... Mary's still feeling a slew of ill-effects from their battle. She says she's been suicidal and self-medicates to cope with their nasty breakup. The suit is rambling at times, but mary's main point is she's emotionally and physically destroyed after losing her son, her businesses, and the joy of mother's days. As she puts it, \" all was loss mary l. Harvey was dead. \" she's suing steve for child endangerment, torture, conspiracy against rights, kidnapping, murder, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Worth noting... The document was not filed by a lawyer, but rather a woman who tells us she is mary's \" civil rights activist. \""

If the obamas had gone to their local shelter, the washington humane society, they wouldn't have found a purebred portuguese water dog. Instead, they might have come home with a pit bull — and that would have been a good thing. The washington humane society, unlike many of its privately funded peers, provides animal control services for the district of columbia. In the 1970s, many private shelters dropped their contracts to provide animal control services, forcing the creation of municipal, publicly funded shelters. Private shelters — not responsible for strays or, in many cases, owner surrenders — can control the number of animals they take in. This allows them to focus on animal welfare, and other donor-friendly programs. Meanwhile, municipal shelters are left with the dirty work of animal control — enforcing laws, housing and returning strays, and, yes, euthanasia. This public-private split is a microcosm of a larger society that not only accepts the privatization of former public services, but also creates two categories of individuals. In this case, pets that are charismatic and easily adoptable end up in private shelters.

The playboy club has officially become the first cancellation of the fall season. A slim three episodes aired, the last of which drew a paltry 3.5 million viewers. Rock center will air in its place, and no, that's not a show about rock-hard bodies. The williams-helmed newsmagazine will debut on halloween night, and will feature harry smith and kate snow as correspondents, along with meredith vieira, matt lauer, and ann curry. Prime suspect reruns will air in the meantime, notes the ap. Some tidbits surrounding the demise: bill zwecker of the chicago sun-times basically predicted it yesterday, calling out the disconnect between what viewers expected the show to be and what it actually was: \" a female-oriented nighttime soap opera. \" so much for confidence: ap reports that williams has been working on his show in anticipation of it launching, as nbc reportedly promised him he'd get a slot when one of its new shows failed. Oh, ouch! our favorite quip comes courtesy of james poniewozik of time: \" in the end, the cancellation was a tribute to the power of voting with one's remote and not watching poorly-written scripts and eddie cibrian's impression of jon hamm as rendered by a wax museum. \"",

Now, nearly four months after the woman was declared brain-dead, obstetricians have delivered a healthy baby boy at 32 weeks, who weighs 5 pounds and 3 ounces, reports the guardian. The birth, which required months of careful medical intervention, has been called \" an extraordinary feat \" by the head of the portuguese society of obstetricians. Doctors have yet to reveal whether the mother is still on life support, per the bbc, but it's the longest a fetus has survived in the womb in portugal to a mother declared brain-dead. The feat isn't without precedent: in 2001, a woman in kentucky gave birth to a healthy full-term daughter eight months after a car crash left her in a coma, and in 2015 a woman in the uk was in a coma for three months following a brain hemorrhage when she woke up to learn that her healthy baby daughter had been delivered six weeks prior. And earlier this year, a baby boy was born in poland to a woman who'd been declared brain-dead of brain cancer 55 days earlier. He was born at 26 weeks, weighing just over two pounds, and his mother was taken off life support soon after.",

Nbc news has reviewed a copy of the report and copies of documents referenced in the report and constructed a timeline that shows how russia warned the u.s. And what the u.s. Did, and didn't do, in response. In march 2011, the fsb, the russian intelligence agency that arose from the remnants of the kgb, sent a cable to the fbi",
            "Washington — after being interrogated for four and a half hours, a 27-year-old chechen man who had just admitted to committing a grisly triple homicide in 2011 with the help of one of the boston marathon bombers was starting to show signs of anxiety. As the chechen man, ibragim todashev, began to write his confession to the murders, an f.b.i. Agent and a massachusetts state police detective in his apartment with him glanced away for a second, and mr. Todashev picked up a table and threw it at the f.b.i. Agent, lacerating the back of his head. Mr. Todashev then dashed into his kitchen and could be heard rummaging through the drawers. Regaining his footing, the agent drew his gun as mr. Todashev, holding a pole over his head, ran at the detective as if trying to impale him. The agent fired at mr. Todashev several times, knocking him down. Despite being shot, he tried to regain his footing and again lunged at the detective. The agent fired at mr. Todashev several more times, fatally wounding him. The description of the shooting in orlando, fla., was included in more than a hundred pages of documents released on tuesday by local investigators in florida and federal officials in washington who were looking into whether the f.b.i. Agent should be charged with killing mr. Todashev. After an"

        "summary": "The movie is called asura, and it's seen as the first attempt by china's burgeoning film industry to put out a genuine hollywood-style blockbuster. One problem: the $ 110 million movie did so poorly in its weekend debut — it pulled in a mere $ 7.1 million — that producers yanked it from all theaters sunday night, reports the hollywood reporter. \" deepest apologies to viewers who did not get a chance to watch the film, as well as to all the chinese and international participants who were involved in its production over the past six years, \" says a statement from the producers, per the guardian. The film was intended to be the first in a franchise based on buddhist mythology, sort of like china's own version of lord of the rings, as thr puts it. The movie even stars lei wu, described by virtually every site covering the flop as a \" teenage heartthrob. \" so what happened? unusually strong competition didn't help, notes the south china morning post, but reviews were generally bad across the board. The producers, however, allege that saboteurs deliberately tanked the movie by flooding review sites with one-star slams. Whatever the reason, movie-watchers might get another chance to see the film down the road. \" we plan to make some changes to the film and release it again, \" a rep from lead producer zhenjian film told one chinese news outlet.
