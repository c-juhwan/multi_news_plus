He did this this morning. \" the bbc notes the video zoomed in on the body a number of times, and blurred only the face. When someone is heard saying he doesn't feel good, a laughing paul is filmed replying, \" what, you never stand next to a dead guy? \" paul tells fans his intention was to look at the spooky side of the forest, and tries to add a sort of psa bent, noting, \" suicide is not a joke. \" he explained the video — which racked up 6.3 million views within its initial 24 hours — wouldn't be monetized, and included suicide prevention information. That didn't quell the rapid and biting criticism: \" logan paul is a disrespectful piece of garbage who further glorified something horrible under the guise of'there's help for you, ' \" reads one twitter post.

        "summary": "Pope francis found himself courting controversy on a recent visit to chile when he defended bishop juan barros, who has been accused of covering up the actions of a pedophile priest. Francis insisted that he considers the allegations against the bishop \" slander \" because nobody has ever come forward with evidence against barros. But now the ap reports that the pope received an eight-page letter in 2015 from a victim in which the man asserts that barros didn't just cover up abuse by the rev. Fernando karadima, he personally witnessed it. Details and developments: the letter: it was written by juan carlos cruz and delivered to to cardinal sean o ' malley, a top papal adviser on the abuse issue, by members of the pope's own commission for the protection of minors in april 2015. \" when we gave him ( o ' malley ) the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns, \" says panel member marie collins. \" and at a later date, he assured us that that had been done. \" in fact, the presentation of the letter to o ' malley was commemorated in a photo. Cruz tells the bbc that he, too, was later assured by o ' malley that the pope had received it. Did he read it? it's impossible to say whether francis actually read the letter, but the new york times lays out the questions: \" did he read the letter and decide not to tell reporters about it? did he choose to believe bishop barros over mr. Cruz? or did he never read the letter, or perhaps read it but forget about it? \" another former commission member calls it all \" willful blindness \" on the part of francis.",

        "summary": "An unusual outbreak has struck japan in the wake of the 2011 tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people — of ghosts, possessions, and exorcisms. Reverend kaneda, the top priest at a zen temple, says he personally exorcised several people who had been invaded by the spirits of tsunami victims, writes richard lloyd parry in the london review of books. Believe the stories or don't, they can be moving and scary: a farmer who flippantly visited the tsunami scene — while eating an ice cream no less — terrified his wife in the coming days by jumping down on all fours, licking the futon, bellowing all night, and saying, \" everyone must die. \" kaneda scolded the farmer for acting foolishly and exorcised the spirit. \" something got hold of you, perhaps the dead who cannot accept yet that they are dead. \" a fire station in tagajo kept getting calls to places that were demolished by the tsunami, until the firefighters prayed for spirits of people who had died — and the calls stopped coming. A sendai cab driver picked up a sad-looking man who wanted to go to an address that had been swept away. The cab driver looked in the mirror and saw that his passenger was gone, but the driver drove there anyway and opened the door for the ghost to leave. Kaneda exorcised one woman of 25 spirits that entered her one after the other. One said he was a father trying to find his daughter when the quake struck. Now he was at \" the bottom of the sea, \" unable to swim up because \" there are bodies all around me. \" according to parry, japan's unspoken religion, the cult of ancestors, may be behind all this. Many japanese keep memorial tablets for dead ancestors — the ihai — and consider them alive in some way. Knowing this, a book publisher who doesn't believe in the supernatural held readings of ghost stories at community centers, where locals could tell their own tales as a form of therapy. \" we provide an alternative for helping people through the power of literature, \" he said.

            "I met a priest in the north of japan who exorcised the spirits of people who had drowned in the tsunami. The ghosts did not appear in large numbers until later in the year, but reverend kaneda's first case of possession came to him after less than a fortnight. He was chief priest at a zen temple in the inland town of kurihara. The earthquake on 11 march 2011 was the most violent that he, or anyone he knew, had ever experienced.

Last week, yasuo takamatsu, 57, got the higher-level diving licence he needs for underwater searches and clearing debris. He decided to start training right away instead of waiting for warmer weather after the authorities made three unsuccessful searches in the last year for his wife yuko's body, the mainichi daily news reports. \" i want to start looking for yuko as soon as i can, tomorrow even, \" he said. \" i ' ll keep diving as many times as it takes. I ' ll get better, a little at a time. \" takamatsu says yuko was at work at a bank when she felt tremors on 11 march. Fearing a tsunami, employees went up to the roof of the 13m ( 42ft ) building - but the wave was reportedly 20m high when it hit the town of onagawa - one of the worst affected areas. Four bank workers were confirmed dead and eight others, including yuko, were declared missing. The town of 11,000 lost around 1,000 people after the catastrophe. Use #newsfromelsewhere"

        "summary": "The ebola outbreak in west africa shows no signs of slowing, having killed at least 4,447. Elsewhere in africa, however, another outbreak of the virus is quietly winding down. It's believed a different strain of ebola first appeared in the democratic republic of congo in late july: a pregnant woman who likely contracted it while butchering wild game died on aug. 11 in the village of ikanamongo, the guardian reports. Though the virus spread, killing 49 of 69 known patients by the ap's count, the last known case was reported some three weeks ago. The world health organization is now on the verge of declaring the outbreak fully contained — thanks in part to a speedy response. A team headed by jean-jacques muyembe was first on the scene. Muyembe, who responded to the first known outbreak in the country in 1976, saw the importance of keeping the virus from spreading to urban areas — which it has now done in the west african outbreak. However, as the mostly isolated drc has seen at least seven ebola outbreaks since 1976 and genetic testing reveals the latest strain is 99.2 % similar to one that appeared in 1995, the country was well-prepared, livescience reports. Before this year, an outbreak had never occurred in guinea, liberia, or sierra leone, where civil conflict, a distrust of government, and well-connected towns and cities have helped ebola spread.

Officials say rafael mccloud, 34 — who escaped from a warren county jail on march 2 with a worker's uniform — was killed by the couple he was holding hostage in a vicksburg home. Police chief walter armstrong tells cbs news that mccloud entered the home through a garage door around 4am thursday and fought a man and woman who were home with their 5-year-old son. The man was stabbed in the shoulder and his wife was hit in the head before both were tied up in a bathroom, reports the vicksburg post. Around 7am, however, the woman either was allowed to leave the room or she freed herself, but either way, she returned with a gun. Police say she fired one shot she thought hit mccloud, then untied her husband, who fired several more shots. The family then flagged down a passing motorist who called 911. Police found mccloud dead in the tub with multiple bullet wounds. \" this community has really been frightened for over a week, and that has come to an end, \" armstrong says, calling the couple's treatment \" torture. \" mccloud, who was indicted in january, escaped from jail after cornering a jail worker with a shank and walked out with a uniform, keys, and radio. A day later, police found the uniform pants at the abandoned hospital where he allegedly killed sharon wilson, 69. Cops are now investigating if mccloud had help on the run. \" he had on a nice white pair of tennis shoes, and he had jeans on that he didn't have when he left jail, \" armstrong says. \" the shoes looked to be the exact size he wears. \"",

The dot on wednesday officially banned vaping \" in all forms, including but not limited to electronic cigars, pipes, and devices designed to look like everyday products such as pens \" on all planes entering, exiting, and flying around the us. The announcement expands on a statement previously issued by the department that it had considered to be \" sufficiently broad to include the use of electronic cigarettes \" but that npr reports was seen by some to have a loophole: it did not explicitly define \" smoking, \" and e-cigarettes release vapor, not smoke. Ars technica notes that no us-based carrier had explicitly allowed the onboard use of e-cigarettes. But the dot's lack of a crystal-clear ruling led to things like the faq on the website for blu ecigs, which asks, \" can you vape on a plane? \" and answers, \" it depends \"; it notes the dot hadn't issued an official ban and instructed fliers to check with individual airlines or ask their flight attendant. In its now-official ban, the dot specifically calls out the \" number of harmful chemicals \" that studies indicate are in aerosol fumes, and it notes that while further research is required to \" fully understand the risks, \" it will take a \" precautionary approach \" in the meantime. Passengers are already barred from both transporting battery-powered portable electronic smoking devices in their checked bags and charging them on board aircraft.

            "After the snowden disclosures, mr. Obama ordered a complete review of spying on allies and partners. In an interview last week, the new director of the n.s.a., adm. Michael s. Rogers, said that review had resulted in the termination of a number of spying operations, not because they were illegal, but because they were unwise. But in conversations with german officials over the past year, the obama administration has made it clear that its commitment extends only to ms. Merkel herself, and not other german officials. That was one of many sources of tension as the two countries, which traditionally share intelligence on terrorism suspects and nuclear proliferation, struggled and failed to reach a new accord. The german parliament is conducting an inquiry into the n.s.a.'s activities in the country, and it heard its first testimony on thursday from two americans who formerly worked for the agency. That testimony came hours after a 27-year-old student in bavaria was identified by name as one of the spy agency's surveillance targets, the first german other than ms. Merkel to be named in that way.

The japanese automaker says the probe was spurred by a whistleblower, and that the situation also allegedly involves representative director greg kelly. As the company explains in a statement cited by reuters, \" the investigation showed that over many years both ghosn and kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the tokyo stock exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of carlos ghosn's compensation. \" kyodo reports ghosn's salary was underreported to the tune of $ 44 million over a five-year period beginning in 2011. The ap reports nissan ceo hiroto saikawa confirmed ghosn was arrested monday after being questioned by tokyo prosecutors. He added the board would vote on removing ghosn and kelly on thursday. Ghosn, 64, is described by the guardian as \" one of the world's most powerful auto bosses \" who \" has managed the seemingly impossible job of running one carmaker in japan, and another in france. \" indeed, he's been ceo of renault since 2005, and led that company along with nissan, where he served as ceo from 2001 until april 2017.

A new study finds that the lake has dense patches of tiny bits of plastic — which just happen to be great sponges for hazardous chemicals. They also look very tasty to birds and fish. The lead university of wisconsin scientist found concentrations up to 1.7 million particles per square mile, 24 % greater than what they turned up in the atlantic ocean, writes john metcalfe. ( all the great lakes are affected, but erie is the worst. ) what's more, the lake's plastic has higher concentrations of toxins known as \" persistent organic pollutants \" than the oceanic plastic, writes hannah franklin at cleveland's scene magazine. The waste comes from standard plastic litter that breaks down into pieces smaller than a grain of sand ( sometimes called \" mermaid tears \" ) and from industrial manufacturing ( these pellets are called \" nurdles \" for some reason ). Depressing stuff, but sarah laskow at grist manages to find a silver lining, or at least a sliver of one: \" great lakes pollution is a little bit easier for people to see and maybe decide to clean up, since they don't want to emerge from a refreshing swim covered in microparticles of trash. \"",

During the trip, the team mummified a pig in the same way moimango and other smoked corpses had been preserved. The process included: scraping the body with a bristly plant draining the gut with a strategically placed bamboo pipe poking tiny holes in the hands and feet to drain bodily fluids, expedited by massaging leaving the body in a smoke-filled hut for a month covering the body in ocher, a form of iron oxide researcher ronald beckett says the anga believe that if the bodies of great people are not handled properly, the dead will roam the jungle and may sabotage hunting excursions or crops. \" the ghost world, \" he tells live science, \" that's a very, very real thing to them. \" still, much remains a mystery about the origins of the practice, writes neubauer.

Police say a man spotted two occupants of a parked car throwing food wrappers on the ground in north minneapolis around 5pm thursday, per minnesota public radio. When the witness attempted to get the car's license plate number, the occupants exited the car and informed the man that they had guns, police say. The man then flagged down officers, who tried to diffuse the situation, but the men in the car raised suspicions when they claimed they couldn't be away from their vehicle because they were awaiting a drone delivery, police say, per the minneapolis star tribune. Citing fear for the safety of the passerby, officers say they then searched the men's vehicle and found a hand grenade, handgun, assault rifles, magazines, and ammunition. Bomb squad personnel determined the ammunition — together with cellphones, computers, drone parts, and other electronic devices in the car — could have been used to build bombs, according to a criminal complaint. Abdullah alrifahe, 27, is now charged with carrying a pistol in public without a permit. ( the star tribune reports he was convicted of the same offense in december. ) jail records show an apparent relative, majid alrifahe, 26, also faces disorderly conduct, misdemeanor assault, and weapons charges stemming from thursday's incident.

Most cases of the virus this year are the result of a mutated variation of the h3n2 strain — so far this season's most commonly reported — and the vaccine isn't proving effective against it, the agency said in a health advisory sent to doctors last night. The warning said that 52 % of the 85 flu samples collected between oct. 1 and nov. 22 were different than the viruses in the vaccine mix this year, cnn reports. The h3n2 virus is linked to more instances of hospitalization and death, especially for children, the elderly, and people with chronic health issues. \" the flu is bad, and you want to do anything you can to prevent getting it and to prevent giving it to other people, \" a manhattan pediatrician tells cnn. Coming up with each year's vaccine is somewhat of a crapshoot. Health experts congregate earlier in the year to figure out which strains are proliferating and to predict which ones will continue on into flu season; they then create their vaccine cocktail out of those strains. But just because this year's mix may not be the most effective against the mutated ( or \" drifted \" ) viruses doesn't mean you should blow off the shot completely: scientists say the vaccine would still likely offer some \" cross-protection, \" which would minimize patients ending up in the er or dying, and it still is doing a decent job against h1n1 and other strains, nbc notes. The cdc also suggests doctors use the antiviral drugs tamiflu and relenza as a flu treatment option to reduce symptoms and hasten getting better, as well as a preventive treatment.

A federal appeals court today ordered google to take down innocence of muslims, reports the san jose mercury news. The 9th us circuit court of appeals voted 2-1 to back the request made by actress cindy lee garcia, who says she got duped by the filmmaker. She agreed to make a desert action flick, only to learn later that a clip from that movie was inserted into the anti-muslim screed, reports nbc news. At one point in innocence, a voice dubbed over hers suggests that mohammed is a child molester. Google vows to fight the decision on first amendment grounds, and the first step will likely be a request that the full 11-judge panel of the 9th circuit rehear the case. At the washington post, legal blogger eugene volokh thinks google has a shot under a \" fair use \" defense. \" the entire video ought to remain available to those who want to get a full understanding of the controversy, and the fair use doctrine ought to be a mechanism for doing that, \" he writes.",

His lawyer tells the new york daily news that berkowitz could have easily been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and that he could have his guilty plea vacated as a result. But though mark heller says he's begged berkowitz to file a post-conviction motion that could see him freed, he says berkowitz has refused out of respect for victims ' families. The born-again christian previously said he won't seek parole for the same reason. ( see berkowitz's message to \" gangbanging teens \" here. )",

        "summary": "President trump's tax reform plan unveiled wednesday heralds the return of the laffer curve, or as it's more commonly known — thanks to the first president bush — \" voodoo economics. \" the new york times reports the laffer curve was first sketched on a napkin by arthur laffer in 1974. The curve says that if you cut taxes enough, you can make up for the financial shortfall through economic growth. And that's exactly what trump's team is pitching — though it ' ll mean adding billions upon billions of dollars to the national deficit while waiting on that promised growth. Here's what else you need to know about trump's tax reform plan: while republican lawmakers were supportive in public, they're grumbling in private, cnn reports. Congressional republicans are upset trump's promised tax-reform plan is more of a tax-cut plan. One senior gop aide says it's \" not even close \" to tax reform. Cnbc reports the plan is missing one thing that wall street really wanted: a steep reduction — all the way to 10 % — for companies that bring earnings back to the us from overseas. There are eight reasons trump's tax reform plan likely won't get through congress, according to the washington post. They include that republicans may not tolerate a huge deficit increase and that the gop head of the senate finance committee is openly wondering if it's a \" good idea. \" politico argues the plan released wednesday was less a step toward actual tax reform and more something for trump to use to bolster his 100-day presidential resume. It was a single page of \" mostly general principles \" largely carried over from campaign promises. Mother jones reports trump's tax reform plan will make the trump family richer in four different ways, including by cutting the tax rate for \" pass-through corporations. \" the trump organization is made up of pass-through corporations, and the plan would cut the tax rate of trump and his children from 39.6 % to 15 %. But we may never know exactly to what extent trump stands to benefit from his tax reform plan, according to the washington post, as treasury secretary steven mnuchin says the president still \" has no intention \" of releasing his tax returns.",

In addition to almost $ 1 million in cash and what dea agent brian besser believes will ultimately tally more than a million fentanyl pills, agents also found a \" pill press \" likely used to turn powdered fentanyl into counterfeit oxycodone tablets. Besser says the press ' output could be thousands of pills an hour. \" it would be very safe to say people have died from this operation, \" besser tells ksl, noting fentanyl is far more potent than the oxycodone buyers would be expecting.

Aaron michael shamo, 26, who was renting the home, was arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute, reports fox 13. He could face 20 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine if convicted.

According to the guardian, 69-year-old jacqueline sauvage shot her husband three times in the back with a hunting rifle the day after their son killed himself. Sauvage says she had been physically abused by her husband for 47 years; she says her son was also abused, and two of her three daughters say they had been sexually abused. Sauvage was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2014. But sauvage became a symbol in france, where rates of domestic violence are higher than in europe as a whole, the new york times reports. Dozens of politicians supported her, and more than 430,000 people signed a petition calling for her release. Last january, french president francois hollande issued a partial pardon of sauvage, allowing her to seek parole. But courts twice refused to grant it. This month, sauvage's daughters sent a letter to hollande, and he granted sauvage a full pardon wednesday. Two hours later, she was seen leaving prison. One of sauvage's daughters offered \" infinite thanks to the president, \" and sauvage's lawyer says the pardon is a \" very strong message... To all women victims of domestic violence. \" but magistrates are left wondering why hollande didn't just offer a full pardon months ago to avoid essentially overruling the courts. The head of the magistrates union accuses him of acting \" to please public opinion \" and making a \" deplorable \" decision that \" challenges the functioning of our institutions. \"",

        "summary": "An underwater training course for navy seals that the washington post calls \" legendarily difficult \" proved fatal friday for one student at a california naval station. James derek lovelace, 21, who had just joined the navy six months ago and completed basic training in january, was wrapping up the last day of his first week of training in basic underwater demolition/seal training, aka bud/s, when class instructors noticed he was having issues and took him out of the pool, the virginian-pilot reports. He lost consciousness and couldn't be revived at the scene at naval amphibious base coronado; he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The training exercise lovelace was attempting is part of what's called \" drown proofing, \" where participants don a camouflage utility uniform and diving masks and then have to tread water and swim, navy spokesman lt. Trevor davids explains. He adds that the cause of lovelace's death is still being investigated, per the ap. As the recruits advance in this training exercise, it becomes increasingly tougher, with seals practicing their escape from hypothetical underwater emergencies, all while having their hands and feet restrained, by learning the basics of breath control and body positioning, per business insider. \" it's a physiological test to see if a guy can do exercises in the water, \" notes an official said by the pilot to be familiar with what happened. Typically, if a student is having trouble during the exercise, instructors will move the student to a different part of the pool and bring in more eyes to \" scale up the student-instructor ratio, \" davids tells the navy times. The pilot says the navy didn't announce lovelace's death until it was contacted by the pilot and nbc news, which worked on the story with the paper. It's the second recent tragedy for lovelace's family: his mom, katie, died last year at the age of 44. ( a navy seal recently killed by isis had an infamous grandfather. )",

Meanwhile, before the cops showed up at his door, netanyahu asserted his innocence, warning his political enemies and the media to \" hold off partying \" and proclaiming that \" nothing will happen, because there is nothing, \" per the bbc, which details other allegations against netanyahu over the years. Israeli ag avichai mandelblit said later that netanyahu, accused of accepting \" improper gifts \" from two businessmen, is now subject to a full criminal investigation into supposed ethics transgressions. Mandelblit says a new inquiry involving netanyahu began in july, with this specific accusation being lobbed three months ago. The ag adds four allegations first broached over the summer, including those swirling around illegal 2009 election activity, have been dismissed.

Hannah upp is one of them, and it's not the first time she's gone missing. She famously vanished in september 2008, where the then-23-year-old failed to show up for the first day of school at her teaching job at a harlem middle school. Over the weeks that elapsed, she was spotted in various places — an apple store, a starbucks — but it was only 20 days later that she was pulled from the waters west of new york city, floating face down and appearing dead. She wasn't, but it emerged that during those three weeks, \" her own biography had been inaccessible to her, \" as rachel aviv writes for the new yorker. The last thing she recalled was going for a run the day she went missing. Upp was determined to have dissociative fugue, in which one loses his or her identity, may assume a new one, and may set out on a journey. Aviv dives deep into what we know about fugue and famous cases of it, along with the apparent hallmarks of upp's: she disappeared for two days in maryland several years later, and then again in september in st. Thomas. In the new york and maryland cases, the timing was similar, and she ended up near bodies of water. That led friends on st. Thomas to head to upp's favorite beach there, where her sundress and car keys were found; her nearby car held her passport, wallet, and phone. Aviv writes that in her first conversation with upp's mother, she said \" it was important that an article about her daughter's experience ' let it stay a mystery. ' \" and so it remains, though aviv fills in many blanks in the full story.",

Although the family wishes to keep most of will's handwritten letter private, joop will, who was just 10 when his father, a dutch resistance fighter, was arrested by the nazis in december 1943, revealed one telling line to the ap in a telephone interview from his amsterdam home. \" he wrote that ' i've now been away from you at home for the 42nd sunday, ' \" said joop, now 82. \" he didn't talk about days or weeks, he talked about sundays — he was a man of deep belief, and in the letter he talked about his beliefs. \" \" it is very emotional, he thought of us, he had concerns for us, and now we have the letter that he had in his hand, \" joop continued. Peter had been a meat inspector when he joined the dutch resistance shortly after the nazis infiltrated the netherlands in 1940. He disseminated an underground paper and helped downed allied pilots escape nazi detection by hiding them in a slaughterhouse shed. After his 1943 capture, peter was sent first to a dutch transit camp, then to a german concentration camp; he died on a train to a second german camp in april 1945. In 1949, the will family received what they thought were the last of peter's effects, including a wedding ring and a bible, afp reports. But peter's wallet, which contained the letter and some photos, was recovered by the british and filed under the wrong name; the items were discovered only after a dutch woman saw them in an online archive and tracked the will family down, per the ap. \" even after such a long time one never forgets, \" joop will says. \" he's always been in my thoughts. \" ( a letter to an elderly man revealed he had a 61-year-old son. )",

The twins were raised by the catholic charity maria consolata, for which they were named, after their mother abandoned them following the death of their father.

Now scientists say the sierra nevada snowpack — which gives the state nearly a third of its surface water — is at a shocking 500-year low, the guardian reports. That means california, now in its fourth year of drought, can't rely as much on winter snow accumulation in the mountains to fill streams and reservoirs during the hot summers. \" it was unprecedented, \" says valerie trouet, who led the study published in nature climate change. \" when you are a climate scientist, first you get excited by the result. Then you realise the extreme level of the snowpack is not something to get excited about. \" trouet's team reached their conclusion by analyzing rings in the trunks of 1,500 blue oak trees in the region, cnbc reports. Winter precipitation plays a big role in the trees ' growth, she says, which can be measured by the width of each year's ring — and last year's was pretty darn thin. So how did it get this bad? seems that last winter's record-high temperatures and lack of rain led to the dismally low snow accumulation. Trouet also warns that california's \" uncontrollable wildfires \" can be linked to the lack of sierra nevada snowmelt, which scientists had already figured was at a 100-year low. If the climate keeps warning, she adds, \" chances of this happening again in the future are much higher than they were in the past. \" ( see how la is fighting drought with 96 million black plastic balls. )",

Others have a decidedly different view. The deal with allergan \" is nothing short of a disgrace, \" writes john cassidy in the new yorker. No matter what pfizer says, this move was dictated purely by a desire to save money in a tax dodge known as an inversion. What makes this particularly galling to cassidy is that pfizer has happily benefited over the years from research funded by us taxpayers under the national institutes of health and the national science foundation. \" now, pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, \" he writes. So what can the us do? efforts to curb inversions are hopelessly stalled, and the obama administration can't legally block the move. Still, \" it should seek to shame pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off, \" writes cassidy, because this is not how a supposedly \" respectable corporate citizen \" is supposed to act. At marketwatch, however, tim mullaney suggests that us might have a stronger weapon than shame: the us should consider a \" regulation steering medicare and medicaid's purchases of drugs and medical devices elsewhere. \" after all, why should a foreign company get such contracts? if pfizer is so interested in bottom line, that's where retaliation should be focused.

Matt pierce told the committee he was moved by the situation of former us rep. Frank mccloskey, who made a point of casting an absentee ballot while battling cancer but died days before election day in 2003. Mccloskey knew the value of a vote: after a recount following the 1984 election, the democrat was declared the winner by just four votes. But while the proposal might sound odd, it would actually give dead hoosiers the same voting rights as most other dead americans. According to the bloomington herald-times, indiana is one of only three states with a \" dead voter \" law, which requires county clerks to check absentee ballots for recent deaths and has been blamed for election night delays. At a legislative forum last month, state rep. Peggy mayfield, a republican, recalls that when she was serving as a county clerk, a man woke up from a coma and wanted to vote. He was given an absentee ballot but died the day before election day. \" it's sad, \" says mayfield, who isn't opposed to changing the law.",

        "summary": "There are 45,000 horses no one wants, and the us government is suggesting destroying them all, the verge reports. In what an exec for the humane society calls \" a complete abdication of responsibility for their care, \" the bureau of land management's national wild horse and burro advisory board has recommended euthanizing the horses, removed from public land and placed in holding pens over the years so there'd be more room for cattle. The horses are available for adoption, but the pens are now crammed and the costs have ballooned, per the blm: $ 49 million last year alone, or almost half of the board's annual budget. A humane society press release calls it \" long-term mismanagement \" at the hands of the blm, which the humane society says could more effectively use birth control to manage the horse population. Still others point out the unseemliness of removing wildlife from its natural habitat to make room for profit-generating cattle. But not everyone is critical of the plan. Rt.com notes that the horses trample on and kick up the protective layer of topsoil that lies over the country's grasslands. And per a december 2015 slate article, these horses aren't technically natives: they're the \" feral descendants of animals brought by europeans in the past few hundred years, \" and that timespan has been too short for us plants and wildlife to acclimate to the equine intruders. The horses can be adopted for $ 125 a pop, but rt.com notes that even if all 45,000 horses were scooped up, that would total just under $ 6 million — not even close to the $ 49 million spent on them just last year alone.

        "summary": "Ikea believes city-dwelling americans are finally ready to start growing their own food. Business insider reports the company plans to launch its line of indoor hydroponic gardens in the us this spring. Hydroponics are supposed to make gardening easier for beginners in that there's no soil, no need to make space in your yard, and no worrying about over- or under-watering. Instead, plans grow directly in water filled with nutrients. Ikea partnered with the swedish university of agricultural sciences to create its line of hydroponics, according to the telegraph. The line includes nursery units for seeds, cultivation units for more mature plants, and artificial lights. This video explains how it all works. Ikea decided to get into hydroponics last year after a survey found 60 % of people grow plants of one kind or another indoors, wired reports. The krydda/växer line of hydroponics was the brainchild of an ikea product developer living in shanghai, where 75 % of people grow plants inside. Ikea believes its system will help people as they live in smaller and smaller urban spaces in the future. Ikea's hydroponic system comes with seeds for 18 types of food plants, including herbs, lettuce, chard, and bok choy. While other companies offer home hydroponic systems, the ubiquity of ikea means a whole lot more people are about to learn about them.",

            "Courtesy of ikea ikea is betting on indoor gardening. The furniture retailer is introducing a line of products, part of the krydda/växer collection, that ' ll help you start your own indoor hydroponic garden. Unlike regular gardens, hydroponic systems don't use soil to grow plants — only water. That water is filled with nutrients to make it a viable way to cultivate plants. Because light, nutrient and water levels are easily adjustable, hydroponic devices also allow for finer tuning of growing conditions. This makes the process less water intensive and viable year-round. Plus, it helps novice gardeners skirt some common problems, including over- or under-watering, root rot, pests, and insufficient fertilizer. Ikea's collection, available in the uk, offers a number of different indoor gardening units. There's a nursery unit, which has small holes that allow seeds to germinate, as well as a cultivation unit, which houses matured plants. The collection also includes plant inserts, nutrients, and artificial lights, allowing customers to create kits with everything they need to grow herbs and greens indoors from start to finish. The collection also includes seeds for 18 types of herbs and salad greens, ranging from basics like lettuce, arugula, and chard, to slightly more exotic greens like chicory, amaranth, and mizuna. To take care of the plants, users just need to germinate them by placing them in water-soaked, nutrient-filled plugs in a nursery unit. Once the plants have matured, you can move them to a cultivation unit, where you give them fertilized water until they mature into harvestable greens. Single krydda cultivation units sitting on a windowsill",
            "Until recently, hydroponics – or the practice of growing plants in water instead of soil – were largely known to two industries: that of large-scale produce farming, and large-scale marijuana farming. It's a way of gardening that relies on science and measurements rather than instinct and trial and error; it's a means to an end rather than a perambulating joy that comes with losing hours pottering around with plants. And, as both kinds of farmers know, it works: or at least it does when the levels of water, light and nutrients are correct. But in the last few years hydroponics have been creeping into people's homes. Pimped-up gardening trays with led lamps and complicated watering systems appear in homes on instagram, people share tips and post questions on reddit.com/r/hydro, the section of the sprawling online forum dedicated to the hobby."

Unlike regular gardens, hydroponic systems don't use soil to grow plants — only water. That water is filled with nutrients to make it a viable way to cultivate plants. Because light, nutrient and water levels are easily adjustable, hydroponic devices also allow for finer tuning of growing conditions. This makes the process less water intensive and viable year-round. Plus, it helps novice gardeners skirt some common problems, including over- or under-watering, root rot, pests, and insufficient fertilizer. Ikea's collection, available in the uk, offers a number of different indoor gardening units. There's a nursery unit, which has small holes that allow seeds to germinate, as well as a cultivation unit, which houses matured plants. The collection also includes plant inserts, nutrients, and artificial lights, allowing customers to create kits with everything they need to grow herbs and greens indoors from start to finish. The collection also includes seeds for 18 types of herbs and salad greens, ranging from basics like lettuce, arugula, and chard, to slightly more exotic greens like chicory, amaranth, and mizuna. To take care of the plants, users just need to germinate them by placing them in water-soaked, nutrient-filled plugs in a nursery unit. Once the plants have matured, you can move them to a cultivation unit, where you give them fertilized water until they mature into harvestable greens.

            "Until recently, hydroponics – or the practice of growing plants in water instead of soil – were largely known to two industries: that of large-scale produce farming, and large-scale marijuana farming. It's a way of gardening that relies on science and measurements rather than instinct and trial and error; it's a means to an end rather than a perambulating joy that comes with losing hours pottering around with plants. And, as both kinds of farmers know, it works: or at least it does when the levels of water, light and nutrients are correct. But in the last few years hydroponics have been creeping into people's homes. Pimped-up gardening trays with led lamps and complicated watering systems appear in homes on instagram, people share tips and post questions on reddit.com/r/hydro, the section of the sprawling online forum dedicated to the hobby.",

Nebraska police say a florida woman who wasn't permitted to board a flight with a puppy not yet two weeks old may have drowned the animal in a bathroom at the central nebraska regional airport. The grand island independent has the alleged timeline: it reports cynthia v. Anderson, 56, attempted to board a plane on thursday with two dogs in \" proper kennels \" and three puppies — two yorkies and a doberman — in a carry-on. The edgewater, fla., woman was told she couldn't fly with dogs so young that grand island police captain dean elliot notes \" their eyes weren't even open. \" the orlando sentinel reports dogs must be at least 8 weeks old to fly; a central nebraska humane society rep says each airline has its own criteria that passengers should reference in advance. Anderson's parents, who live in western nebraska, reportedly relieved her of the yorkies, and she allegedly tried to again get on a flight the next day with the doberman puppy hidden in her carry-on bag, reports the daytona beach news-journal. She wasn't permitted to board. Police say anderson was spotted entering an airport bathroom; after she exited, a bathroom user reported a dead puppy in a toilet. \" the cause of death was determined to be drowning, \" says grand island police sgt. Stan steele following an autopsy. Nbc nebraska reports anderson faces charges of recklessly abandoning an animal, a felony punishable by up to five years in jail.

        "summary": "Besides getting stuck with a hello kitty tattoo for life, there's another downside to getting skin ink: microscopic particles can taint your lymph nodes. A new study found that after a person gets a tat, nano traces of the ink containing preservatives and contaminants work their way into the person's nodes, whose job is to cleanse the body of toxins, afp reports. Researchers write in scientific reports that colored tattoo ink, a mix of organic and inorganic pigments, can contain nickel, chromium, manganese, and cobalt. After black, made from iron oxides and carbon, the most common ink in tattoos is titanium dioxide, a white pigment found in sunscreen that can cause irritation when used in skin art. Co-author hiram castillo-michel of the european synchrotron radiation facility in france says when getting a tattoo, clean needles aren't the only concern. \" no one checks the chemical composition of the colors, but our study shows that maybe they should, \" he says. Stained lymph nodes are not news in the tattoo world, discovery reports, noting that as the body tries to reject insoluble ink injected below the skin's epidermis, tattoos leak ink, plasma, and lymphatic fluid. Using x-ray fluorescence to study the nodes of tattooed cadavers ( an admittedly small sample of four corpses, with two non-tattooed control cadavers ), the scientists found the smallest bits of blue and green pigments were the mostly likely to linger, causing chronic enlargement of exposed nodes. While they found \" strong evidence \" of long-term toxin deposits, the next step is to figure out the long-term health effects. ( a political rallying cry spawned a spate of tattoos. )",

Last year, almond milk took the crown from soy as the non-dairy king, and how: in august, bloomberg businessweek reported annual almond milk sales of $ 738 million for the 12 months ending july 26, versus $ 341 million for soy. But a new entrant is angling for a slice of the pie: silk, the onetime top dairy-free brand, has this month started selling cashew milk in the us, quartz reports. It's advertised as \" the first cashew milk in the refrigerated case, \" per a press release, and silk calls it \" creamier than skim milk with 1/3 of the calories. \" cashew milk could appeal to those who see almond milk as little more than flavored water, quartz notes ( cashews are much softer, so as one nut milk company owner explains, there's much less to filter out after they're ground ). It could also be handy amid california's drought, given that 80 % of the planet's almonds are grown in the state. It takes more than a gallon of water to grow one almond, mother jones reported earlier this year ( a single walnut, it noted, needs 4.9 gallons ). Cashews, on the other hand, are grown all over the world, from south america to africa to asia. And silk is far from the only company marketing \" milk \" made from the crop. There are already cashew-based ice cream parlors, as the arizona daily star reports, while cashew milk recipes abound. Still, almonds could be tough to topple, given that this year, they became america's favorite nut.",

Now, thanks to a new technique, scientists say they've been able to quantify the damage, which could ultimately help them preserve the work. They did so by measuring the levels of light-absorbing molecules called chromophores in the cellulose that makes up the paper, reports livescience. Because chromophores tend to absorb blue and violet light and reflect reddish and yellow light, old documents often develop a yellowish hue. And because the portrait was done in red chalk, the yellowing reduced contrast with the paper, making the lines appear to vanish. Almost since it was first drawn, the portrait's history has been shrouded in mystery. It disappeared for centuries until a sardinian king handed it over to the royal library of turin in 1839, and was displayed publicly for decades in the 1900s. The scientists who were offered rare access to the now fragile art, which has been locked away in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vault at the library since 1998, determined that the work is in such poor condition because it was kept for centuries in \" extremely humid conditions or within a closed environment, \" a researcher tells heritage daily. Now that the damage has been quantified, preservationists can map out what restoration technique to use to save this piece and other ancient documents as well.

        "summary": "Fresh turmoil in pakistan today, as its supreme court ordered that prime minister raja pervez ashraf be arrested within 24 hours. The move isn't exactly a surprise, but the drama there isn't limited to ashraf's situation, which springs from accusations that the former water and power minister scored kickbacks from private energy initiatives. Rather, it's another name that's making waves: that of muhammad tahir ul-qadri. The firebrand cleric has been camped out in islamabad, where he is calling for the government to resign — and he's surrounded by thousands of supporters, reports reuters. Qadri has pledged to remain near parliament until the government does away with the current legislature and installs a caretaker government. The military is believed to be backing him in the hopes he will create an opening for it to play a role in said government and potentially delay spring elections, reports the new york times. Is ashraf's lot linked to qadri's? the times says there's no proof of that, though analysts believe the court may be leveraging the anti-government sentiment he is creating in order to continue its crusade against president asif ali zardari. Interesting side note: in addition to his many religious followers, qadri has attracted a number of other supporters to his cause by way of his decision to leave a \" luxurious \" lifestyle in canada and return to pakistan.",

            "\"there's a sense that things are snowballing — hard to predict in any way, \" said cyril almeida, a senior writer at dawn newspaper. The chief catalyst of this jolting change comes in the form of a 61-year-old preacher, muhammad tahir-ul qadri, who catapulted himself into the political limelight less than a month ago, and now finds himself issuing ultimatums to mr. Zardari from inside a bulletproof container within view of the soaring presidential residence. A giant rally in lahore last month signaled the start of mr. Qadri's assault on pakistan's political classes, which he derides as incompetent and irredeemably corrupt — a resonant message in a country of high unemployment and crippling electricity shortages. He drove home his message with an intensive television advertising campaign, paid for with generous amounts of money, the origins of which he has not fully explained. On monday evening, he stepped up the attack, leading tens of thousands of followers into the heart of islamabad, where he renewed demands that mr. Zardari resign immediately. The crowd fell short of the promised \"million-man march, \" but was enough to spook the government: by tuesday morning, he had pushed forward to a square in front of the parliament. \"there is no parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits \" — bandits — he said in",
            "Islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan's supreme court ordered the arrest of the prime minister on tuesday on corruption allegations, ratcheting up pressure on a government that is also facing street protests led by a cleric who has a history of ties to the army. The combination of the arrest order and the mass protest in the capital, islamabad, led by muslim cleric muhammad tahirul qadri, raised fears among politicians that the military was working with the judiciary to force out a civilian leader. \" there is no doubt that qadri's march and the supreme court's verdict were masterminded by the military establishment of pakistan, \" fawad chaudhry, an aide to prime minister raja pervez ashraf, told reuters. \" the military can intervene at this moment as the supreme court has opened a way for it. \" however, the ruling coalition led by the pakistan peoples party ( ppp ) has a majority in parliament and lawmakers can simply elect another prime minister if ashraf is ousted. In june, ashraf replaced prime minister yusuf raza gilani, who was disqualified by the supreme court in a previous showdown between the government and the judiciary. Elections are due in a few months and president asif ali zardari hopes to lead the first civilian government in pakistan's 65 years as an independent nation that will complete its full term"

            "\"there's a sense that things are snowballing — hard to predict in any way, \" said cyril almeida, a senior writer at dawn newspaper. The chief catalyst of this jolting change comes in the form of a 61-year-old preacher, muhammad tahir-ul qadri, who catapulted himself into the political limelight less than a month ago, and now finds himself issuing ultimatums to mr. Zardari from inside a bulletproof container within view of the soaring presidential residence. A giant rally in lahore last month signaled the start of mr. Qadri's assault on pakistan's political classes, which he derides as incompetent and irredeemably corrupt — a resonant message in a country of high unemployment and crippling electricity shortages. He drove home his message with an intensive television advertising campaign, paid for with generous amounts of money, the origins of which he has not fully explained. On monday evening, he stepped up the attack, leading tens of thousands of followers into the heart of islamabad, where he renewed demands that mr. Zardari resign immediately. The crowd fell short of the promised \"million-man march, \" but was enough to spook the government: by tuesday morning, he had pushed forward to a square in front of the parliament. \"there is no parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits \" — bandits — he said in",
            "Islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan's supreme court ordered the arrest of the prime minister on tuesday on corruption allegations, ratcheting up pressure on a government that is also facing street protests led by a cleric who has a history of ties to the army. The combination of the arrest order and the mass protest in the capital, islamabad, led by muslim cleric muhammad tahirul qadri, raised fears among politicians that the military was working with the judiciary to force out a civilian leader. \" there is no doubt that qadri's march and the supreme court's verdict were masterminded by the military establishment of pakistan, \" fawad chaudhry, an aide to prime minister raja pervez ashraf, told reuters. \" the military can intervene at this moment as the supreme court has opened a way for it. \" however, the ruling coalition led by the pakistan peoples party ( ppp ) has a majority in parliament and lawmakers can simply elect another prime minister if ashraf is ousted. In june, ashraf replaced prime minister yusuf raza gilani, who was disqualified by the supreme court in a previous showdown between the government and the judiciary. Elections are due in a few months and president asif ali zardari hopes to lead the first civilian government in pakistan's 65 years as an independent nation that will complete its full term"

        "summary": "\" my wife and son were murdered by a masked gunman, and my other son and i were left for dead, but survived. \" those are the words of kent whitaker on his website, detailing the horrific crime that tore his life apart in december 2003. But, he adds, things soon got worse: the son who'd survived, thomas \" bart \" whitaker, was later arrested and convicted for planning the attack with two friends, and he now awaits a feb. 22 execution on texas'death row. The washington post documents the elder whitaker's rage in the hours just after the shootings, which had taken place as the four family members arrived home from a dinner out. As he stewed in his hospital bed, recovering from the bullet that had come within inches of his heart, whitaker first vowed to \" inflict pain \" on the shooter, then started thinking on his faith and how god wouldn't want him to go down a path of vengeance. And so he decided then to forgive, \" no matter who was responsible \" — a promise made before finding out that bart, in his early 20s, had helped mastermind the attack. Even though whitaker and his extended family pleaded with the da not to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors painted bart as a sociopath who wanted his parents ' money; he was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to die. The case of the now 38-year-old, who's been on good behavior behind bars and is about to earn his master's degree, underscores how victims should be folded into the process of doling out justice, whitaker says. \" this isn't just a case of a dad who is ignoring the truth about his son, \" he says. \" believe me, i ' m aware of what his choices have cost me. \" the whitakers have filed a petition with texas ' parole and pardons board to commute bart's sentence to life in prison.",
