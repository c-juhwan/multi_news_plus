        "summary": "\" papa \" john schnatter, fresh off seeing his net worth drop $ 70 million, is blaming the nfl's tolerance of player protests for declining pizza sales at his eponymous restaurants, forbes reports. Papa john's released its third-quarter financial report tuesday, and while it beat its estimates for earnings and revenue, it also lowered expectations for sales. On wednesday, shares fell 11 % and schnatter saw his net worth decline to $ 801 million. According to bloomberg, it was papa john's biggest stock drop in two years and came nearly a year after the chain hit an all-time high last december. The culprit, according to schnatter: nfl players kneeling during the national anthem and nfl commissioner roger goodell's failure to stop them. \"this should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago, \" schnatter said on a conference call wednesday. Schnatter, a trump donor, believes goodell should force players to stand for the anthem. \"leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership, \" schnatter said. A bloomberg analyst says it's possible to see where schnatter is coming from: fewer people watching football means fewer people ordering pizza or seeing ads for papa john's, which has been the nfl's official pizza sponsor since 2010. But, as slate notes, there's no evidence protests — either by players or offended fans — have been behind the decline in nfl viewership. Multiple sports have seen ratings decline as more people opt out of cable, and the nfl's ratings have actually been going up as the season progresses.",

Eleven incumbents are in trouble in the polls ( and two other open-seat races could see a party switch ), the washington post reports. And with just two weeks left before their constituents head to the voting booths, there may not be much time left to plead their case. Some highlights: the post reports there are 36 senate races and 36 gubernatorial races taking place, but when it comes to spending on tv commercials, the biggest spending is occurring via the latter. The center for public integrity reports that about $ 379 million has been spent on gubernatorial ads, to senate candidates ' $ 321 million. Eight of the 10 biggest spenders are running for governor ( kentucky's mitch mcconnell and louisiana's mary landrieu represent the senate's big-spenders ). Micah cohen accurately predicted on the fivethirtyeight blog last year that four of the republican governors \" who rode the tea party wave to power in blue and purple states in 2010 \" would be in peril right now: pennsylvania's tom corbett ( \" a goner for sure, \" quips the post ), maine's paul lepage, michigan's rick snyder, and florida's rick scott. Speaking of scott, who was just last week embroiled in fangate with republican-turned-democrat opponent charlie crist: florida takes top honors for the most expensive governor's race in the country, at $ 62 million in tv-ad buys. Aside from the aforementioned four states, the post runs down nine more states that could see a party switch: georgia, massachusetts ( open seat ), alaska, wisconsin, colorado, illinois, connecticut, kansas, and arkansas ( open seat ).

The attacks on the police officers had been carried out by elements of a radical group called the black liberation army. \"it's open season on the cops in this city, \" ed kiernan, the president of the patrolmen's benevolent association, said after the shootings of officers jones and piagentini, and he urged all officers to carry shotguns, bringing them from home if necessary. On saturday, a gunman shot his ex-girlfriend near baltimore, then came to brooklyn and opened fire into a police car parked on tompkins avenue. Inside were officers wenjian liu, 32, and rafael ramos, 40, one a chinese-american, the other a new yorker of puerto rican origin."

Shkreli, 34, is accused of illegally taking stock from retrophin, a biotech company he founded, and using it to pay off investors in a hedge fund he managed after the fund tanked. He is also accused of defrauding those investors. Jury selection begins monday morning in the case, which isn't directly connected to what shkreli is best known for: hiking the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 %. Some background: the trial.

Penniless. In a pretrial hearing, shkreli's attorney claimed that the former ceo is broke and \" doesn't have any cash, \" nbc news reports.

Shkreli's lawyer argued that a wu-tang clan album shkreli bought for $ 2 million is in reality \" probably worthless. \" he said offers shkreli had recently made, including $ 100,000 for information leading to the killer of dnc staffer seth rich, were just \" preposterous promises \" on social media. Ignoring attorneys ' advice. The ap reports that since his arrest in late 2015, shkreli has gleefully ignored his attorneys ' advice to keep a low profile and has been speaking his mind on many subjects on social media.

What will be debated in whole woman's health v. Hellerstedt: whether a texas law that imposes stringent mandates on abortion clinics and doctors who perform abortions infringes on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Some takes on the topic: the washington post offers a succinct q&a on the case. Cnn notes that everyone will be watching justice anthony kennedy, who's already joined forces with the four liberal justices in blocking some of the restrictions during the case's appeal. Cnn looks at kennedy's position close to the center of the bench — and says \" both sides have reason to worry. \" and mainly to sway kennedy, more than 100 women — including actress amy brenneman, who terminated a pregnancy at age 21 — have filed supporting briefs explaining how their abortions \" allowed them to control their bodies, plan for the future, and welcome children into their lives when their careers were established and their personal lives were on solid ground, \" the new york times reports. The atlantic ponders whether the supreme court will respect precedent in this \" blockbuster \" case, noting that the fifth circuit court took on the high court's precedent with an attitude verging on \" old-fashioned defiance. \" there's even a comparison of this scenario to my cousin vinnie. More than 1,000 people on both sides are expected to stand vigil outside the supreme court wednesday. The post looks at the dedicated \" community of the cold and the wet \" — including \" feminists [ calling ] themselves ' big raging liberals, ' \" as well as the \" unapologetically pro-life \" — who endured the elements to gain a chance to hear the arguments before the court.

        "summary": "Here's another thing you may soon be able to do on your apple watch: check your blood sugar. Sources tell cnbc that apple has a secret team working to develop sensors that could continuously track blood sugar levels. If successful, it would be a breakthrough for people with diabetes, who could glance at their wrists to check glucose levels instead of pricking a finger several times a day. Apple isn't alone. Other companies have been racing, and so far failing, to come up with similar technology. The winner stands to gain a chunk of a global marketplace in blood-sugar monitoring worth more than $ 12 billion, per reuters. In the us alone, there are 29 million people with diabetes. Before his death, steve jobs envisioned that wearable sensors could be tapped to tackle other health-related issues, such as monitoring vital signs like oxygen levels. The project got a boost in 2010 when apple bought a company called cor and hired bob messerschmidt, then the enterprising ceo of cor, who emailed him cold about using sensors for health. Since then, apple has acquired experts in the field from various biomed companies in a quest to develop technology that could cost the palo alto giant up to $ 1 billion. Apple's team of about 30 people is working on an optical sensor that shines a light through the skin to measure glucose levels. It's not as easy as it sounds. The reason so many other previous efforts have failed is that as far as sensors go, measuring blood sugar is particularly hard, especially if you want to do so without piercing the skin. One expert in the field tells cnbc it's \" the most difficult technical challenge i have encountered in my career. \" ( whole-body vibration could help those with diabetes. )",

The quirky leading man was best known for starring in offbeat movies like tim burton's ed wood and the film version of fear and loathing in las vegas. But it turns out mixing depp's oddball performance tendencies with a big-budget disney concept is a recipe for success. The first pirates movie earned $ 654 million at the global box office. The franchise has gone on to earn a total of $ 2.7 billion, and a fourth film is slated for 2011 ( in 3-d, natch ). Depp's most recent star turn for the studio, a 3-d update of alice in wonderland, has brought in $ 1 billion at the box office. His ability to almost guarantee a big box office ( even public enemies earned $ 214 million ) means studios are willing to pay whatever it takes to get a bit of the depp magic. Between june 2009 and june 2010, depp was the highest-paid actor in hollywood, earning a total $ 75 million. This year's top 10 highest-paid actors banked a total of $ 349 million between june 2009 and june 2010. To figure out earnings, we talked to agents, managers, producers and lawyers to determine what the stars earned as upfront pay on movies they are currently shooting, as well as back-end pay earned after a movie hit theaters. We also looked at any money actors might have earned from doing ads. Ranking second behind depp is ben stiller with $ 53 million. The comedian earns big bucks for films like night at the museum: battle of the smithsonian and the upcoming third installment in the meet the parents franchise because those films pay out at the box office.

        "summary": "One big factor in a deadly fire at trump tower over the weekend in new york city is drawing a lot of attention: the 50th-floor apartment that burned had no sprinkler system, though that was perfectly legal. The city passed a law requiring sprinklers in high-rises in 1999, but only for new buildings, explains the ap. Because trump tower went up in 1983, it didn't need to comply. Trump was among the developers who opposed the 1999 law as too expensive, arguing that it would add $ 4 per square foot to an apartment. As the new york post reported in 1999, he personally called council members to lobby against the measure. The opposition affected the final version of the legislation, allowing older buildings to be grandfathered in, per the washington post. However, trump also made a move at the time that went above and beyond the new law. He decided to spend an extra $ 3 million to add sprinklers to trump world tower, then under construction. Legally, he didn't need to do so under the law. \" people feel safer with sprinklers, \" he told the new york times back then. \" but the problem with the bill is that it doesn't address the buildings that need sprinklers the most. If you look at the fire deaths in new york, almost all of them are in one- or two-family houses. \" saturday's fire killed 67-year-old todd brassner, an eclectic art collector who lived alone, according to the times. A friend tells the newspaper that he'd been trying to sell since the 2016 election, \" but when people heard it was a trump building, he couldn't give it away. \" the cause of the fire has not been determined.",

When the state legislature returns at the start of 2018, the dem assemblyman says he ' ll introduce a bill that would ban the sale of new cars fueled by gas or diesel after 2040, the sacramento bee reports. Because transportation exhaust makes up more than 30 % of all greenhouse gas emissions in the state, this move would boost california's efforts to slash co2 emissions by 80 % ( compared to 1990 levels ) by 2050, per bloomberg. \" the market is moving this way, \" ting says, per the bee. \" the entire world is moving this way. At some point you need to set a goal and put a line in the sand. \" the golden state is trying to keep pace with similar efforts abroad, including a ban by france and the uk by 2040, and an even more ambitious one in india by 2030. China has also announced like intentions, though its timetable isn't as clear. Bloomberg notes such a move could cause a domino-type effect nationwide, as automakers under the gun to prioritize electric cars for the country's most populous state may also stop prioritizing gas- and diesel-powered cars in other states. Ting's announcement comes on the heels of mary nichols, head of the california air resources board, telling bloomberg earlier this week that such a ban was being mulled and that gov. Jerry brown is definitely on board in barring vehicles driven by internal combustion engines. The new york times takes a look at some of the questions and doubts swirling around the concept, with one critic from the free-market think tank pacific research institute comparing the idea to something you'd read about on the onion. \" but then … you go, ' yeah, this is california, ' \" he notes.",

Valladares navas tells the houston chronicle that the section of highway is actually one of wycoff's favorite spots and the site of the couple's second date, a motorcycle ride. \" i stopped on my motorcycle and she loved the view, \" valladares navas tells ktrk. So when it came to proposing, \" i just wanted to do something different, \" he says. An instagram video shows friends standing in lanes of traffic with cellphones and cameras as valladares navas gets down on one knee. As wycoff says yes, a few vehicles sneak by the scene honking their support or anger — it's not quite clear which. Valladares navas says he told wycoff they were going to a party, then stopped on the highway and told her to get out. \" i said, ' are you serious? ' \" wycoff recalls. \" then i saw all my family and friends with cameras and i looked where vidal was and he was down on one knee. … honestly, i didn't think about if it was a good idea or a bad idea. I was just so happy in the moment. \" valladares navas apparently didn't think about the consequences, either. \" i never really thought about causing an accident, \" he says. \" love makes you do stupid things. \" he adds that the group stopped traffic for only about 35 seconds. \" i think it's rare and romantic, \" a woman writes on instagram, per kprc. Others have a different view. \" i do hope that there is enough photo evidence to get him fined for pulling this stunt, \" a user says.

When he saw the robbery happen, he responded like any police officer would, and intervened.

            "Two armed men made a fatal mistake when they stormed a pharmacy in the city of campo limpo paulista in brazil on saturday and announced that they were robbing the place. Among the shoppers was an off-duty sao paulo police sergeant, rafael souza, with his wife and infant. One of the men, wearing a masked hoodie, pointed a gun at souza, who was carrying the infant on his left arm, police said. According to the brazilian paper estadao, souza pulled his own weapon and engaged the men in a 25-second running gun battle, some of which was captured on surveillance footage now circulating across the globe. The video shows souza with one eye on his targets and another on his wife, who is taking cover behind in one of the store's aisles. At one point, his wife reaches out for the child. Souza, who is already firing at the men, pauses for a split second, darts back to her, hands off the child and resumes firing. Ultimately he hit both men. When paramedics arrived on the scene, they were pronounced dead. Souza told investigators he fired first because he believed they would have opened fire if he told them he was a police officer. A similar incident happened in 2014 when an off-duty officer and his family were attacked by an armed robber on the street in sao paulo. The officer's three-month-old daughter slipped out of her father's hands and landed on the concrete. The officer fired at the attacker and held him until authorities arrived. His daughter suffered minor injuries. More from morning mix: olympian gabby douglas says she, too, was sexually abused by gymnastics team doctor weather channel tried to film georgia dome implosion.

            "Sao paulo, brazil ( nbc news ) – security cameras in brazil captured the moment where a police officer shot and killed two robbers while holding his infant son. Sao paulo state police sergeant rafael souza is being called a hero in brazilian media after the november 19 incident. Souza was off-duty and at the store with his wife and young son. When he saw the robbery happen, he responded like any police officer would, and intervened. According to police, one of the suspects pointed a gun at souza, so he opened fire, keeping his son close to his side. After the shooting, souza is seen handing his son safely off to his wife. Both suspects died at the scene.",

            "Two armed men made a fatal mistake when they stormed a pharmacy in the city of campo limpo paulista in brazil on saturday and announced that they were robbing the place. Among the shoppers was an off-duty sao paulo police sergeant, rafael souza, with his wife and infant. One of the men, wearing a masked hoodie, pointed a gun at souza, who was carrying the infant on his left arm, police said. According to the brazilian paper estadao, souza pulled his own weapon and engaged the men in a 25-second running gun battle, some of which was captured on surveillance footage now circulating across the globe. The video shows souza with one eye on his targets and another on his wife, who is taking cover behind in one of the store's aisles. At one point, his wife reaches out for the child. Souza, who is already firing at the men, pauses for a split second, darts back to her, hands off the child and resumes firing. Ultimately he hit both men. When paramedics arrived on the scene, they were pronounced dead. Souza told investigators he fired first because he believed they would have opened fire if he told them he was a police officer. A similar incident happened in 2014 when an off-duty officer and his family were attacked by an armed robber on the street in sao paulo. The officer's three-month-old daughter slipped out of her father's hands and landed on the concrete. The officer fired at the attacker and held him until authorities arrived. His daughter suffered minor injuries. More from morning mix: olympian gabby douglas says she, too, was sexually abused by gymnastics team doctor weather channel tried to film georgia dome implosion.

The hyalinobatrachium dianae is causing quite a stir because of its resemblance to a certain muppet, mashable reports. Yes, kermit has found a twin in this frog with bright green skin and bulging eyes — one of 149 \" glass frog \" species with a translucent underbody that reveals its innards. Described in a new study, the inch-long frog was spotted in the talamanca mountains and may have evaded scientists for some time because its \" advertisement call, \" which costa rica's tico times describes as a \" long metallic whistle with rapid pulses, \" sounds more like an insect's than a frog's. \" costa rica is a very well-studied area by herpetologists so this discovery was surprising, \" says scientist brian kubicki, who named the frog after his mother, diana. However, he adds that six specimens of the species — the first glass frog found in the country since 1973 — were found in an area that was \" poorly explored \" previously. So what does kubicki think of h. Dianae's resemblance to kermit? \" i think it is great that this species is getting so much attention around the world, \" he tells cbs news. \" hopefully this will help increase the awareness of the incredible amphibians found in costa rica and the need to continue studying them and conserve their vital habitats. \" ( a frog discovered in new york city has a croak unlike any other. )",

Some rebels are reportedly returning fire ( though a bbc correspondent describes their efforts as a \" futile gesture \" ), and reuters reports that 50 people have been killed today. According to the rebels, a field hospital where dozens are being treated is a target of today's attack, which the bbc calls one of the worst assaults on homs of the uprising. And protesters fear russia and china's veto of a un draft resolution calling for syrian president bashar assad to step down will embolden the government to act as it pleases, resulting in even more violence. But russian foreign minister sergei lavrov today defended his country's actions, saying the resolution meant choosing a side in a civil war. He will fly to syria for talks with assad tomorrow. The criticism of the vetoes showed no signs of abating, however. A rep for david cameron said, \" russia and china are protecting a regime that is killing thousands of people. We find their position incomprehensible and inexcusable. \" france's defense minister didn't mince words: \" there are political cultures which deserve a kick in the ass.

A reader reported that a man who was with her got out of the car and went inside the restaurant to pick up a take-out order. Another man was in the back seat of her black mercedes. Snyderman had sunglasses on and had her hair pulled back, the reader said. An american freelance cameraman working with snyderman in liberia last week tested positive for ebola. Snyderman, a resident of princeton, was flown back to the united states with a crew member on a private charter flight this weekend. Snyderman and her crew were going to be placed under voluntary quarantine for 21 days as a precaution, nbc news president deborah turness announced in a written statement on oct. 3 ( see the letter below ).

He was massively outraised by his rival. Cantor — whose internal polling had him up 34 points last week — raised $ 5.4 million this cycle, while brat had only raised $ 206,000 by mid-may, according to his last fec filing. Underscoring that point, nbc reports that brat spent $ 122,000 on his entire campaign through may 21; cantor, meanwhile, spent $ 168,000 in the same period — at steakhouses alone. His campaign manager is just 23 ( as of last month ). Writes the washington examiner of zachary werrell, he \" interviewed for the gig at a panera restaurant and has been sleeping on the couch of his mentor. \" brat had the backing of tea party heavyweights including laura ingraham, but says the race was about more than the tea party versus the gop establishment.

Nutria, commonly referred to as \" river rats \" — which the moscow times reports are originally from south america but have been something of a staple in southern russia for years — are giant, orange-toothed rodents bred for their cheap fur, reports the guardian. With many russians on the brink of poverty, the rodents ' carcasses made their way into the kitchen, and turned out to be both nutritious and easy to cook. Now, a native of krasnodar ( a city in southern russia near the black sea ) has opened the krasnodar bistro in central moscow, and as his instagram reveals, he's elected to add many versions of nutria to the menu, including stuffed into cabbages and made into hot dogs. It's actually \" a really clean animal, \" he says, describing it as an omega-3-rich herbivore that washes its food before eating it. Writing for the guardian, shaun walker describes the burger as \" juicy and fairly bland, somewhere between turkey and pork. \" lonely planet reports that his bold move has inspired other restaurants in moscow to bulk up their menu with nutria meat as well, though it remains to be seen whether the middle-class hipster crowd these bistros target will go for the latest take on locally sourced ingredients.

A drone captured video footage of the 16-foot-wide, 26-foot-deep crack, which appeared last week in remote farmland and cuts across highway 26 between the coast and hermosillo in northwest mexico. Some officials speculated a san andreas fault earthquake may have caused it — there was an earthquake along the fault on sunday, first news notes — but experts at the university of sonora are eying an underground stream as the possible culprit, australia's news network reports. Experts say a farmer-built levee started leaking, creating an underground stream that weakened the earth above it and caused it to crumble. A mexican geologist says that rainwater could also be to blame, saturating the ground and causing \" ditch flows, \" but that there is no cause for alarm, according to the international business times. The unstable ground is, however, forcing cars to drive around the area, and a second crack has reportedly opened up nearby.

The man once figured to be president is now merely an outgoing governor, and one of the most unpopular in the nation at that. And even though christie quickly endorsed donald trump once the governor was out of the presidential race, he was passed over for a plum post in the administration and instead given the chairmanship of trump's opioids commission. That relative crumb \" has been dismissed by some as the ultimate booby prize, \" writes jason zengerle at gq, but the magazine's profile of christie suggests it's anything but. \" for much of his governorship, christie had been admirably proactive in ( and progressive about ) addressing the drug scourge, \" writes zengerle, adding that christie has put a particular focus on opioids during his final year in office. In fact, christie still sounds a little miffed that one thing lost in the controversy over the infamous photo of him on a state beach during a government shutdown is that the shutdown itself was triggered over his demand for $ 300 million for opioids treatment. ( he would eventually get two-thirds of that. ) the story recounts how christie had been focusing on the issue long before he became governor, though it became personal when a friend fatally overdosed on percocet in 2014. \" one of the more traumatic moments of my life, \" says christie, who had been part of the man's support network. Christie's panel has suggested a national strategy for trump, who's expected to formally declare a national emergency on opioids as early as this week.

The blood test looks at the levels of four of the body's \" biomarkers, \" molecules that can point to health conditions. Researchers found that when those biomarkers were \" off-kilter, \" subjects were five times more likely to die within five years. The study results, published in plos medicine, followed two experiments. First, estonian researchers made the finding in a study of 9,842 people. But they doubted their results and asked finnish scientists to try; after research on another 7,503 duplicated the results, the finnish called their findings \" astonishing. \" scientists followed the 17,000 subjects for five years, during which period 684 died. All of them had comparable levels of the biomarkers. Britain's national health service explains that those biomarkers include increased levels of infection-related alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and the metabolism-related compound citrate, reduced levels of the nutrient-carrying protein albumin, and reduced size of very-low-density lipoprotein — or \" very bad cholesterol \" — particles. \" what is especially interesting is that these biomarkers reflect the risk for dying from very different types of diseases such as heart disease or cancer. They seem to be signs of a general frailty in the body, \" says a researcher. But the nhs cautions that \" due to ( the study's ) observational nature, it can only show an association, rather than causation, thereby limiting its potential impact. \" ( but, hey, if you're rich enough, maybe you can just reverse the aging process altogether. )",

The test, which was based on a study sampling 17,000 people, measured a total of 106 biomarkers; these included substances in the blood such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein – a protein associated with inflammation. Based on the levels of each biomarker, the test provided a summary score, which was then used to predict the risk of dying from any cause within the following five years.

Older adults and retirees are increasingly climbing up the lifeguard chair, with fewer high schoolers and college students seeking jobs, reports the washington post, telling the story of a 70-year-old texas woman who went from making just over $ 10 an hour as a substitute high school teacher to $ 14 an hour at local pools. \" i thought, ' what the heck, i love the water, so i ' ll give it a try, ' \" the woman says. She's not alone: with rising wages and less-onerous physical requirements, the american lifeguard association has recruited people as old as 86 to fill the nation's 150,000 lifeguarding jobs. Between extracurricular activities and internships, it seems teens no longer have the time, or inclination. Just 35 % of teens 16 to 19 are working, compared to 52 % in 1998. The lack of teen workers combined with increased immigration vetting under the trump administration, resulting in \" unprecedented \" visa issues for foreign workers, has made for a \" double storm, \" an ala rep tells the new york post. \" back when baywatch was on the air, we had so many applicants that we had to turn people away, \" he adds, per the times. Now \" we're starting to think outside the box: baby boomers, seniors, retired lawyers and accountants. \" applicants are almost guaranteed a job for summer — pools across the country are struggling to fill positions, and some remain closed as a result — but they first need to complete lifeguard certification, which takes about 40 hours of training. According to the post, it requires a person swim 500 meters in less than 10 minutes and run one mile on the beach in 7.5 minutes. ( like nudity? you ' ll like this lifeguard post. )",

        "summary": "Monsanto has had a big — and mostly bad — week, with lots of headlines revolving around something called glyphosate, the key ingredient in its popular herbicide roundup. Here's what's happening: on friday, monsanto lost a court fight to prevent california from labeling glyphosate a carcinogen, reports the fresno bee. But then came good news for the company. On wednesday, the european chemical agency announced that its assessment of glyphosate on behalf of eu countries found that it was safe for public use, per the guardian. The decision will be reviewed by the european commission before a final decision is made. ( greenpeace isn't happy. ) meanwhile, another lawsuit is unfolding involving hundreds of americans who say glyphosate caused their cancer. Cbs news talks to one of them, a mother with stage 4 non-hodgkins lymphoma who used to spray roundup on her lawn every week. Lawyers for those suing monsanto allege \" highly suspicious \" ties between the company and the ( now retired ) epa official charged with policing the company. Court documents unsealed this week show that the epa official once told a company manager, \" if i can kill this, i should get a medal, \" referring to a study on the dangers of glyphosate. See bloomberg. Those same documents also point to emails suggesting that monsanto ghostwrote parts of two scientific reports claiming roundup doesn't cause cancer. The epa reviewed both before deciding glyphosate was safe, reports reuters. However, monsanto says an email from an executive — reading, \" we would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and [ scientists ] would just edit &amp; sign their names so to speak \" — was taken out of context, and it accuses opposing attorneys of \" cherry-picking \" one email out of millions of pages.

Critics and audiences alike are impressed, according to rotten tomatoes.

It helps that the plot \" makes consistent sense, \" which isn't always the case with such flicks. Tom holland's appearance as spider-man also spells good things for the future of the genre. \" it's basically a third avengers film, and creatively the best of the bunch, \" writes brian lowry at cnn. The film's scope \" marks a significant departure from the genre's past, \" but it manages to tease multiple new characters \" without losing its focus — and more significantly, its sense of fun. \" the ending, however, is \" a trifle messy, and rushed. \" while batman v superman was a \" dour and dark … excuse for spectacle, \" civil war is \" colorful and fun \" and \" rooted in character and emotion, \" writes jamelle bouie at slate. That's not even the best part: it features \" one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed, \" bouie writes. Overall, it's \" one of the best films to come out of marvel studios. \" \" smart, snappy, politically savvy, and blessedly fast on its feet, \" is how peter travers describes it. \" sure, it's too much and way too familiar, \" but it \" brings the fun, the fierce, and the fireworks, \" he writes at rolling stone. \" summer, we have liftoff. \" travers also praises chris evans \" for bringing a charming quirk \" to the title character.",

But \" she was wearing high heels and a skirt at the time. So i ' m not sure if that counts. \" obama says that when he plays basketball, \" i ' m always getting knocked around. \" people play hard against him, he explains, because they know if he beats them \" they won't hear the end of it. \" he says throwing out the first pitch at an mlb game is \" the most stressful thing \" he does. \" each time i go up there my thinking is all right, i ' m just going to blaze this thing in. And then i ' m thinking, man, if i throw a grounder that's going to be a problem. \" he says he's friends with michael jordan, and thinks he's the first politician jordan ever donated to. He says he will one day welcome his chicago bulls to the white house as nba champions. \" you're guaranteeing it? \" simmons asked. \" well, i've got another five years here, \" obama replied.

Rick perry to step in and stay their client's execution, scheduled for tomorrow, citing racially biased testimony presented at his sentencing hearing. Texas law requires juries to decide if a defendant poses a \"future danger \" when deciding whether to give the death penalty, the la times explains. Prosecutors brought up \"the race factor, \" asking defense psychologist walter quijano if being black made buck more likely to be dangerous. Quijano said it did, and prosecutors cited that in their closing arguments. Quijano gave similar testimony in six other cases, and in each case the defendants were given new sentencing hearings. Buck, whose guilt is not being questioned, shot two people while on drugs in 1995, but had no prior history of violence — a fact quijano noted meant he was unlikely to pose a future danger.

Opening statements began tuesday in the case of 15-year-old anissa weier, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. Weier's defense is now tasked with convincing 10 of 16 jurors ( 12 assigned and four alternates ) that weier was delusional at the time of the may 2014 attack and went after leutner because weier feared the internet character slender man. Weier has pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree homicide, meaning she admits she took part in the attack; this trial will determine if she can be held criminally responsible, which will impact whether she heads to prison or a mental hospital. \" anissa's broken mind caused her to lose touch with reality, \" weier's defense attorney told jurors tuesday, adding she'd been a loner who developed a \" delusional belief system \" with co-defendant morgan geyser, believing they could become slender man's proxies by murdering leutner, per the ap. Waukesha county assistant da kevin osborne refuted that, noting weier had intended to carry out the attack herself but instead instructed geyser to do it, which he sees as an indication she knew it was wrong. Weier's father took the stand as a defense witness and said while his daughter had gone through rough times during his divorce, \" in my opinion, she was a normal child. \" geyser, who's been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has pleaded not guilty to being a party to attempted first-degree homicide and will go to trial oct. 9.",

While such checks took just minutes a few weeks back, thousands of people are now seeing wait times of at least 100 hours, the denver post notes. In los angeles, however, the long lines are of thousands of people returning guns, not buying them. The city's program to give gun owners grocery gift cards in exchange for their weapons has been a roaring success, the la times reports. Handguns and rifles can bring in up to $ 100, while assault weapons can net owners $ 200.

        "summary": "The first steps to justice have taken a glacial 20 years, but serbia has made its first arrests in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 1,000 muslim boys and men. Police arrested seven men in early morning raids across serbia and one suspect is on the run, the chief serbian war crimes prosecutor tells the ap. \" they are former members of a special brigade of the bosnian serb police, \" he says. Nedeljko milidragovic, 58, a commander known as \" nedjo the butcher, \" was among those detained. \" there are other suspects in serbia and neighboring countries and we are after them as well, \" a deputy prosecutor tells reuters. Though serbia has previously charged others with aiding the crime, he says the arrests mark \" the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in srebrenica. \" after heavy shelling, bosnian serb forces led by ratko mladic — now on trial at the hague — entered srebrenica in 1995 and crammed 1,000 men and boys into a warehouse. They then fired several rounds into the building and heaved grenades through the windows. When 100 survivors remained, milidragovic allegedly ordered them out of the building and promised they would be spared; they were murdered, too. Some 8,000 men and boys were killed over three days in a crime since ruled a genocide, the bbc reports. After the bosnian war, milidragovic built a successful trucking business with funds stolen from his victims, prosecutors say.

Monday's plea was for felony attempted procurement of a miscarriage, and because her time served already fulfilled her sentence ( one year in prison ), yocca walked out of the rutherford county adult detention center monday evening a free woman. Yocca attempted to end her pregnancy at home in a bathtub in september 2015, when she was 24 weeks pregnant, per the new york times, but heavy bleeding brought her to a nearby hospital, where she had an emergency c-section and delivered a 1.5-pound baby boy with serious medical issues — two weeks after the abortion attempt. That child was eventually placed in foster care and adopted. In tennessee, women can only receive abortions after 24 weeks if the mother's health or life are in danger, and only with counseling 48 hours beforehand. Yocca stayed in prison all this time because she couldn't raise her $ 200,000 bond. Abortion rights advocates are worried what precedent her case could set. \" what these kinds of arrests do is it will discourage people from seeking help, \" lynn paltrow, the director for national advocates for pregnant women, tells nbc news.",

I \" might write a thing about it and how it has shaped my life because it's such an unusual beautiful thing to live with, \" she said. \" one funny thing is when i ' m writing, if a song's colours are too oppressive or ugly sometimes i won't want to work on it. \" but mostly, she encouraged fans: one wrote that she started having panic attacks at 16 and lorde's music helped her get through it. \" i love you. Keep on keeping on, \" lorde wrote. Another fan thanked her for giving confidence to girls with curly hair by not straightening her hair. \" curly hair is the coolest s --- mama i love having this halo of hair radiating out from my face the bigger the better! actually just cut my hair a little shorter so it would be as big and cute as possible. \" and to a 14-year-old who bemoaned not having any idea what she was doing, while lorde is out there winning grammys at 18: \" when i was 14 all the things i've achieved now were just wishful thinking....

New york fire commissioner daniel nigro said the cause of saturday's blaze is not yet known but the apartment was \" virtually entirely on fire \" when firefighters arrived after 5: 30pm. \" it was a very difficult fire, as you can imagine, \" nigro said. \" the apartment is quite large. \" todd brassner, 67, was taken to a hospital and died a short time later, the nypd said. Property records obtained by the ap indicate brassner was an art dealer who purchased his 50th-floor unit in 1996. Six firefighters suffered minor injuries, reports cnn. Shortly after news of the fire broke, trump tweeted: \" fire at trump tower is out. Very confined ( well built building ). Firemen ( and women ) did a great job. Thank you! \" asked if that assessment was accurate, nigro said, \" it's a well-built building. The upper floors, the residence floors, are not sprinklered. \" fire sprinklers were not required in new york city high-rises when trump tower was completed in 1983. Subsequent updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install the sprinklers retroactively, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations. Nigro noted no member of the trump family was in the 664-foot tower. Lalitha masson, a 76-year-old resident, told the new york times that she did not receive any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered. \" i thought we were finished, \" said masson. \" i called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11. \"",

Steve bullock declared a state of emergency for two counties yesterday after a 12-inch oil pipeline burst saturday, pouring up to 50,000 gallons of oil into the yellowstone river near the town of glendive, the state's department of environmental quality reports. Bridger pipeline co. Noticed the breach saturday around 10am and shut the pipeline down by 11am, per a company statement. A spokesman for bullock initially told the ap that \" we think it was caught pretty quick \" and noted the frozen river may minimize damage. But cleanup crews are struggling through the ice, the ap notes. And although initial tests revealed no oil in the drinking water, residents started noting sunday that they \" smelled something funny \" in the water; the epa said in a statement last night that elevated hydrocarbon levels were detected in glendive's water, the grand forks herald reports. Drinking water is now being trucked into glendive \" as a precaution, \" say officials; an advisory against drinking water from the local treatment plant was also issued last night, the ap notes. Officials had said earlier yesterday that contamination was unlikely because of oil's tendency to float ( the water intake is nestled 14 feet below the surface ). The deq notes a few oil sheens have been seen, with the ap reporting one 60 miles downstream from glendive. In addition to the epa and deq, the coast guard, fish and wildlife service, and dot are all assessing the mess and assisting with cleanup, notes the herald. \" our primary concern is to minimize the environmental impact of the release and keep our responders safe as we clean up from this unfortunate incident, \" bridger vp tad true said in the statement.

        "summary": "President trump has picked his new national security adviser: army lt. Gen. Hr mcmaster. He is \" a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience, \" trump said in announcing his decision monday in florida, per politico. Mcmaster replaces michael flynn, who was asked to resign over his conversations with the russian ambassador about sanctions before taking office. The los angeles times calls mcmaster \" one of the military's most prominent intellectuals. \" some related coverage: a blogger at foreign policy who knows mcmaster calls him \" smart, energetic, and tough, \" and he maintains that mcmaster has written one of the best books on the vietnam war: dereliction of duty: johnson, mcnamara, the joint chiefs of staff, and the lies that led to vietnam. Mcmaster talks about life in the military in this 2014 interview with the ledger-enquirer of columbus, ga. Among the quotes: \" some people think, hey, you're in the military and everything is super-hierarchical and you're in an environment that is intolerable of criticism and people don't want frank assessments. I think the opposite is the case. In the army, because the stakes are so high — right? — you can't just be a yes-man and say, ' great idea, boss! ' if you don't believe it — right? — because lives are at stake. \" read it in full here. The new york times says mcmaster's thinking on counterterrorism served as the basis for gen. David petraeus'strategy that shifted momentum toward the us against insurgents in iraq. Last year, mcmaster warned that the army needed to stop shrinking, notes heavy.com in its five-things-to-know feature on the general. Mcmaster participated in the battle of 73 eastern during desert storm in which us troops were outnumbered but still prevailed because iraqi soldiers were using outdated equipment. He wrote about the battle and its lessons at the strategy bridge.",

Such is the case for ron m. Estes, who is running in kansas ' 4th congressional district against, you guessed it, another ron estes — gop rep. Ron g. Estes to be precise. Per kmuw, the longshot candidate says he is banking not on his name, but on his fellow south-central kansans'desire for change in the district served not long ago by current secretary of state mike pompeo. Candidate estes says he believes he would have chosen to run against congressman estes in the gop primary even if they had different names, but onlookers might find it hard to shake the feeling the name really does help. Candidate estes has spent just $ 2,000 on his campaign and doesn't plan to spend any more, he tells kansas.com. \"we knew we couldn't out-raise the current incumbent, so we've been a grass-roots campaign over social media, other things. \" those \" other things \" aside, the challenger's track record includes 40 years at boeing, during which he spent time on the aerospace giant's international space station project. He's hoping his high-level management experience will help him blaze a trail to washington against the other estes, the former state treasurer who took over for pompeo. State officials recently ruled that the incumbent will be distinguished from his opponent by being listed as \" rep. Ron estes \" on the primary ballot aug. 7.",

Already the worst legacy of the cold war when kim jong il took over from his father in 1994, north korea plunged into abject desolation in the 1990s as it was wracked by a famine that killed around 1 million people between 1995 and 1999.

        "summary": "The \" guru of bling \" is going to jail for 20 years for raping two women, and police in india are on high alert in case his followers revolt. A judge sentenced gurmeet ram rahim singh to the prison term on monday, after his conviction for raping two followers at his ashram in 2002, reports the bbc. ( singh received 10 years for each rape, and he must serve the sentences consecutively. ) singh's dera sacha sauda sect claims 50 million adherents worldwide, and scores of them in india went on a deadly rampage last week in northern haryana state after the conviction was announced. So far, however, things have remained calm after the sentencing. That might be because police have orders to shoot protesters on sight, reports reuters. Authorities had taken flak after last week's violence, in which nearly 40 people died, for giving the protesters free rein. The 50-year-old singh, also nicknamed the \" rockstar baba \" for his flamboyant style and vast media enterprises, plans to appeal his conviction. Two years ago, singh even put out his own movie, starring himself, in which he performs miracles, sings and dances, and roughs up gangsters.",

Greg mulvihill was shot in the side but survived; lovejoy, 45, and weldon mcdavid, 50, were both found guilty of attempted murder and conspiracy on nov. 13, reports people. The jury that convicted them heard how as part of their near-finalized divorce, lovejoy had been required to pay $ 120,000 to mulvihill, 47. Police say she instead planned to pay $ 2,000 to mcdavid, her firearms instructor and a former marine, to kill her husband. The pair allegedly decided to act on sept. 1, 2016, because a new moon meant it would be especially dark. That night, a male called mulvihill claiming he had incriminating evidence against him and directing him to a deserted path near carlsbad, calif. ( lovejoy had accused mulvihill of raping her and molesting their son, allegations mulvihill denies. ) mcdavid claimed he was just trying to shoot the flashlight mulvihill held and that he thought mulvihill showing up would indicate some kind of guilt that could be used in the custody battle. One juror's take: mcdavid's story \" was getting absurd at times. \" among the evidence: the ar-15 found in mcdavid's garage, mcdavid's dna found near the path, and cell-tower data that put mcdavid and lovejoy near the scene, authorities say. Lovejoy, who could face 25 years in prison, collapsed when the verdict was read, per the san diego union-tribune. Mcdavid, who could face 50 years, wept. Sentencing is dec. 12.
