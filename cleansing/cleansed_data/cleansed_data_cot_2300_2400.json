        "summary": "A massive leak of internal documents from bermuda-based law firm appleby has exposed the financial secrets of many of the world's elites — but while it may cause many tough questions to be asked, no evidence of law-breaking has surfaced. The \" paradise papers \" leak of 13.4 million records to german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung, which shared it with the international consortium of investigative journalists, is second only in size to the similar panama papers leak in 2016. It exposes the offshore interests of thousands of people, including celebrities, more than 100 politicians, and queen elizabeth ii, whose private estate reduced the tax payable to her majesty's government by investing millions of pounds in at least one offshore fund. Other famous names on the list include keira knightley, madonna, and bono, who became part owner of a shopping mall in lithuania through a low-tax investment in malta, the new york daily news reports. The guardian reports that in a major embarrassment to canadian prime minister justin trudeau, who has promised to target tax avoidance, the papers reveal that his chief fundraiser and financial adviser, stephen bronfman, shifted millions of dollars from canada to tax havens such as the cayman islands. The papers also name trump administration officials, including secretary of state rex tillerson and commerce secretary wilbur ross, reports the new york times. The documents reveal links to vladimir putin's son-in-law that ross didn't disclose during his confirmation process.",

        "summary": "The question of whether jesus was married became a hot topic in academic circles when a papyrus fragment surfaced in which he's quoted as talking about his wife. A harvard professor was convinced enough to present an academic paper on the subject, though skeptics abounded about the fragment's authenticity. Now the atlantic digs into the matter with an utterly fascinating investigative story, one that delves not so much into the scientific particulars but into the background of the man who provided the fragment to harvard's karen king. His name is walter fritz, a native of germany who now lives in florida, and that background is fishy indeed. While king allowed fritz to remain anonymous, fritz eventually concedes to ariel sabar of the atlantic that he is indeed the owner of the controversial fragment. Fritz's background includes a stint as head of a museum in the former east germany that he left amid the suspicious disappearance of pricey artifacts. There's also the porn business he started that centered around his wife, who, he claims, speaks a strange tongue, possibly aramaic, during sex. Plus there's the mountain of inconsistencies in his story about how he acquired the fragment, not to mention his background studying the ancient language of coptic that would have given him the know-how to create a forgery. Also: during an interview, he floated a proposition to sabar about collaborating on a book in which the writer would \" have to make a lot of stuff up. \" there's much more. The bottom line: in a follow-up story, king herself says fritz misrepresented himself to her, and she now concedes that the fragment is probably a forgery. Click to read the full story.",

Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to jesus's being married. The papyrus's lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between jesus and the apostles over whether his \"wife \" — possibly mary magdalene — was \"worthy \" of discipleship. Its main point, king argued, was that \"women who are wives and mothers can be jesus's disciples. \" she thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether \"marriage or celibacy [ was ] the ideal mode of christian life \" and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy.

But thursday, for the first time, king said the papyrus — which she introduced to the world in 2012 — is a probable fake. She reached this conclusion, she said, after reading the atlantic's investigation into the papyrus's origins, which appears in the magazine's july/august issue and was posted to its website wednesday night. \"it tips the balance towards forgery, \" she said. Critics had argued for years that errors in coptic grammar, similarities with the gospel of thomas, and other problems pointed to forgery. But king had placed her faith in the opinions of expert papyrologists, along with a series of carbon-dating and other scientific tests, at mit, harvard, and columbia, that had turned up no signs of modern tampering or forgery. When i called her in march while reporting my atlantic story, she said she was not interested in commenting on — or even hearing about — my findings before publication.

Its main point, king argued, was that \"women who are wives and mothers can be jesus's disciples. \" she thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether \"marriage or celibacy [ was ] the ideal mode of christian life \" and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Related story karen king responds to",
            "For four years, karen l. King, a harvard historian of christianity, has defended the so-called \"gospel of jesus's wife \" against scholars who argued it was a forgery. But thursday, for the first time, king said the papyrus — which she introduced to the world in 2012 — is a probable fake. She reached this conclusion, she said, after reading the atlantic's investigation into the papyrus's origins, which appears in the magazine's july/august issue and was posted to its website wednesday night. \"it tips the balance towards forgery, \" she said. Critics had argued for years that errors in coptic grammar, similarities with the gospel of thomas, and other problems pointed to forgery. But king had placed her faith in the opinions of expert papyrologists, along with a series of carbon-dating and other scientific tests, at mit, harvard, and columbia, that had turned up no signs of modern tampering or forgery. When i called her in march while reporting my atlantic story, she said she was not interested in commenting on — or even hearing about — my findings before publication. Thursday afternoon, however, she called me to say the story was \"fascinating \" and \"very helpful. \" although she had exchanged numerous emails with the owner and had met him in december 2011, she"

The times of india and bbc use words like \" tumbled \" and \" slipped \": a witness tells the latter that the railing was \" very low, \" and the man, identified only as maqsood, may have accidentally fallen. But a rep for the national zoological park tells the ap the man intentionally approached the tiger, going so far as to climb over the enclosure's low fence before jumping down 18 feet into a protective dry moat; the male tiger lives on the island the moat surrounds. Those who were on the scene say the tiger immediately approached maqsood and \" silently watched him for nearly 15 minutes. \" at some point, people began throwing rocks at the tiger to lure it away from the man, whom another zoo-goer described as \" cowering in fear \" and apparently pleading with the tiger. Instead, the creature pounced, reportedly dragging the man away by the neck. The wall street journal reports the zoo's director confirmed that staff were unable to divert the animal's attention and that the man \" died on the spot. \" ( the bbc's take is a much more brutal one: a witness says maqsood \" was writhing in pain... [ and ] suffered for the next 10 to 15 minutes. \" ) an official tells the times that a single guard is posted to each enclosure, and that visitors regularly ignore warnings to keep their distance.

Even more so now: archaeologists finished a three-week underwater excavation at the site off the coast of antikythera in southern greece on tuesday and discovered that the ship was much longer than believed. \" it's the titanic of the ancient world, \" brendan foley of the woods hole oceanographic institution explains in a press release. Researchers came to their conclusion after discovering the ship's remnants are strewn over 1,000 feet of seafloor, recovering some hull planks, and measuring a number of lead anchors at more than 3 feet long. The ship itself may have been as long as roughly 160 feet. Also among the \" stunning \" new finds: a bronze spear measuring 6.5 feet. Due to its size and heft, foley suspects it wasn't used as a weapon but instead was part of a statue. Four huge marble horses were uncovered by sponge divers in 1901, and foley suggests what could have been: a warrior, spear in hand, in a chariot pulled by the horses. The team calls the finds \" very promising \" and plans to return to the site next year — foley recently told the bbc that he hopes to find more pieces of the antikythera mechanism there. The bbc adds an intriguing bit of speculation: that the wreck, dating from 70bc to 60bc, was carrying a would-be bride and her dowry from asia minor to rome. ( it's been a banner week for shipwrecks, with canada finally identifying the wreck it most hoped to find. )",

The un petition, which accompanied a relative lull at the start of muslim holiday eid al-fitr, followed pleas for peace from president obama, un secretary ban ki-moon, and pope francis over the weekend, as well as a brief truce that deteriorated after just a few hours on saturday. Israeli jets, meanwhile, broke the lull, striking three sites in gaza in response to a rocket attack. Neither israel nor palestinian leaders seemed particularly pleased at the un's stance, which is non-binding. Un palestinian ambassador riyad mansour told ap reporters that \" you cannot keep 1.8 million palestinian civilians in the gaza strip in this huge prison, \" calling the situation \" inhumane \" and a \" recipe for disaster \" and saying a legally binding resolution should have been passed already to put a stop to israeli \" aggression. \" israel, for its part, took issue with the un statement because it made no mention of the country's right to defend itself or hamas launching rockets into israel. World leaders, including john kerry, have been holding out hope that a series of temporary ceasefires might be the impetus the embattled region needs to work out its problems for good, reports the new york times.",

It's not clear whether the man was bitten by the mouse or cat; either could have carried the bacteria, said doctors. Plague bacteria are carried by fleas, which typically infest rodents. People can become infected through flea bites or through contact with an infected animal.

It's called the asian longhorned tick, and so far the biggest threat is to animals. But there's still cause for concern. In asia, the species transmits a virus that proves fatal to 15 % of victims and is particularly lethal to seniors. One caveat about that: very little is known about the tick, and it's possible that the fatal virus in asia requires another host, one that is more common there. As for the new tick, it's been spotted in new york, new jersey, north carolina, pennsylvania, virginia, west virginia, and arkansas. \" it is an aggressive biter and frequently builds intense infestations on animals causing great stress... And blood loss, \" says a statement from the north carolina department of agriculture, per the charlotte observer. Other not-so-fun facts: females don't need males to reproduce, meaning a well-fed female tick can create an entire colony on her own. And the tick apparently can survive american winters, which will make year-round vigilance necessary. The longhorned tick is so named because it has antenna-like features that look like longhorns; the problem is, you'd need a microscope to spot those \" horns, \" a state agriculture official in pennsylvania tells the york daily record. One bright spot: so far, none of the tested ticks have had pathogens related to common tick-borne ailments such as lyme disease or babesiosis. ( maybe this type of clothing can help? )",

William sherman, who was heading toward the area after torching columbia in february 1865. Scientists, civil war fanatics, and other spectators cheered as the three cannons — a confederate brooke rifle and a captured union dahlgren naval gun — were retrieved by underwater archaeologists via an excavator. \" we brought a little bit of south carolina history to the surface today, \" butler tells the state. ( the navy went to raise a confederate warship from the depths of a georgia river in may. )",

Sherman's troops left columbia, s.c., on the morning of feb. 20, 1865, about a third of it lay in ashes behind them, with thousands left homeless. Within weeks, southerners had begun to publish what they considered evidence of an orchestrated northern atrocity. Ten years later, the dispute remained so sharp that sherman felt it necessary to defend himself in his memoirs by accusing confederates of setting the city on fire themselves.

If mesoglue works up to expectations, it \" may change the way we make electronics, \" reports techcrunch. Soldering — heating metal into molten form and using it to make things stick together — has been around thousands of years, notes a post at motherboard. But it's painstaking, and the heat involved is a hazard both to hobbyists ' fingers and to the electronics themselves. The new high-tech glue makes use of research into nanorods, \" infinitesimally small rods with metal cores, \" the researchers explain in a post at eureka alert. One side of the rod is coated with the element indium, the other with galium. \" these coated rods are arranged along a sub­strate like angled teeth on a comb: there is a bottom 'comb ' and a top 'comb, ' \" writes northeastern's hanchen huang. \"we then inter­lace the 'teeth. ' \" the two elements form a liquid when they touch, and \" the resulting glue pro­vides the strength and thermal/electrical con­duc­tance of a metal bond. \" put more simply: \" it's like welding or soldering without the heat. \" but don't write off soldering just yet. A blog post at technabob cautions that the one demo video currently available for mesoglue is \" oversimplified, \" and motherboard notes that \" lead remains as cheap as ever. \" no word yet on when the patented mesoglue might hit the market.",

Had his death occurred five years earlier it likely would have gone quietly unnoticed. But in 2008, karason went on the today show to talk to matt lauer about something most unusual: his blue skin. Karason says he started turning blue a decade and a half ago, the result of applying and ingesting silver. He was trying to treat dermatitis on his face and had used what the christian post describes as \" a silver-based remedy \" along with colloidal silver. Nbc news explains that the latter was something he drank, and describes it as a liquid karason made himself that has silver particles suspended in it. He consumed 10 ounces a day, notes abc news. It was outdated medicine, however: though silver had been used as medicine for thousands of years, it was effectively replaced by penicillin in the 1930s, and was banned by the fda because it causes argyria, in which silver amasses in the skin and organs and stays there. It causes the blue coloration. The post notes that karason was known by some children as \" papa smurf, \" but bristled when adults used the term, according to his estranged wife. In addition to his troubled marriage, karason fought prostate cancer and health problems, and struggled financially. He noted in a 2012 interview, \" people are reluctant to hire blue people. \" ( we last year reported the story of an entire kentucky family that was blue-skinned. )",

While the bill is expected to founder in the senate, as it did on previous attempts in 2013 and 2015, this time it the has backing of president trump. A white house statement says the administration \" strongly supports \" the measure \" to secure critical pro-life protections. \" the bill would criminalize abortions after 20 weeks except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the mother's life. Marjorie dannenfelser, head of the pro-life susan b. Anthony list, circulated a september 2016 letter in which then-candidate trump promised to support the bill, per the washington post. \" it's past time … to pass a nationwide law protecting unborn children from the unspeakable cruelty of late-term abortion, \" dannenfelser says. Gop sen. Lindsey graham pledged to introduce companion legislation in the senate, but the chances of republicans garnering the 60 votes needed to pass it are low, the hill reports. Asked about the bill, gop whip sen. John cornyn said, per cnn, \" that's not a near-term priority. \" several states have already passed similar measures, which opponents called unconstitutional. \" this dangerous, out-of-touch legislation is nothing more than yet another attempt to restrict women's access to safe, legal abortion, \" planned parenthood said.

In a study published last week in the international journal of primatology, researchers recount only the ninth recorded murder of a chimp by its own community. In 2007, foudouko was the leader of a group of more than 30 chimps in senegal, national geographic reports. He was nicknamed \" saddam, \" and anthropologist jill pruetz tells new scientist he was \" somewhat of a tyrant. \" but foudouko was overthrown and exiled for years, living on the edges of his former community. Then in 2013, he was killed by a group of younger males. The violence didn't stop there. The community spent nearly four hours brutalizing foudouko's body, according to a press release. They broke his bones, beat him with rocks, ripped at his body, and ate parts of him. Pruetz says she was \" really disturbed \" for days after watching video of the incident. Humans may ultimately be responsible for the rare and gruesome violence that befell foudouko. His community has nearly twice as many male chimps as females, likely due to poachers targeting female chimps. This increases tensions in the community, and foudouko may have been killed for approaching a female in heat. Horrifying as the incident may have been, one expert says it can help us better understand how chimp societies function. ( a lonely, deer-humping monkey shocked scientists and the internet. )",

        "summary": "Three teen girls allegedly stole a car in florida wednesday night — a joyride that ended tragically when the car plunged into a pinellas county pond, killing all three, wfla reports. The owner of the honda had given the girls a ride and stopped at a walmart, which is when cops say the teens, all of whom have been in trouble for grand theft auto before, took off. Early the next morning, sheriff's deputies saw the car run a red light and tailed it from a distance ( county deputies aren't permitted to pursue stolen cars, per the tampa bay times ), but the car drove to a cemetery and into the pond. The car was towed out of the water about two hours later. \" we don't know what the girls did or where they were between about 8: 30 … when they stole the car and when our sergeant saw them … about 3: 30, \" says pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri, per wfla. The only clue: a facebook post that said, \" who tryna get seen &amp; wheels? \" made by one of the teens at 8: 48pm. \" with the water and the thickness and with the windows being closed, unfortunately it just became a death chamber, \" gualtieri tells wfla. The teens were ided as dominique battle, 16, and ashaunti butler and laniya miller, both 15. Wtsp notes a car-theft \" epidemic \" has hit the area. Also in florida, per the ap: a 15-year-old boy from silver springs shores died wednesday after he fell off the back of a chevy camaro driven by a 17-year-old friend. The death of gianni fabian garcia, who hit his head on the pavement when he fell, is being investigated, the ocala star-banner reports.",

        "summary": "A century and a half after a legendary confederate submarine mysteriously sank, conservationists in charleston, sc, are still working to figure out why. Their latest step could be key: experts yesterday placed the 40-foot hl hunley in a solution that's 1 % sodium hydroxide and 99 % water, the post and courier reports. The caustic mixture should, over the course of several months, soften the hardened sand-and-shell layer that coats the iron vessel's hull. Each day, the tank the hunley is submerged in will be drained, allowing scientists to work to scrape that layer off before refilling the tub once again, reports the ap. Because under that layer \" is the possibility of new information about the attack, \" says an archaeologist. The sub was the first ever to sink an enemy ship — in this case, the union's housatonic, which was part of a blockade around the key southern port of charleston. Why the sub itself sank right afterward remains a mystery. \" chiseling away the concretion ( of sand and shell ) will allow us to travel back in time, potentially helping us learn what happened to the hunley and her crew that night, \" says south carolina lt. Gov. Glenn mcconnell. The sub currently sits in a 76,000-gallon tank, and once the salt is fully removed from the hull the hunley will be able to be safely displayed without being submerged in water. The full conservation process is expected to take five years. ( click for one theory on what sunk the hunley. )",

The uk researchers found traces of garlic mustard seeds in 6,000-year-old pots dug up in denmark and germany. Because the seeds have little nutritional value but deliver a peppery flavor, they conclude that the seeds'sole purpose was to spice up other foods in the pot, one of the researchers tells national geographic. The discovery is intriguing because it further challenges the notion that prehistoric people were concerned only about shoveling down food for basic sustenance, explains livescience. That is, meals weren't just about consuming calories — they may have had a larger social component than realized. The finding suggests that \" cooking and producing food was a very creative process for them, \" another of the researchers tells npr's the salt blog.

        "summary": "Some experts worry the us is heading for disaster due to a baby shortage, the washington post reports. According to 2016 data released friday by the cdc, the number of women giving birth in the us is down 1 % from 2015 and at a historic low. The birth rate is now 62 births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44. Experts are concerned about a \" national emergency \" if a shrinking population leads to fewer workers and a smaller tax base. And as usual, millennials are to blame. Here's what you need to know about birth rates and their impact: the birth rate is currently below \" replacement \" level — the rate at which a generation can exactly replace itself, medpage today reports. Older women are actually having more babies, but millennials are having so few the overall birth rate is declining anyway. Governing looks at some of the public policy implications of a shrinking birth rate — which resulted in 4 million fewer babies being born between 2008 and 2016 — including what it means for public education due to a decline in elementary school population. As part of the declining birth rate in young women, the teen birth rate hit an all-time low, dropping 9 % from 2015, cnn reports. The teen birth rate has now dropped 67 % since 1991. A physician with nationwide children's hospital says the reason is \" access to contraceptives and use of contraceptives \" among teens. One rate that is increasing, according to nbc news: preterm births. Nearly 10 % of babies born in 2016 were born early. It's the second year in a row preterm births increased, and experts say the current plan to cut medicaid, which covers half of all births, would make the problem worse. Meanwhile in india: despite the fertility rate dropping from 4.97 children per woman to 2.3 children per woman over the past 40 years, the country's population is predicted to keep growing, hitting the 1.44 billion mark and surpassing china in seven years, the hindu reports.",

        "summary": "An ancient legend tells of a man sneaking a human boy into an animal sacrifice to zeus on greece's mount lykaion and being turned into a wolf as punishment, the washington post reports. But despite plato and others writing about ongoing human sacrifices, archaeologists have never been able to confirm the practice on mainland greece, according to the ap. That may have just changed. On wednesday, the guardian reports, the greek government announced the discovery of a 3,000-year-old skeleton belonging to a teenage boy. It was found buried at the ancient sacrificial altar on mount lykaion amidst the ashes from 1,000 years of animal sacrifices. The find may confirm what the ap calls \" one of the darkest legends of antiquity. \" an expert at columbia university tells the post that the find, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, could be \" extremely significant. \" ancient writers reported ongoing human sacrifices at mount lykaion, a center of zeus worship, possibly in hopes of being turned into wolves. Evidence — including the removal of most of the skull and the arrangement of the body — points to the newly discovered remains being those of a human sacrifice. However, a body being buried at the altar where it was sacrificed would be unusual. Archaeologists hope to find more evidence for the existence of human sacrifices in ancient greece. And with only 7 % of the mount lykaion altar having been excavated, there's a chance more human remains are waiting. ( an archaeologist thinks she's solved the mystery of mexico's teotihuacan. )",

        "summary": "A small swiss museum is ready to take on a huge collection of art looted by the nazis — and the mammoth task of finding the rightful owners of the paintings. Insiders tell the wall street journal that the kunstmuseum bern is preparing to accept the $ 1.3 billion collection of cornelius gurlitt, who died in may — not long after his hoard was discovered at his munich home — and unexpectedly made the museum his sole heir. If the museum does accept the collection, heirs of holocaust victims could receive restitution in a matter of days. Gurlitt, the son of hitler's art dealer, made a deal with german authorities to return art known to have been looted to present-day heirs. Sources say gurlitt decided to leave the collection, much of which had been deemed \" degenerate \" by the nazis, to the swiss because he was unhappy about how he was treated by german authorities. But the german government, which has been under pressure to return stolen artwork, will be glad to see the scandal end, the journal notes. One potential hiccup could be a psychiatric report that found gurlitt was in no fit state to make a will — he was paranoid and believed nazis had been hunting him since the 1960s to recover the art, according to reports in the german press — but it's not likely to be an issue unless the museum decides against taking the collection, causing the art to be distributed among gurlitt's distant relatives, deutsche welle reports.",

            "It could have all been so simple. Shortly before his death, the son of art collector hildebrand gurlitt willed his massive art collection - which is still is police custody - to a swiss museum. The hundreds of paintings and drawings, which include nazi-looted art that once belonged to jewish collectors, would be relocated to a legally neutral country. In gurlitt's trove, the so-called \" degenerate art \" - works by jewish artists deemed culturally unacceptable by the nazis - would be permanently loaned to german museums. In addition, the german task force, under the direction of attorney ingeborg berggreen-merkel, would be permitted to continue its provenience research, in order to determine which items from the gurlitt collection had been looted during the nazi period and should be returned to their jewish heirs. When the more than 1,500 works, worth millions of euros, were uncovered in gurlitt's munich residence and his salzburg house in fall of 2013, questions arose that poked deep into germany's shameful past and renewed the debate of how nazi-looted art and artifacts should be legally dealt with three-quarters of a century later. The gurlitt case, however, seemed to be neatly resolved and shelved - until german newspaper \" süddeutsche zeitung \" reported monday that cornelius gurlitt's will may not be legally binding. Diagnosis: paranoia cornelius gurlitt died in may at the age of 81 according to the \" süddeutsche zeitung, \" a psychiatric examination indicates that gurlitt was not mentally stable enough to complete a valid will. Helmut hausner, lawyer and head physician at the center for psychiatry in cham, in bavaria, compiled the 48 page report. Cornelius gurlitt allegedly suffered from \" paranoia, \" which voids his \" freedom to decide \" while composing his will. Gurlitt is said to have felt that he's been hunted by nazis since the 1960s, believing that they wanted to steal the paintings he'd inherited from his father.

            "It could have all been so simple. Shortly before his death, the son of art collector hildebrand gurlitt willed his massive art collection - which is still is police custody - to a swiss museum. The hundreds of paintings and drawings, which include nazi-looted art that once belonged to jewish collectors, would be relocated to a legally neutral country. In gurlitt's trove, the so-called \" degenerate art \" - works by jewish artists deemed culturally unacceptable by the nazis - would be permanently loaned to german museums. In addition, the german task force, under the direction of attorney ingeborg berggreen-merkel, would be permitted to continue its provenience research, in order to determine which items from the gurlitt collection had been looted during the nazi period and should be returned to their jewish heirs. When the more than 1,500 works, worth millions of euros, were uncovered in gurlitt's munich residence and his salzburg house in fall of 2013, questions arose that poked deep into germany's shameful past and renewed the debate of how nazi-looted art and artifacts should be legally dealt with three-quarters of a century later. The gurlitt case, however, seemed to be neatly resolved and shelved - until german newspaper \" süddeutsche zeitung \" reported monday that cornelius gurlitt's will may not be legally binding. Diagnosis: paranoia cornelius gurlitt died in may at the age of 81 according to the \" süddeutsche zeitung, \" a psychiatric examination indicates that gurlitt was not mentally stable enough to complete a valid will. Helmut hausner, lawyer and head physician at the center for psychiatry in cham, in bavaria, compiled the 48 page report. Cornelius gurlitt allegedly suffered from \" paranoia, \" which voids his \" freedom to decide \" while composing his will. Gurlitt is said to have felt that he's been hunted by nazis since the 1960s, believing that they wanted to steal the paintings he'd inherited from his father. According to the \" süddeutsche zeitung, \" hausner based his findings on documents and letters from gurlitt's estate.

But towering above them was one beefy rodent that one scientist calls \" punxsutawney phil on steroids \" — with super senses to boot. The 20-pound vintana sertichi was accidentally found in a giant slab of sandstone in madagascar, reports national geographic. Researchers were looking for fish fossils, but they found instead vintana, perfectly preserved and complete. And he's quite odd: not only is he \" humongous, \" but had superhero sight and very sensitive hearing. But his nose was the best — analysis of vintana's brain revealed 14 % of it was dedicated to smell; dogs only use.31 %. \" the very exotic combination of its skull features are so beyond our previous imagination, \" says a paleontologist. Some of vintana's more reptilian traits suggest an ancient lineage on the mainland before the species was isolated on madagascar, where its eccentricities evolved, adds the national science foundation. There, it also took on more mammalian features — like a diet of roots, seeds, and nutty fruits, adds the guardian. Vintana is special for another reason: it's one leaf on an undiscovered branch of the mammalian family tree — the gondwanatherians. They lived in the southern hemisphere, \" a part of the world ( of ) which we know nothing, \" says one researcher. \" gondwanatherians were completely unknown 30 years ago, \" says the paleontologist.

As we wrote back in october, this is a key piece of the \"big data meets local \" trend to provide analytics around physical world locations. In that respect, the best way to think about placed insights is comscore for the offline world. Much like comscore, placed gets its data from an opt-in panel of mobile users. It has accelerated that effort by paying app developers to integrate opt-in location tracking to their apps. After collecting all this data for a few years, the result has been 13 billion locations measured from about 70, 000 panelists. As we've discussed, this can be valuable for retailers, brands, advertisers or app developers to measure user behavior and build strategy accordingly. From our previous writeup: users of a given app can be measured to see that in the aggregate, 8 % are likely to be near a mcdonalds or 12 % are likely to be near a starbucks. This has marketing implications for these chains, as well as their competitors or complimentary products. According to shim, placed offers this data for free, and will begin to monetize after an ecosystem is formed around its use. There are also many upsell possibilities such triangulating different data sets to discern deeper levels of understanding of user behavior. To illustrate what insights is capable of, today's launch comes with a few data nuggets. Check them out below, and more to come as we follow placed and the overall developing \"location analytics \" space. It will come into play in location based mobile ad targeting among other things.

A man named carter had tended 90 acres of cotton, only to have his landlord seize the entire crop and his possessions. From the town of ratio, in phillips county, arkansas, a black farmer reported that a plantation manager refused to give sharecroppers an itemized account for their crop. Another sharecropper told of a landlord trying \"to starve the people into selling the cotton at his own price. They ain't allowing us down there room to move our feet except to go to the field. \" no one could know it at the time, but within a year these inauspicious meetings would lead to one of the worst episodes of racial violence in u.s.

When the plan was announced earlier this week, conservative evangelist franklin graham urged donors and alumni to withhold support from the school, complaining that \" christianity is being excluded from the public square and followers of islam are raping, butchering, and beheading christians, jews, and anyone who doesn't submit to their sharia islamic law, \" npr reports. Officials say there had been a flood of \" vitriolic \" emails and calls objecting to the plan, as well as some security concerns. Graham tells the news &amp; observer that he thinks the school's 700 or so muslims should be allowed to worship on campus: \" let duke donate the land and let saudi arabia build a mosque for them, \" he says. Before the plan to broadcast the call once a week was scrapped, the chapel's associate dean for religious life said it reflected duke's commitment to religious plurality. The call will instead be broadcast on the quadrangle outside the chapel before muslims move to the chapel's basement for friday prayers as they've done for the last two years, reports the ap, which notes that the chapel has also hosted buddhist meditations and hindu services.",

The metropolitan police department says between 20 and 30 young people showed up at a diesel store on m street, cbs dc reports, with the post noting the incident happened right before 6pm. A police report cited by the paper indicates the perpetrators just started pulling items off the racks, making off with four leather jackets worth about $ 800, plus about $ 12,000 in other merchandise. Although one employee was said to have been pushed during the fracas, police say there were no injuries. It's not the first time a flash mob has descended upon an upscale georgetown retailer. In 2014, a group of teens flooded into a true religion store and helped themselves to merch around dinnertime, which one shopper described as \" odd \": \" stuff happens maybe later, but not at 6pm, \" she told wjla at the time. Shoplifting crimes had picked up enough, in fact, to spur local businesses, police, and residents to start using a group-messaging app in february 2014 to keep tabs on \" people they thought were suspicious, \" the post notes.

Instead, it's become an exercise in racial profiling. Local police in the washington, d.c., neighborhood recorded more than 120 thefts in just the last 60 days, according to cbs news. The group-messaging chat room, which comprises 380 members, was meant to help shopkeepers, police, and others alert each other about shoplifters or people who seem suspicious. In the more than 3,000 messages exchanged about suspicious people in the operation groupme group since january, nearly 70 percent were black, according to a review by the business improvement district.

The georgetown business improvement district partnered with local police to launch \"operation groupme \" early last year to connect small businesses, police officers, and community leaders in a concerted fight against shoplifting. Instead, it's become an exercise in racial profiling. Local police in the washington, d.c., neighborhood recorded more than 120 thefts in just the last 60 days, according to cbs news. The group-messaging chat room, which comprises 380 members, was meant to help shopkeepers, police, and others alert each other about shoplifters or people who seem suspicious.

        "summary": "It's something most of us have done before: ignored a headache. A 26-year-old california man did just that beginning in late august, but then the pain got worse. The cause turned out to be almost unimaginable: a tapeworm larva that had made its way to his brain. The napa valley register reports that luis ortiz's mother took him to the er at queen of the valley medical center in early september after disorientation and vomiting set in while he was at her house. It wasn't a moment too soon. A cyst had formed around the worm that was preventing water from getting to ortiz's brain. His neurosurgeon, dr. Soren singel, likened the situation to \" a cork in a bottle, \" and said the sacrament state senior was perhaps 30 minutes away from death. A drain served to relieve the pressure on his brain, and surgery that involved drilling into his skull followed. Singel suspects ortiz ate something that contained tapeworm eggs, with the larvae making its way to his intestines and then brain. What was removed from the cyst was a wiggling worm that measured just 1/16 of an inch. Ortiz is on medication designed to wipe out any other lingering tapeworms, and has had to withdraw from school while he does therapy designed to strengthen his memory. Cbs sacramento reports that where the tapeworm came from is \" still a mystery, \" though pork — or the feces of someone who was infected via pork and then prepared food ortiz ate — is a possibility. The cdc explains that neurocysticercosis is a \" parasitic infection caused by larval cysts of the pork tapeworm \" that hospitalizes about 1,000 americans each year. For now, ortiz says, \" i have been staying away from pork. \" ( something even grosser was pulled from a man's head last year. )",

The new york times reports he hopped onto google earth to look around a little and stumbled across what could prove to be the oldest earthworks ever discovered. Two weeks ago — eight years after dey made his discovery — nasa released the first satellite images of the 260 or so mounds, banks, and trenches that populate a remote area of the country. According to quartz, the largest of these man-made geometric figures is called the ushtogaysky square. It's 810,000 square feet with each side measuring as long as an aircraft carrier. \"i've never seen anything like this, \" one nasa scientist tells the times. \" i found it remarkable. \" kazakhstan has shown little interest in studying what are now called the steppe geoglyphs since dey discovered them in 2007, the times reports. In fact, so little had been published about the discovery that a professor looking into them thought they must be a hoax, according to the telegraph. That's starting to change. The times reports initial research into the earthworks reveals the oldest to be about 8,000 years old. If that's true, it would be the oldest ever found. Dey believes they could have been built by stone age tribes living in the region, which would challenge scientific assumptions on early nomadic peoples. Tribes would have to have been larger, better organized, and more stationary than previously thought. Dey is now hoping to set up a base from which to study the geoglyphs, and nasa has requested photos of the area from astronauts. ( one geoglyph found in kazakhstan is in the shape of a swastika. )",

Years of work led intelligence agents to believe the $ 1 million compound — which reuters calls \" luxurious \" and notes is about eight times bigger than neighboring homes — was built specifically to house and protect osama bin laden. Its construction close to the capital raises questions about whether pakistani officials knew of bin laden's location. The key break came when us intelligence discovered one of bin laden's trusted couriers two years ago and tracked him. Finally, last august they discovered the super-fortified compound where the courier and his brother lived. With a series of barbed-wire-topped walls up to 18 feet high, few windows, and no internet or telephones, the compound was extremely secure. There was a third-floor terrace tucked behind a seven-foot privacy wall, and a series of internal walls as well. The compound's residents burned their trash, rather than allow it to be collected. By february, officials were convinced it housed bin laden himself. After a series of national security council meetings, finally, last friday, president barack obama gave the go-ahead for the raid.

The state's energy and environment department yesterday put up a website describing key evidence, just as the oklahoma geological survey said in a statement that \" the injection of produced water in disposal wells \" is \" very likely \" causing most of the state's quakes. The statement, which notes residents should prepare for a \" significant earthquake, \" says that prior to 2008, the state saw about 1.5 quakes each year that were magnitude 3 or greater, reuters reports; there are now about 2.5 per day. Most of the activity \" is occurring over a large area, about 15 % of the area of oklahoma, that has experienced significant increase in wastewater disposal volumes. \" the website and statement mark a major change for oklahoma. Last fall, gov. Mary fallin dismissed links between oil and gas activity and earthquakes as rumor. Still, the oklahoma oil and gas association isn't buying the ogs ' claims. \" there may be a link between earthquakes and disposal wells, \" its president says, per the new york times. \" but we — industry, regulators, researchers, lawmakers, or state residents — still don't know enough about how wastewater injection impacts oklahoma's underground faults. \" rep.

But it wasn't until the 15-year-old virginia resident paid a visit that its math error was fixed, reports boston.com. The teen noticed that the exhibit's equation for the \" golden ratio \" was off. \" there was a minus sign instead of a plus sign three times, \" he tells myfox boston. He brought it to the attention of the museum, and soon received a letter of thanks. \" they had the text big but the equation small, so i guess it's pretty easy for your eyes to skim over, \" says the teen, who hopes to go to mit. He described the exhibit as \" pretty cluttered \" and speculated that most visitors wouldn't pause to read the entire plaque that featured the golden ratio. The exhibit — the work of charles and ray eames — has been in place since 1981, but the equation is now correct for the first time. Or, more correct. In a statement released yesterday, the museum noted the way it presented \" the golden ratio in [ the ] exhibit is in fact the less common — but no less accurate — way to present it. \" still, it was able to make the change, something the museum's exhibit content developer wasn't sure they could do at first. Because the exhibit itself is \" considered an artifact...

Mr murdoch told the culture committee he had not been \" aware \" of an email suggesting the practice went wider than a \" rogue \" news of the world reporter. But ex-now editor colin myler and ex-ni legal manager tom crone have now said they \" did inform \" him of the email. Mr murdoch later said he \" stands by his testimony \" to the committee on tuesday. Meanwhile, the bbc has learned the fbi plans to contact actor jude law following claims his mobile phone was hacked during a visit to the us. It is alleged a story published by the news of the world in 2003 was based on information obtained from his voicemail which, if proved, could lead to charges in the us because his phone would have been operating on a us network. News international denies the claims. In another development on thursday, it emerged sun features editor matt nixson had been sacked from the paper in relation to an investigation into the time he was at the news of the world. The management and standards committee of news corporation, the parent company",
            "Mr. Myler and mr. Crone's statement seems to mark a round of finger-pointing, coming days after the testimony of mr. Murdoch and his father, rupert, the news corporation chairman, who testified that he was not to blame for the hacking and was let down by people he trusted. Mr. Myler and mr. Crone spoke out because they were angered that the company was telling reporters that they had failed to tell james murdoch about critical facts in the civil lawsuit, three executives said in interviews. In a statement, mr. Murdoch said, \"i stand by my testimony to the select committee. \" on tuesday, mr. Murdoch also told the committee that he \"did not get involved in any of the negotiations directly \" and that the settlement seemed reasonable at the time. Beyond mr. Myler and mr. Crone, other news international executives, as well as members of mr. Taylor's legal team, painted a picture of mr. Murdoch as being quite engaged in keeping the case from going to trial. They say that the size of the settlement he authorized reflected that. Photo in july 2008, news international's chief financial officer, clive milner, was asked to endorse a check for £ 725,000. He was not told what it was for — only that \"the check is for james murdoch, \" according to a company official"

C overdosed on acetaminophen and veuve clicquot champagne after learning she had breast cancer, reports the bbc, and though she survived, damage to her organs has necessitated dialysis — and she won't do it.

King's college hospital in london had asked the court to weigh in, arguing that the treatment should be \" imposed \" on her, even if it meant drugging her into a complacent state to do so.

Her lawsuit, which accuses the firm of violating virginia employment law, seeks two additional weeks of severance pay she says she was promised, along with legal fees, usa today reports. Attorney maria simon at the geller law group says briskman's \" expression of disapproval \" is \" fundamental political speech \" protected by state law as well as the constitution. The lawsuit accuses akima of firing briskman out of fear of illegal government retaliation and notes that a senior director wasn't fired for violating social media policy after making profane comments about a black lives matter supporter on facebook, the guardian reports. Briskman says she filed the lawsuit in the belief \" americans should not be forced to choose between their principles and their paychecks. \" \" working for a company that does business with the federal government should provide you with greater opportunities, but it should never limit your ability to criticize that government in your private time, \" she says.

        "summary": "A gunman \" hellbent on killing a lot of people \" at seattle pacific university was stopped thanks to a student's bravery, police say. As the gunman — who shot one person dead and wounded others in a university building — paused to reload his shotgun, he was pepper-sprayed by jon meis, a student working as a building monitor, police say. Meis put the suspect, identified as 26-year-old aaron ybarra, in a chokehold as other students and faculty members rushed to help hold him down. Ybarra has been booked on murder charges and police say he was carrying a knife and more shotgun shells. Meis is being hailed as a soft-spoken hero, but \" we're not really talking to anyone right now, \" his sister tells the seattle times. \"it doesn't surprise me that he would step in to do something like that, \" adds a classmate. \" he's a selfless guy. \" as for ybarra, he was not a student at the small, christian university and his family and friends are mystified by the rampage. \" it makes no sense at all, \" says a man who described himself as one of ybarra's closest friends. \" he's super happy and friendly. He's an awesome guy, someone who would never let you down. \" he says his friend didn't drink or do drugs and had recently gotten a new job bagging groceries. After the shooting, scores of students and staff members gathered in the center of campus to pray, the seattle post-intelligencer reports. \" remember he is loved and a son, \" said one freshman offering prayers for the gunman. \" he is a brother of ours. Remember he is a son and that he is so loved. \" a 20-year-old female remains in critical condition, while two male students suffered lesser injuries. One wasn't shot but was instead injured in the struggle to subdue the gunman.",

        "summary": "Jeb bush's new slogan has really taken off, but not in the way he might've hoped. Despite recent cuts to his campaign budget and staff, bush appeared at a florida event on monday promising to set the country on the right track. \" after seven years of incompetence, corruption, and gridlock in washington, we need a president who can fix it. I can fix it, \" bush said, standing in front of a banner reading, \" jeb can fix it. \" the event was meant to turn a new leaf for bush, who's fallen to fifth in the gop pack after poor debate performances. But rather than casting bush in a presidential light, social media users are comparing him to car repairmen, marriage counselors, and even bob the builder under the hashtag #jebcanfixit, per the washington post. One twitter user jokes that if bush quits the gop race, he ' ll get his own hgtv show called jeb can fix it, while another suggests his slogan refers to florida's role in deciding the 2000 presidential election results. Donald trump also threw some shade: \" i never thought of jeb as a crook! stupid message, the word ' fix ' is not a good one to use in politics! \" he tweeted. Gawker points out bush's slogan is ill-advised for another, more obscure reason: it's similar to jim ' ll fix it — the once-popular british children's show hosted by jimmy savile, who was later accused of sexually abusing more than 450 people, including children. The observer goes as far as to say the slogan \" could end mr. Bush's run \" since the online digs show his message \" is not being taken seriously and that his candidacy is a joke. \"",

She ended up getting fired after seven months, but before she left, worried that regulators were being way too deferential to the bank, she began recording meetings. The tapes \" portray a new york fed that is at times reluctant to push hard against goldman and struggling to define its authority, \" writes jake bernstein. At one point, for example, an examiner is quoted as suggesting that the team tell goldman, \" don't mistake our inquisitiveness, and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general, as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily. \" in other words, let's not upset the bank. After listening to the recordings, financial writer michael lewis concludes that \" the ray rice video for the financial sector has arrived. \" taken in full, they show a \" breathtaking wussiness \" on the part of fed employees, he writes at bloomberg. His top takeaway: \" you sort of knew that the regulators were more or less controlled by the banks. Now you know. \" segarra, he adds, lost her job and undermined her career on wall street in making this information public, and he hopes it's not in vain. \" the fed is probably telling itself that, like the financial crisis, this, too, will blow over. It shouldn't. \" click to read his full column or to read the full report at propublica. Links to the radio broadcast with the actual recordings are here.",
