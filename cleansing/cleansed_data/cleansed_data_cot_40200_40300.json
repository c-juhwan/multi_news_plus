Blodget bemoaned the plight of the \" poor guy \" whose job is to \" stand in the bathroom watching people pee all day. \" their presence, he wrote, invokes a series of emotions: \" annoyance, guilt, pity, uncomfortable invasion of personal space, and then... Extortion. \" first we feast followed up on the blog post, asking balthazar owner keith mcnally for a response, and was surprised to receive this: \" unfortunately, i completely agree with it and will, in the next few weeks, relieve the restaurant's bathroom attendants of their duties, \" he said. But the atlantic wire followed up on that news by interviewing the actual bathroom attendants, who say they hadn't heard anything about it. Cheikhou niane, who has manned balthazar's bathroom for four years, says he doesn't think mcnally will follow through, because his job is too important. \" if there's not somebody here, \" he says, \" people come in, drop the paper, pee, no flushing, make kaka, no flushing. Very very very messy. \" for his part, blodget appears to feel bad that he might be costing niane and his colleagues their jobs. \" whoa! i hope they're hiring them as waiters! \" he tweeted, then promised business insider would create three new jobs to replace those lost.",

Unbeknownst to them, another enormous monument has been \" hiding in plain sight \" half a mile away. Satellite and drone imagery and ground surveys have revealed a platform as long as an olympic-size swimming pool and twice as wide buried beneath the sand at the world heritage site, reports national geographic. Inside sat a smaller platform that would have housed a 28-by-28-foot building facing a staircase that study author christopher tuttle calls \" fascinating, \" per the guardian; the staircase is atypical in that it does not face the heart of petra. \" i find it interesting that such a monumental feature doesn't have a visible relationship to the city, \" he says. He says archaeologists previously suspected something was at the location of his find, but \" the structure's sides resembled terrace walls common to the city \" and so were seemingly ignored. Pottery found on the surface suggests the structure may date to about 150bc — or petra's first glory age, per the bbc. Many of petra's most iconic structures were built later, from the end of the first century bc to the second century ad. The city was eventually abandoned in the seventh century ad, rediscovered in 1812, and named one of the 7 new wonders of the world in 2007. No excavations are scheduled, but co-author sarah parcak notes satellite surveys of sites elsewhere in the world are underway.

Located amid rugged desert canyons and mountains in what is now the southwestern corner of the hashemite kingdom of jordan, petra was once a thriving trading center and the capital of the nabataean empire between 400 b.c. And a.d. 106. The city sat empty and in near ruin for centuries. Only in the early 1800s did a european traveler disguise himself in bedouin costume and infiltrate the mysterious locale. In 1985, the petra archaeological park was declared a unesco world heritage site",

Satellite surveys of the city revealed a massive platform, 184ft by 161ft, with an interior platform that was paved with flagstones, lined with columns on one side and with a gigantic staircase descending to the east. A smaller structure, 28ft by 28ft, topped the interior platform and opened to the staircase. Pottery found near the structure suggests the structure could be more than 2,150"

        "summary": "When doctors in india opened up a tumor in a teenager's lower jaw on monday, something unexpected happened. \" little pearl-like teeth started coming out, one by one. Initially, we were collecting them, they were really like small white pearls. But then we started to get tired. We counted 232 teeth, \" 17-year-old ashik gavai's doctor tells the bbc. At one point, they also took a chisel and hammer to remove fragments of a \" marble-like \" structure in the boy's jaw, the telegraph reports. The surgery took seven hours and a four-person medical team in a mumbai hospital. Turns out gavai, from a village in western india, had a complex composite odontoma — basically a benign tumor. It usually forms in the upper jaw and causes the gums to make lots of teeth, and it could've damaged gavai's jaw bone, the mumbai mirror reports. Gavai's 18-month saga had become a cancer scare for his parents, who took him to mumbai when the village doctors couldn't figure out what was causing swelling in the right side of his jaw. A month ago the swelling caused severe pain, and that's when his parents feared the worst. Now that gavai is back to having the normal 28 teeth, he's not out of the woods. Doctors say the condition could come back, especially if a tooth or fragment was left behind. Gavai's case may be a record — the most teeth taken out of such a tumor was previously 37, the doctor says. Next stop: doctors will apply for the guinness book of world records. ( this woman had an 88-pound tumor removed after she noticed she'd been gaining weight. )",

The independent reports the unnamed owner of the $ 5 liberty head half eagle — of which 268 total were made by the san francisco mint in 1854, per coinweek — didn't think the coin was real, and coin experts had told him as much. But one dealer thought it would be worthwhile to get one more opinion, and so the owner handed the coin over to third-party authenticator numismatic guaranty corporation, which set about on a complex course of detective work to compare the new coin to the three existing ones. Gizmodo explains that wasn't an easy task: although it had high-res scans of two of the coins ( one at the smithsonian, the other owned by a coin-collecting family called the pogues ), the third coin had been owned by the du pont family — and had been stolen in 1967 and never found. Authenticators used images of the du pont coin from 1962, when it had last been auctioned off, to establish both that it wasn't the stolen coin and that commonalities among all four coins proved this newest coin was the real deal. Ngc won't put an exact number on the coin's value, as it specializes only in authentication, but estimates it's worth \" millions. \" meanwhile, the only clue to the owner: it's a guy who has lived in new england his whole life, and he's now going to be \" quite rich, \" a coin expert tells the chronicle.

Hena akhter's family talked to cnn this week, and offered a heartbreaking story of the girl's death. In their telling, akhter's much older cousin, mahbub khan, had repeatedly harassed the girl, and finally this winter trapped her in a bathroom stall, gagged her, beat her, and raped her. When his wife walked in on the scene, she beat hena, too, and then reported the \"adultery \" to the local imam. A makeshift tribunal sentenced hena to 101 lashes — she passed out after 70. She arrived at the hospital bleeding badly, and died a week later. Yet the autopsy report listed no injuries, ruling her death a suicide. Now, hena's family is suing that doctor, and have ensured that many involved in hena's punishment have been arrested. Bangladesh's public seems outraged, and that might be the faint silver lining here, writes nicholas kristof of the new york times. \" let's hope that the public reaction and punishments are so strong that the word goes out … that such misogynist fatwas are not only immoral but illegal. \"",

But why did herod have his lavish home — the roman world's biggest palace complex — built at a strategically useless desert location? because his mother nearly died there in a wagon accident when herod, then galilee's governor, fled the advancing parthians in 40 bc; in thanksgiving for her survival, he promised to be buried there, smithsonian reports. Today it's in the west bank, where palestinians say the palace belongs to them — but israel has declared the site a park and wants it as a tourist attraction. Though herodium was first ided in 1838, it wasn't until 2007 that archaeologist ehud netzer said he was able to pinpoint the location of herod's tomb. Though a rare, smashed sarcophagus was found there, bones weren't; netzer said at the time that jews who were rebelling against the romans likely destroyed the space between 66ad and 77ad. ( another recent discovery suggests kings david and solomon were real. )",

A baby boy was born to a surrogate in december from a fertilized embryo frozen by the couple. It was to have been implanted in the womb of liu xi, but she and her husband of two years, shen jie, died in a 2013 car crash just five days before the scheduled procedure, reports the guardian. As liu and shen had no siblings, per the new york times, their deaths might've meant the end of their family lines — if their parents hadn't intervened. They demanded a court grant them authority over the couple's embryos, stored at a hospital in nanjing. After a complicated three-year legal battle — it involved suing each other, per the times — they won. Since surrogacy is illegal in china, an embryo was then implanted into the womb of a 27-year-old surrogate from laos. To ensure chinese citizenship, the child was born in a hospital in guangzhou, with the four grandparents taking dna tests to confirm the identities of his deceased parents, reports the bbc. Liu's mother named him tiantian, meaning \" sweet. \" his \" eyes look like my daughter's but overall, he looks more like his father, \" she tells the beijing news, per the guardian.

Chandra also tweeted the bill's tally, $ 231,115, which was almost entirely covered by her insurance provider. Chandra's thread, which shows photos of ethan in the hospital and playing after recovery, struck a chord on twitter; her first tweet was liked by more than 81,000 and shared more than 53,000 times. \" it's been kind of crazy, honestly, \" she told buzzfeed news, \"but i ' m hoping that i can be a clear voice for our community and for kids like ethan who stand to lose so much from this bill. \" the mother of two added that if ethan's coverage is taken away or given caps, the family would have to sell its home and move to canada, where her husband is from. Meanwhile, chandra says the healthcare debate has given her 4-year-old daughter political aspirations. \" she told me recently that when she becomes president she's going to make sure that everyone can go to the doctor when they need to. \"",

        "summary": "The taliban has been taking pointers from the islamic state's online presence, keeping its social media accounts and website updated and fresh, and even launching a new app through the google play store last week. But that app — called \" pashto afghan news — alemarah, \" per the guardian — has now been scrubbed from the store, and some are wondering how and why it made it through google at all, especially since the company just last year announced an age-rating system designed to filter out questionable content. The app broadcast official statements and videos, which may have been considered propaganda, from the militant group. And as gizmodo points out, google play's policies don't allow \" apps that depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities, \" which could mean documenting terrorist attacks or featuring instructions on how to carry out one — not exactly a far-fetched possibility on a taliban product. The app disappeared from google play on saturday due to \" technical issues \" and will be back soon, is how a taliban spokesman is framing it, per bloomberg. Google's statement on the matter isn't clearing much up. \" while we don't comment on specific apps, we can confirm that we remove apps from google play that violate our policies, \" a google play spokesperson tells the next web, which notes that isis also has an app on google play — but that app is a messaging app, so it may not be promoting hate speech or propaganda the way the taliban's may have been. And while it's not clear whether that's what the app was doing, a european university institute researcher of militant islamists notes to the guardian that the app was put out in pashto, indicating \" the local pashtun population is the main audience and it could thus be perceived as an attempt to bolster its support in eastern afghanistan where [ isis ] … is pushing for control. \"",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's isn't exactly contagious, but a protein that goes on to form the disease was perhaps passed to patients during surgery, meaning there could be an acquired form of the disease, a new study finds. Uk researchers, who describe their finding in nature, studied the brains of eight people 36 to 51 who died of creutzfeldt-jakob disease, caused by proteins known as prions, or \" proteinaceous infectious particles, \" per popular science. They found all had contracted the disease via accidental exposure to prions when they were given a contaminated growth hormone to treat growth problems, reports reuters. But researchers also discovered something else: \" what we found, very much to our surprise, was that of the eight patients, four had quite significant, some severe, deposition of amyloid protein, the alzheimer's protein, \" neurologist john collinge says, per time. Only one patient showed no sign of the protein. That doesn't mean alzheimer's can be passed through normal contact. Instead, it shows that alzheimer's may, like cjd, be caused by exposure to a protein — in this case, amyloid — that could potentially be passed via surgery. Some researchers argue the amyloid protein's precursor, a-beta amyloid, does \" stick avidly to metal surfaces. \" the human growth hormone given to patients, \" in addition to being contaminated with cjd, probably also was contaminated with a-beta seeds, \" collinge says; it had been donated by elderly patients after their deaths. Since 1985, human hormone injections have been replaced with synthetic ones due to the risk of contamination. Collinge says research will be needed to ensure other procedures, like blood transfusions, don't raise a person's chance of developing alzheimer's, but, as another researcher says, \" i don't think we need to worry excessively. \" ( could alzheimer's be linked to pollution? )",

            "The year is almost at an end, can you believe? while some may think 2018 was the end of the f***ing world, let's not forget our latest trek around the sun introduced us to the new fab five - yes, that was this year- ( queer eye ), the new - and wickedly dark - sabrina ( chilling adventures of sabrina ) and the noah centineo ( to all the boys i've loved before ). It reinvigorated our love for crying dogs ( dogs ), sexy robots ( lost in space ) and bubbble baths ( big mouth ) and most of all, our love for love ( the kissing booth, set it up ). Also noah centineo ( sh*t we said that already ). To be fair 2018 did have its moments, after all there were a few of us who craned our pants this year ( the haunting of hill house ) and someone actually made this ( nailed it! ).... Without further ado here are the series, shows and stars we binged, rewatched and fell in love with in 2018. The movies we fell in love with this year: nothing says true love quite like repetition, which is why we revisited these films again and again and again ….

        "summary": "With an arrest in the case of the dormant golden state killer, the new york times looks at what makes serial killers tick and, contrary to what you might think, it's not usually an insatiable thirst for blood. As forensic psychologist j. Reid meloy explains, \" these are not acts that a person is compelled to do. They are intentional and predatory. There is choice, capacity and opportunity that is exercised. \" that helps explain why the golden state killer appears to have gone quiet after 12 murders and more than 50 rapes in california between 1976 and 1986. Similarly, btk killer dennis rader ended his string of 10 murders in 1991, 14 years before he was arrested. He later admitted \" to engaging in autoerotic activities as a substitute for his killings, \" as noted in a 2008 fbi report. Though motives are hard to nail down, changes in stress level, location, work, and family have also had an impact on serial killers, per the times. Michael h. Stone, another forensic psychologist, notes green river killer gary ridgeway's murder spree spanned his first two marriages but quieted following a happier third one. There was a five-year break in crimes attributed to the golden state killer after a daughter was born to suspect joseph james deangelo in 1981, per the los angeles times. But stone speculates age is a factor, too. In 1986, deangelo would've been 40. At that age, \" testosterone levels are down \" and one's \" capacity to perform is weakened, \" stone says. Rape-murderers \" are really rare over age 50, \" adds a retired fbi criminal profiler. \" we just don't see them. \" ( here's how deangelo was identified. )",

        "summary": "After its recent major measles outbreak, california is pretty close to becoming only the third state to deny vaccine exemptions for religious reasons. The state assembly today approved legislation that would require all kids entering public or private daycare, elementary school, or secondary school for the first time in the state, or advancing to seventh grade, to be vaccinated against measles, whooping cough, and other diseases, with the only exemption being for children who have a doctor-confirmed medical issue that would make vaccines dangerous. Under the new law, religious exemptions and other \" personal or moral belief \" exemptions would no longer be allowed; 31 other states already deny exemptions based on personal or moral beliefs, but most allow religious exemptions, the los angeles times reports. The state senate passed the legislation earlier this month, and is expected to approve the minor amendments the assembly made and then send the bill to gov. Jerry brown, who has not said publicly whether he ' ll sign but has said he considers vaccines \" profoundly important. \" if he signs, it will take effect january 1 and will apply to kids entering the aforementioned institutions or grade levels as of next july, npr reports. The times refers to the law as \" one of the toughest mandatory vaccination laws in the nation \" and to the bill as \" the most controversial taken up by the legislature this year, \" but notes that the 46-31 approval vote was bipartisan. Hundreds of parents protested the bill at recent legislative hearings. Sample feelings: \" we are pulling out all the stops, \" says an opponent, noting that court challenges and even a possible referendum are on the table. An assemblyman called it unconstitutional, saying it infringes \" on the rights of certain students to attend school. \" ( non-vaccinated children would have to be home-schooled or utilize a public school's independent study program at home. ) \" while i respect the fundamental right to make that decision as a family, we must balance that with the fact that none of us has the right to endanger others, \" says an assemblywoman who supported the bill.",

It's the oldest metal object ever found in the middle east, and was probably owned by the apparently important 40-year-old woman buried with it in an extravagant tel tsaf grave, livescience reports. The awl's date has pushed back metal use in the region centuries earlier than thought, to about 5100 bc. The copper it's made of was likely brought in from 620 miles away, adds sci-news, suggesting locals imported metal objects first before starting to create them. Archaeologists had previously estimated the region's metal use started around 4500 bc thanks to some copper artifacts and gold rings found in the southern levant. The awl also says quite a lot about tel tsaf, an important archaeological site in the middle east since it was discovered in 1950. Located near the jordan river, tel tsaf was a wealthy center of international commerce in the ancient world. It had huge silos that could store up to 30 tons of grain each, roasting ovens in communal courtyards that suggest large gatherings took place there, and many artifacts originating from elsewhere around the mediterranean, as per the jerusalem post. The awl suggests people in the region also had fairly advanced technology.

Sebastian deleon is only the fourth person in the us to survive an infection by the naegleria fowleri parasite, which he contracted while swimming, florida today reports. On aug. 5, the teen was at an orlando theme park with his family when he was overcome with headache so excruciating that he \" couldn't tolerate people touching him, \" said dr. Humberto lirian, a critical care pediatrician. Sebastian's parents took him to florida hospital for children, where dr. Dennis hernandez decided not to stop at a migraine diagnosis and took a sample of his spinal fluid — a move that saved the boy's life. Call it \" divine intervention and a gut instinct, \" hernandez said, the orlando sentinel reports. Other symptoms can include fever, nausea, and seizures. A lab test revealed the deadly amoeba, which can be tough to spot, and doctors immediately reached out to the maker of a drug recently approved to treat the parasite — the company, profounda, happens to be based in orlando. After profounda got the call, notes the sentinel, \" the drug to treat sebastian was delivered in 12 minutes. \" miltefosine isn't commonly stocked by hospitals, which cost the life of an 11-year-old florida boy in 2014, but that may change after sebastian's close call. Quick treatment was credited with saving a 12-year-old in arkansas in 2014. Only three people out of 138 have survived infection, according to the cdc. For the deleon family at least, there is a happy ending. \"we are so thankful that god has given us the miracle, \" said the teen's mother, brunilda gonzalez. ( in june, an 18-year-old in ohio died after becoming infected on a white-water rafting trip. )",

Prince william is carefully following developments in the probe of the troubled tabloid that was shut down over the summer as editors ' phone-hacking operations came to light. \" given that the news of the world bugged the phones of members of the royal household, nothing about what they were up to surprises us any more, \" said a royal insider.",

He says the medical staff isn't even recording details of prisoners ' conditions. \" they intend to leave us until we lose a kidney or another organ. They will wait until we are damaged. Maybe until we are too damaged to live. \" a navy spokesperson for the prison tells the times the military policy permitting involuntary feeding of hunger strikers is still in effect, and that medical officials would tube-feed a detainee if necessary to prevent death, but a pentagon spokesperson explains that prison officials decided to enforce the policy more rigorously, meaning they will be more strict about what health conditions make force-feeding medically necessary.",

        "summary": "The senate last night overwhelmingly passed a massive $ 662 billion defense bill that calls for crippling sanctions against iran, requires the military to hold suspected terrorists — even those busted on us soil — and would allow detention of american citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely without trial. The white house has threatened to veto the bill because of the ramp-up in the military role in handling terrorists. \" applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the us would raise serious legal questions, and would be inconsistent with the fundamental american principle that our military does not patrol our streets, \" the white house said in a statement. The bill would require military custody of suspects linked to al-qaeda or its affiliates and involved in an attack or a plot against the us. American citizens would be exempt. But the legislation also would allow authorities to deny suspected terrorists, even citizens seized in the us, the right to trial and subject them to indefinite detention, reports ap. The provision infuriates civil rights groups. \" since the bill puts military detention authority on steroids and makes it permanent, american citizens are at greater risk of being locked away by the military without charge or trial if this bill becomes law, \" said the senior legislative counsel for the aclu. The 93-7 vote backed military expenditures $ 27 billion less than what president obama requested and $ 43 billion less than last year. The senate's version must still be reconciled with the house-passed measure. In other action yesterday, senate republicans rejected renewing a temporary cut in payroll taxes, even though both parties have promised to reach a compromise on a tax break before they recess for the holidays.",

Opposition officials claim he scored kickbacks from private energy initiatives, and he was questioned by investigators in april. Ashraf isn't likely to win reelection, experts say — and that may be precisely why the pakistan people's party chose him. If he becomes pm, the high court will likely demand he open a corruption investigation into president asif ali zardari.

A new study reveals that even though a larger percentage of high school seniors than their 1998 counterparts are heading off to college with an ' a ' average, sat scores have fallen — meaning, as usa today notes, that those chart-busting grades might actually be \" fool's gold. \" per inside higher ed, the study released monday — which will be included in a book on testing, grades, and college admissions coming out next year by johns hopkins university press — shows that 38.9 % of high school seniors graduated with an a average ( which includes a- and a+ ) in 1998. In 2016, the figure was 47 %. The average gpa score also rose during that period, from 3.27 to 3.38. But sat scores were another story, dropping from 1,026 points to 1,002 out of a possible 1,600. Inside higher ed notes that if gpa were indicative of learning, sat scores \" should be going up, or at the very least remaining stable. \" where grade inflation seems to be most prominent: in schools with more white, affluent students, as well as in private schools, where the inflation rate is three times that found in public schools. The study authors warn that leniency in handing out top marks could \" paradoxically disadvantage \" certain students, as ok students may get mixed up with real top performers when college admissions officers review transcripts. The authors say class rank could be a better indicator than gpa of how a student measures against his or her peers but say more schools are giving it up. ( some colleges are dumping sat scores. )",

When water washes out an ants ' nest, the vulnerable larvae and pupae become life rafts, and queens are allowed to ride in the center. That puts the babies at risk of drowning, cold, and predators lurking underwater. But ants have a reason for such callous escape methods: their little ones float better, the international science times reports. Ants aren't alone in putting their children at risk: bees are known to toss out larvae infected with infectious bacterial disease, and time reports that mustached tamarin mothers, when overwhelmed, will kill their own kids or let them die off. The scientists who studied ants in controlled floods found that the babies were usually just dazed after being life rafts, and walked off no worse for wear.

It's that last one that seems the most primally encoded, and for good reason: it's hardly possible to pass on your genes if your babies die before they're old enough to have offspring of their own. And yet not only do animals sometimes fail to protect the young of their species  they often kill them themselves. Infanticide is disturbingly common in nature.

        "summary": "An amateur historian says a secret detail about vincent van gogh has for decades sat in the archives of the writer who tackled the artist's life in the acclaimed 1934 fictionalized biography lust for life. In what a press release describes as \" seven years of meticulous research, \" bernadette murphy uncovered a 1930 meeting between author irving stone and van gogh's physician, felix rey. During their visit, rey sketched an illustration of the injury van gogh inflicted on his left ear on dec. 23, 1888, a wound that rey treated a day later after police found van gogh and brought him to the hospital, reports the bbc. The globe and mail reports \" scholarly consensus \" has long held that van gogh sliced off his earlobe and later gifted it to a prostitute named rachel. Quite the opposite, holds murphy. Murphy's suspicion that the sketch remained in stone's archive proved correct, and it shows the ear was nearly entirely severed, with only a bit of lobe remaining. In comments to the new york times, van gogh biographer steven naifeh describes the sketch as \" not credible, \" saying his own research surfaced a \" very detailed etching \" of van gogh's ear made in 1890 by another doctor; though more than the lobe was missing, the entire ear was not gone. A reproduction of the rey sketch, done on a prescription pad, is featured in murphy's book, van gogh's ear, which was published tuesday. Her book upends the long-held rachel story as well, with murphy saying her research led her to a 19-year-old brothel maid named gabrielle who had suffered a serious dog bite as a child and who was given the ear to \" alleviate what [ van gogh ] perceived as her suffering. \" ( another van gogh surprise: a newly found sketchbook. )",

Scientists confirmed that chimps prefer cooked food to raw food and discovered that when they had access to a \" cooking device \" — really a container in which researchers would replace raw sweet-potato slices with cooked ones — they were patient enough to bring the food to the device and wait for it to \" cook \" instead of just gobbling the raw food, scientific american reports. The study was inspired by the theory that cooking played an important role in human evolution, the new york times notes. The finding suggests that humans aren't alone in possessing the \" causal reasoning, self-control, and anticipatory planning \" required to cook, the researchers write in the proceedings of the royal society b. But chimps don't cook in the wild — why not? their failure to master fire is an obvious reason, but the lead researcher tells the bbc that another reason is that they lack the \" social skills \" for cooking, which include trusting others not to steal your food if you hang onto it for a second longer than absolutely necessary. \" trust is another component for cooking to become a practice in a social group, \" he says.

That was up from a 0.3 percent increase in september. People showed a slightly bigger appetite to spend because their incomes rose 0.5 percent, reflecting a slowly healing jobs market.

        "summary": "Have a mouth full of cavities? you can maybe blame those teachers who wouldn't let you chew gum in class. Gum gets some scientific analysis in a study titled \" quantification and qualification of bacteria trapped in chewed gum \" published in plos one yesterday ( and, it should be noted, funded in part by the wm. Wrigley jr. Co. ). Researchers confirmed that the \" chewing of gum can trap bacteria, \" which can cause cavities, and then remove that bacteria when you spit it out. And as their study's title suggests, the researchers quantified gum's effectiveness. Five volunteers chewed one of two commercially available pieces of spearmint gum for a span of time ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes \" according to their own personal routine without specific instructions for chewing. \" chewers then spit the gum into a cup containing sterile water. \" around 108 \" — that's 100,000,000 — \" bacteria were detected per gum piece depending on the method and gum considered, \" they write. Brushing with a new toothbrush without toothpaste on it ( which is somewhat inexplicable ) reportedly removes the same amount, \" which would put chewing of gum on par with the mechanical action \" of said brush. Real clear science points out that the researchers noted more species of bacteria were reeled in by longer chewing times, but that adhesiveness begins to diminish after 30 seconds. Write the researchers, this causes \" a release of initially trapped, more weakly adhering bacteria from the gum. \" what the research could lead to: \" the development of gum that selectively removes specific disease-related bacteria from the human oral cavity. \" ( a tragic flipside: chewing gum likely killed a college student over the weekend. )",

            "Abstract chewing of gum contributes to the maintenance of oral health. Many oral diseases, including caries and periodontal disease, are caused by bacteria. However, it is unknown whether chewing of gum can remove bacteria from the oral cavity. Here, we hypothesize that chewing of gum can trap bacteria and remove them from the oral cavity. To test this hypothesis, we developed two methods to quantify numbers of bacteria trapped in chewed gum. In the first method, known numbers of bacteria were finger-chewed into gum and chewed gums were molded to standard dimensions, sonicated and plated to determine numbers of colony-forming-units incorporated, yielding calibration curves of colony-forming-units retrieved versus finger-chewed in. In a second method, calibration curves were created by finger-chewing known numbers of bacteria into gum and subsequently dissolving the gum in a mixture of chloroform and tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic-acid ( te ) -buffer. The te-buffer was analyzed using quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction ( qpcr ), yielding calibration curves of total numbers of bacteria versus finger-chewed in. Next, five volunteers were requested to chew gum up to 10 min after which numbers of colony-forming-units and total numbers of bacteria trapped in chewed gum were determined using the above methods. The qpcr method, involving both dead and live bacteria yielded higher numbers of retrieved bacteria than plating, involving only viable bacteria.

The researchers calculated that a single piece of typical \" tab \" gum can trap up to 100,000,000 bacteria, or roughly ten percent of the microbial load in saliva. They further estimated that gum removes a similar amount of bacteria as flossing, but noted that flossing targets different areas of the mouth. For the study, five biomedical engineering students generously donated their time to chewing two different standard pieces of gum for various lengths of time ranging from 30 seconds to ten minutes. Afterwards, the gum was spit into a cup filled with sterile water and analyzed. The researchers found that the longer a piece of gum is chewed, the more microbial species from the mouth it captures. However, after thirty seconds of chewing, the gum starts to lose its adhesiveness, which means that it traps fewer bacteria overall. Not all gum may benefit your dental health. Sugar-sweetened gum effectively feeds oral bacteria. When these microbes ferment sugars, the biofilm on your teeth grows more acidic, which, in turn, leads to cavities.

But tanriover and his companions had no clue what the mass was, so they recorded it and uploaded it to youtube — and a marine expert who saw the video thinks he has the answer, livescience notes. Dr. Michael vecchione of the smithsonian's national museum of natural history says the blob looks to him to be a giant mass of squid eggs and that it's the largest he's ever seen, per deep sea news. \" we don't know exactly how many eggs are in there, \" he tells livescience, but he adds they may number in the tens of thousands. Vecchione says such egg masses are typically found further offshore and that the eggs usually hatch within three days, making this discovery a rare sighting, deep sea news notes. He thinks a red flying squid, described by livescience as a \" voracious predator \" that can reach almost 5 feet in length, is responsible for the 13-foot egg mass. A comparably sized squid-egg mass from a humboldt squid was discovered off the coast of california in 2006 and held between 600,000 and 2 million eggs. One of the lead authors of that study explains that the mother squid lays a smaller jelly-like mound filled with eggs and that it grows in size as it takes on seawater, per national geographic; she adds that this protective coating keeps predators and parasites away from the embryos, while the gradual expansion of the blob likely gives the babies room to grow.

It is \" deeper and more realistic than any other sim game i've played. \" what happened in previous versions was largely determined by luck; now you get a trove of \" real-time data \" on all aspects of city life. Chelsea stark, mashable: be warned that the first thing you build in the new game is probably going to fail miserably — but you ' ll still love playing, writes stark. \" the city feels responsive and alive, and is good at telling you what it needs. Once you learn about the detailed metrics available to you in for each city, it's like a whole different game has opened up. \" dean takahasi, venture beat: \" it is wonderfully complex, but very easy to play, \" he writes. \" the title is a massive undertaking and it has come together beautifully overall. Hopefully, ea will be able to improve the connected parts of the game, and the experience will become more fun with more players. \" kyle orland and peter bright, ars technica: the two editors each played over the weekend for about 12 hours, and \" were pretty disappointed with what we found. \" both found the new game's space limits way too restricting, for one thing. \" maybe ea shouldn't have messed with its successful city building formula quite so much. \" server trouble? adam barnes at nowgamer says lots of players are having trouble connecting to the game's servers, which could bode poorly for an \" always-on \" internet game.",

So easy that gay couples were lined up for licenses beforehand, refreshing their smartphones as they awaited the news, the oregonian reports. Oregon's attorney general had refused to defend the law, leaving mcshane — who is openly gay — to defend it himself. He didn't convince himself. Instead, he issued what the washington post calls an \" unusually personal \" ruling. \" if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality, we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families, \" he wrote. \" let us look less to the sky to see what might fall; rather, let us look to each other … and rise. \" in portland, more than 70 marriage licenses were issued following the ruling, the ap reports, with the first marriages taking place within the hour. It's the 17th straight victory for same-sex marriage since the supreme court's doma decision. And while many of those rulings are stayed awaiting appeal, this one isn't — and, indeed, an appeal might not be possible, slate observes, because the state's liberal governor is unlikely to defend the ban, and the supreme court has ruled that outside groups can't intervene. Even if an appeal were somehow lodged, oregon voters are almost sure to vote in gay marriage in november anyway. The decision makes oregon the 18th state to recognize gay marriage.",

        "summary": "An amazing find by harvard researchers has brought the number of known parchment copies of the declaration of independence to two: one in dc's national archives, and one in a tiny records office in the place the us declared independence from. Researchers emily sneff and danielle allen believe the copy they uncovered in the archives of the town of chichester, england, once belonged to charles lennox, 3rd duke of richmond, known as the \" radical duke \" for his support of the american colonists, the boston globe reports. They made the find after spotting a catalog entry online while doing research for the declaration resources project, which is collecting data on different versions, the new york times reports. Allen and sneff believe the parchment was commissioned in the 1780s by james wilson, a pennsylvania lawyer known as a strong nationalist. Allen tells the harvard gazette that the copy is unlike any others they have found — and most other documents of the era — because it scrambles the order of the signatories instead of grouping them by state. \" this is really a symbolic way of saying we are all one people, or ' one community,'to quote james wilson, \" she says. Allen, a professor of government, says the document addresses a \" key riddle \" of the american system: whether the country was founded by its people, or by a collection of states. The researchers are now looking into how the copy ended up in england.",

        "summary": "A magnitude 7.9 earthquake off alaska's kodiak island early tuesday prompted a tsunami warning for a large swath of coastal alaska and british columbia. That warning was later canceled by the national tsunami center, but a watch remained in place for parts of the state, the ap reports. The strong earthquake, first reported as a magnitude 8.2, was recorded about 175 miles southeast of kodiak island. Warnings from the national weather service sent to cellphones in alaska warned: \" emergency alert. Tsunami danger on the coast. Go to high ground or move inland. \" kodiak officials warned residents to evacuate if they lived in low-lying areas. People reported on social media that the quake was felt hundreds of miles away, in anchorage. Lt. Tim putney of the kodiak police department says: \" we haven't seen anything yet or had any reports of a wave. \" however, he says, they are still encouraging people below the 100-foot mark to head for shelters. The earthquake woke putney up out of a dead sleep, and he estimates it shook for at least 30 seconds. \" i've been in kodiak for 19 years and that was the strongest, longest lasting one i've ever felt, \" he says. Kerry seifert, an emergency management specialist in the state emergency operations center, says the center had not received any reports of damage as the timeline for initial waves reaching some communities had passed. \" this is almost too soon to be into it to get that kind of information, \" he says. \" and certainly, communities are climbing hills, some of them. \"",

According to nbc dfw, carmen ponder says she was driving to walmart on saturday when a truck cut her off while driving erratically. She passed the truck and pulled into the walmart parking lot. Ponder says the truck followed her and she was accosted by commerce police chief kerry crews, who was in the passenger seat. Ponder says crews was \" yelling and cussing \" at her that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter to drive and that ponder shouldn't have passed them. She says crews called her a \" black bitch \" when she informed him that letting his 14-year-old daughter drive was illegal. Ponder says when she left the store, she was confronted by plain clothes officers who demanded she apologize to crews. She refused and was arrested. Ponder was later charged with evading arrest. In a facebook post, ponder's attorney says his client's only crime was \" the color of her skin. \" the city has placed crews on leave during an investigation into the incident, but it states ponder's account conflicts with that of crews and another officer. Crews says he wasn't involved in the initial argument between two motorists and only got involved when one of them approached him. The city doesn't say who the other motorist was.

        "summary": "President trump addressed the 19th national boy scout jamboree in west virginia on monday and extolled the values of working hard and never giving up. But he also strayed from those scout-like subjects into the realm of politics, hitting on familiar topics such as \" horrible obamacare, \" the \" fake media, \" the dc \" cesspool, \" and his victory over hillary clinton. Here's the full transcript. Some highlights: big moments: the toronto star rounds up 17 \" jaw-dropping \" moments in the speech to kids, including when he joked about firing his health secretary if obamacare repeal failed. ( he also singled out west virginia's sen. Shelley moore capito. ) more standard advice: \" so as much as you can, do something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you're going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. \" clinton: he spoke of working hard in the campaign, particularly in michigan. \" you know, my opponent didn't work hard there because she was told she was going to win. \" ( the crowd booed her. ) obama: \"by the way, just a question. Did president obama ever come to a jamboree? \" trump asked, triggering boos. Obama had never attended because of policies against gay scout masters, notes the new york times. A question from trump: \" who the hell wants to speak about politics when i ' m in front of the boy scouts? right? \" cocktail party: trump regaled the scouts with a story about attending a cocktail party in the 1980s and meeting famed housing developer william levitt, whose career was on the wane at the time. Why? because, and this was the lesson, he'd taken time off and \" lost his momentum. \" the week has a video clip. Election night: \" but you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the republicans are red and the democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And they didn't know what to say. \" too political? some current and former scouts thought so, with reactions rounded up at time. Trolled: pete souza, obama's white house photographer, continued his not-so-subtle trump trolling by posting this image of obama with a boy scout. Obama, he writes, wasn't telling the boy \" about his electoral college victory. \"",

        "summary": "\" if you go in swimming at 10 o ' clock at night, you're going to get consumed. \" such was the assessment of an australian lawmaker when commenting on a woman who is believed to have been consumed by a crocodile sunday night in far north queensland. Warren entsch, who serves in parliament, placed the blame squarely on cindy waldron, 46, who went swimming at 10: 30pm sunday in the daintree national park. The attack occurred at thornton beach, which is only accessible via ferry and has signs \" saying watch out for the bloody crocodiles, \" entsch said. \" you can't legislate against human stupidity. \" senior constable russell parker tells australia's abc news that waldron, who lived in new south wales, was swimming with a friend in waist-deep water when the attack happened. The friend tried to pull her to safety but failed, and then ran to a local business to get help; she was unharmed save for some grazes, but is in an extreme state of shock, per an emergency responder. Parker says they have thus far been unable to find waldron, though a helicopter equipped with thermal imaging equipment was used last night. The search will continue monday. Cnn notes that crocodile attacks in the region occur infrequently, with the last one in the park having taken place in 2009, when a 5-year-old was killed. In comments to stuff.co.nz, a local official suggests this attack could be especially rare: \" i don't know exactly where it happened, but if it was on the beach, that is very unusual for a croc to attack on a beach. They live in estuaries and are usually in transit when on a beach, going from one estuary to another. \"",

        "summary": "Water isn't just running low in california, a top nasa scientist warns — it's going to plum run out in about a year. \" as difficult as it may be to face, the simple fact is that california is running out of water — and the problem started before our current drought, \" writes jay famiglietti in the la times. He notes ominously that since 2011, california has lost roughly 12 million acre-feet of stored water per year, and water sources in the sacramento and san joaquin river basins are way below normal levels. He says the state needs to ration water, manage groundwater better, and form a task force to create better water strategies. \" we're not just up a creek without a paddle in california, we're losing the creek too, \" he writes. In other bleak water news: desperate for groundwater, california is drilling deep enough to extract ancient water that dates back 15,000 to 20,000 years, mother jones reports. That groundwater may never be replenished, water quality will suffer, and pumping will grow ever pricier, experts say. An article in the journal groundwater warns that a water supply amounting to two lake eries was depleted across the us in recent years. \" that's enough to contribute to rising sea levels, along with melting glaciers and polar ice, \" says mother jones. Meanwhile, a blistering heatwave has struck california with record-high temperatures yesterday in several locations, including los angeles ( 90 ) and san diego ( 89 ), the la times reports. And cali isn't alone: officials in brazil predict that sao paolo — the biggest and most economically vital city in south america — will run out of water by june, pri reports. Some 20 million residents are taking precautions amid the region's worst drought in decades.",

In other words, the memories might remain — however deeply hidden — in the brain, and thus accessing them is just a matter of stimulating the right neurons. \" it has the potential to lead to novel drug development to help with regaining memories, \" a researcher tells the washington post. To study this, researchers used a laser technology called optogenetics to watch neuron activity in the brains of mice. All mice in this study were given an electric shock after sniffing a lemon scent, but a week later, only half those with dementia froze when they smelled lemon in anticipation of being shocked, compared to all the healthy mice freezing. The researchers were able to watch the healthy mice retrieve memories from the same place where they'd been stored, while mice with dementia called up other memories stored elsewhere. But by stimulating the neurons with a blue laser, scientists were able to reactivate memories in the mice with dementia. The downside? optogenetics isn't ready for humans, notes the post, \" because it isn't yet safe or practical to tinker with our neurons or stick lasers into our brains. \" next up, scientists hope to see whether memories are stored and retrieved similarly in humans. The independent points out that in some alzheimer's cases, music has been known to rouse old memories, \" suggesting they may not disappear completely. \" ( diagnosis of dementia is improving, but treatment remains elusive. )",

According to conrad lee and pádraig cunningham of the ireland-based clique research cluster, if you want to know what ' ll be on playlists around the country in a few weeks, you might tune in to what they're listening to now in atlanta. In \"the geographic flow of music, \" a paper submitted to the online scientific forum physics arxiv, lee and cunningham analyzed about 60 billion pieces of data from last.fm, a music streaming website. Last.fm publishes lists of the most listened-to artists by geographical location, which allowed lee and cunningham to chart how those lists changed across 200 cities since 2003. The researchers used statistical techniques to track which cities served as the trend leaders for listening habits. ( more: next step for tupac's hologram: national tour? ) the results? in north america, atlanta was the leader in predicting overall music trends as well as hip-hop trends, while montreal was the clear indie music frontrunner. ( sorry, brooklyn. ) in europe, oslo beat out london as overall music leader, while paris led the indie scene. The study is the latest in the growing field of network science, which mines the ever-increasing volumes of data on human behavior supplied by online social networks like last.fm or twitter. However, the results seem to contradict the assumed notions of musical centers. As the physics arxiv blog on the technology review points out: it's easy to imagine that the biggest cities ought to be those furthest ahead of the curve because they have biggest populations from which new and interesting bands can emerge. That doesn't seem to be the case in this data – big cities such as new york, la and london do not lead. \"we find only weak support for this hypothesis, \" say lee and cunningham",

For the record, the washington post isn't sure he meant that all his family's gifts would go back as well. It also points out that mcdonnell, for the first time, said he wasn't aware of the extent of williams ' largesse to his family: \"some of them [ the gifts ] i did not know about at the time. \" and the ap highlights this quote from mcdonnell in his own defense: \" many questions have been asked about why i didn't do x, y, and z.

And that means that although johnson could still raise some dust and complicate matters for the two major-party candidates in states where third parties have historically done well, it doesn't look definite he's going to have a significant impact on the race, as ralph nader did in two states in 2000 ( and nader's poll numbers were less than half that of johnson's in late august of their respective election years, per fivethirtyeight ). Johnson's numbers began to drop after he didn't qualify for the first presidential debate in september. His standing has also been affected by the fact that polls are now looking more closely at likely voters, not just registered ones: a cnn/orc poll from this weekend, for example, gave johnson a 5 % among registered voters, but only 3 % for those likely to show on election day ( down from 7 % three weeks earlier ). And the globe notes johnson's flubbed foreign policy remarks likely haven't helped, either. But intelligencer says this \" crash \" is \" right on schedule, \" as third-party candidates in years with close races tend to start seeing declining numbers as the election nears.

        "summary": "Pizza is the most problematic food out there, as far as addictive-like qualities go. So report students who completed the yale food addiction scale as part of a study by researchers at the university of michigan. Those researchers published their findings in plos one earlier this year, and wrote that \" though evidence of ' food addiction ' continues to grow, no previous studies have yet examined which foods or food attributes are likely implicated in addictive-like eating. \" so they sought to create a sort of \" addictive profile, \" and ultimately determined that processed foods that are higher in fat and refined carbohydrates, which have a rapid rate of absorption as indicated by glycemic load, tend to be hardest for we mere mortals to resist. \" processing was a large, positive predictor for whether a food was associated with problematic, addictive-like eating behaviors. \" the common-sense upshot: salmon and cucumbers aren't problematic; ice cream and chips are. And with pizza atop our gotta-have-it list, mic this week looks at what may set cheese apart. Cheese contains the protein casein, which releases opiates called casomorphins as the cheese is digested. \" [ casomorphins ] really play with the dopamine receptors and trigger that addictive element, \" registered dietitian cameron wells, who was not part of the study, tells mic. And while it's present in all dairy products, it's far more condensed in cheese because it takes 10 pounds of milk to make about a pound of cheese. When it comes to cheese, we're certainly eating more of it: americans tripled their cheese consumption between 1970 and 2010, from about 8 pounds per year to 23 pounds, reports the center for science in the public interest.

Well, we don't need to tell you. While cheese is delicious, taste may not be the only reason we're eating so much of the melty, fatty stuff. Cheese, as it turns out, may also be addictive. The science: a recent university of michigan study investigated which items serve as the drugs of the food world. Lo and behold, pizza topped the \" addictive \" list. So what makes it so hard to just have one slice? the key quality of addictive foods, the study found, was processing: unprocessed foods like salmon or brown rice were not associated with addictive eating behaviors, while highly processed foods like french fries and potato chips were. And many processed foods have one thing in common: fat. \" fat seemed to be equally predictive of problematic eating for everyone, regardless of whether they experience symptoms of ' food addiction, ' \" erica schulte, one of the study's authors, told mic.
