        "summary": "Usually on the side that's doing the accusing, gloria allred has just been slammed with a lawsuit from an ex-client alleging she's the guilty party. Per lawnewz, tv weatherman kyle hunter, who hired the celebrity lawyer to represent him in his claim that cbs discriminated against him in favor of pretty young meteorologists, filed a legal malpractice and fraud suit against allred on tuesday in los angeles county superior court. Hunter's specific beef: that allred messed up key parts of his defense, and that she didn't clue him in that she and cbs were developing a legal drama based on her life, which he says is a conflict of interest. All of this led to \" a near-seven-figure legal bill for hunter, a sunk suit against cbs, and [ his ] impaired reputation, \" per his complaint. ( the suit, which is asking for $ 1 million in damages, was filed by a lawyer who contributes op-eds to lawnewz ). In the suit, hunter blasts allred and other lawyers at her firm for not interviewing witnesses who may have helped his case, among other grievances. Per variety, hunter's suit says the $ 800,000 legal bill he had to pay when he lost to cbs left him near bankruptcy. Lawnewz also uncovered in march that the state bar of california is looking into allred's actions for misconduct, for undisclosed reasons. \" allred sandbagged her client to serve her personal pecuniary interests, her penchant for public fame, and to protect the malfeasance of her media allies, \" the suit notes, adding she \" needs to spend less time in front of a tv camera, and more time in an ethics library. \" a statement from allred's law firm calls hunter's claims \" worthless \" and notes he \" has been threatening to sue our law firm for approximately one year in an attempt to get our law firm to pay him money which he is not entitled to. \"",

        "summary": "A $ 35 million restoration of monticello is underway, but it's what's been buried under a restroom there for nearly 80 years that's been attracting the most attention of late: the bedroom of sally hemings, one of president thomas jefferson's slaves and the mother of six children who historians suspect were his, the washington post reports. The wwii-era bathroom that was apparently built over where hemings slept, close to jefferson's own bedroom, has been slowly pulled apart by archaeologists based on coordinates provided by the third president's own grandson. The work is revealing the 18th-century plaster walls and brick floor, and peeling back the cover-up of a long-hidden ( but well-known ) secret of jefferson's longtime relationship with hemings. Usa today explains it's all part of the mountaintop project, an ambitious initiative to bring the former virginia plantation back to how \" jefferson knew it, \" and to showcase more stories of those who lived on the estate — both free residents and slaves, of which the author of the declaration of independence owned hundreds. Hemings, believed to have been a nursemaid for the president's daughter, then a regular monticello maid, is rumored to be the daughter of jefferson's father-in-law. Once the room ( set to be open to the public next year ) is fully restored, it will be furnished with artifacts from the jefferson-hemings period. A philanthropist who's donated money to various monticello projects says bringing people to such historic landmarks means you have to \" show them what it was really like. … the good and bad of history. \" ( the uva community pleaded with its president to not quote jefferson. )",

A study published in the bmj looks at the case of a 34-year-old man who developed \" thunderclap headaches \" after consuming just one of the incredibly hot peppers at a chili-eating contest, reports the guardian. Researchers say the man suffered dry heaves immediately after consuming the reaper — which scores an intimidating 1.6 million on the scoville scale versus 5,000 for a jalapeno — and went to the emergency room a few days later because he was having very short but incredibly painful headaches. \" it started all of a sudden as severe pain in the back of the neck and then spread to all over the head, \" study author dr. Kulothungan gunasekaran tells cbs. \" that's typical of a thunderclap headache. \" after several brain scans, the doctors determined that the man's headaches were being caused by a condition called reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, or rcvs, which involves the narrowing of the arteries. It can occur without any apparent cause or be triggered by medication or illegal drug use, but in this case, the researchers determined that it was the first known case to be caused by chili peppers. The man's arteries returned to normal within five weeks and there were no lasting effects, but since rcvs can lead to strokes in rare cases, researchers say anybody experiencing similar symptoms after eating hot chilis should seek medical attention.

Beyond that, however, things get more difficult. Republicans \" have plenty of options but their victories must come either by defeating democratic incumbents in red states or picking off seats in blue or purple states that obama and the democrats have been winning in presidential elections, \" writes balz. Republicans boast that they can take the senate without winning in any state that mitt romney lost, but to do so, they'd have to knock off incumbents in arkansas, louisiana, alaska, and north carolina. None are gimmes, especially the latter two. Democrats, meanwhile, say they've got better candidates overall and a stronger \" ground game \" to turn out voters. Balz sums up by saying republicans are \" in an enviable but not yet commanding position. \" they may yet take the senate, but they ' ll have to \" earn it state by state by state. \" at the hill, james carville adds that democrats can take heart from one stat: the gop's favorability rating is hovering around 35 %, with democrats at 49 %. \" in what other endeavor would you be selling something attached to a brand so unpopular and expect success? \" he asks.

Two sources familiar with the situation say the dnc plans to offer sanders a \" concession \" in the form of seats on a critical convention committee tasked with crafting the party's platform, per the washington post. The goal: to bridge the growing gap between the two camps. It's become what us news frames as a \" family feud, \" most recently fueled by chaos at last weekend's nevada democratic convention, when sanders supporters were said to have thrown chairs and become hostile toward organizers. Some sanders devotees have also accused the party of rigging the nomination process to ensure hillary wins. Sanders has called for the party to \" do the right thing \" and embrace his supporters, some of whom have warned there may be protests at the convention if their concerns aren't heard. He also penned a letter to dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz earlier in may asking for seats for his own people on three important convention committees — the platform group, as well as one for rules and one for credentials. For the 15-person platform committee, sanders wanted it split right down the middle between his people and hillary's, with one \" neutral \" rep of wasserman schultz's choosing. The unnamed post sources say a final decision should come shortly and expect that while sanders likely won't get the seven seats he's seeking, he ' ll end up with more than what the dnc originally allotted him.",

Party leaders, meanwhile, have grown more frustrated with sanders, who they say has unfairly fueled that perception. \"i don't think they've handled it very well and i think they've lost the moral high ground on",
            "Democrats are always divided, they themselves say. As a party which prides itself on inclusiveness – and surely, those who turn out in democratic primaries are far more diverse, in terms of race and ethnicity, than those in gop nominating contests – the institution will naturally have its disagreements. But given the unexpected success of trump, who both repels and fascinates his democratic critics, democrats also know they can't go into the fall without a united message and united front. Democrats believe latinos, women, african-americans and other democratic-leaning groups will be especially motivated to show up at the polls to vote against trump, even if they aren't particularly inspired by clinton. But some democratic lawmakers say privately they are spooked by some early polling showing trump very competitive in states like pennsylvania, ohio and florida."

Ripa, who appears to be on a strahan-related strike, won't be back on live! until at least tuesday, and people notes that producers aren't sure how to resume things once she returns, since she's \" gone radio silent, \" sources say.

            "There are many things to admire about david lee roth's home. There's the lushly landscaped property, three football fields ' worth by his estimation, hidden behind a 9-foot ivy-covered wall on an otherwise undistinguished suburban pasadena block. There's the house itself, which he's had for 25 years, a sprawling 1920s spanish-style mansion with 13 rooms in the basement alone. There's the tennis court in back, filled with a foot and a half of sand to accommodate beach barbecues — he doesn't play tennis. But roth's favorite thing about his home might be the floors. They are important. \" feel this? \" he stamps his foot a few times. \" that transfer of shock? the floor has to have some give to it. It's why you don't do ballet on concrete. \" the effect is much like the inch-thick wooden plank, maybe 15 feet by 15 feet, that comprises the center of van halen's stage, where he plies a very specific trade. Acrobatic high-kicks and shimmies. Martial-arts maneuvers and sashays. \" i have moves onstage it took me two years to learn. \" there is nothing actually on most of the floors in the house. The living room is bare, save for a few framed photos from the cover shoot of the first van halen album hanging crooked in one corner. ( \" i ' m not much of a furniture collector, and i ' m not much of an interior decorator. \" ) a ceiling-high built-in china cabinet is empty. Half a bottle of jamaican rum rests on the mantle, and on the far wall is a rack of japanese katana swords. \" the real deal, \" he says, unsheathing one. \" razor sharp. The first time i held one of these swords, i was maybe 9 years old. \" he demonstrates a few moves, alternately fluid and severe. \" everything has to be internalized or you ' ll look stiff. Once you can do it physically, it becomes your personality. \" he's decked out in the now standard offstage getup of mustard-colored overalls he started wearing three years ago while building stage props around the house — a samurai mario brother. \" i just had my sword teacher here from tokyo,"

Mubarak is consuming only liquids and juices, is weak and has lost a lot of weight, mohammed fathallah, the head of the hospital where the ex-president is being held, told the state-run egyptnews. Fathallah's deputy, dr. Asim azzam, told the agency that the former leader's vital signs were semi-stable. The 83-year-old mubarak ruled egypt for more than 29 years before a popular uprising drove him from office in february. He has been hospitalized since april, after suffering heart palpitations. Prosecutors have said mubarak suffers from depression, fatigue, repeated irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure that could lead to fainting and an increased risk of heart attack. His lawyer disclosed in june that the ex-president been struggling with complications from 2010 surgery for stomach cancer.

The second bomb was also hidden in a backpack, but it's not clear whether it was also made from a pressure cooker, the fbi says. Investigators say the bombs — packed with bbs, nails and pellets to maximize shrapnel injuries — may have cost less than $ 100 to build and were made from ingredients so ordinary that tracing them may be impossible, reports the washington post. Investigators believe the bombs were triggered with \" kitchen-type \" egg timers instead of cell phones and used a common explosive like black gunpowder, the new york times reports. \" the black powder, or smokeless powder, you can buy in walmart or gun shops.

            "The bombs that tore through a crowd of spectators at the boston marathon could have cost as little as $ 100 to build and were made of the most ordinary ingredients — so ordinary, in fact, that investigators could face a gargantuan challenge in attempting to use bomb forensics to find the culprit. Investigators revealed tuesday that fragments recovered at the blast scene suggest a simple design: a common pressure cooker of the kind found at most discount stores, packed with an explosive and armed with a simple detonator. A final ingredient — a few handfuls of bbs, nails and pellets — helped ensure widespread casualties when the two devices exploded monday near the race's finish line, law enforcement officials said. The devices'design was immediately recognized by counterterrorism experts as a type touted by al-qaeda for use by its operatives around the world.

            "The bombs that tore through a crowd of spectators at the boston marathon could have cost as little as $ 100 to build and were made of the most ordinary ingredients — so ordinary, in fact, that investigators could face a gargantuan challenge in attempting to use bomb forensics to find the culprit. Investigators revealed tuesday that fragments recovered at the blast scene suggest a simple design: a common pressure cooker of the kind found at most discount stores, packed with an explosive and armed with a simple detonator. A final ingredient — a few handfuls of bbs, nails and pellets — helped ensure widespread casualties when the two devices exploded monday near the race's finish line, law enforcement officials said. The devices'design was immediately recognized by counterterrorism experts as a type touted by al-qaeda for use by its operatives around the world.

The uaw has never managed to organize a foreign-owned plant in three decades of trying, but this time it's got a powerful ally: volkswagen. The german automaker wants the union to help it replicate the successful \" works council \" model it uses in germany, in which workers help manage plant operations, the washington post reports. Germany's ig metall union is also pressing for the uaw partnership, adds the wall street journal. But republicans have launched an all-out assault to prevent that, arguing that it will blemish the low-cost, business-friendly image of the south, which claims nearly 20 such foreign-owned auto plants. ( uaw is also courting workers at a mercedes-benz plant in vance, ala., and a nissan plant in canton, miss. ) activists have put up billboards with slogans like, \" detroit: brought to you by uaw. \" one state senator threatened volkswagen, saying it would have would have a \" very tough time \" winning tax incentives from tennessee's republican legislature if it unionized. And bob corker yesterday said he was \" very certain \" that vw would build a new suv in chattanooga if workers vote down the union, reuters reports. In reality, vw has said the vote will have no bearing on the decision, and chattanooga's mayor is worried the politicized fight might drive vw to choose its mexican plant instead. \" we never want to put politics ahead of jobs, \" the mayor says.",

As the car began filling with water, the women kicked out the cracked windshield, hoping to escape, but the water only flooded the vehicle faster. With water at the teens ' necks, griffin noticed the back window was also broken and told santos to follow her out of it, reports the press democrat. Griffin made it out but was quickly carried downstream. \" i remember reaching from the water and grabbing onto a branch and i pulled myself up, \" she says. Santos never emerged from the car, and griffin spent the next 12 hours on the branch in a light jacket as temperatures dropped to 28 degrees. \" i thought i was going to die, \" griffin says, though she was eventually able to cross the creek and flag down a car.

        "summary": "The rigorous negotiation phase is over, but the landmark iran nuclear deal now faces what the wall street journal calls a \" wall of resistance \" in congress. \" it's going to be a very hard sell, \" mitch mcconnell said on fox news sunday, raising doubt that any deal could truly limit iran's nuclear weapon capability. Once the full text, plus any appendices, are submitted to congress, lawmakers will have 60 days to review the deal before sanctions against iran can be lifted. Congress will then have a few options: lawmakers can choose not to vote on the deal, or they can put forth a resolution either approving or disapproving it. They ' ll have 12 days after the review period to pass a resolution through both chambers; a vote will likely come in september after summer recess. Should congress disapprove the deal and president obama veto that, lawmakers will have 10 days to override the veto. However, most agree we're unlikely to see a veto reversed, considering how many democrats would need to abandon their president to get the 67 votes needed in the senate; republicans hold just 54 seats. Republicans aren't giving up hope, and suggest centrist democrats could be persuaded; many democrats have yet to openly express their opinion on the deal. Should all else fail, if a republican succeeds obama, he or she could make the risky move of using executive authority to throw sanctions on iran and leave the panels used to enforce the deal, politico notes. He or she could also tout any iranian violations or stubbornness over the long-term as reason to exit the deal. Israel would likely be on board: benjamin netanyahu called the iran deal a \" historic mistake for the world, \" per the new york times. With the expected lifting of sanctions, \" iran will receive hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine, \" he says.",

        "summary": "If you're wondering how on earth a squirrel managed to get onto a plane at the orlando airport, here's the answer: a woman walked right on board with it tuesday. Usa today reports the passenger had told frontier airlines in advance that she would be bringing an \" emotional support animal \" on the cleveland-bound flight. She did not specify that it was a squirrel. Had she, she would have learned that squirrels and other rodents aren't permitted aboard in this capacity. The airline says that when she was informed she would need to deplane she refused, and police were called. A rep for the airline says all passengers were removed from the plane and then the woman was escorted off, causing a roughly 2-hour delay. Clickorlando reports the orlando police department said the woman ultimately cooperated with them and was not arrested. But the new york post points out a twitter video shows that as she was wheeled out of the gate in a wheelchair, she thrust her middle finger at the crowd of waiting passengers, to cheers. It's unclear whether they were cheering at her gesture or her removal ( abc news reports it was the latter ), though a passenger who was on the flight told usa today that \" for the most part \" people found humor in the whole situation. Other support animals prohibited on frontier flights per its policy: \" reptiles, insects, hedgehogs, rabbits, sugar gliders, non-household birds or improperly cleaned and/or animals with foul odor. \" ( this flier claims she was forced to flush her pet hamster. )",

The june 14 incident at caldwell woods on chicago's far northwest side came to light on monday and also prompted an apology from cook county board president toni preckwinkle, who later said she expressed her regrets in a phone call to puerto rican gov. Ricardo rossello. In the video, a man — later identified in police reports as timothy g. Trybus, 62 — demands to know why the woman is wearing a shirt displaying the puerto rican flag. He asks her whether she is an american citizen, even though puerto rico is a u.s. Territory and its residents are u.s. Citizens. \"you should not be wearing that in the united states of america, \" trybus tells her. The woman asks an officer for help and asks him to restrain trybus."

The flights will take advantage of the long range of boeing's 787-9 dreamliner, to arrive in late 2017, which will also offer larger windows, self-service bars, and a kind of hammock for passengers to rest their feet. That's not a bad idea as the 9,000-mile flight could be the world's longest commercial flight by duration, reports the telegraph. Air india's flight from delhi to san francisco covers 9,500 miles but takes less time at about 14.5 hours. Some might consider 17 hours in the sky to be a form of torture, but it's a wink compared to the four-day journey through nine cities qantas first offered in 1947, reports the bbc, adding that the dreamliner's 236 passengers will now have time to watch 18 episodes of game of thrones or read a third of war and peace.

On sept. 29, valentina milluzzo was rushed to a hospital on the east coast of sicily with complications in her 19th week of pregnancy, and she went into premature labor. For more than two weeks she was more or less stable, but things took a turn for the worse on oct. 15: her lawyer says one of the fetuses developed severe breathing issues, and as her own condition deteriorated, the doctor taking care of her refused to carry out an abortion she requested, reportedly noting he was a \" conscientious objector \" and saying, \" i will not intervene as long as it's alive, \" deutsche welle reports. Milluzzo miscarried both fetuses, got an infection, and died oct. 16. Italian doctors are indeed a conservative lot when it comes to abortions, with government figures showing about 70 % of ob-gyns there balked at terminating pregnancies in 2013; in sicily, that stat rose to nearly 88 % — even though abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, and after that if the life of the mother is in danger or the fetus has severe problems. Doctors are able to register as conscientious objectors to abortions, but sources tell the ansa news agency this particular doctor wasn't registered. The hospital's argument: even if it were a conscientious objection ( and the hospital says the doctor never claimed that ), outside specialists are recruited to carry out abortions — but since milluzzo miscarried naturally, there was no need for outside help to be brought in. In the meantime, milluzzo's burial has been put off until the investigation into her death is complete. ( this woman live-tweeted her 48-hour trip to get an abortion. )",

Around 3 a.m. Sunday, ross hopped in a car his friend was driving in indiana and sped toward detroit, he said in a facebook post. As the car passed through ohio, an officer pulled it over. The driver was taken to jail in wayne county, michigan, and the vehicle was impounded. Ross knew this might be more than just a traffic stop for him too — he had a petty warrant out for his arrest, which meant he too was probably going to jail, according to cnn affiliate wdtn. As he began to tell the officer about the loss of his sister, ross broke down crying. That's when one of the troopers at the scene — ohio state highway patrol sgt. David robison — started to pray with ross. \"he reaches over and began praying over me and my family, \" ross wrote on facebook. \"everybody knows how much i dislike cops, but i am truly ( grateful ) for this guy. He gave me hope. \" robison also did one other"

This according to a study published in the journal work, employment and society. It was a small one: 36 partnered women and 12 partnered men were interviewed; all had at least one child under the age of 14 and all worked full-time, defined as at least 30 hours. Standout findings: roughly half of the women worked 50 % or more of the total paid hours logged in their household; only one of those women reported that her partner took the lead in terms of housework. Fifteen of the women earned 60 % or more of the household's total income; of these, 67 % still had the main responsibility when it came to housework. Only one reported her partner doing the most; the rest shared the load. Of the 16 females who earned between 40 % and 59 % of the total income, none reported having a partner that did the most. Six said it was shared, and 10 said they had the main responsibility. Writes dr. Clare lyonette, \" our interviews also showed some evidence of a larger contribution by men in lower-earning families, in comparison with men in higher-earning families. Even in those households where the woman was reported to do more... Men still seemed to do substantially more than professional/managerial men who were reported as'sharing '. \" either way, women are still doing the bulk of the work — and in a university of warwick press release, lyonette says part of this may be that women help perpetuate the stereotype that men \" are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard. \" to wit, another study found that women spend 3 hours a week just re-doing men's chores.",

The rapper, whose presence at the event infuriated conservative pundits who seized upon some of his controversial lyrics, gently recited verses about love and the suffering of young people in a violent culture, reports the washington post. Other guests included singer-songwriters aimee mann and jill scott and former poets laureate rita dove and billy collins jon stewart, meanwhile, noted that common — \" a grammy-winning vegetarian \" — is actually a very mainstream rapper. The daily show host accused fox pundits of hypocrisy for attacking common but not going after artists like johnny cash, who wrote his share of violent lyrics and was honored by george w. Bush, or ted nugent, who has made violent remarks about obama and hillary clinton but whom sean hannity calls a friend. Stewart then launched into an anti-fox rap of his own.

After plugging topographic data and the hydrogen isotope ratio in venus ' atmosphere into climate models, nasa researchers say earth's closest planet neighbor may have had an average surface temperature of 52 degrees, with a maximum temperature of 95 degrees, and liquid water oceans up to 1,700 feet deep before volcanic activity gave it a facelift 700 million years ago, reports engadget. In other words, it may have had \" the requirements for the origin of life \" as far back as 3 billion years ago, a researcher tells new scientist. Of course this scenario depends on certain factors. If the planet spun significantly faster than it does today — spinning once on its axis every 16 earth days, as opposed to 243 — or had topography similar to earth, it would have been much hotter, reaching a max temperature of 183 degrees, researchers write in geophysical research letters. \" we really need more data before we can say much more … but if you have a venus-like world around a solar-type star with a slow rotation, it could be quite a reasonable place for life to exist, especially in the oceans, \" says study author michael way. \" you get temperatures almost like earth.

But while the election of the new president, hassan rowhani, a former nuclear negotiator who is considered a moderate compared with the other candidates, was greeted by some administration officials as the best of all likely outcomes, they said it did not change the fact that only the country's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, would make the final decision about any concessions to the west. Even so, they said they wanted to test mr. Rowhani quickly, noting that although he argued for a moderate tone in dealing with the united states and its allies when he was a negotiator, he also boasted in 2006 that iran had used",

Across the country, drivers honked horns, men danced to pop music and women clapped, celebrating mr. Rowhani's campaign pledges to bring more freedom and better relations with the outside world. But mr. Rowhani, 64, is no renegade reformist, voted in while iran's leaders were not paying attention. Instead, his political life has been spent at the center of iran's conservative establishment, from well before ayatollah ruhollah khomeini led the islamic revolution in the 1970s. And analysts say that mr. Rowhani's first priority will be mediating the disturbed relationship between that leadership and iran's citizens, not"

All performances consist of two basic components: the things an actor does consciously and -- usually the magic ingredient -- the things that emerge as the result of not trying. With bridges ' performance here, as with perhaps nearly every performance he's ever given, it's impossible to locate the seams between the two. Bridges may be acting, but he always makes it look like living. Is a seemingly casual performance harder to pull off than a mannered or highly stylized one? the answer to that question has as many variations as there are actors, but the fact that bridges ' \" crazy heart \" performance feels so breezy and natural shouldn't cause anyone to underestimate it. This performance doesn't come out of left field for bridges -- it comes out of the field, which is to say it springs from a lifetime spent giving terrific performances in good movies as well as mediocre ones, as bridges has done.

How? thanks to a huge donation of $ 500,000 from billionaire pharmaceutical exec stewart rahr, all the celebs -- including organizer alicia keys and kim kardashian -- can again hit up their social media accounts, which they all agreed to abandon until the money was raised. \" i am back from the dead! \" kardashian announced monday evening. \" thank you all so much for your donations and contributions! i have missed u all so much!!! \" keys announced monday that the charity reached its $ 1 million fund-raising goal in honor of last week's world aids day.

            "Celebrities were so frustrated with the time it took to raise $ 1 million for keep a child alive's \"digital death \" campaign, they persuaded a wealthy savior to give them $ 500,000 so they could get back on twitter. Brooklyn-born billionaire pharmaceutical executive stewart rahr donated $ 500,000 yesterday to meet the $ 1 million goal, thereby resuscitating alicia keys, swizz beatz, kim and khloe kardashian, lady gaga, justin timberlake, ryan seacrest, daphne guinness and others on twitter and facebook. The boldfaces agreed to \"kill \" themselves on social media until they raised a $ 1 million for the charity, which helps fund hiv/aids relief in africa and india. But it took longer than expected, and insiders say the celebs became frustrated. \"it's the worst mismanagement of star power i've ever seen in my life, \" said a source close to the program. Sources said the organization expected to raise the $ 1 million in a week. But by yesterday, after six days, it had taken in only about $ 450,000. Stars including kim kardashian, who can earn about $ 10,000 a tweet, started getting itchy fingers. One source blamed servers that crashed for 12 hours on the first night for the slow-paced donations. Others blamed lack of promotion and overestimating the participants'twitter power. Another source"

Just 23 at the time he vanished during a solo climb of one of the mont blanc massif's main peaks, hyvert was found earlier this month on the talefre glacier with his gear ( including his skis ) and his wallet ( including his id ) still intact, reports the guardian. In spite of the resolution, not everyone is rejoicing. \" i ' m a mountain man, and i would have preferred him to stay up there, \" hyvert's father, now 82, told rtl radio. \" he was better on a mountain than in a coffin. \" and the french climber's body will be returned to that mountain: the family plans to return to the glacier and scatter his ashes there. Scores of climbers die every year on the range's dangerous and highly technical terrain, reports reuters, though bodies are often recovered the following year when ice thaws. During hyvert's march 2, 1982, climb, however, the weather took such a bad turn that it stranded another mountaineer and kept rescuers on hold for two days, at which point the other climber was found and flown out. Rescuers searching by air and foot found no trace of hyvert, and no clues had emerged since, notes the local. The working theory is that hyvert fell into an icy crevasse, where his body was preserved for decades and \" finally ejected, \" reports the telegraph.

        "summary": "Abraham lincoln perused a book of racist \" science \" before he was president and his note inside is proof, a museum says. The abraham lincoln presidential library confirms — by way of lincoln's unusual style of writing the letters e and n — that one of the most popular americans wrote an inscription inside a tattered copy of types of mankind, which has sat on a shelf at a small illinois library for years. The book argues that different races were formed separately and thus african-americans are not \" fellow men, \" nbc chicago reports, noting the argument was often used to justify slavery. Lincoln scribbled the name of the book's owner, clifton moore, inside the front cover but did not include his signature, the museum says. So did the great emancipator buy the arguments he read? \" lincoln was worried that the whole idea that you could segregate one group of people based on some brand-new thinking would just carry on into other realms, \" a presidential library curator tells cbs washington. \" everything we know about lincoln's legal, religious, and scientific thinking tells us he rejected that argument. \" though published in 1854, it isn't clear when lincoln got his hands on the book. Below his inscription, however, is a note from a local attorney attesting to the fact that lincoln wrote in the book in 1861, after he was elected president but before he left illinois; some think it's possible he borrowed it to prepare for his presidential campaign. The vespasian warner public library eventually plans to put the book on display. ( in other news, experts think they've identified a mysterious pen pal of lincoln's. )",

The legislation passed thursday now goes to gov. Jerry brown, who is expected to sign it into law after previously working out the plan with labor unions. Democrats who control both legislative chambers hailed the increase as a boon to more than 2 million of california's poorest workers and an example to the nation as it struggles with a growing gap between rich and poor. Republicans echoed fears from business owners and economists that the annual increases — eventually tied to inflation — would compound california's image as hostile to business. The assembly passed the legislation with a 48-26 vote and the senate followed, 26-12. No republican in either chamber voted in favor. Adam gray was one of two democrats in the assembly who voted against it, saying unemployment is already too high in his central valley district, the los angeles times reports. \" while $ 15 an hour probably isn't even high enough for areas like san francisco and parts of los angeles and our other urban centers, it's too high for some small businesses and some communities, \" he says. The increases would start with a boost from $ 10 to $ 10.50 on jan. 1. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees would have an extra year to comply. The state of new york is considering a similar move.",

While the legislation as written maintains current law, the executive order provides additional safeguards to ensure that the status quo is upheld and enforced, and that the health care legislation's restrictions against the public funding of abortions cannot be circumvented.

            "Just before 4 p.m. Et, the white house released text of a compromise on abortion to help clear the way for passage of the health care legislation. Statement from communications director dan pfeiffer today, the president announced that he will be issuing an executive order after the passage of the health insurance reform law that will reaffirm its consistency with longstanding restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion. While the legislation as written maintains current law, the executive order provides additional safeguards to ensure that the status quo is upheld and enforced, and that the health care legislation's restrictions against the public funding of abortions cannot be circumvented. The president has said from the start that this health insurance reform should not be the forum to upset longstanding precedent. The health care legislation and this executive order are consistent with this principle. The president is grateful for the tireless efforts of leaders on both sides of this issue to craft a consensus approach that allows the bill to move forward. A text of the pending executive order follows: executive order - - - - - - - ensuring enforcement and implementation of abortion restrictions in the patient protection and affordable care act by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, including the \" patient protection and affordable care act \" ( approved",

        "summary": "Police are continuing to piece together the murder of temple university student jenna burleigh and say they now know how her alleged killer moved her body 150 miles from philadelphia. After killing the 22-year-old, joshua hupperterz, 29, put her remains in a storage bin and transported it to his mother's home in jenkintown, police say. The next day, according to police and other sources, hupperterz used a lyft car to move the bin to property owned by his grandmother in wayne county, reports nbc philadelphia. Burleigh's body was reportedly still inside the storage bin when investigators found it in a utility shed on the wayne county property saturday, reports the philadelphia inquirer. A coroner determined she died from a combination of blunt trauma and strangulation. Police believe burleigh, who was seen leaving a bar with hupperterz around 2am thursday, was killed at hupperterz's philadelphia apartment, where authorities allegedly found blood and a substantial amount of marijuana. But authorities haven't commented on a motive other than to say that the murder doesn't appear to have been premeditated, per people. Hupperterz, a former temple student who previously faced burglary and other charges, has been taken into custody and charged with murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, and drug-related offenses. A spokesperson for lyft says the company is \" devastated \" by its apparent link to the murder, adding lyft is \" ready to work with the authorities in their investigation, \" per nbc.",

But it still laid out some stark numbers: the us now has about 50,000 catholic nuns, down from the peak of 125,000 in the 1960s, and their median age is mid- to late 70s. The vatican launched the investigation, formally called an \" apostolic visitation, \" in 2008 under pope benedict, and most figured it would end up criticizing us nuns for becoming too political or for straying from church doctrine. But as the ap writes, \" there was no critique of the nuns, no demands that they shift their focus from social justice issues to emphasize catholic teaching on abortion, no condemnation that a feminist, secular mentality had taken hold in their ranks. \" instead, it praised them for \" selflessly \" serving the poor and asked the nuns themselves to assess their own challenges amid declining numbers, reports the catholic news service. The vatican also promised to value their \" feminine genius \" more. ( maybe the supportive tone is a reflection of pope francis, who thinks that a smart nun once saved his life. )",

The foundation has been taking a tough look at itself, hiring a consultant to survey industry insiders — booksellers, editors and even critics — to see if the award process itself needs to be reformed to attract more attention. On the table are proposals like expanding the judging pool beyond just writers who judge in their own genre to include well-known cultural figures of all types, and limiting for the first time who may submit award entries. ( now, any publisher can submit as many books as it wants in any category as long as the author is an american citizen. ) the goal is to add more sex appeal to an industry that's not exactly known for it — but not, the organizers insist, just for its own sake. \"it's not about being glitzy, \" said david steinberger, the chief executive of perseus books and chairman of the foundation. \"it's about increasing the impact great books have on the culture. \" photo the unstated model here is not the oscars or the emmys, but rather the man booker prize, britain's top literary honor.

Bae, who reportedly has medical issues related to diabetes and an enlarged heart, says his health is deteriorating and that he's toiling in a labor camp to serve out his 15-year sentence, doing \" hard labor \" for eight hours a day, six days a week. Still, the 46-year-old missionary accused by north korea of scheming to overthrow the government — an offense that could have been punishable by death — says he has been treated \" as humanely as possible. \" miller, 24 — detained for \" improper behavior \" after he allegedly ripped up his tourist visa and demanded asylum — tells cnn that his \" situation is very urgent \" because he's heard he's going to trial soon and will go straight to jail. He notes he won't know what his charges are until trial day. Fowle was detained for supposedly leaving a bible in a north korean restroom, notes reuters, but he tells cnn he's got \" no complaints \" about how he's been treated, adding, \" it's been very good so far, and i hope and pray that it continues, while i ' m here two more days or two more decades. \" read more about kenneth bae and other detained americans in north korea.",

Seth rogen, rose byrne, and zac efron star in the story of a pair of new parents battling it out with their neighborhood's new frat house. As of this writing, the movie has a 76 % on rotten tomatoes, with supporters almost universally noting its gentler virtues. Here's what reviewers are saying: \" neighbors is probably the best comedy of the year so far and offers what too many of its fellows fail to provide: edgy humor with a slice of intelligence and insight, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. \" while there's no denying the film's ' mature ' credentials, there's an element of truth and honesty to some of the humor that is both surprising and refreshing. \" it's \" about as endearing as a movie featuring constant drinking, drugs, anatomy jokes, and fraternity hazing can be, \" agrees moira macdonald at the seattle times. \" rogen and byrne are so likable and charming together, and play their scenes with such lightness, you're immediately on their side. \" \" i can't quote any of the jokes, but a healthy percentage of them work, \" ty burr at the boston globe promises — especially a particularly outrageous breastfeeding scene. But \" underlying all the condom jokes and bad behavior is something genuine: the anxiety that young people in a youth-obsessed culture can feel when they're finally and irrevocably called upon to be responsible. \" but ann hornaday was not amused. \" viewers who find unbridled hilarity in the idea of babies eating condoms, men dueling with sex toys, and 30-something yuppies keepin ' it trill by using words like'trill ' will find much to value in neighbors, \" she writes in the washington post. Don't expect subtlety; this is \" a movie of wammies: one-liners, shticks, and sight gags that don't gain in momentum or accrue in meaning. \"",

The writer is sean penn, and his subject is as unlikely as he is sought-after: joaquin guzman — known equally as el chapo, mexico's top drug kingpin, prison escapee extraordinaire — who was just recaptured friday. Guzman's downfall, the ap reports, came about courtesy of that september interview after authorities were able to track him to rural durango state; a law enforcement official tells the ap that officials held their fire at the time because guzman was with two women and a child, but that they later tracked him to the house in los mochis where he was nabbed. The reason for the penn interview was a bit of vanity: a movie about his life. Highlights of the fascinating story: penn had a co-interviewer, kate del castillo, whom the new york times describes as \" a mexican actress who once played a drug kingpin in the soap opera. \" guzman wanted del castillo involved in the movie, writes penn. \" he was interested in seeing the story of his life told on film, but would entrust its telling only to kate. \" the ethical and legal ramifications of the article are still up in the air, notes the times: rolling stone changed certain names and didn't disclose certain locations; it agreed to submit the story to guzman for approval. A mexican official said late saturday that everyone who met with guzman is under investigation, penn included, though whether they ' ll face consequences or whether officials are more interested in the content of the discussions isn't clear. Sample reaction, via marco rubio, speaking sunday on abc news: \" if one of these american actors who have benefited from the greatness of this country...
