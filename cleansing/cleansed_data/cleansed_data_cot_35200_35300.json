Against a tide of technology and a ballpark culture of entertainment options and limited attention spans, the scorekeeping pencil — like its first cousin at miniature golf courses — has persisted. At about 3 ¼ inches long and with no eraser on top, the pencil has helped carry on the traditional method of scoring a ballgame that is generally believed to have begun with a late 19th-century sportswriter named henry chadwick.

        "summary": "If you're undecided about whether your next glass of wine should be red or white, a new study out of brown university may provide the tipping point: it suggests that white wine raises the risk of skin cancer. While researchers have long known that alcohol in general can raise the risk of certain cancers, this is the first time melanoma has been on the list, reports cnn. To be clear, the relative risk associated with white wine is small, but researchers still found it to be statistically significant. What's more, the increased risk seemed to affect parts of the body you wouldn't typically associate with skin cancer, such as the trunk, which is generally covered in clothes. The reasons for all this is unclear, reports cbs news. \" for now, i would say that alcohol in general is related, and i would emphasize that white wine is particularly related, \" says study co-author eunyoung cho. She notes that white wine has high levels of acetaldehyde, a carcinogen that can damage dna, and while red wine does as well, one theory is that its antioxidants might counterbalance the chemical. So should you give up your favorite white? researchers aren't going that far. A science blogger at forbes assesses the study, which examined data from more than 200,000 health professionals over 18 years, and concludes: \" i ' m still a bit skeptical, because we have no good explanation for why white wine – but not red wine, beer or other alcohol – would cause skin cancer. But still, when you reach for a glass of wine this holiday season, perhaps you should choose red instead of white. \"",

Fox &amp; friends'steve doocy pointed out that \" nordstrom took the ivanka dresses out of the store to put these jeans in. \" ainsley earhardt, meanwhile, noted, \" if i had known they were going to go for that much, i would've saved all of my brother's jeans and sold them on ebay. \" calling it a \" ludicrously self-sabotaging men's style piece, \" tim teeman writes at the daily beast that those who'd wear them would never get anywhere near a manual-labor worksite. \" the only mud you've ever gone near is at the beautician's, \" he chastises.

Payroll gains have averaged 207,000 over the past three months. And for the year the economy has averaged 215,000 job gains every month, the best pace of job growth since 1999. \"",

Last year, march hit 8.6 %. \" i believe that by 2020, we will see the first 15 % month, possibly a little sooner, \" says christopher clack, a former noaa researcher who now runs a company called vibrant clean energy. \" this will partly depend on the weather patterns in the year, but i could see substantial ( wind and solar plant ) additions before 2020 that will increase production to those levels. \" generally speaking, wind and solar numbers peak in what are known as the \" shoulder seasons \" of spring and fall.

        "summary": "After 12 years and hundreds of hours of legal battles, the state of arkansas has successfully taken a man's life. Ledell lee, a convicted murderer who'd been on death row for more than 20 years, was executed late thursday after the us supreme court decided not to intervene, cnn reports. Prison officials say the 51-year-old inmate, who denied killing 26-year-old debra reese in 1993, requested holy communion as his last meal and declined to make a final statement. Neil gorsuch voted with the majority in the supreme court's 5-4 decision to allow the execution to proceed, reports the new york times. Lee, whose death warrant expired at midnight, took 12 minutes to die and was pronounced dead at 11: 56pm. Arkansas had planned to execute eight inmates before the end of april, but court decisions spared the first three men and put the execution of a fourth in doubt, the ap reports. The aclu and the innocence project had called for post-conviction dna testing in the case of lee, who was also convicted of two rapes and suspected of a second murder. In the attack lee was executed for, reese was sexually assaulted before being hit 36 times with a tire-thumping tool that her husband, a truck driver, had given her to protect herself with when he was on the road. Her son, joseph lucky, was 6 years old when she was killed. At lee's final clemency hearing, lucky called him \" the embodiment of evil, \" thv11 reports.",

Two of the accused had been arrested after the last rape in bhiwani but were eventually let out on bail, while the other three were never arrested at all. Her family says she was attacked again because they kept pursuing the case, seeking to have all five put behind bars despite offers to settle the case out of court for a relatively large sum of money. \" we were getting constant threats from the accused to reach a compromise outside the court, but we remained firm, \" the brother of the woman, said to be either 20 or 21 years old, tells the hindustan times.

The young woman is a dalit, considered the lowest, \" untouchable \" caste, while at least three of the accused are said to be from an upper caste. The washington post notes that the outcry against rape cases involving victims from lower castes is often \" muted, \" and that the region where this most recent rape took place is still held in a patriarchal grip, where, \" male-dominated village councils often mete out their brand of misogynistic justice with impunity. \" the indian express reports that the woman's family had moved to rohtak from bhiwani after the last assault, fearing she would be ostracized and because they feared the accused men, who are all in their late 20s.

What makes a 685-page book on economic history, translated from french, amazon's bestseller? well, the reviews have been great; paul krugman calls it \" truly superb \" in the new york review of books. And it deals with an issue that speaks to americans, writes aimee picchi at cbs news: income inequality. Piketty argues that the problem is tied to return on capital surpassing the economy's growth rate. In other words, as jordan weissmann writes at slate, \" as economic growth slows in a country, the income generated by wealth balloons compared with income generated by work, and inequality skyrockets. \" piketty, weissmann notes, \" has been perhaps the most important thinker on inequality of the past decade or so. \" his work has been instrumental in documenting the oft-discussed wealthiest 1 %. While the book has been a sales success, however, it hasn't generated many amazon reviews, picchi points out; that could mean the readers who are buying it aren't actually getting around to reading the giant thing.

        "summary": "Remember the massive cyberattack last month in which victims were told to pay a ransom to have their data unlocked? the nsa thinks it was a scheme by north korea to make money for its government coffers, reports the washington post. A report not yet made public suggests the perpetrators responsible were sponsored by north korea's spy agency, the reconnaissance general bureau; the ransomware was traced to ip addresses commonly used by the rgb in china, officials say. The report suggests the perpetrators belong to the lazarus group, a hackers ' collective that works on behalf of pyongyang. Security researchers at google and symantec previously said an early version of wannacry contained code used by the lazarus group in an earlier cyberattack. The goal of the ransomware — which demanded $ 300 in order to release encrypted data on victims ' computers — was apparently to raise money for north korea's regime. So did it work? not so much. Despite affecting more than 300,000 people in 150 countries, it raised just $ 140,000 in bitcoin that has yet to be cashed out, likely because the transactions will be easily trackable. Given such faults — attackers also couldn't tell which users paid a ransom — a cybersecurity researcher at rendition infosec suggests the worm was accidentally unleashed in a testing phase. The nsa assessment isn't definitive, but it says the evidence overwhelmingly points to north korea. The bbc, however, notes that a different assessment suggested the hackers were fluent in chinese, which would cast doubt on north korea as the culprit.",

        "summary": "Donald trump: presumptive gop nominee, cheeto jesus, and, per politico, a record-setter for \" political toxicity. \" that's the site's analysis of trump's standing with the american people after recent polls show he's reached a level of unpopularity \" without historical peer in the modern era of presidential campaigns. \" an abc news/washington post poll released wednesday shows 70 % look at trump \" unfavorably, \" a 10-point rise since last month. Not that hillary clinton got off scot-free: she rose to an unfavorable rating of 55 %, a high for her as well. The poll's press release points out that the 1,000 adult participants were surveyed between june 8 and june 12 — much of that time fell before last weekend's orlando shooting and the candidates'remarks on it. A bloomberg poll also released this week, surveying 1,000 us adults between june 10 and june 13, doesn't do much for the donald, either, assigning him a 66 % unfavorable rating and hillary 54 %. And a gallup poll taken between june 10 and june 16 has trump perched on the 64 % unfavorable rung, while clinton hovers at 55 %. Perhaps most stunning, though, is how trump — who once said black voters would like him better than obama and that hispanics are \" going to love trump \" — fares among racial and ethnic minorities: in the abc/post poll, 94 % of blacks and 89 % of hispanics give him a negative rating, while 59 % of whites do. Hillary, on the other hand, claims a relatively low percentage of blacks ( 19 % ) and hispanics ( 34 % ) who view her unfavorably, but she falters behind trump with white voters, with 68 % unfavorability. Also notable, per politico, is how strong the negative emotions swirling around trump are, with a majority of voters in both the abc/post poll and the bloomberg poll saying they had a \" strongly unfavorable \" feeling about him. The last potus candidate with a majority of \" unfavorable \" ratings during june of an election year: george hw bush in 1992. Still, none of this may matter. \" will the united states elect a president whom more than half the people view unfavorably? today, the answer to that question looks like it might be yes, \" a quinnipiac university pollster tells politico.",

        "summary": "In news certain to start a whole new round of arguments at record stores ( were record stores still a thing ), researchers at new york university say the songs you like could give you away as a psychopath, the guardian reports. Researchers had 200 people already scored on the levenson self-report psychopathy scale listen to 260 songs. According to the new york daily news, some of the songs were released as early as the 1940s and all were picked for being very recognizable. Researchers found enjoyment of 30 of the songs, including \" lose yourself \" by eminem and \" no diggity \" by blackstreet*, was predictive of psychopathy. Alternately, \" titanium \" by sia and \" my sharona \" by the knack were among the songs that were completely useless in rooting out a psychopath. Lead researcher pascal wallisch refused to name the other songs used in the study for fear of tainting future research. But while some media outlets are reporting the findings as a condemnation of rap or r&b, wallisch says that's not the case. \" this study has nothing to do with rap music, \" he says. \" it's more song-specific and not genre-specific. \" however, he's not sure what it is about certain songs that seem to attract psychopaths. \" it may be the stimulation in the song. We don't know, \" he tells newsweek. Wallisch also warns against taking the results too seriously yet.

        "summary": "John kerry fired what was widely seen as a frustrated parting shot at israel amid rising tensions wednesday, warning, as \" a friend, \" that the country needs to hear some \" hard truths \" about its settlement policy, which he believes is jeopardizing any hope of a two-state solution. The wall street journal notes that the kerry speech also appeared to be a warning to the donald trump transition team about the danger of breaking with longstanding us policy on working toward a palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital. Before the speech, trump tweeted that israel shouldn't be treated with \" such total disdain and disrespect. \" he urged the country to \" stay strong \" because jan. 20 is \" fast-approaching. \" a round-up of coverage: israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu did not welcome the criticism: the times of israel reports that he attacked and ridiculed kerry's speech in hebrew, then in english. \" is that all he's got? \" wondered netanyahu, slamming kerry for attacking the \" only democracy in the middle east \" and vowing to work with trump to \" repeal \" a un resolution condemning israeli settlements, which the us, to the fury of israel, did not veto. The washington post looks at the background to obama's decision to abstain instead of vetoing the un resolution. Its sponsors were determined to call a vote before obama left office, insiders say — and obama, with \" nothing to lose, \" decided to take a stand. Kerry's remarks were greeted warmly in europe, the new york times reports, but they were condemned by us lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Eliot engel, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, called it \" wrong \" and said it was painful to watch, while sen. John mccain said it was \" at best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration, \" and at worst another \" dangerous outburst. \" the bbc reports that kerry's remarks could help \" set the scene for future diplomacy, \" with a peace conference set to take place in france in mid-january, the week before trump takes office. Netanyahu has a lot more than kerry's remarks on his plate: reuters reports that israel's attorney general has ordered a criminal investigation of the prime minister on two unspecified matters.

( see here and here, or check out a recent pew poll showing the anemic level of interest among americans — only about 15 % are closely following things. ) midterms always lack the punch of a presidential election, of course, but this year seems worse than any recent one, writes peter beinart at the atlantic. The problem, he argues, is that while 2014 has a number of dramatic races on the local level, nothing is grabbing people in more of a big-picture sense. \" there's no big national issue on which voters feel that they can change the country's course. \" go back to 1998, for instance, when the possibility of bill clinton's impeachment hung over the election. In 2002, the nation fretted about invading iraq, and four years later, it fretted about leaving. In 2010, the economic collapse overshadowed all. But this year, \" americans just don't believe that as much hinges on their vote. \" control of the senate? sure, \" democrats want to win, but they're not too worried about losing, \" writes ezra klein at vox. Even if they do, \" they're likely to take it back in 2016. And it's not as if much is going to get done in the meantime. \" people right now are worried about ebola and isis, he adds, and that gets to heart of the problem of the 2014 election: \" it doesn't seem likely to really change anything anyone cares about. \" click for klein's full column, or beinart's.",

        "summary": "Without a risky bone-marrow transplant before symptoms appear, children with brain disease ald can expect to live no longer than five years as nerve cells in the brain die off and erase one's ability to walk, talk, and think. Even a successful transplant can result in permanent disabilities, reports the new york times. That's why a new study in the new england journal of medicine is raising eyebrows: for the first time, doctors say they have successfully repelled adrenoleukodystrophy using gene therapy, a feat that could boost the survival rate of the rare brain disease affecting one in 20,000 boys, usually around age 7. Two years after gene therapy — a treatment expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars — 15 of 17 boys with a mutated gene causing ald showed no symptoms. Of the two who died, one had ald too advanced to be halted, while the other withdrew from the study. Gene therapy \" has effectively arrested the progress \" of the disease, study author david a. Williams says in a release. There are drawbacks in addition to cost, however: like with a bone-marrow transplant, it's necessary to start the therapy early as the good ald genes, which are introduced into a patient's blood stem cells via a disabled form of hiv, take a year to multiply in bone marrow and reach the brain, where they protect neurons. Indeed, the only sign of ald in the patients of the clinical trial was deterioration evident in brain scans. But this is not so much an issue in states that have begun newborn screening for ald, reports npr. Additionally, \" patients don't have to wait to find a donor match \" and there's no need for \" immunosuppression drugs, which can have very significant, even fatal, side effects, \" says williams. This \" is a curative therapy. \"",

        "summary": "It's been a week since french gunmen cherif kouachi, said kouachi, and amedy coulibaly were killed, but their bodies remain unburied, probably somewhere in a paris morgue, the new york times reports. French law allows for local burial, though an official family request must be made to the mayor of the city where the deceased either lived or died; the family may also choose to bury the body in a family plot or bring it back to their home country. But no official requests have been made yet for the three muslim attackers, either from their families or the paris prosecutor, the times notes. And a few local mayors have already said they'd refuse such requests to prevent gravesite visits from fanatics. \" if i ' m asked to bury said kouachi, i will refuse categorically, \" the mayor of reims, where kouachi lived, tells the times. \" [ cemeteries are a ] place of peace. I don't want them to become a place of hatred. \" france is a secular state, so muslim cemeteries, where tombs are oriented toward mecca, are scarce, the bbc noted in 2013. And burials in france are usually \" provisional, \" which means the grave needs to be vacated after a 30- or 50-year lease is up and the body placed in a common grave — at odds with the muslim mandate that bodies should generally remain untouched. If a burial request is made despite these issues, a mayor could keep the dead's name and any other provocative words off the headstone to prevent unwanted visitors, a funeral law expert tells bfmtv. ( a similar problem arose regarding tamerlan tsarnaev's burial. )",

            "Image caption the old cemetery in fes, morocco from working-class neighbourhoods of french towns and cities to the villages of algeria and morocco, a strange kind of reverse migration is under way - of the dead. Every year thousands of bodies are being repatriated from france to the maghreb, as muslim families return their loved ones to the soil of their original home. It is a costly and complicated business, involving flights, consular administrators and specialist funeral providers. It also prompts the question: why not get buried in france? after all, france is the country where these families are now destined to live. Would it not be a sign of successful integration if france were also where they chose to rest when they died? the answer to that question has to do with the complexities of national identity in a world of mass migration. But also with france's own obsession with secular \" republican \" values, and its reluctance to give ground - literally - on matters of faith. At the el-ouadjib ( duty, in arabic ) funeral parlour in lille in northern france, abdallah hadid receives three or four calls a day from families that have just had a death.

        "summary": "One body apparently looks much like another after a few days in tokyo's edo river. In june 2017, a japanese woman who reported her husband missing identified a body found in the river as her loved one. She had the body cremated — and was shocked 11 months later when her husband turned up alive and well, usa today reports. Two other relatives also identified the body pulled from the river as the missing husband, who was in his 40s and had been reported missing three days earlier. Police say that after the mistake was discovered, they were able to use fingerprint records to establish the true identity of the body. Authorities say the body retrieved was that of a man in his 30s who was around the same height as the husband and who'd been reported missing on the day the body was pulled from the river. \" the incident is extremely regrettable. We're determined to prevent a recurrence, \" a senior tokyo police officer says. Police say that under the current system, fingerprint and dna verification isn't required when relatives identify a body that hasn't been linked to a crime, the asahi shimbun reports. They didn't disclose where the woman's husband had been during the 11 months that everybody thought he was dead. ( this elderly japanese crime boss was a fugitive for 15 years — and then facebook gave him up. )",

A boy genius who got his caltech phd at 20, wolfram dabbled in particle physics before creating the mathematica software package, and then wolframalpha, a \" computational engine \" that debuted to considerable fanfare a few years ago. In an elegiac blog post, wolfram notes that the discovery of the higgs brings a lifetime ( his lifetime ) of physics research to a close. It confirms the \" standard model, \" which is the putative organization of the subatomic universe that scientists have been working on for decades.

It wasn't clear what theory was correct. Some theories seemed shallow and utilitarian; others seemed deep and philosophical. Some were clean but boring. Some seemed contrived. Some were mathematically sophisticated and elegant; others were not. By the mid-1970s, though, those in the know had pretty much settled on what became the standard model. In a sense it was the most vanilla of the choices. It seemed a little contrived, but not",
            "In confirming what we already thought, the higgs boson discovery portends a close to a glorious chapter of particle physics. Cern experimental physicists around the world are celebrating the discovery of the higgs boson, which was officially announced yesterday. While many of us are trying to figure out what the higgs boson is, and whether calling it the god particle is stupid, one of the smartest guys in the world, stephen wolfram, is sad. A boy genius who got his caltech phd at 20, wolfram dabbled in particle physics before creating the mathematica software package, and then wolframalpha, a \" computational engine \" that debuted to considerable fanfare a few years ago. In an elegiac blog post, wolfram notes that the discovery of the higgs brings a lifetime ( his lifetime ) of physics research to a close. It confirms the \" standard model, \" which is the putative organization of the subatomic universe that scientists have been working on for decades. That might sound like a good thing, but confirming what we already thought was the case actually is actually a lot less interesting than discovering something fundamentally new."

        "summary": "To an asthma sufferer, a fit of wheezing and coughing probably seems like your average asthma attack. A new study, however, suggests shortness of breath and other symptoms linked to asthma might actually indicate a peanut allergy. After analyzing the records of 1,517 children with asthma at an ohio respiratory clinic, researchers found 44 % had undergone a blood test to indicate an allergy to peanuts and 22 % tested positive. Overall, about one in 10 were found to have a peanut sensitivity, but 53 % of affected children and their parents weren't aware of any adverse reaction, the guardian reports. \" many of the respiratory symptoms of peanut allergy can mirror those of an asthma attack, and vice versa, \" the study author says. \" children with asthma might benefit from a test for peanut sensitivity, especially when control of wheezing and coughing is difficult to achieve. \" even if parents are fairly certain that their child doesn't have an issue with peanuts, a blood test could reveal surprising results. \" many people have positive allergy tests but can eat peanuts safely — and so it is unsurprising that many people tested for this research did not know they would have a positive test result, \" says a doctor at asthma uk, adding asthma paired with a food allergy boosts the risk of a severe asthma attack. Livescience notes a 2010 study found children with asthma and a peanut allergy were hospitalized twice as often as those with only asthma. Researchers also say certain asthma medications shouldn't be used by kids with peanut allergies. They hope to next investigate why asthma and peanut allergies appear to be linked, noting the rate at which peanut allergies were known to sufferers was \" strikingly similar \" across all ages, per medical news today.

In kleptopredation, on the other hand, an animal waits until its prey has finished eating then just straight-up eats its prey and its prey's prey, which is currently sitting in its prey's belly. The marine biologists observed kleptopredation in a type of sea slug called a nudibranch. The study found that in 14 out of 25 cases, nudibranchs chose to eat hydroid polyps, its normal prey, while the polyps still had a belly full of zooplankton, their typical prey. Because the zooplankton inside the polyps accounts for about half of nudibranchs'diet, researchers believe the sea slugs actually favor consuming plankton rather than the polyps themselves, which nudibranchs appear to be using \" as living fishing nets. \" researchers believe other marine organisms are likely using kleptopredation as well, likely because it increases their nutrition intake. ( this sea slug does something incredibly unusual. )",

        "summary": "Yes, that donut is delicious – practically irresistible. And here's why. Yale researchers have found that foods that combine fat and carbohydrates create a powerful reward in the brain, reports usa today. The investigators recruited 206 volunteers and gave them a small amount of money to bid on various foods in an auction-like way, while having their brain scanned in real time. The team found that the participants were more likely to pay for foods containing the fat-carbo combination, and moreover, the brain scan reflected stimulation in an area associated with reward. Ironically, foods containing the magic fat-carbo combo don't exist in nature, except for breast milk, which contains 3.5 % fat and 7 % carbohydrates. Snack food, by comparison, is typically about one quarter fat and half carbohydrates. The results at least partly explain rising rates of obesity. It turns out that combining fat and carbs created a craving that went beyond \"two plus two \"; the combination generated a unique response that was greater than the sum of the parts. The study, says yale psychiatrist and senior author dana small, is one of the first to show that \" our modern foods, processed foods, are different. They are affecting our physiology differently, \" per nbc. The volunteers were also asked to guess how many calories were in the various foods. According to small, they were good at estimating calories from fatty food, but bad at carbohydrates. The bottom line? as yalenews reports, the human body has not evolved to handle snack food like \"donuts, french fries, chocolate bars, and potato chips, \" says small, and its reward system \"may backfire to promote overeating and obesity. \"",

The body of 62-year-old sushil manjhi hasn't been found. His son and daughter were in the boat with him when the tiger leapt from bank, and they tried unsuccessfully to beat the animal off with sticks, the son tells ap. The tiger \" quickly flung my father on his back and gave a giant leap before disappearing into the forest, \" he says. The attack happened in sunderbans national park, which is filled with estuaries and tidal rivers and is a crucial habitat for bengal tigers. Maybe 2,500 exist in the wild, according to nature world news, and the sunderbans region is supposed to be off-limits to fishermen and hunters. Poor villagers often hunt for crabs in its waters, however, and this would be the fourth fatal tiger attack in the sunderbans this year.

As for where the sns warehouses ( there are possibly six ) are located, \" this is not public information, \" per a government website, but npr's nell greenfieldboyce got a look inside one — after signing a confidentiality agreement that barred her from saying anything about the exterior. Among the things she noticed inside: a massive american flag; a caged area containing potentially addictive drugs; a huge freezer stocked with items requiring colder temps; rows of ventilators that are charged monthly and serviced annually; shipping containers pre-stocked with 50 tons of goods, ready to be sent to local public health officials if needed; and shelves \" so tall that looking up makes me dizzy. \" one interesting wrinkle: expiration dates. The dates on every item needs to be checked so expired ones can be tossed, meaning vast sums of money are spent on items that will ultimately be discarded. That's not to say the stockpile hasn't been called upon. The first deployment was in june 2001, when 200 ventilators and related supplies were sent to houston in the wake of tropical storm allison; three months later, sns provided items following 9/11.",

Scientists placed 11 people in a sanitized chamber and tested the microbes in the air around them using air filters and petri dishes. Though researchers chose to focus on whole microbial communities rather than specific pathogens, they identified thousands of different types of bacteria across 312 samples. \" if i scratch my head, thousands of skin cells, cell fragments, bacteria, and fungi get airborne, \" says lead author james meadow, who notes bacteria also escapes in our breath and, yes, our farts. \" the world is covered in a fine patina of feces, \" he generously adds. While scientists found mouth bacteria streptococcus and skin microbes propionibacterium and corynebacterium were present in the clouds of all 11 participants, the different combinations provided a signature so distinctive that scientists could identify the person in the chamber just by looking at the bacteria in the air. The results \" demonstrate for the first time that individuals release their own personalized microbial cloud, \" the authors say in a release. \" if you are close enough to shake hands with someone, you are in their microbial cloud, \" adds meadow. \" when someone walks by and you feel breeze, that's taking your bacteria with them. \" the research could help us better understand the spread of diseases.

Scores of heads of state, royals, other dignitaries, and celebrities are expected to pour into the country from around the world to attend the ceremony in qunu, the remote village in the eastern cape where mandela grew up, creating a security and logistical nightmare one commentator likens to \" a simultaneous opening and closing ceremony of the world cup, a presidential inauguration and a monarch's coronation. \" at the same time, an army of news crews from around the world will be scrambling for accommodation. For now, the great statesman's body is believed to be in a military hospital in pretoria, where he will be embalmed before monday's ceremony of national mourning at a 95,000-seat soccer stadium in soweto, reports cnn. According to government sources, he will then lie in state for three days at the seat of government in pretoria before a military aircraft flies the body to qunu next friday, where the military will hand responsibility for his remains to his famiy. The next day, the state funeral will be broadcast to millions. Finally, he will be buried in a small, private family ceremony in accordance with his xhosa tribal roots, at a burial spot he chose overlooking the fields where he tended cattle as a boy, the telegraph reports.",

Faid had been on the run since his dramatic prison break in sequedin, northern france, on april 13th, during which he held four prison guards hostage. Faid, 41, was arrested at around 3am french time, in the company of a 29-year-old accomplice, who is already known to police, according to sources for french daily le parisien. The arrest and capture was peaceful, according to pierre-henri brandet, a spokesman for the interior ministry. \" there was no exchange of gunfire, and the arrest happened in good conditions, \" he told europe 1 radio on wednesday.

        "summary": "Now that lance armstrong has admitted to doping, it seems he's officially made his way from universally beloved to universally reviled. A roundup of reactions to his confession, which airs on oprah's show tomorrow: \" he's a cheater and a bully who doesn't deserve leniency, \" write emily bazelon and william saletan in slate. Even so, allowing him to cut a deal with the us anti-doping agency \" may be the only way to fix cycling, \" they concede. If armstrong can help to bring down the international cycling union, a corrupt organization that purports to fight against dopers while actually protecting them, the sport could actually become clean again. Click for their full piece. Cnn asked writers, cyclists, and ethics experts whether lance should be given another chance, and their across-the-board response was: no. But some agree that his cooperation with the usada could ultimately help cycling. More still needs to be done, writes randy cohen: all the doping riders, many of them tops in the sport, need to confess. And cycling's governing bodies must then \" provide a setting in which honest athletes can participate \" without feeling the need to dope in order to compete. Usa today ran a similar experiment, asking readers if lance should be forgiven. Most seem to agree that the answer is no, but some still admire his work with livestrong. Others point out that the problem is bigger than him, and involves the entire sport. But the most unlikely victim? dodgeball. Armstrong appeared in a pivotal scene in the vince vaughn comedy, talking vaughn into not giving up because, as armstrong says in the film, \" you know, once i was thinking about quitting when i was diagnosed with brain, lung, and testicular cancer all at the same time. But with the love and support of my friends and family, i got back on the bike, and i won the tour de france five times in a row. But i ' m sure you have a good reason to quit. \" now the movie is pretty much ruined, many agree.",

        "summary": "A person close to jordan linn graham — the newlywed accused of pushing her husband of eight days off a cliff and to his death in july — says graham was vocal about not really wanting to get married. And friends of the groom now say they were vocal, too. A member of cody lee johnson's wedding party says he warned johnson not to marry graham, as did others. Cameron fredrickson says the two-year relationship \" didn't seem like a happy, loving \" one, and describes graham as unfriendly; he notes she didn't look at her husband-to-be as she said her vows, reports the missoulian. Fredrickson, however, acknowledges that johnson never expressed any misgivings to him. Graham, for her part, will find out where she will remain pending trial by noon today. At an appearance in us district court in missoula yesterday, attorneys for the 22-year-old asked that she be allowed to stay with her mother and stepfather; the prosecution wants her behind bars. Other revelations from court: fbi special agent steven liss testified that graham told her maid of honor, via emails sent before johnson's death, that she didn't want to wake up, reports the missoulian. And cnn reports that prosecutors asserted that a fake email account created soon after johnson's death was part of an attempted cover-up.",

Citing news reports claiming he arrived 12 minutes late and stayed beyond the allotted time while meeting queen elizabeth ii for tea at windsor castle last month, trump said the media \" can make anything bad because they are the fake, fake disgusting news, \" per the telegraph. Trump added he'd actually had \" a beautiful, beautiful visit \" with the queen, even though she'd kept him waiting. \" i had landed and i ' m on the ground and i ' m waiting with the king's and with the queen's guards — wonderful people. I ' m waiting! i was about 15 minutes early and i ' m waiting with my wife and that's fine. Hey, it's the queen, right? we can wait, \" trump said, per the washington post. Of the meeting, he added, \" i didn't know this — it was supposed to last 15 minutes but it lasted like an hour. Because we got along. And she liked our first lady and our first lady liked her. \" but the media packaged it as \" the president was 15 minutes late for the queen.... Wrong! \" he said. Per the post, brits aren't buying what trump is selling. \" we all saw the news clips. You were late!!! \" reads one typical comment online.",

Those two are expected to be indicted later today. The big question remains whether the charges will implicate christie himself in the decision. He has denied any knowledge of it beforehand. Wildstein's guilty plea suggests he is cooperating with authorities, which means \" he could give them an inside view of how the plot unfolded, \" notes bloomberg. The us attorney for new jersey, paul fishman, is expected to provide details this afternoon.

Klaus kristiansen of denmark apparently couldn't get the tale his own grandfather had told him out of his head — that an aircraft had crashed behind their birkelse farm in 1944 — and so when his son had a history homework assignment, he jokingly told the boy to \" go out and find the plane that is supposed to have crashed, \" reports dr p4 nordjylland, via the local. But what 14-year-old daniel rom kristiansen turned up in a nearby field was no joke: the remnants of a german messerschmitt plane, as well as the remains of its pilot, the bbc reports. Dad and son had headed out with a metal detector, and when the device started beeping, they borrowed an excavator and began digging deep into the earth. Starting at around 13 feet down, they started turning up pieces of the wreckage of the bf 109 model. Kristiansen says they found \" maybe 2,000 [ to ] 5,000 pieces \" of the plane, books, a wallet with some cash, papers — and then bone fragments and pieces of human clothing. He says he's lived on the property for decades and had never seen \" a single bit of metal. \" the two called authorities, and the site has been roped off. Forensics experts are hoping to identify the body. \" luckily my son has something to write about in his assignment now, \" kristiansen tells dr.

So when is it ok to start selling off dinosaur bones? npr takes a look at the murky ethical territory many struggling cultural institutions face using the field museum as example. In 2004, the museum auctioned off more than 30 george catlin paintings, earning it $ 15.5 million, the chicago tribune reported at the time. Such a move is generally considered kosher in the museum world so long as the proceeds are used to acquire new pieces or care for existing ones, which is what the field museum has done. But the tribune last month reported that the museum's decision to use some of the money to pay salaries of some staff who tend to the collections — and to sell its final four catlin paintings — has rankled some. Part of the problem: people bequeath items and collections to museums expecting them to stay there forever. If word gets out it's selling off works, donors might be dissuaded from handing over their triceratops skeletons. \" it makes donors in the future fear for the security of the things they leave to the organization, \" says the co-founder of the university of chicago's cultural policy center.",

When the field museum sold more than 30 works of 19th-century western art for millions of dollars in 2004, it eased controversy by announcing plans to spend the proceeds on new artifacts and by holding on to four of the best paintings from the collection. This george catlin portrait of the sauk and fox chief black hawk was held back from a 2004 field museum auction that included 31 other catlin works. But four years later the field's board voted to sell it and three other catlin paintings remaining in the field collection. That sale was completed in 2011. Since then, records show, some scientists and executives at the field have considered selling other treasures. In late 2010, on the recommendation of a financial consulting firm, the museum went through its collections to determine whether any items could be sold. And this year, a committee of scientists and executives tasked with evaluating the museum's financial situation suggested in a report to the president that the museum's rare book collection could fetch up to $ 50"

        "summary": "Some 35 years after police targeted gay men in a series of raids on bathhouses, toronto's gay community will finally get an apology. Toronto police chief mark saunders is expected to deliver an official apology wednesday for the feb. 5, 1981, raids on four bathhouses — known as operation soap — during which 160 officers armed with crowbars and sledgehammers arrested 286 men on charges of indecency and prostitution, reports ctv news. About 90 % of charges were dropped, but not before closeted men had their names and photos broadcast around the country. Many lost relationships and jobs as a result, a lgbt researcher tells the globe and mail. \" it was incredibly scary, \" one man tells the cbc. \" we thought this was a safe place just like the lgbt people in orlando thought that they were in safe place. \" but \" in a way, it was our stonewall moment in canada, and really, the beginning of the major push for equality of lgbt rights. \" thousands protested the next day, leading author margaret atwood and others to speak out in support of the gay community. The city's first pride event came that june, per the cbc. Toronto police are also expected to apologize for a 2000 raid on a women's bathhouse event, which saw male officers encounter nude women, reports the toronto star. While many say the apologies will be a step in the right direction, others say the focus should be on eradicating what some view as homophobic legislation.",

        "summary": "Has orange juice had its day in america? a story at quartz backed up by sales figures over the years suggests as much. The big takeaway is that per-capita consumption is down 40 % since the 1990s, with last year's sales the lowest in 15 years. The story lays out some of the reasons that a comeback doesn't look likely: higher prices: diseases are devastating florida's citrus crop, leading to smaller oranges and higher prices. As in, about twice as high as prices in 2000. Waning breakfast: fewer people are eating this meal, and the inextricably linked orange juice is suffering as a result. Not so healthy? orange juice has loads of sugar, and the industry — especially tropicana parent pepsi and simply orange parent coca-cola — has taken flak of late for inflating nutritional claims about its juices. ( on that note, a recent atlantic story equates the nutritional value of commercial orange juice to soda and recounts how it nonetheless acquired the reputation as a healthful drink through savvy marketing over the decades. ) but it's not all gloom and doom. Time notes that while powdered vitamin c drinks are gaining popularity, \" everybody knows you can't make a decent mimosa with emergen-c, so there may still be hope for the once mighty juice. \"",
