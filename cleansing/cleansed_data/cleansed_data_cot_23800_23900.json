        "summary": "On may 5, 1945, us soldiers liberated the mauthausen concentration camp in austria, ending a nightmare that began for marsha kreuzman nearly six years before. Kreuzman and her family were forced into the krakow ghetto in 1939, when she was in her teens; the next year, her mother was taken to a concentration camp and killed. Kreuzman herself went to a labor camp, then to auschwitz, then bergen-belsen, then flossenbürg, then mauthausen. Along the way she saw her father shot, and lost her brother. When the americans found her, she weighed just 68 pounds, and was on the ground outside a crematorium. She tells cbs new york, \" i was lying on the crematorium door waiting to be shuffled to crematorium. I was sick and when the american soldiers picked me up, i looked [ and ] he looked like he was in heaven. \" in the decades since, kreuzman, now 90 and living in new jersey, has searched in vain for someone to thank, going so far as to write letters to men she found in telephone books who she thought might be connected to the 11th armored division, reports the star-ledger. How she eventually found joe barbella, 93, two months ago, is pretty wild: she happened to be reading a 65th wedding anniversary announcement in the star-ledger for barbella and his wife, which noted that his division helped liberate mauthausen. She called him the next day, and the two have had several meetings since.",

        "summary": "A retired police detective suspects he's getting closer to solving a series of 1940s hollywood murders, including that of the black dahlia — and the man he suspects to be the killer is his own father. Steve hodel first began to suspect george hodel while going through his belongings after his death at age 91 in 1999. That's when he says he found two photos resembling elizabeth short, who became known as the black dahlia — and da records confirm hodel was indeed under suspicion in the 1947 case. The younger hodel started doing research, and in 2003 published a book on the subject. He suspects his father killed as many as 10 young women before moving to asia in the late 1940s, including jean spangler, a 26-year-old actress who may have been seeking an abortion before her 1949 disappearance; hodel says his father was then one of the only la-area physicians performing abortions. And new evidence lends credence to his serial-killer theory, he tells nbc los angeles. Hodel believes his father committed the murders in or near their home at the time, which hodel told cbs in 2004 included a secret room he and his siblings weren't allowed to enter. Suspecting the bodies may have been disposed of nearby, he returned to the house in 2012 with a cadaver dog in tow. It picked up the scent of possible human decomposition in several areas, including the alley behind the house. A soil sample from that alley was analyzed late last year, and it \" came up positive for human remains, \" says the forensic anthropologist who tested it. Hodel next wants to deepen his search for the remains, but he's been thus far barred from searching the private hillside near the home, and the lapd has declined to get involved. Hodel also thinks his father, who traveled to northern california in the 1960s and died while living in san francisco, may have been the zodiac killer — but at least two other people have pinned those murders on their fathers as well.",

Daniela poggiali, 42, was arrested friday in connection with 11 patient deaths and had already been under suspicion of killing another in april, the new york post and ansa report. Police then found a selfie on her phone of poggiali giving a thumbs-up beside a dead patient in northeast italy. \" i can assure you in that all my professional years of seeing shocking photos, there were few such as these, \" says a prosecutor. Poggiali was originally suspected of killing a 78-year-old woman who had entered the hospital with minor health issues and allegedly died from a potassium overdose — which can trigger cardiac arrest and be hard to trace because it leaves the body soon after death. Now police believe she may have killed up to 38 patients who \" needed extra care or had pushy relatives, \" reports ansa. Co-workers, who had already noticed patient deaths during poggiali's shifts, describe her as \" a cold, polished \" person who worked hard, gawker reports.

        "summary": "If you don't assume that ordering an iced drink at starbucks could include an ample amount of ice in that drink, and that said ice will count toward the stated liquid volume of that beverage — well, you're not smarter than a fifth-grader. That's basically the gist of the public lashing directed by a california judge toward alexander forouzesh, who sued the coffeehouse chain for misleading consumers about iced beverage sizes because the total ounce count includes the ice and the beverage, not just that of the drink itself, reports the chicago tribune. Us district judge percy anderson dismissed forouzesh's case last week, writing in his decision that any \" reasonable consumer \" would understand that an iced drink would include ice and, therefore, affects its listed volume. And not only any reasonable consumer, but also most kids who've paid attention in science class or ever poured themselves a cold beverage. \" as young children learn, they can increase the amount of beverage they receive if they order ' no ice, ' \" anderson wrote, adding that \" if children have figured out that including ice in a cold beverage decreases the amount of liquid they will receive, \" forouzesh and other adults should be able to do the same. Anderson also notes that starbucks ' iced drinks come in clear cups, so customers can see exactly how much ice is held within, per grub street. Starbucks isn't off the hook yet, though: there's one other case out of illinois that's going after starbucks for the same icy infraction, plus at least two plaintiffs who say the company rips customers off with its hot coffee drinks, too.",

The dismissal still leaves the near-identical lawsuit filed earlier in illinois, but the company surely welcomes one fewer piece of pending litigation impugning its ice-filling practices. The idea behind plaintiff alexander forouzesh's suit was that starbucks instructs baristas to fill the liquid in iced drinks up to a preset fill line that's not at the top of the cup. The remainder is ice, and that's fraud, he claimed, because beverage sizes don't contain the quantities advertised ( 12 ounces for a tall, 16 ounces for a grande, 24 ounces for a venti ).

        "summary": "Even with a major downturn in the oil business, the united arab emirates still has enough money to look at a few modest construction projects — including building a mountain in the desert. The gulf nation, which is desperately short of rain, has paid $ 400,000 to the colorado-based university corporation for atmospheric research to study the possibility of boosting rainfall with an artificial mountain, arabian business reports. The uae spent $ 558,000 on cloud-seeding, a process meant to increase the amount of rain produced by clouds, last year alone; lead researcher roelof bruintjes explains that a mountain would cause air to rise, creating more clouds to seed, though they're not entirely sure how tall the mountain should be. \" building a mountain is not a simple thing, \" he says. The next step will be to submit the team's plan to an engineering firm. Experts seem to think the idea is as outlandish as it sounds. \" i really doubt that it would work, \" oxford physics professor raymond pierrehumbert tells vocativ. \" you'd need to build a long ridge, not just a cone, otherwise the air would just go around, \" he explains, adding that even if that was possible, under local conditions, \" it's really unlikely to work as there is very little evidence that cloud seeding produces much rainfall. \" he says no mountain will change the fact that the area is a desert, and the uae would be far better off \" putting the money into solar-powered desalination plants. \" exactly how much money the project would cost isn't clear, though the washington post notes that a plan to give the netherlands its first tall mountain had an estimated price tag of up to $ 230 billion — and was only found to be feasible if the mountain was hollow.

Once a new state law takes effect on aug. 1, university president gregory fenves says he ' ll be forced to allow licensed concealed handgun holders 21 and older to bring guns into classrooms. State leaders passed the \" campus carry \" law last year, with gov. Greg abbott noting a licensed carrier could confront a potential shooter and prevent mass death; public universities must comply, though private universities can opt out. Fenves, however, is not on board. \" i do not believe handguns belong on a university campus, so this decision has been the greatest challenge of my presidency, \" he says, per reuters. The university will enforce gun-free zones in areas like most dorm rooms, but guns will be permitted in classrooms. The school expects fewer than 1 % of its 50,000 students will be eligible to carry a concealed weapon, which must be kept unloaded in a holster that protects the trigger, per wtvr and the washington post. But objections have still been plentiful. Fenves says he's heard from outraged students, parents, and professors who fear discussing grades with armed students; at least 280 professors signed a petition condemning the law in october. \" as a professor, i understand the deep concerns raised by so many. However, as president, i have an obligation to uphold the law, \" fenves says. Colorado, idaho, kansas, mississippi, utah, wisconsin, and oregon, also allow students to carry concealed handguns on campuses.

Morrissey, one-time lead singer of the smiths, was picked for the dubious distinction of winning the tongue-in-cheek bad sex in fiction award by britain's literary review magazine for his penguin classic book about four boston relay runners who are cursed by an old man. \" the judges were swayed by an ecstatic scene involving ezra, one of the athletes, and his plucky girlfriend, eliza, \" the judges said, citing a description of the two \" screaming and shouting as they playfully bit and pulled at each other in a dangerous and clamorous rollercoaster coil of sexually violent rotation... \" the review, which announced the prize"

        "summary": "Brad pitt and angelina jolie supposedly had a crazy fight about their kids while aboard a plane right before jolie filed for divorce, citing \" the health of the family \" as her reason. Now, sources are going into more detail about the parenting problems that supposedly caused the split. For one thing, it seems pitt wanted the children to have a home base in new orleans and attend one school there, while jolie preferred to bring them along on all sorts of globetrotting adventures while home-schooling them. Pitt was also the stricter of the two parents, although \" he's not a drill sergeant, \" a source tells us. He just got mad about \" regular fatherly things, \" like the kids not going to bed on time or not putting their things away. \" brad teaches them to be respectful human beings. Angelina lets the kids run around and behave badly, \" says another source. But a source on jolie's side says that pitt is \" a big yeller, \" including yelling at the kids, and that \" there were a few times angie said she was terrified. \" as us points out, sources said in the past — before the divorce — that brad and angie had \" heated, screaming fights \" about how to parent their six children. La county's department of children and family services is investigating the alleged plane incident, and people reports that pitt is cooperating and took a voluntary drug test, which tmz notes was not officially required for the dcfs investigation. Another source on pitt's side tells us that jolie had been unhappy for a while, and the plane fight just gave her a way to get out of the marriage and \" destroy \" pitt.

Although israel refers to the city of jerusalem as its capital, most other nations, including the us, don't, choosing to keep embassies in tel aviv instead. But trump reportedly told netanyahu all that would change if he makes it into the white house, noting that \" jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the jewish people for over 3,000 years \" and that the us, \" under a trump administration, will … recognize jerusalem as the undivided capital of the state of israel, \" according to a statement from trump's campaign, per al jazeera. Reuters notes that the palestinians want to claim east jerusalem — which israel nabbed in the 1967 war and annexed in 1980 — for themselves for when they eventually set up their own state next to israel. But in the private meeting with netanyahu, trump is said to have noted that \" israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of islamic terrorism \" and that \" peace will only come when the palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept israel as a jewish state. \" what trump is using to back up his push: a law passed by congress in 1995 that called for all of jerusalem to be recognized as israel's capital, though al jazeera points out no president from either major party has ever put the law into effect, as it would cut into the executive branch's sway over foreign policy.",

It says that comey wrote seven memos in all and that four of them have information deemed classified by the fbi. One key point that's unclear: whether the information was classified when comey wrote the memos or was labeled so after the fact. The fbi showed the documents to congress over the past week, and the report is based on anonymous officials who saw the markings. \" james comey leaked classified information to the media, \" trump tweeted monday, after seeing a report on fox news. \" that is so illegal! \" in his testimony before congress, comey said he gave one of his memos to a professor friend at columbia university and instructed him to give it to a reporter because he thought it would make it more likely that a special prosecutor would be appointed. ( that's exactly what happened. ) the hill notes that comey famously criticized hillary clinton for careless handling of classified information and now is likely to face the scrutiny of congressional investigators for the same thing. However, the daily caller notes that the implications for comey are unclear because, as fbi chief, he would have had the authority to classify or declassify documents. And another complicating factor is that he had the documents after he was fired from the agency, as a private citizen.",

        "summary": "A broken door handle proved deadly for two women in the czech republic on saturday. Police say a mother and daughter, ages 65 and 45, died after becoming trapped in their friend's sauna for roughly 90 minutes. A police rep who spoke about the freak accident — which the afp reports happened near jicin, to the northeast of prague — says it appears the women were unable to exit the sauna after the handle broke, and their attempts to break the door's window were unsuccessful. Their friend found them on the floor after noting the time and deciding to check on them. While sauna deaths are rare, they do occur: a 2008 study published in the journal of forensic sciences looked at sauna-related fatalities between 1990 and 2002 in finland and found an annual death rate of less than two per 100,000 inhabitants. The study found heat exposure was behind a quarter of the deaths. Saunas and finland were under the microscope once again in 2010, when a finalist at the world sauna championships there collapsed and died after spending six minutes in a 230-degree fahrenheit sauna. While such temperatures might seem uncommon outside of finland, an organizer told the bbc at the time that \" it is not so unusual \" here. The competition was permanently ended due to russian vladimir ladyzhensky's death. The temperature of the sauna the women were using in the czech republic hasn't been reported.

        "summary": "The rate at which women die in texas from pregnancy-related complications is higher than in any other us state — or even in the rest of the developed world, reports the guardian. A study in the journal obstetrics and gynecology found that the maternal mortality rate in texas doubled in a two-year span, from about 18 per 100,000 births in 2010 — a year with 72 deaths — to about 36 in 2012, which saw 148 deaths. In the 48 states not including texas and california, the rate was 23.8 deaths per 100,000 in 2014, up 27 % from 18.8 in 2000. California was the only state to see a drop. The authors say the hike in the death rate in texas — no other state saw a similar uptick — is difficult to explain \" in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, \" per the guardian. The huffington post notes the rise coincided with the state slashing health care funding for women. Women's health advocates blame a republican-led state legislature that gutted texas ' family-planning funding by two-thirds — $ 73.6 million out of its $ 111.5 million was cut in 2011, the year that maternal deaths spiked — forcing the shuttering of 80 clinics that provided birth control, cancer screenings, and other services. Dr. Lisa hollier, who heads a state task force looking into the problem, told the dallas morning news that they don't \" have a specific answer at this time. \" dr. Daniel grossman of the university of texas at austin called the study findings a \" tragedy \" and an \" embarrassment \" and told the morning news, \" this is a problem we should be able to address and fix. \"",

Similarly, the rate in texas jumped from 18 deaths per 100,000 births in 2006 to 36 deaths per 100,000 births in 2014.

            "The pregnancy-related death rate in texas nearly doubled between 2010 and 2012 ― the same time period that the state severely cut women's health funding, most notably at planned parenthood, according to a new study. The research, which will be published in the september issue of the journal obstetrics and gynecology, found that 148 texas women died in 2012 from pregnancy-related causes, either while pregnant, or soon after being pregnant, up from 72 deaths in 2010. Similarly, the rate in texas jumped from 18 deaths per 100,000 births in 2006 to 36 deaths per 100,000 births in 2014. But sadly, texas is just an extreme snapshot of the united states ' bigger maternal mortality problem. The u.s.

The incident, which took place at a meijer pharmacy in petoskey, prompted the aclu to file a complaint with the chain, saying 35-year-old peterson was the victim of sex discrimination. In addition to being used to treat miscarriages, misoprostol is also commonly used to treat ulcers. \" had the customer been a man prescribed the same medication … the pharmacist would have filled it, \" the aclu says in a statement. When combined with another drug, per the free press, misoprostol can be used to cause an abortion. Upon learning that she had miscarried, peterson declined more invasive procedures and opted to let her body complete the miscarriage on its own. After that took longer than expected, her doctor prescribed misoprostol. She says she went as far as to divulge to the pharmacist that the fetus was not viable, per the aclu statement, but the pharmacist accused her of lying. Per michigan live, meijer does allow pharmacists to refuse to fill a prescription based on religious beliefs. However, the policy is to then have another pharmacist handle it or transfer it to another pharmacy. The pharmacist refused even that, says peterson, who eventually did get the medication she needed from a different pharmacy. Meijer reportedly declined to comment on the specifics of this case.

        "summary": "Humans are the only animal known to develop alzheimer's disease, and an official diagnosis requires checking off this list of three things: dementia, which is observed through screenings, and two pathologic markers — amyloid plaques ( sticky bunches of misfolded proteins ) and neurofibrillary tangles ( tau proteins clumped together and twisted around ). While amyloid plaques have been found in several species of aging primates, the tau tangles found in people have never been spotted outside of humans — until now. Reporting in the journal neurobiology of aging, researchers say they've discovered them in our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Since chimps were declared endangered in the us in 2015, research on them has been dramatically restricted, and invasive research is banned, making mri scans on aging chimps unlikely. But a new center that obtains the brains of chimps who died at zoos or research centers enabled this study, reports science. Twenty brains that belonged to chimps who'd died between the ages of 37 and 62 ( the latter is about 120 in human years ) were analyzed; 13 had amyloid plaques and four of those had tau tangles. Still, chimps don't display severe dementia. \" they're missing something, \" an outside neuropathologist tells scientific american. It's possible the proteins are folded differently to protect them, which has the potential to inform human treatment. At the very least, they're the only other animal known to display alzheimer's pathologic signature. ( many people being treated for alzheimer's may not have it. )",

Whether chimps actually succumb to alzheimer's or are immune from symptoms despite having the key brain abnormalities is not clear. But either way, the work suggests that chimps could help scientists better understand the disease and how to fight it — if they could get permission to do such studies on these now-endangered animals. A definitive diagnosis of alzheimer's includes dementia and two distortions in the brain: amyloid plaques, sticky accumulations of misfolded pieces of protein known as amyloid beta peptides; and neurofibrillary tangles, formed when proteins called tau clump into long filaments that twist around each other like ribbons. Many other primates including rhesus monkeys, baboons, and gorillas also acquire plaques with aging, but tau tangles are either absent in those species or don't fully resemble those seen in humans. In the new study, researchers led by biological anthropologist mary ann raghanti at kent state university in ohio turned to our closest relative, chimpanzees. In 2015, the u.s. Fish and wildlife service declared all u.s. Chimps endangered, effectively ending all invasive research on them. But thanks to a",
            "Aged chimpanzees develop brain characteristics that are similar — but not identical — to those seen in early alzheimer's disease in humans, researchers report on august 1 in neurobiology of aging1. The findings from humanity's closest relatives could help researchers to understand why people develop dementia, as well as suggest that caretakers of aging, captive chimpanzees watch them closely for behavioural changes. Although most animals ' cognitive abilities decline late in life, only people seem to develop alzheimer's disease, which can result in severe dementia symptoms. The brains of people with alzheimer's show several signs of the disease: plaques made of a protein called amyloid-β, tangles of a protein called tau and the loss of neurons. Humans were thought to be the only primates with brains that can contain plaques and tangles simultaneously — although one study did find both markers in a single chimp brain2. Using a collection of chimpanzee brains that has been compiled over several decades, a team led by mary ann raghanti, a biological anthropologist at kent state university in ohio, analysed the brains of 20 aged chimps that had died between 37 and 62 years of age. The team examined the brain regions that are damaged in people with alzheimer's — such as the memory-forming hippocampus — and found that four of the preserved chimp brains contained both plaques"

In the new study, researchers led by biological anthropologist mary ann raghanti at kent state university in ohio turned to our closest relative, chimpanzees. In 2015, the u.s. Fish and wildlife service declared all u.s. Chimps endangered, effectively ending all invasive research on them. But thanks to a",
            "Aged chimpanzees develop brain characteristics that are similar — but not identical — to those seen in early alzheimer's disease in humans, researchers report on august 1 in neurobiology of aging1. The findings from humanity's closest relatives could help researchers to understand why people develop dementia, as well as suggest that caretakers of aging, captive chimpanzees watch them closely for behavioural changes. Although most animals ' cognitive abilities decline late in life, only people seem to develop alzheimer's disease, which can result in severe dementia symptoms. The brains of people with alzheimer's show several signs of the disease: plaques made of a protein called amyloid-β, tangles of a protein called tau and the loss of neurons. Humans were thought to be the only primates with brains that can contain plaques and tangles simultaneously — although one study did find both markers in a single chimp brain2. Using a collection of chimpanzee brains that has been compiled over several decades, a team led by mary ann raghanti, a biological anthropologist at kent state university in ohio, analysed the brains of 20 aged chimps that had died between 37 and 62 years of age. The team examined the brain regions that are damaged in people with alzheimer's — such as the memory-forming hippocampus — and found that four of the preserved chimp brains contained both plaques"

If campos hoped this would deflect attention, it seems to be having the opposite effect.

Its conclusion: there's a world of difference between \" vanishing \" and merely withdrawing from the public eye, and it puts campos in the latter category. Campos \" is not missing, \" a vegas police officer tells the website, sounding frustrated at some wild conspiracy theories surfacing. \" he's not under arrest. \" campos is the security guard who was shot by vegas gunman stephen paddock on the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay hotel. Police initially said campos had been shot in the hallway outside paddock's room six minutes prior to paddock's larger shooting spree — the unarmed campos was praised as a hero — but authorities later revised the timeline to say that he had been shot about the same time paddock began shooting at concert fans. Campos was going to address his role and any interaction with paddock last thursday in a spate of media interviews, but he abruptly canceled, and campos ' union president ( who was helping coordinate the interviews ) says he was told only that campos ended up in a walk-in medical clinic. Reporters say a security guard is now parked outside campos ' home, and neighbors haven't seen him. \" he's a hero, \" one neighbor tells the los angeles times, \"and nobody knows where he is. \"",

Heritage auctions is now auctioning the 2-foot-long, 200-pound slab engraved in a samaritan script, though the commandments aren't exactly as you know them today. Rather than \" thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain, \" the slab — believed to be up to 1,700 years old — includes a commandment to worship on mount gerizim, viewed as sacred in the samaritan sect of judaism, reports live science. Not much is known about the history of the slab before it was discovered near yavne, israel, in 1913 and given to a man who placed it in his courtyard, where it was trampled by decades of guests walking on it, per the washington post. However, heritage auctions says it likely stood at the entrance to a synagogue — possibly later destroyed by romans, byzantines, or crusaders — before the 12th century. It was eventually sold to an archaeologist in 1943 and is now owned by rabbi saul deutsch of the living torah museum in new york, reports cnn. \" its surface is worn, battered and encrusted in places, but running a gloved finger over it does produce, in some people, a particular thrill of touching a piece of bible history, \" an auction rep says.

            "Although retailers have started creeping into thanksgiving by pushing black friday openings earlier and earlier, a new huffpost/yougov poll finds that a big majority of americans think retailers should stay closed on thanksgiving so workers can have the day off. According to the new poll, 62 percent of americans think businesses should close on thanksgiving so workers can have the day off, while only 27 percent said that they think stores should feel free to stay open if there is demand for it. That makes opening for thanksgiving only slightly more popular than opening for christmas. A huffpost/yougov poll conducted last december found that 70 percent of americans think businesses should close on christmas so workers can have the day off, and only 22 percent think businesses should remain open.

Their verdict on some of the more controversial claims: donald trump: \" her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes..... We ' ll have a massive, massive tax increase under hillary clinton's plan. \" abc news rates this \" mostly false, \" noting that clinton has talked about raising the taxes of high earners, but none of her proposals involve doubling anybody's taxes. Donald trump: \" we've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore. \" the new york times says \" no, no, no \" to this: some 10 million more americans have jobs since president obama took office, and manufacturing output is at an all-time high. Hillary clinton: \" what i have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt. \" false, according to abc: estimates vary, but most analysts agree that debt will go up under her economic plan, with the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget putting the figure at $ 200 billion over a decade. Donald trump: \" hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. \" wrong, according to politico's wrongometer: clinton supports deferred action plans, not full amnesty — and in the leaked speech extract trump was apparently referring to, clinton was talking about open borders for energy. Donald trump: \" clinton flip-flopped on the trans-pacific partnership. \" he's right on this one, according to the guardian: she praised the trade deal on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2014, then opposed it as a presidential candidate. Hillary clinton: trump bought chinese steel for the trump international hotel in las vegas. Correct, according to the times: reports state that trump used steel and aluminum for projects including the vegas hotel, which was completed in 2008. Donald trump: \" when you ran the state department, $ 6 billion was missing... It is gone. $ 6 billion. \" the washington post took a thorough look at this claim last week. It concluded that the figure trump is referring to comes from a 2014 management alert. No money was stolen or misplaced, but auditors found that there were paperwork problems like incomplete files on deals worth around $ 6 billion, largely deals in iraq dating back to the george w.

The guide leading her group had said to keep an eye out for the swimmers, per the bradenton herald. But when one came into view, its reaction was unexpected. \" all of a sudden [ the otter ] jumped on the kayak and two seconds later he jumped on me, \" 77-year-old spector tells fox 13. Hearing her screams, spector's husband, who was kayaking ahead, flipped his boat. \" i was in the water with a paddle, just trying to beat the otter off her back, \" the 78-year-old says. \" it didn't want to come off! \" spector says she also hit the otter with a paddle before her own kayak turned over. After a tussle in the water, the animal released its grip, leaving spector with bite and scratch marks on her arms and nose, and, according to her guide, an earlobe dangling. Spector was taken to a hospital, where she received stitches and rabies treatment — a second woman who was scratched also received treatment — but spector thinks she was lucky. A life jacket protected her back from the otter's claws, and \" by some miracle, i don't have any injuries on the top of my head, \" spector says, noting the hat she was wearing was left in tatters. Guide marsha wikle says she's never witnessed such aggressive behavior in otters, which normally shy away from humans. But the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission says it received a report of two people bitten by an otter a day before the attack on spector, some 2 miles away. Reports also described an otter chasing boats, per the herald. Fwc officials are searching for the otter and plan to post notices warning visitors to the area.

The los angeles times revisits the shepherds, a family of four who experienced tragedy in their attempt to flee their mendocino county home — and then still more tragedy. Kai shepherd, 14, was found dead by a neighbor some 50 feet from his mother, sara, and 17-year-old sister, kressa; both the women were burned over more than 60 % of their bodies.

The parents are being treated at different hospitals — sara at the uc davis medical center in sacramento and jon at st. Francis memorial hospital in san francisco — and are expected to survive. But they've been largely sedated, have said only a few words over the last month, and have not been told about their children. Mindi ramos tells the times that sara, her sister, is \" forlorn and melancholy... There is a spot on her forehead that didn't get burned, and i touch that all the time. \" the family's hope is that jon can be moved to sacramento before his nov. 13 birthday so the couple of 25 years can deal with their heartache together.

The 23-year-old is a supermodel in pakistan, and she's been jailed in the country since march 14 following her arrest at the islamabad airport. The bbc reports she was carrying a suitcase that contained roughly $ 500,000, an amount hugely in excess of the $ 10,000 limit on cash being taken out of the country. A charge of money laundering followed; she's being held in adiala jail in rawalpindi, bail was denied, and prosecutors say a conviction could bring her as many as 14 years in jail. The bbc reports that ali says she had no idea the rule existed. And she didn't plan to take the money out of the country anyway, according to one of her lawyers. The guardian shares khurram latif khosa's explanation: that the money was the result of a legal property sale, and that she hadn't checked in to her flight but was in the vip lounge; he says she planned to meet her brother there, and that he was going to take the money to karachi. He also reportedly said that the courts and media weren't treating her well. The bbc reports the media have been in a frenzy over whether she's being given preferential treatment, citing one report that referenced a prison-jammer-proof cellphone and a room with a tv. But the bbc's reporter says jail officials told him she's being treated in accordance with jail rules, and is held in a block with 10 other women.",

The court heard his deathbed allegations this morning. The 43-year-old litvinenko had been a kgb officer who fled russia for the uk in 2000 and then became a fierce critic of the kremlin. He died 22 days after having tea at a posh hotel with two russians, andrei lugovoi and dmitri kovtun, both of whom are expected to testify by video. The kremlin has long denied any role in his death. The bbc, meanwhile, reports that the poisoning via a radioactive isotope called polonium 210 may have actually been the third such attempt on litvinenko's life using polonium.",

He was shot again. \" the event was hosted by the american freedom defense initiative, which offered $ 10,000 for the best cartoon depicting the prophet, the ap reports. After the shooting, dozens of attendees were taken to a separate location and briefly questioned by the fbi. The injured guard was shot in the leg and has now been released from the hospital, cnn reports.

Its aim is to teach students to be happier. Sternbergh took the course himself and found it useful, and he suggests that it might better be called \" what is happiness, why aren't you happy, and what can you do to change that? \" that's because santos delves into not just the science of happiness, but the practice of it. Think of it as exercise. \" the thing that makes this course different is that we also focus on what i call ' behavior change ' — the science of how you move your behavior around, \" santos tells her students. All students must start with this survey to help determine their baseline happiness. Then comes the process in which students essentially \" rewire \" their brains. \" throughout the class, students use a rewi app specially developed for the course to alter their behavior and enhance their well-being, \" writes sternbergh. \" they aren't tests per se but exercises designed for self-betterment: keep a daily gratitude journal for seven days; take a survey to determine your signature strengths; get at least seven hours of sleep for three days in a row. \" the story digs into how the course shows that most people overvalue money and undervalue time. One day, for example, santos has the students show up to class, only to learn that it's been canceled. The catch is that they must spend spend the free hour not catching up on work but doing something unexpected for pleasure. One time-crunched student began to cry at the news.

Rezaian, marine veteran amir hekmati, and christian pastor saeed abedini were about to leave tehran — a fourth american had already departed and a fifth had decided to stay in the country — when rezaian's wife, yeganeh salehi, and mother mary rezaian \" disappeared, \" a us official tells the new york times. \" nobody could find them, and they were not answering phones. The iranians then said there were legal issues that would prevent either from leaving the country. \" the lead american negotiator who brokered the swap, which he said included rezaian's family, refused to depart without them. John kerry called the iranian foreign minister, who started investigating. Iran's prosecutor general eventually issued an order allowing the family to leave, but american officials couldn't get in contact with them. \" we started to conclude that mary and yegi were being held to destroy the deal, \" the official says. After a 12-hour delay, they were finally permitted to board a plane bound for geneva, per the guardian. It was \" touch-and-go until the last minute, \" says jason rezaian, who's met with editors in germany, where he's recovering at a military hospital. He says he's \" feeling good \" after 18 months in an iranian prison; at one point, he endured 49 days in solitary confinement, but he found solace reading books, per the washington post. \" i know people are eager to hear from me, but i want to process this for some time, \" he says.",

        "summary": "President obama has promised to remain neutral during the democratic primary, but a number of stories are suggesting that his public comments reveal him to be squarely in camp clinton. In an interview with politico, for instance, obama downplayed the suggestion that bernie sanders is tapping into the same kind of passion that obama himself did in 2008. While praising sanders for his \" full-throated \" support of progressive issues, he added that \" bernie came in with the luxury of being a complete long shot and just letting loose. \" he also likened sanders ' candidacy to a \" bright, shiny object. \" in contrast, \" i think that what hillary presents is a recognition that translating values into governance and delivering the goods is ultimately the job of politics, making a real-life difference to people in their day-to-day lives. I don't want to exaggerate those differences, though, because hillary is really idealistic and progressive. \" read the full interview here. Some takes: \" he couldn't hide his obvious affection for clinton or his implicit feeling that she, not sanders, best understands the unpalatably pragmatic demands of a presidency he likens to the world's most challenging walk-and-chew-gum exercise, \" writes glenn thrush, who conducted the interview for politico. Thrush notes that obama didn't dispute the idea that sanders might be too much of a \" one-issue \" candidate in regard to income inequality. \" make no mistake: obama just tried to undercut bernie sanders, \" reads the headline of a post by greg sargent at the washington post. \" obama is basically trying to pour cold water on the loftiness of sanders ' argument, by nodding to the ' appeal ' of promising another transformative moment, while suggesting that clinton's more constrained view of what can be'delivered ' is more realistic, and that this is actually an attribute that recommends her for the presidency. \" in a piece written before the politico interview, a new york times story observed: \" obama has said he will not endorse a candidate during the primaries; his advisers are careful not to root publicly for anyone. But the white house is working with mrs. Clinton's campaign in ways large and small. Their two staffs consult on issues ranging from the campaign's use of mr.

Only 32 % of $ 8.6 million raised by video-maker invisible children last year went to direct services, \" with much of the rest going to salaries, travel, transport, and film production, \" according to an analysis of public finance reports by student blog visible children. More troubling to critics is the organization's suspected support for military intervention, apparently underscored by a photo of charity founders posing with guns with members of the sudan liberation army, reports abc news. The charity, headquartered in san diego, has posted a lengthy defense against critics on its website. Invisible children is \" faith-based, \" but doesn't want to be defined that way, co-founder jason russell tells abc news. \" we are unorthodox and if you don't accept the unorthodoxy of what we do, then you won't get it, \" he added. He also criticized the \" old model \" of charity fundraising that aims to deliver most donations directly to subjects, rather than more effectively spending money on advocacy. Russell called the gun picture — taken at the 2008 juba peace talks when kony was supposed to sign a peace treaty — a \" joke photo \" for family and friends. But ap photographer glenna gordon tells the washington post that she believes the photo she took smacks of colonialism, and that it \" plays into the myth that invisible children are very much trying to create. \" while no one takes issue with attacking kony, gordon laments the \" emotional manipulation \" and inaccuracies of videos made by the group.",

The ap notes that prosecutors never offered a motive beyond saying hernandez appeared angry with lloyd at a nightclub two nights before the killing. Prosecutors have suggested lloyd may have been killed because he knew too much about hernandez's alleged involvement in a deadly 2012 drive-by shooting that killed two in boston.

Hernandez's lawyer acknowledged his client witnessed the crime but insisted he did not do it. A first-degree murder conviction in massachusetts automatically triggers an appeal to the supreme judicial court. A date for the hernandez appeal wasn't immediately set. Separately, in boston, hernandez is charged with shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado after an encounter at the nightclub cure. According to prosecutors, de abreu accidentally bumped into him at a nightclub, spilling hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was \" trying \" him, and surveillance video outside the club showed hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down."

            "President barack obama's top national security adviser tom donilon is resigning and will be replaced by u.s. Ambassador to the united nations susan rice, marking a significant shakeup to the white house foreign policy team. A white house official confirmed the personnel changes wednesday morning ahead of a planned announcement by the president later in the day. Donilon has been a key foreign policy adviser to obama since he first took office. But the 58-year-old had been expected to depart sometime this year, with rice seen as the likely candidate to replace him. Rice, a close obama confidante, came under withering criticism from republicans as part of the investigations into the deadly attack on a u.s. Compound in benghazi, libya. Rice, relying on talking points from the intelligence community, said in television interviews that the attacks were likely spontaneous, which was later proven incorrect. Obama considered nominating rice as his",
            "Washington — president obama announced on wednesday afternoon that susan e. Rice, the american ambassador to the united nations, would replace tom donilon, who is resigning, as national security adviser in a major shakeup of his foreign-policy inner circle. The appointment, which mr. Obama made in a rose garden ceremony, puts ms. Rice, 48, an outspoken diplomat and a close political ally, at the heart of the administration's foreign-policy apparatus. It is also a defiant gesture to republicans who harshly criticized ms. Rice for presenting an erroneous account of the deadly attacks on the american mission in benghazi, libya. The post of national security adviser, while powerful, does not require senate confirmation. In his announcement, mr. Obama referred to ms. Rice's role as an adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign and praised her work as a key diplomat during his first term. \"with her",

        "summary": "On wednesday afternoon california residents were shocked to learn that a powerful earthquake had supposedly hit the pacific ocean about 10 miles off the coast of santa barbara. They were probably just as surprised to learn a few minutes later that the magnitude 6.8 quake had actually happened in 1925. The los angeles times reports that a staffer at the california institute of technology mistakenly triggered an alert while correcting information about the location of the 92-year-old quake for the us geological survey's earthquake database. An email was then sent out from the usgs email server claiming that the 1925 quake was set to occur on june 29, 2025. The washington post reports that email alert automatically generated a story on the times site through an algorithm called quakebot. The huffpost reports that several automated tweets synced to the usgs server were sent out as well, causing confusion. Usgs corrected the mistake on twitter shortly after the initial alert went out and followed up with a more detailed explanation on its website within a half hour. The times sent out tweets explaining the mistake and blaming the original usgs alert. The paper also tweeted a picture of its front-page coverage of the 1925 santa barbara earthquake, which, it reported at the time, \"demolished or seriously damaged virtually all brick concrete and stone structures in the city, \" \" virtually wrecked \" a famous hotel, and forced the city's 30,000 residents to evacuate their homes and sleep outside.",

The school wants a cut of all the profits apple has made on all those devices, plus interest, which an expert tells cnet could amount to $ 75 million.

This year's global drug survey, with 120,000 participants in 50 countries, found that 0.2 % of more than 12,000 people who reported taking magic mushrooms in 2016 ended up in the emergency room, per the guardian. That's compared to 0.6 % of cannabis users, 1 % of lsd and cocaine users, 1.2 % of people who took mdma or ecstasy, 1.3 % of alcohol consumers, 3 % of people who took synthetic marijuana or \" spice, \" and nearly 5 % of people who took methamphetamine, labeled the most dangerous recreational drug. Drugs like lsd are more potent than magic mushrooms, so \" it's easy to take too much and have an experience beyond the one you were expecting, \" says survey founder adam winstock. That's why users should \" always take a tiny dose to start. \" but in the case of magic mushrooms, \" death from toxicity is almost unheard of, with poisoning with more dangerous fungi being a much greater risk in terms of serious harms, \" winstock says. Magic mushrooms, with the active ingredient psilocybin, do carry risks, though. Users may experience accidental injury, confusion, disorientation, panic attacks, and negative flashbacks, reports inverse. Winstock adds that risk of harm increases when the drug is taken with alcohol or in \" risky or unfamiliar settings. \" ( here's what happened when cancer patients took mushrooms. )",

Republican martha mcsally accused democrat kyrsten sinema of \"treason \" monday night, latching onto recent reports about sinema's comments as an antiwar activist at the end of a contentious, fiery arizona senate debate. Near the end of the hourlong debate, mcsally attacked sinema over the comments from a radio show in 2003, reported last week by cnn. The host made a hypothetical comment about joining the taliban, to which sinema responded: \" i don't care if you want to do that, go ahead. \" story continued below mcsally demanded an apology, accusing her fellow congresswoman of saying \"it's ok to commit treason. \" sinema didn't respond to the attack or explain her past comments, instead accusing mcsally of running a negative campaign by using \"ridiculous attacks and trying to smear my campaign. \" the exchange in monday's debate, the only one scheduled in arizona, epitomized the campaign to replace retiring gop sen.

Kyrsten sinema. \" with her experience and long record of service, martha is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for arizona, \" ducey said in a statement. \" i thank her for taking on this significant responsibility and look forward to working with her and senator-elect sinema to get positive things done. \" mcsally will serve until the 2020 election, when voters will elect someone to serve the final two years of mccain's term. Kyl was appointed after mccain's death from brain cancer in august. He previously served in the senate for arizona and had said he would only commit to serving until the end of 2018. The appointment puts arizona back in the political spotlight just a month after democrats won their first statewide race in a decade.

One woman tells 7 news she spent eight hours cleaning out her backyard only to return to a waist-high tangle the next day. The weeds don't pose a fire hazard and likely aren't harmful to animals once dried, but the clean-up is \" physically draining and mentally more draining, \" a local says. \" it makes it difficult to get the car out in the morning — if you can find it, \" a man adds, per australia's abc news.

Ozbilici initially thought it a \" theatrical flourish. \" quite the contrary: ozbilici counts 8 gunshots total, some of which killed russia's ambassador to turkey, andrei karlov, 62. The ap reports the gunman has been identified as a police officer named mevlut mert altintas; he was killed in an ensuing shootout. Reuters cites a tweet from the ankara mayor stating the gunman was 22 and off-duty. A witness says he was behind karlov as the ambassador gave a speech and shot him from behind. One take on the implications, from the stratfor think-tank via reuters: \" the attack comes at a bad time: moscow and ankara have only recently restored diplomatic ties after turkey downed a russian aircraft in november 2015. Though the attack will strain relations between the two countries, it is not likely to rupture them altogether. \" in a piece at slate titled in part \" the russian ambassador to turkey isn't franz ferdinand, \" joshua keating agrees, suggesting the attack will serve as \" a pretext for closer cooperation rather than conflict. \" indeed, in televised comments reports by the guardian, vladimir putin swung not at turkey, instead calling \" the crime...

Then this year it moved 60 feet in a few months and 60 feet in a single day. Now it's menacing pricey fiber-optic cables, a petroleum pipeline, a union pacific freight rail track, and part of highway 111. \" it's a slow-moving disaster, \" a california fire and emergency official tells the la times. Imperial county even declared an emergency this year to curb the slow one, to no avail. Union pacific constructed a 100-foot-long, 75-foot-deep underground wall of steel and boulders, but the slow one just bubbled under it, approaching the tracks. Now union pacific has built temporary tracks on safer land and officials say part of highway 111, which links the cali-mexico border to interstate 110, could get shut down. What's more, the slow one smells like eggs and would suffocate any unlucky person who tumbles into the 40-foot-deep sinkhole. Also called the niland geyser, it runs about 80 degrees fahrenheit thanks to bubbling carbon dioxide. \" it's a quirky thing, \" says geophysicist david lynch, who has studied the mud spring. \" if there was no railroad nearby, you wouldn't even know about it. This would just be something out there chewing out the desert. \" ( one geyser erupted and poured out trash dating to the 1930s. )",
