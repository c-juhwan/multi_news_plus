He found that the most efficient boarding method is to board alternate rows at a time, beginning with the window seats on one side, then the other, minimizing aisle interference. The window seats are followed by alternate rows of middle seats, then aisle seats. He also found that boarding at random is faster that boarding by blocks. The results of his study were published in the journal of air transport management in 2008, with steffen claiming the airline industry could save massive sums with more efficient boarding.

            "Not to be confused with monte carlo algorithm probabilistic problem-solving algorithm monte carlo methods ( or monte carlo experiments ) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: [ 1 ] optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution. In physics-related problems, monte carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures ( see cellular potts model, interacting particle systems, mckean-vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases ). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in maths, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems ( space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc. ) problems, monte carlo – based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \" soft \" methods",

The patent describes an adhesive layer that \" may be a very sticky material and operate in a manner similar to flypaper, or double-sided duct tape, \" designed to prevent pedestrians from further injury, the san jose mercury news reports. The technology, which will also work on ordinary cars, will bring both the vehicle and the pedestrian to a \" more gradual stop than if the pedestrian bounces off the vehicle, \" the patent states. The sticky stuff will be under an eggshell-like layer so it won't end up covered in insects during everyday vehicle use. The idea sounds like it has the potential to prevent injuries, american physical society spokeswoman rebecca thompson tells gizmodo. \" getting hit by a car once is much preferable to getting hit by a car and then the ground and then another car, \" she says. \" cyclists wear helmets not as much to prevent their head's impact with the car as much as their head's impact with the ground when they fall. \" a google spokeswoman declined to say whether the company really plans to introduce the system to its fleet. The company holds patents \" on a variety of ideas, \" she says: \" some of those ideas later mature into real products and services, some don't. \" ( glue may not be much help if you're hit by one of the self-driving big rigs a former google engineer is working on. )",

While schools attempt to lessen the load by offering financial aid, average student debt appears to be climbing. So some institutions are also responding by beefing up their mental health services to help students cope with life in the red. \"we're worried about one type of debt — student debt — and we want to know how to pay it off as quickly as possible, \" said dillon collet, who is about to enter his final year at the university of toronto's faculty of law and sat on the dean's advisory committee on financial aid.

Starting tuesday, people who borrowed money to finance their higher education will not have to pay back their government loans until their yearly earnings exceed $ 25,000, ctv news reported. It's part of the canada student loans program's repayment assistance plan. \" the future prosperity of our country depends on young canadians getting the education and training needed to succeed in the job market, \" maryann mihychuk, the minister of employment, workforce development and labor, said in a news release published sunday. \" as a result of this new measure, students will be better positioned to transition into the workforce after graduation. \" in addition to the $ 25,000 rule, the government announced that people who are having trouble paying off their debt can also request smaller monthly payments — or have them suspended entirely"

Archaeologists who've uncovered the remains of boys, girls, and 200 young llamas killed with cuts across the sternum say it's evidence of the largest known mass child sacrifice anywhere in the world. It dwarfs the ritual killings of 42 children previously uncovered in the aztec capital of tenochtitlán, now mexico city, reports national geographic. It wouldn't have been pretty: archaeologists say both animal and human victims, aged 5 to 14, had their chests cut open, possibly as a means of getting at the heart. As for the why, el nino factors into a leading theory. Archaeologists say a layer of mud at the site of huanchaquito-las llamas, less than a mile from the chimu capital of chan chan, suggests the area was experiencing torrential rains related to el nino at the time of the sacrifice between 1400 and 1450. Since elevated sea temperatures and coastal flooding linked to el nino could've affected both fishing and agriculture, archaeologists suspect the chimu got desperate. \" they may have seen that [ adult sacrifice ] was ineffective \" and \" people sacrifice that which is of most and greatest value to them, \" anthropologist haagen klaus, who was not involved in the excavation, tells natgeo. The skulls — marked with a red ceremonial pigment, per the washington post — indicate victims came from across chimu's territory, reports newsweek. ( this teen might've been sacrificed to zeus. )",

        "summary": "If north koreans living along the country's demilitarization zone with south korea don't yet know that their leader's half-brother was assassinated this week, they probably will soon. South korea announced plans thursday to broadcast news of kim jong nam's death on loudspeakers aimed across its border with north korea, reports chosun ilbo. A military official said \" north koreans will be quite shocked \" by the news since nam was the \" eldest descendant \" of north korea's founder, kim il sung. South korea has previously used the speakers to broadcast anti-pyongyang propaganda and world news up to 15 miles away. Meanwhile, malaysian officials say north korea has filed a request to claim kim's body, per the guardian. However, the officials say the body won't be released without a dna sample of a family member. Kim is thought to have six children, but the washington post reports that no relative has emerged to claim or even identify the body. North korean officials are also said to have tried unsuccessfully to prevent an autopsy on kim. No results have been released, but he is believed to have been poisoned. Three people have been arrested, including an indonesian woman who may have thought she was participating in a prank.",

        "summary": "Russia may soon have a president with a \" stylish white eye. \" not vladimir putin, but alexei navalny, a russian opposition leader who made the joke after a not-so-funny incident last week that may leave him partially blind. The new york times reports navalny was attacked thursday in moscow by a perpetrator who came up to him, threw green liquid in his face, then ran off. Navalny says his doctor told him he suffered a chemical burn and has lost 80 % sight in his right eye, which may get better with treatment. The los angeles times notes navalny, who's planning on running for president next year, was leaving his office at the anti-corruption foundation, a russian ngo, when he was assaulted with the liquid, which he at first thought was the harmless antiseptic \" zelyonka \" ( meaning \" brilliant green, \" per the bbc ), a fluid called the \" russian green dye weapon of choice \" by the inverse. Zelyonka is often used by russian government supporters against critics, and it's usually harmless unless consumed by mouth. But navalny said his doctor told him another \" caustic chemical \" had been mixed in, leading to his injuries. Even though local cops say they're looking into the incident, navalny says they're dragging their feet. He's keeping a stiff upper lip, though. He appeared on his youtube channel just hours after the attack, and he posted a series of images sunday on his blog that showed movie characters who also sport odd ocular organs. He also offered a mock-up of himself as the main character from the terminator. Meanwhile, per reuters, a senior russian election official told ria that navalny can't run for president until he gets an embezzlement conviction nixed on further appeal — a case navalny says is sabotage.

        "summary": "The supreme court has struck down a century-old minnesota law banning political apparel at polling places. In a 7-2 ruling, the court said the law was written too broadly to be reasonably enforced without violating first amendment rights, reports bloomberg. All states regulate political apparel at polling sites, but only 10 states have rules so broad that just about anything can be deemed as political. Minnesota's law bans issue-oriented messages as well as \" material promoting a group with recognizable political views, \" per usa today. The court supported the idea that voters should not be subjected to intimidating political statements but said minnesota's law was so broad that it could be interpreted to include harmless or non-political messages, per politico. In short, the rules must be specific. \" if a state wishes to set its polling places apart as areas free of partisan discord, \" chief justice john roberts wrote for the court's majority, \"it must employ a more discernible approach than the one minnesota has offered here. \" roberts used the example of a voter entering a polling place wearing a boy scout leaders ' uniform, back when the scouts were under fire for excluding members based on sexual orientation. Justices sonia sotomayor and stephen breyer dissented and argued that minnesota's top court should have ruled on the law's constitutionality before the supreme court ruling. The lawsuit was filed by a voter who went to the polls in 2010 wearing a \"please i.d. Me \" button and a t-shirt with the message: \" don't tread on me. \" the voter was initially turned away but was eventually allowed to vote.",

So far 152 residents in tiny kalachi have fallen ill with the mystery sickness, which comes with symptoms like memory loss, nausea, dizziness, and debilitating headaches. \" headaches — that's not the word, \" says a male villager who passed out last august while riding his motorcycle, but wasn't injured, the guardian reports. \" for six weeks, i didn't know where to put myself. It strongly affects your mentality. I ' m very on edge. \" and even though the illness was first officially recorded in 2013, scientists haven't decided what it is. Local officials say they've ruled out two possible culprits — carbon monoxide poisoning and radon, a radioactive gas — yet a federal official says some affected houses had co levels 10 times higher than is recommended. Others point to a soviet-era, abandoned uranium mine just outside kalachi: \" radon could be operating as a narcotic substance or an anesthetic, \" a russian scientist tells newsweek. \" currently, the underground space of the mine is flooded and gases are being squeezed to the surface. \" meanwhile, authorities are offering residents \" voluntary relocation \" to a presumably safer area, but only about 100 have accepted so far. \" they say it affects the brain; they say it gives people headaches, \" a villager says of the sickness, \" but our headache now is where we're being resettled. \" ( now read about a mystery disease affecting only one family on the planet. )",

Brent brisben, captain of the salvage ship that found the sunken treasure, tells cbs news the timing was \" magical \" and \" surreal. \" a lot more people might call it lucky. Brisben and his crew found the booty july 30 and july 31 off the coast of vero beach in just six feet of water. \" people freak out that we're literally 10 to 15 feet of the beach, \" brisben tells the florida newspaper.

        "summary": "Nobel week is upon us again, having kicked off monday with the award for medicine. Scientific american compiled a dozen surprising facts about the history of the prizes, established by the wealthy swedish industrialist who happened to invent dynamite. Here are six standouts from its list: 860 laureates and 25 organizations have won the nobel prize between 1901 and 2014, and four laureates won twice. Linus pauling, however, stands alone as the only person to win an unshared nobel twice — first in 1954 in chemistry, and second in 1962 in peace, per the nobel foundation. Three winners were in prison when they won. German journalist carl von ossietzky, burmese politician aung san suu kyi, and chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo all won the peace prize. Only two prizes have been sold during a laureate's life, and both in the past year. One was 1988 physics winner, leon lederman, who auctioned his prize for $ 765,000 to cover medical expenses. The average age of nobel laureates is 59, with the oldest winner being leonid hurwicz, who won in economics in 2007 at the age of 90. The youngest winner, malala yousafzai, won the peace prize in 2014 at 17. It can take decades to be recognized — two to three on average. But in 1966, peyton rous won the medicine prize for work he did 50 years earlier on viruses that can cause tumors. After awarding the prize to two dead people, the nobel foundation decided in the 1970s to no longer hand out prizes posthumously. But in 2011, ralph steinman won the prize in medicine three days after he died — the judges hadn't known, and decided to let it stand. For the full list, head over to scientific american.",

Laureates can't speak off the cuff during the awards ceremony banquet, according to 2013 nobelist randy schekman who won for his research into cellular transport. He says the text for that speech must be turned in to the nobel foundation more than 24 hours in advance to allow for translation into swedish. 2. Doing time. Three laureates were in prison when they received the award, all of them winners of the nobel peace prize. German pacifist and journalist carl von ossietzky in 1935, burmese politician aung san suu kyi in 1991 and chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo in 2010. 3. How much is it worth? physics winner leon lederman, who won in 1988 for his co-discovery of the muon neutrino, sold his nobel earlier this year to cover medical care expenses. The buyer, whose identity was not released by the auction house, paid $ 765,000 for it. Only two nobels have ever been sold during a winner's life. Both such sales occurred in the past year. 4. Return policy. Russian billionaire alisher usmanov paid $ 4.7 million to buy the gold nobel medal awarded to biologist james watson for his work deciphering dna's double helix, but he then gave the medal back to the laureate. Usmanov said the medal should remain with the winner and that the monies he paid for it should go toward research. 5. Pesky security.

        "summary": "President trump is stepping up his message on immigration before the midterms in a big way with a tweeted video about an undocumented immigrant who killed two law enforcement officers in 2014. The ad centers on luis bracamontes, who was in the country illegally when he killed the officers in california and is now on death row, reports the sacramento bee. \" illegal immigrant, luis bracamontes, killed our people! \" reads text on the ad, which shows an unrepentant bracamontes smiling in court and promising to kill more officers if he gets out. He had been deported twice before his killing spree. \" democrats let him into our country, \" reads the ad, which combines images of bracamontes with others that appear to be of migrant caravans heading to the us and was made for the trump campaign, per cnn. \" it is outrageous what the democrats are doing to our country, \" wrote trump. \" vote republican now! \" as the washington post notes, the ad is drawing comparisons to the infamous willie horton ad, featuring a black prisoner who murdered a woman while on furlough, that doomed michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential election. \" this may be the most desperate and vile ad since willie horton, \" tweets former clinton labor secretary robert reich. Other critics point out that the ad doesn't talk about white men who commit mass murder, including the alleged pittsburgh synagogue shooter. Bracamontes has been used by the trump campaign before, including in an ad named \" complicit \" earlier this year that also accused democrats of being lax on immigration. ( trump hinted at the legal strategy he might use on birthright citizenship. )",

Has tried seven times to stem the leak since october, first by pumping in heavy mud to plug a suspected hole in a casing that surrounds a pipe. Instead, the mud has been pushed back up by the pressurized gas, resulting in a huge crater around the wellhead that makes it more vulnerable. Now, per the times, socal gas is hoping relief wells will fix the problem, though it will take at least six weeks to reach the base of the well 1.6 miles below the surface. The leak, as of early january, had released more than 77 million kilograms of methane into the air, sickening people up to a mile away and blanketing residential areas with the rotten egg smell added to natural gas. And on at least 14 occasions, air samples have revealed airborne levels of cancer-causing benzene higher than what socal gas reported, according to ap. The company blames an \" oversight \" and says the problem has been fixed. While concern has been focused on the areas closet to the well, one analysis revealed elevated methane levels up to eight miles away, gizmodo reports. ( gov.

The washington post reports brian mcmonagle spoke to the jury for two hours, \" flipping between stage-whispered intimacy and earsplitting verbal explosions. \" he called constand a liar and pushed the jury to view what happened between cosby and constand as just one consensual night in a year-long relationship. The los angeles times quotes mcmonagle like so: \" ' yeah, it was romantic; yeah, he was giving me sweaters; yeah, he was telling me how to wear my hair, ' he said, mimicking constands ' voice. \" in that same vein, deadline notes mcmonagle acknowledged the presence of wife camille cosby, making her first appearance of the trial. \" when you dance outside your marriage, you got to pay the band. And he danced and she deserved better, \" mcmonagle said as he pointed at camille. The ap reports she had no reaction over the two hours, but smiled when the closing argument concluded. The washington post notes mcmonagle apologized for his own \" irish-italian \" temper, and the new york post elaborates with a longer quote from him: \" i pray to god you ' ll do your job better than i did mine. If during the course of this trial i have said or done anything that might have offended one of you, hold it against me, not him. Me — not him. I wear my emotions on my sleeve and that's not good for a lawyer. \" the prosecution will present its closing argument next, and the ap reports the case could go to the jury today.

It's written on the other side of a receipt, possibly for paying a grain tax in the ancient egyptian village of tertembuthis, which is now el-ashmunein. It also contains misspellings and other errors, so it was likely written from memory ( and shows that \" ordinary people \" believed in christianity, not just the \" elite, \" reports fox news ).

        "summary": "Reaction to president obama's re-election is rolling in from the right: some disappointment, some regret, an eye toward the future... And then there's donald trump. A look around the red landscape on this morning after election 2012: trump is really upset with last night's results, reports e! online. On twitter ( his favorite medium ), things started out tame — \" well, back to the drawing board! \" — but quickly devolved into calls for a march on washington to \" stop this great and disgusting injustice \" and halt this \" sham \" election, with hopes the house won't \" give anything to obama until he terminates obamacare. \" for a more grounded response, kevin williamson, writing for the national review, focuses on ohio, which romney really needed to win. He derides residents there who \" like crony capitalism \" and didn't see the repeal of obamacare as essential. \" offering americans a check is a more fruitful political strategy than offering them the opportunity to take control of and responsibility for their own lives, \" he writes. Fred barnes at the weekly standard says the republicans ' problem is their candidates. Romney was somewhat presidential, but they would have had a better chance with younger runners like paul ryan, bobby jindal, or chris christie, all of whom \" represent the republican future in the best possible way. \" what he's not hopeful about, however, is four more years of obama, \" the man with no plan and no mandate. \" obama got lucky with sandy, which let him \" rise for a few days above the partisanship that has defined his first term, \" writes the wall street journal in an editorial. Romney missed opportunities to win over minority voters, namely hispanics, by staying too far right on immigration. The column reminds the gop, however, that \" the battle for liberty begins anew this morning. \"",

            "Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In 2010, they failed to win the senate when it was theirs for the taking. Now they've lost the white house to president obama, despite his poor record and the likelihood things won't get any better in his second term. And they failed again to capture the senate, though a takeover was initially thought to be a cinch. The result was a status quo election, with democrats entrenched in white house and senate and republicans firmly in control of the house. As it turned out, the election wasn't historic at all, except that barack obama, the first african american president, became the first to be reelected. The numbers and the faces in washington have barely changed at all. We're stuck with them. As hard as republicans tried, they were unable to upset the balance of political forces. What's their problem? in senate races, it's bad candidates"

Insiders tell the washington post that after the possibility was raised, trump's legal team asked for more information on what mueller wanted to discuss with the president and turned the information into the leaked list of 49 questions. The post's sources say trump is still so angry about the raid on attorney michael cohen's offices that he's highly unlikely to agree to a mueller interview, though giuliani says it's still a possibility. \" hopefully we're getting near the end.

        "summary": "A coroner has ruled that peaches geldof did, indeed, die of a heroin overdose, and her husband, thomas cohen, admitted at the inquest looking into her april death that she was using again shortly before her death, the guardian reports. The 25-year-old mother of two had been taking methadone for more than two years to curb her addiction, but relapsed in february despite treatment and counseling, the bbc reports. At that time, cohen found suspicious text messages on geldof's phone and confronted her; she retrieved drugs she'd hidden in their home and flushed them down the toilet. He told the inquest he checked for drugs after that point and never found more, but added that he believes geldof may have been lying when she told him her weekly drug tests were negative. He also answered \" yes \" when asked if she was a heroin addict. Heroin wasn't the only drug in geldof's system — a pathologist also noted evidence of codeine, methadone, and morphine in her blood. Syringes, knotted tights, and burnt spoons were also found in the house. And the heroin — present in a \"fatal range \" in geldof's body — was particularly dangerous for someone who'd been off the drug long enough for her tolerance to lower, a forensic scientist testified. Found in a black cloth bag in a bedroom cupboard, the drug was 61 % pure — much higher than the 25 % pure grade found on the street.",

        "summary": "President trump made a big change in his foreign policy team thursday by announcing that john bolton would replace hr mcmaster as his national security adviser. One word turning up in virtually every profile of bolton is \" hawkish, \" or sometimes \" ultra-hawkish. \" specifically, bolton has argued for a hard-line approach to north korea ( he wrote that a pre-emptive strike would be justified ) and iran ( he wrote that trump should abandon the nuclear deal struck by president obama ). Here's a look at the fallout: huge deal: \" we can't overstate how dramatic a change it is for trump, \" writes jonathan swan at axios. With bolton on board, the president will likely ditch the iran deal in may, and the proposed summit with north korea is now looking \" shaky. \" bolton isn't just hawkish, he's adept at bureaucracy and \" won't take anybody's crap, \" writes swan. Expect him to clash with defense chief james mattis. His views: buzzfeed collects 11 \" remarkable statements \" from bolton that reflect his world view. \" there's no such thing as the united nations, \" he said in 1994. \" if the un secretary building in new york lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference. \" bolton served as us ambassador to the un from 2005 to 2006, and he declared in 2013 that the us was too often \" acting like a well-bred doormat \" there. His mustache: \" will bolton shave the stache? \" wonders phil kerpen of american commitment. He might be only half-joking. Politico notes that trump reportedly passed over bolton for a state department post last year because the president wasn't a fan of the 69-year-old's bushy mustache.",

Police say the unidentified man shot himself about 300 feet from the parliament building in syntagma square, as rush-hour commuters passed by. Though the man left no suicide note, witnesses heard him shouting, \" so i won't leave debts for my children. \" the wall street journal notes that suicides were up 20 % in 2010 and 2011 in greece, compared to pre-crisis 2009. But a government rep downplayed the incident, saying, \" we must all be calm and respect the real causes ( of the suicide ), which are not yet known. \" the death follows similar occurrences in italy: reuters reports that a 78-year-old woman jumped out of her fourth-floor balcony yesterday after her pension was chopped by 25 %.

Amy herbst, a mezzo-soprano, says she was doing fine until an army nurse screwed up her childbirth operation in 2012. The nurse at an army hospital in fort campbell, ky., apparently damaged herbst's reproductive and digestive system when her son was born — leaving herbst incontinent, flatulent, and unable to continue her singing career. \" she is suffering through a very embarrassing and very significant injury, and frankly, the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low, \" her attorney tells the army times. According to herbst, the nurse performed an episiotomy — meaning she cut an area between the anus and the vagina to help ease childbirth. But the incision couldn't be fully repaired, and it seems follow-up surgeries may not fix it, either. Herbst lost a job singing in madame butterfly thanks to the operation, the tennessean reports.

The lawsuit claims that the nurse performed an episiotomy during the second stage of herbst's labor without the new mom's consent or knowledge. An episiotomy is an incision that a doctor or nurse makes in the perineum – the area between the vagina and anus – to help deliver a baby that is in distress or to prevent muscles from tearing. The nurse-midwife reportedly repaired the episiotomy with sutures, but after herbst left the hospital, she \"began to experience fecal urgency and incontinence, including periodic leaking of stool and excessive flatulence, \" the suit states. Herbst claims that upon returning to the hospital, another nurse told her that attempts to repair the cut had been unsuccessful, and a colorectal surgeon told her she would need reconstructive surgery to fix the damage. Because of the complications of the procedure, herbst says she is unable to continuing working as a professional opera singer at the nashville opera company. \"she is suffering though a very embarrassing and very significant injury, and frankly, the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low, \" herbst's attorney, charles allen, told army times.

As part of that probe, scientific american publishes a look at one such federal investigation into how nearly 100 researchers who gathered at a nevada center in 2014 made \" several grievous errors \" while conducting a supposedly safe nuclear-pulse experiment with a machine called godiva. Their carelessness led to them unknowingly breathing in radioactive uranium, which they didn't discover until months later. The report details the pressure scientists were under to complete their work at the national criticality experiments research center, how a protective cover failed to be reinstalled during a product reassembly in 2012, and how one particular decision turned out to be a risky one. That decision: to turn off annoying radioactivity-detecting alarms that kept going off as godiva emitted its bursts. The scientists didn't realize that by shutting off the alarms, they were also closing off ventilation systems and air filters. While the doses they inhaled weren't especially high — at worst, the equivalent of 13 chest x-rays — they're enough to pose an added cancer risk for the scientists. Scientific american details how the first researcher discovered, on his own during routine testing two months later, that his health was at his risk, as well as the \" shroud of official secrecy \" that sheltered the experiment itself as well as the mishap that had occurred at the test site. The report also documents how financial penalties apparently weren't harsh enough to force major changes. More on the debacle here. ( did a uranium mine sicken a remote village in kazakhstan? )",

        "summary": "More than half a century after a group of beavers parachuted into the idaho backcountry, officials have uncovered footage of the quirky wildlife management moment. The idaho department of fish and game was struggling with an overpopulation of beavers in some regions in the 1940s when wildlife managers settled on a novel idea. They captured beavers and other furry rodents, packed them into special travel boxes, attached parachutes and dropped them from a plane into the frank church river of no return wilderness. Animal lovers, take heart — it appears all the beavers made it through their flying adventures unharmed. The film made around 1950 and dubbed \" fur for the future \" showed the infamous beaver drops, but it had long been lost, boise state public radio reported thursday. Fish and game historian sharon clark recently uncovered the fragile film, which had been mislabeled and stored in the wrong file. It has been digitized and released on youtube by the department and the idaho historical society. Trapping and transplanting beavers still happens today — but in less dramatic fashion. \" we haven't done airplane drops for 50-plus years, but it apparently worked pretty well back then to re-establish them in remote places, \" said steve nadeau, fish and game's statewide fur bearer manager. The agency now moves beavers to the owyhee desert, in the state's southwest corner, to help restore vegetation stripped away by years of watershed use. Nadeau says the goal is for beavers to make ponds in the region, which can hold water year-round.",

In 2016 he was arrested again for apparently grabbing and slapping the buttocks of another woman by the pool of his apartment complex. Prosecutors dropped battery charges after both arrests. He'd also been arrested in 2014 for allegedly trespassing in an fsu dining hall, which led to a trespass warning against him across the campus. Little more is known about the shooter — who apparently entered the studio pretending to be a customer and opened fire — but his linkedin page says he graduated from new york's binghamton university in 2002, studied public administration and urban planning at fsu, and worked as a supply and logistics director with the us army from 2008 to 2010. His facebook page's about section says, \" as hard as you try, you can not escape your destiny. You can run from it, but you can not hide from it. \" it also includes this quote from the serial-killer protagonist of american psycho: \" i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. \" ( the pittsburgh synagogue shooting put the focus on this social media site. )",

Late last week, the washington post reported on a recent treasury department practice made possible by a single sentence lurking in the 2008 farm bill: seizing tax refunds from americans who were being forced to repay debts, in many cases social security benefits, their parents allegedly racked up. That farm-bill line removed the 10-year statute of limitations on debt owed to the government, and the social security administration yesterday said it would halt its effort to collect on debts that are older than a decade, the post reports. The stop is \" pending a thorough review of our responsibility and discretion under the current law, \" says acting social security commissioner carolyn colvin, who added that anyone who \"believes they have been incorrectly assessed with an overpayment \" should contact the agency. Last week's article told of taxpayers who were given no notice or explanation before their monies were seized to pay debts their dead parents incurred; in one case, a notice was reportedly sent, to a po box last used in 1979.

The move was in response to the chaotic hyperinflationary period that had defined the zimbabwean economic environment for almost a decade prior to february 2009. Most zimbabweans still are haunted by the memories of that era when zimbabwe ` s then legal tender, the zimbabwe dollar effectively lost its usefulness as a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account and means for deferred payments – all considered features which give any monetary currency its value. Looking through history, it's interesting to note that there has not been any economy that has reverted back to its local currency once it has dollarised. Panama, widely considered as the closest the strategy of dollarisation has come to being successful, ecuador and el salvador all still use the us dollar many years after dollarising. The logic behind dollarising is that the government would be aiming to reduce its inflation whilst reaping the economic benefits of \"co-opting \" another country ` s currency. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is debatable. Looking at the latin american countries that have dollarised, their economies still lack notable economic development compared to their peers who have not dollarised. Some scholars have argued that for dollarisation to be effective, it must be accompanied by fundamental macro-economic reforms as"

Even after seeing five specialists and undergoing three surgeries, the 38-year-old said she was still left with a perpetually runny nose that kept her up all night. \"every day there was a problem, \" said campbell, of oak lawn, illinois. \"i had a dry mouth from breathing through my mouth and constant headaches. \" that all changed after doctors at loyola university health in maywood, illinois, diagnosed her with samter's triad, a newly recognized medical condition involving a combination of nasal polyps, asthma and a sensitivity to aspirin. \"my patients typically come in carrying a thick folder of medical records because they have tried for a long time to find a cure for their illness, \" said dr. Monica patadia, the board-certified head and neck surgeon who treated campbell at loyola. More than 37 million americans have at least one sinus problem a year, according to the american academy of otolaryngology, making it one of the most common medical conditions the average person experiences. Samter's triad, also known as aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, or aerd, affects an estimated 10 percent of people with asthma.

Any pity you have is for yourself. \" patel was found guilty of strangling and suffocating his 34-year-old wife with a plastic bag in may, with her $ 2.5 million life insurance policy apparently being part of the draw. Authorities say patel had long had affairs with men he met through the grindr app, and he was said to have wanted to run off to sydney to be with his latest boyfriend — and to have a child with him using jessica patel's frozen embryos, created via ivf. \" he could have divorced her, taken everything he wanted, he did not need to take her life, \" jessica's sister said in a statement. \" he had no right to take this evil, cruel, and malicious step. \" part of what helped bust patel, who tried to make the murder scene look like someone else had broken in: a health and wellness app on his iphone that showed a burst of \" frantic \" activity as he tried to stage the supposed burglary. The same app on jessica's phone, meanwhile, stayed still — until the 14 paces patel took with her phone as he removed it from her body and dropped it outside as part of the staging.",

The guardian reports the famous soccer player and member of the us women's national team was escorted from the park by orange county sheriff's deputies following an argument at a bar in the united kingdom section of epcot center. Based on an instagram post from earlier sunday, it appears morgan and her crew were attempting a drinking game in which they had to imbibe in every part of epcot. Police say around 8: 30pm, giles barnes — a professional soccer player for orlando city sc who was with morgan — cut in line at a bar. Witnesses tell tmz an argument between morgan's group and another group ensued. Sheriff's deputies were escorting barnes out of the park when they were called back to the bar to deal with morgan — who was described by police as \" screaming \" and apparently \" highly impaired \" — and her \" verbally aggressive \" group. Morgan, another orlando city player named donny toia, and toia's wife were detained in a conference room, where police say they were \" belligerent, with screaming and yelling, \" the orlando sentinel reports. The three were cited and removed from disney world. No charges were filed in connection with the incident, and morgan apologized wednesday on twitter. \" i will learn from this make sure it does not happen again, \" the soccer star tweeted, adding, \" #liveandlearn. \" *soccer pun.",
