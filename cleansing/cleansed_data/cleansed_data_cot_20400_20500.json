A sizable chunk are also clipping coupons and generally overturning long-held notions of gender roles in the supermarket and in the kitchen — which helps explain why companies are tripping over themselves to package foods designed to catch the eyes of guys. Witness \" brogurt, \" the nickname for powerful yogurt, pitched as the first yogurt specifically designed for men. Think more protein, bigger servings, bull horns on the packaging, and tag lines such as \" find your inner abs. \" at slate, kristin hohenadel isn't so sure about this kind of stuff. \" isn't this just as condescending ( and embarrassing ) to men as pastel-colored girly yogurt packaging is to women? \" maybe, but don't expect the concept to fade away anytime soon.

In focus group after focus group, julie murphy, an account planner at midan marketing, heard from under- and unemployed men who were buying and preparing most of the food in their households. Robbed of their economic potency, men were transforming themselves from chest-waxing metrosexuals into helpmates. Smelling a trend, midan conducted a survey that revealed that 47 % of men in the us are buying most of of the groceries and doing most of the cooking in their homes. Murphy decided to call this group \"manfluencers™ \" in order to highlight their newfound power over purchasing decisions. ( yes, the term is trademarked. ) contrary to decades of dogma"

            "Sada, iraq ( reuters ) - the earth shook three times with the impact of air strikes targeting islamic state positions north of mosul. Only then did the iraqi troops assembled on the edge of the small farming village advance. The army had gathered on friday afternoon in a muddy street that showed signs of heavy fighting with the jihadists from a day earlier: store fronts shorn off, electricity poles pulled down, bullet casings carpeting the ground. A rooftop sentinel kept watch. The iraqis'tan-colored humvees, reinforced with steel plates around the wheels to guard against sniper fire, were dwarfed by four mraps ( mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles ) manned by u.s. Military advisers. The second phase of the operation to retake mosul, islamic state's last major stronghold in iraq, began on thursday after several weeks of deadlock in the most complex operation in the country since the 2003 u.s.-led invasion. Conventional u.s. Forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now visible very close to the front lines. They are backing iraq's army, federal police and counter-terrorism service ( cts ), whose levels of training and experience vary widely. Since the offensive began 10 weeks ago, cts punched into mosul from the east and took a quarter of the city, but regular army troops like those in sada have made slower progress advancing from the north and south, slowing the operation. Iraqi soldiers carry weapons during a battle with islamic state, north of mosul, iraq, december 30, 2016. Reuters/khalid al mousily marginal advantage western officials from a coalition providing air support, training and advice to the iraqi military have hailed the recovery of the army and police, which dropped their weapons and fled islamic state's blitz across a third of the country in 2014 despite billions of dollars in u.s."

Michael bromwich, director of the bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement, said he supports some key provisions in the house gop regulatory bill. But he said the republican plan would divide regulatory work into two categories: those in which a lease has been issued and those without a lease, causing delays and duplication. Bromwich spoke at a hearing by the house energy and mineral resources subcommittee as his agency neared implementation of its own regulatory overhaul started after last year's bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico. That plan will divide boemre into two agencies: the bureau of ocean energy management and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement. Bromwich didn't say whether he would oversee one of the new bureaus, or leave the federal government when the reorganization takes place in two weeks. During his testimony, bromwich cited a wall street journal article thursday that suggested permitting activity in the gulf is approaching pre-bp spill levels.

A new study found the wealthy spend less time looking at other people, probably because the lower classes hold less \" motivational relevance \" for them, meaning the hoi polloi aren't worthy of their attention, live science reports. The study used google glass to track the gaze of 61 new yorkers who were told to look at whatever caught their attention on the street. Glass ' video camera near the right eye recorded the findings. Writing in the journal psychological science, researchers at new york university found a correlation between social class and interest in others. While class did not account for the number of times a participant looked at others, the upper classes spent less time looking at others compared with those in lower classes. The \" findings make a compelling case that social classes differ in their judgments of other people's significance, \" the researchers wrote, per live science. If this sounds difficult to measure, it is. Google glass can register the turn of a head but not where the eyes are tracking. So scientists followed up in the lab with an eye-tracking device that analyzed optical movements timed to new york city street scenes. They found the same result. To determine if participants were aware of their behavior, they showed computer images to 400 people and determined that those in the higher classes took longer to notice when a face changed. \" this finding suggests that social class, like other forms of culture … can shape human cognitive functioning at a deep level, \" they said.

        "summary": "Researchers tramped into a national park in sri lanka, played a recording of agitated honey bees within earshot of elephants, and got the reaction they hoped for: the elephants developed a serious case of the heebie jeebies. The study in current biology suggests that asian elephants react in much the same way to bees as their counterparts in africa — the giant creatures will go out of their way to avoid the insects. And this, the new york times explains, is very good news for elephants because it adds credence to a novel new strategy being employed to protect them. Essentially, farmers string beehives around their property, which keeps the elephants away, thus reducing elephant-human interactions that generally end poorly for all the mammals involved. The practice is becoming widespread in africa, where oxford researcher lucy king first began her studies several years ago, and the new study suggests asian farmers would be wise to follow suit. \" if we could help apply the results from this research to develop effective community-based beehive fence deterrent systems for rural asian farmers living with elephants, we could have a significant impact on the survival of the asian elephant species, \" says king, per science daily. Reuters reports that a village in india has virtually eliminated once-common invasions by elephants with the practice, with a potential bonus: farmers can reap a modest new income from the bees ' honey, though there's a learning curve involved in maintaining the hives.

The study, led by dr lucy king, a research associate with the oxford university department of zoology and head of the human-elephant co-existence program for save the elephants, showed that asian elephants responded with alarm to the bee simulations. They also retreated significantly further away and vocalised more in response to the bee sounds compared to controls. In collaboration with elephant scientists from cornell university, save the elephants, trunks and leaves, disney's animal kingdom and university of peradeniya the team now hope that beehive deterrents, used so successfully to ward off african elephants from rural farm lands, can be applied to prevent asian elephant populations from raiding crops.

At least that's what the youth wing of sweden's centrist liberal party is proposing, the washington post reports. The law would allow men to officially do away with all legal responsibility for their child, including paying child support, but would also give up all future visitation rights. And much like an actual abortion, the decision would be irreversible, according to rt. \" there are endless examples of men who can't even say whether they want to be involved in parenthood or how involved they want to be, \" liberal youth of sweden west chairman marcus nilsen tells a local newspaper. \" it is important that men remain honest with themselves and their intentions. \" the proposal was called \" madness \" and \" disgusting \" on social media and got no support from the main body of the liberal party. But nilsen maintains it would make things equal between men and women, as well as letting women know what they can expect from a father-to-be, the local reports. \" it is important to discuss the role of men in pregnancy, \" the post quotes nilsen. He also claims the proposal can't be misogynist as it came from women within the the liberal youth. The liberal party is considered mainstream in sweden, but its youth wing appears to be testing that. Last month, the liberal youth proposed legalizing incest between siblings over the age of 15 and necrophilia as long as a \" post-life sex request \" was included in the will.",

Yet a proposal from a swedish group to offer men the right to a \" legal abortion \" of an unborn child has not been met with enthusiasm. The idea, proposed by a regional branch of the youth wing of the centrist liberal party, would allow a potential father to legally abdicate his responsibility toward the child up to the 18th week of a woman's pregnancy.

Some 46 % of viewers thought obama won the debate, while 39 % called it for mitt romney, according to a cnn poll. \" debates are about moments, \" and obama had three big ones: his quip that romney's pension was bigger than his, his victory — with help from moderator candy crowley — in a scrap with romney over the benghazi attack, and his closing attack on romney's 47 % remarks, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Romney had his share of moments, but when he tried to catch obama out over benghazi, he was \" hoisted with his own petard by crowley in what will be the single most memorable ( and replayed ) interaction of the debate, \" he writes. Andrew sullivan, who set off a panic among obama supporters after the first debate with his analysis that the president may have thrown it all away, was satisfied: obama \" came back like a lethal, but restrained predator, \" he writes at the daily beast. \" he behaved like a president. He owned the presidency. \" fox news declares that both democrats and republicans are split on who won, and rounds up a few opinions: charles krauthammer, for one, calls the debate \" frazier vs. Ali \" and gives the win to obama. The debate was \" effectively a tie, or perhaps a slight edge to the challenger, \" decides yuval levin at the national review. Obama landed some punches by attacking romney \" as a cold-hearted plutocrat and calculating flip-flopper, \" but \" romney for the most part responded ably, and more importantly he attacked obama's record very effectively and argued for his own agenda reasonably well, \" he writes. Mark halperin at time gives obama a b-minus and romney a c. Obama was vastly improved over denver and \" did well in terms of being presidential, emotional, and solid, without slipping into an off-putting hipper-than-thou mode, \" he writes, while romney \" flunked his main test of reacting to a more aggressive obama \" and \" lost control of the event, the thread of his message, and the pleasing, accessible manner he displayed in denver. \" the debate \" puts a full stop to the reverberations of obama's denver disaster that were still echoing, giving the incumbent an undeniable win, \" he decides.

One bit getting heavy attention is that state department spokesman victoria nuland successfully argued to have the draft scrubbed of a reference to \" extremists \" linked to al-qaeda because it \"could be abused by members [ of congress ] to beat up the state department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? \" the white house insists that none of the changes were made for political reasons, with only national security staffers involved, and that such revisions are standard practice before any talking points go public.

Their study, published in plos one, suggests that babies who are smiling are attempting to make whomever they're interacting with smile back — all while the infants exert as little effort as possible. \" i used to wonder if my daughter was trying to communicate with me when she was an infant and smiled, \" the lead researcher tells the san diego union-tribune, and this study shows \" it might not have just been wishful thinking on my part. Babies are very goal-oriented. \" as the study explains, \" by the time infants reach 4 months of age both mothers and infants time their smiles in a purposeful, goal-oriented manner. In our study, mothers consistently attempted to maximize the time spent in mutual smiling, while infants tried to maximize mother-only smile time. \" in fact, a press release notes, researchers found that babies use sophisticated timing in order to get what they want. Researchers first looked at a previous study that observed face-to-face interactions of 13 moms and their babies when the infants were aged 4 to 17 weeks. By using an algorithm to \" reverse engineer, \" they were able to determine the babies ' goals based on their behavior. But if babies want their mothers to smile as much as possible while they smile as little as possible ( though, as one researcher cautions, the study did not determine whether the babies were conscious of what they were doing ), then shouldn't infants refrain from smiling if their mother is already smiling? that's where the sophisticated timing comes in: infants used \" maximally efficient... Wait times \" between smiles, because, if they stop smiling entirely, their mother is likely to also stop smiling at some point. Researchers then programmed a robot with a realistic, toddler-like face to behave in the same fashion as the babies in the study, and had that robot interact with students. The same thing happened: the robot minimized its own smiles all while maximizing the smiles it received in return. ( american babies don't laugh as much as dutch babies do. )",

In our study, mothers consistently attempted to maximize the time spent in mutual smiling, while infants tried to maximize mother-only smile time.

            "Photo advertisement continue reading the main story jerusalem — israeli warplanes carried out a strike deep inside syrian territory on wednesday, american officials reported, saying they believed the target was a convoy carrying sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry on the outskirts of damascus that was intended for the hezbollah shiite militia in lebanon. The american officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said israel had notified the united states about the attack, which the syrian government condemned as an act of \"arrogance and aggression. \" israel's move demonstrated its determination to ensure that hezbollah — its arch foe in the north — is unable to take advantage of the chaos in syria to bolster its arsenal significantly. The predawn strike was the first time in more than five years that israel's air force had attacked a target in syria. While there was no expectation that the beleaguered assad government had an interest in retaliating,",

Syrian state television accused israel of bombing a military research center at jamraya, between damascus and the nearby border, but syrian rebels disputed that, saying their forces had attacked the site. No source spoke of a second israeli strike. \" the target was a truck loaded with weapons, heading from syria to lebanon, \" said one western diplomat, echoing others who said the convoy's load may have included anti-aircraft missiles or long-range rockets. Several sources ruled out the presence in the convoy of chemical weapons, about which israel has also raised concerns. Diplomatic sources from three countries told reuters that chemical weapons were believed to be stored at jamraya, and that",

        "summary": "A surprising find under what used to be america's most notorious prison: texas a&m researchers using ground-penetrating radar have discovered the remains of an old military fortress long believed to have been completely destroyed, reports the bbc. The san francisco bay island was once the home of fort alcatraz, built upon the discovery of gold in the area and transformed into a line of defense during the civil war. The fort never fired a shot during the war, though it did house confederate sympathizers jailed for denouncing the federal government. The radar has revealed old fortifications along with buried magazine buildings and tunnels dating from long before the main prison building was erected in 1915. \" from 1850 to 1907 was the era of fortress alcatraz, \" explains texas a&m professor of geology and geophysics mark everett. Much of the remaining fortress is inaccessible under prison buildings, but archeologists hope to start excavations soon on what they believe is an important find under the prison's parade ground. \" it is called a caponier, and it is a large structure that juts out into the bay and provides defensive cover. We have seen it in the old photographs but it has completely disappeared from present view, \" says everett. He told the houston chronicle last month that the national park service had asked his team to search for civil war-era structures at the site, using equipment that scans under the earth in a way \" similar to the way people look for oil deposits. \" one other find of note: what is believed to be some of the oldest concrete in the us, which was likely imported from europe. ( historians are trying to locate another long-lost us fort, but it turns out they may have been looking in the wrong state. )",

Dunkin'donuts, 7-eleven, cracker barrel, and wawa brought back their versions as of monday, notes usa today. Expect mcdonald's to follow suit any day now. Aficionados like to tout the health benefits, and indeed bustle ticks off some of the benefits linked to ingredients such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.

Years ago and fathered 36 children between 2000 and 2014. He billed himself as a highly intelligent donor working toward a phd in neuroscience engineering, but he was actually a college dropout diagnosed with schizophrenia and narcissistic personality disorder who has spent time behind bars for burglary, reports the cbc. Aggeles appeared at a police station in georgia's athens-clarke county last week to turn himself in, and police say he admitted lying. But how much xytex knew about his history — or whether the company has or is going to file a report against him — remains unclear. So far, he has not been charged with any crimes. Also unclear is whether a disease as genetically complex as schizophrenia will be passed down to his progeny, but it's an issue that's likely not limited to aggeles. The guardian reports that it's easier than ever for donor-conceived children to find a genetic family member, with the us donor sibling registry helping to connect more than 10,900 people with their half-siblings or donors. Since donating his sperm, aggeles has received mental health treatment, earned a degree in cognitive science, and is working toward a master's in artificial intelligence.

Chloe mcclendon, who worked as a contractor, was indicted this week in houston, the washington post reports. The 26-year-old was charged along with two other women — alicia myles, 31, and dominique thomas, 25 — on multiple counts, including aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, reports click2houston. Simply put, they're accused of stealing social security numbers, addresses, and names to make phony documents. Accomplices allegedly used those documents to open commercial credit accounts and buy electronics items like iphones and ipads. The post reported last month that the us passport agency was already refusing to let contractors bring cellphones to the office, and planned to prevent government workers as well, because someone in houston had been caught swiping applicants ' personal data. But rob arnold, who heads a federal workers ' union, questions the phone ban: \" if the contractors had been caught writing down the applicants ' private information on a piece of paper, would they have banned paper and pens? \" he asks. He also says the passport agency has reduced costs by replacing government workers with contractors and giving the latter greater responsibility.",

It quickly went viral, and long has been praised for her honesty — but a number of critics are calling her out for baring her son's problems so publicly, and some are even questioning her own fitness as a mother: on her own blog, sarah kendzior takes a look at long's previous blog entries and finds some discrepancies: long had previously described her purportedly lanza-like son as a normal kid who nonetheless infuriated her with his obama-loving views; she also accused her ex-husband of having the boy sent to a juvenile correction facility after he failed to do his chores. In one post, she describes wanting to \" throttle \" her kids or call her son's parole officer and \" let the state take care of you. \" after taking heat herself, kendzior insisted in a second blog post that the context is important — and that the bottom line is, \" a child does not deserve to have his mother embark on a media tour promoting him as a future mass murderer. \" \" no, you are not adam lanza's mother, \" reads the headline on a disability and representation blog by rachel cohen-rottenberg, who is aghast at the idea that any mother would compare her own child \" to mass murderers. In public. Under her own name. On the internet. For the world to see. \" she's similarly appalled at those praising long, wondering if they've forgotten about the effect this will have on her son. \" it's as though they've written him off. He's just a talking point. A springboard for discussion. An avatar of people's worst fears. But not a child struggling. \" another reaction posted by the blogger at thegirlwhowasthursday accuses long of reinforcing mental illness stigma by tying such illnesses to mass murders. \" by reducing ' mental illness'to ' outward behavior'the article dehumanizes the mentally ill and completely glosses over the inner mental life and experiences of those with mental illness. \" kendzior and long today released a joint statement, saying they didn't anticipate their posts would go viral and calling for unity: \"we are not interested in being part of a 'mommy war '.

        "summary": "In what is likely an attempt to \" show off, \" men eat more in the presence of women than in front of other men, according to new research out of cornell university. In fact, in the study published this month in the journal evolutionary psychological science, researchers say that of the 105 adults they observed over a two-week period at an all-you-can-eat buffet, men ate a whopping 93 % more pizza ( about 1.5 slices ) when with women than with men, and 86 % more salad. But it wasn't necessarily a turn-on to their female counterparts. Women, who ate roughly the same regardless of the gender of their company, reported feeling that they overate and were rushed when dining with men. \" these findings suggest that men tend to overeat to show off — you can also see this tendency in eating competitions, which almost always have mostly male participants, \" says the lead researcher. Overeating is a way of using body language to say, \" i have so much energy that i can afford to engage in some specific kind of risky or altruistic activity, \" the researcher tells live science, while other studies show similar trends of men engaging in riskier behaviors in front of women than men. A similar experiment conducted at indiana university of pennsylvania found that all students tend to order more food in front of women than in front of men, though how much was limited to the menu items as it was not a buffet, reports upi. Because the cornell study is so small, researchers caution on drawing too many conclusions, but the university's food and brand lab did draw up a poster with the message, \" calm down when eating with the opposite sex. \" ( should an obsession with \" clean \" eating be its own eating disorder? )",

The \" extraordinary levels \" of pollution in the mariana trench in the western pacific ocean and the kermadec trench some 4,000 miles away, initially described last summer, are now laid out in a study published in nature. Researchers say toxic industrial chemicals called persistent organic pollutants, or pops, known to affect reproduction, were found \" in all samples across all species at all depths in both trenches, \" they tell the guardian. Adds lead researcher alan jamieson, \" the surprise was just how high the levels were — the contamination in the animals was sky high. \" pops — including polychlorinated biphenyls, or pcbs, which were banned in the 1970s — have leaked into oceans and accumulated in animals, which sink to the deep ocean when they die. They're then eaten by scavenging amphipods like those in mariana trench, which are more contaminated with pcbs than crabs living in some of china's most polluted waters, usa today reports. At the conversation, jamieson compares the use of plastic microbeads to that of pops, noting \" we have a shocking example of our own stupidity, as people gradually realize … that stuff that goes down the sink doesn't magically disappear into another dimension. \" he adds researchers are now surveying amphipods in the trenches for plastic pollution he is sure will be there.

But now the agency is proposing a $ 350,000 fine after amazon sent, via air, a package labeled \" amazing! liquid fire \" from louisville, ky., to boulder, colo., on oct. 15, 2014, reuters reports. That \" amazing \" drain cleaner injured nine ups workers when the package leaked, and the workers had to be doused with chemical wash after experiencing a burning sensation. The faa contends the package wasn't packaged or labeled correctly, considering its corrosive contents, and didn't come with the form required for shipping dangerous goods. Per usa today, the 1-gallon container was labeled with a skull and crossbones, as well as the warnings \" causes severe burns \" and \" corrosive to eyes and skin, \" but that container was packed inside a fiberboard box. The wall street journal notes that the proposed fine comes right as amazon is diving deeper into the shipping arena with its own fleet of planes and trucks — and also as the faa is getting tough on those who flout its rules on hazardous materials. The agency says that between february 2013 and september 2015, amazon was hit with the two dozen regulation violations — resulting in at least 15 packages that leaked and totaling nearly $ 1.3 million in fines, per reuters — and notes that it's going to keep a close eye on the retailer's shipping protocol. \" we take the safety of our air cargo delivery partners seriously, \" an amazon rep says, promising to keep working with the faa.

No, this is divergent, the story of a girl in a strictly segmented society who doesn't fit into any of those segments. Critics are divided; the movie is well made, everyone seems to agree, but it doesn't exactly feel fresh. Here's what they're saying. Chris vognar at the dallas morning news says what everyone's thinking: \" hey, we gotta kill time between hunger games installments somehow. \" divergent isn't as good, but at least it's no twilight, \" and its key demographic should gobble it up. \" still, toward the end \" you feel you could be watching almost any movie with a scheming villain and an underdog hero and two more high-priced chapters to set up. \" director neil burger is talented, and produces something better than the book. But then, the book was just an \" ambitious young author's attempt to re-write the hunger games without bringing the lawyers down on her head, \" and summit has happily produced it \" to crank up the franchise machinery … without the bother of creating something fresh, \" complains ty burr at the boston globe. It's \" a cynical exercise on every possible level. \" the novelist \" appears to be one in a long line of religious conservatives who think there's nothing more dangerous than intellectualism, \" writes david edelstein at vulture — the movie's bad guys are the \" erudites \" devoted to intellectual pursuits. But if you can ignore that subtext, it's fairly entertaining. Shailene woodley is so good that \" she ends up doing a lot of the screenwriters ' work for them. \" claudia puig at usa today also noticed the \" anti-intellectual bias, \" but she didn't find that redeeming entertainment value. \" too much of the movie … is spent on a tedious array of physical challenges, evaluations, and psychological tests in dimly lit places, \" she writes. \" despite two strong lead performances and a welcome dose of female empowerment, this somber tale feels too familiar and formulaic. \"",

But it's not just cloning and raising cattle for beef. Commercial genetics company boyalife, which is building the center with south korea's sooam biotech, sinica, peking university's institute of molecular medicine, and the tianjin international joint academy of biomedicine, says it also plans to clone racehorses and dogs — the latter not just for pets but to sniff out illegal drugs and victims of natural disasters, reports vice. It may even help rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction. \" in china we do things on a massive scale, \" boyalife ceo xu xiaochun told bloomberg back in 2014. \" we want to do all this not just for profit, but also for history. \" and in spite of some controversy on the use of cloned animals, he tells the guardian he's confident the move is a positive one: \" we are going [ down ] a path that no one has ever traveled. We are building something that has not existed in the past. This is going to change our world and our lives. It is going to make our life better. So we are very, very excited about it. \" the european parliament has voted to outlaw the sale of cloned livestock, while in the us the fda has long taken the stance that cloned meat is safe and harbors no complications \" unique to cloning. \" ( the us is already in the cloning racehorses game. )",

A newly surfaced photo of harriet tubman shows the famous abolitionist not as the older woman seen in familiar images, but much closer in age to the woman who led enslaved families to freedom on the underground railroad and served as a union spy and scout during the civil war, the auburn citizen reports. The photo, authenticated by historian kate clifford larson, was in an album belonging to abolitionist emily howland, and it's believed to show tubman when she was somewhere between 43 and 46 years old, mic reports. Tubman was born into slavery in maryland in 1820. She escaped to philadelphia in 1849 and guided her family and many others to freedom in the following years. \" what's remarkable about this photograph is that she's so proud and dignified and beautiful. She looks so young, \" larson tells the citizen. \" this is the vibrant young tubman just coming off her work during the civil war. She's building her life with her family in auburn. \" larson, author of a tubman biography, says that unlike dozens of other photos she has been sent over the years, she realized this photo was a genuine picture of tubman the moment she saw it. The historic image will be auctioned off march 30 by swann galleries as part of an album that is expected to fetch up to $ 30,000.

But in a horrific ending to his climb, he instead found another hiker not with his group, who told him, \" i ' m sorry, i think your friends have fallen, \" the national post reports. That hiker's haunting words turned out to be accurate, and before noon on sunday, four bodies were found at the foot of the british columbia mountain, the vancouver sun reports; a fifth body was found later in the day. The hikers were believed to have been part of two local hiking groups: the vancouver korean hiking club and the mjm hiking club. \" this is not the outcome which we had hoped for, \" says a spokesperson for the royal canadian mounted police. The hikers are believed to have fallen more than 1,600 feet. At the summit, they apparently stepped on a cornice, a mass of hardened snow that hangs over the edge, which broke off and sent them plummeting. Alastair ferries, the hiker who broke the news to the sixth member of the party, had a feeling that was what happened when he found a pair of snowshoes, then tracks from the group's members that went straight over the side once he reached the top. An avalanche canada warning services manager tells the cbc that failures of cornices, which are difficult to see, are common at this time of year and that people shouldn't be lulled by the warm spring weather at the bottom of mount harvey. \" we still have a pretty wintry snowpack up...

After grueling training regimens, they set off on nov. 3 from the ronne ice shelf, and both hope to make it to the finish line ( the ross ice shelf ) in about two months'time, through some of the most extreme conditions and while dragging sleds that initially weighed 375 pounds each. They can't accept \" so much as a cup of tea \" from anyone along the way. In 2016, rudd's friend, henry worsley, attempted the feat before turning back, then tragically died of organ failure after being airlifted out. English explorer ben saunders made the attempt last year, but he ended his quest at mile 805. Rudd announced his plans in april, while o ' brady sprung his own surprise on the world in october, so when the men first met up in punta arenas, chile, \" there was a lot of tension and distrust. \" but they ended up bonding as they both discovered in the other a similar drive to pull off the unprecedented feat. When they embarked, they hugged before departing, with rudd noting: \" good luck. I think we're both going to make it. \" more on their journey in the ice-covered no man's land in the times and national geographic, which notes that some contend this feat has already been accomplished.",

Although the office of personnel management is so far keeping to the original figure, briefed us officials say that 18 million people were actually affected, and that number is expected to get even bigger, cnn reports. The sources say fbi chief james comey spilled the new estimate recently in a closed-door session with senators, though a source tells abc news that these are \" very raw numbers \" and that \" many forensic steps \" are still being taken. Even people who applied for federal jobs and didn't get them could be at risk, per cnn. The number is expected to grow because a database was hacked that stored security clearance forms, which contained personal info of family members and associates of government officials. Opm officials are now feeling the pressure. Internal auditors told the house oversight committee last week that important databases with sensitive national security info hadn't been adequately protected, and the head of the opm has been criticized for being slow to provide relevant info, cnn notes. Another sore point has been that investigators believe the hackers were the same ones that infiltrated opm contractor keypoint government solutions last year — and that it was keypoint credentials used to break into the opm files. Meanwhile, ars technica worries the opm breach is related to other major hacks, and that the hackers are pulling all this info together into what will eventually become \" a linkedin for spies, providing a foreign intelligence organization with a way to find individuals with the right job titles, the right connections, and traits that might make them more susceptible to recruitment or compromise. \" ( those really into cyber-espionage should read ars technica's full piece. )",

Those were \"very raw numbers, \" and investigators are still conducting \"many forensic steps \" to determine whether so many people actually had their personal information stolen, a source close to the investigation said today.

But the jury didn't convict him of murder, which has left a bad taste in many people's mouths. Has justice been done? what should we learn from the incident? here's what people are saying: \" it's a hollow victory, \" writes tonyaa weatherbee at cnn. \" i guess now any random white man can confront a black teenager whose style of dress or music he doesn't like, \" and, if that teenager responds defiantly, as teenagers are wont to, \" then it's perfectly fine to exterminate him. \" the verdict says that in 21st century america, young black men are so scary that killing them isn't murder. For ta-nehisi coates at the atlantic, the killing and the non-verdict are simply the latest evidence that \" the irrelevance of black life has been drilled into this country since its infancy, and shall not be extricated through the latest innovations in negro finishing school. \" paul barrett at bloomberg is no dunn apologist, but he thinks the civil rights groups calling for a retrial are making a mistake. It would wiser to let dunn rot in prison and pivot to a larger discussion that \" doesn't prolong public focus on the particular nature of this one man's malevolence. He's not important. Why provide a fresh forum for his defense lawyers to suggest he's some kind of martyr? \" that discussion should focus on stand your ground laws, argues nick o ' malley at the sydney morning herald. Floridians \" cannot claim to be surprised \" by the non-verdict, he writes. This mistrial, and george zimmerman's acquittal, \" are not glitches in stand your ground law, but the law's very intent. \" indeed, the new york times has a piece today on how the law specifically made conviction more difficult.",

And donald trump's approval ratings are lower than those of any new president for whom such polling exists. What's going on? here's a hypothesis: our age of radical transparency is far likelier to reveal bad stuff than good. Virtually every fallen leader of recent times has been undone by the dramatically expanded availability and light-speed portability of digital data — as mundane as electronic financial records ( lee ) or as advanced as remote surveillance ­( flynn's conversations with russian ambassador sergey kislyak ). It all reveals what's hidden, and the things people try to hide tend to be bad. Get used to it. Evidence suggests that for ­broader reasons, radical transparency may be raising the base level of tumult to uncomfortable new highs. In business, for example, easier access to information for customers, competitors, and others causes industry dominance to change more quickly, corporate life spans to decline, and executive tenures to shorten. Knockout leadership gets harder to maintain. Yet it",

The university of maryland-baltimore county stunned the sports world by pulling off the most surprising upset in college basketball history, trouncing virginia 74-54 on friday night to become the first no. 16 seed ever to beat a no. 1 seed in the men's ncaa tournament.

The cable network has announced a new partnership with sesame workshop, the nonprofit behind the tv show, that means the next five seasons will air exclusively on hbo and via its streaming services for the first nine months of each season's run, then will be available for free on pbs ( where sesame street has run since 1969 ) and its member stations, usa today reports. The agreement gives sesame workshop the ability to produce 35 new episodes per year ( it currently churns out 18 ), as well as creating a muppets spinoff series and a new children's educational series, per the new york times. What this move also does for hbo: gets it back into the children's programming game, which it ditched years ago, without having to jump entirely into the original-content realm. ( the actress who played maria on the show for 44 years just missed the hbo move. )",

        "summary": "Today marks the start of the second phase of dzhokhar tsarnaev's trial in federal court, in which a jury will determine whether he should be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole. What you need to know: how this phase will differ: tsarnaev's lawyers were clear about his involvement in the bombings, so the guilty verdicts were expected. What will happen in the penalty phase is anyone's guess, which the new york times predicts will make for a \" far more contentious, emotional, and unpredictable \" phase. What do the victims want? they're split, with many staunchly against death, with their reasons ranging from the likelihood of a drawn-out appeals process following a death sentence to its inability to truly bring peace to those affected. Indeed, the boston globe cites records showing most federal convicts facing death spend at least 10 years mired in appeals while on death row. The how, how long, and how likely: presiding judge george o'toole jr. Is predicting a roughly four-week trial; the jury must unanimously decide on death; and the globe counts that in 232 federal death penalty cases since 1988, death was handed out 34 % of the time. Who will say what: the defense will continue to paint tsarnaev's brother, tamerlan, as having a significant influence over him; prosecutors are expected to emphasize the heinous nature of the bombings and have more survivors testify, reports the ap. The witness lists aren't yet public; the times notes it's unclear if any of tsarnaev's family members will testify. The massachusetts angle: the ap cites polls that show a majority of boston-area residents would prefer to see tsarnaev handed life. The globe points to the state's history as part of the reason why. The death penalty was done away with there in 1984, and no one had been executed in the state in the four decades prior. In the two previous federal death penalty cases the state has seen, the jury decided on death in one instance, though that's since been overturned and a sentencing retrial is planned for september, reports the boston herald.",

It still applies to bills and supreme court nominations. 2. Well, technically it still applies to all bills and supreme court nominations. In practice, legislation that mainly uses the government's tax and spending powers can evade the filibuster using the budget reconciliation procedures. That's how george w.

After five years of filibusters, obstruction, lengthy waits for confirmation and arguments over whether the party that failed to win either the white house or the senate nonetheless has the power to hold top government jobs open for as long as barack obama is president, senate democrats finally decided that enough is enough. On thursday, nearly every member of the democratic caucus invoked a procedural maneuver that will allow the senate to confirm several blocked nominees",
