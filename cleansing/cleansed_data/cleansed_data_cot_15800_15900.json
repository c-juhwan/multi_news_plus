By cnn's count, that was the fifth time this week he had offered a position on the war, having initially told fox that he would have authorized it, before saying he had \" interpreted the question wrong \" and describing it as a \" hypothetical. \" he stressed that he didn't want to say anything that could be seen as disrespectful to those who served and died in the conflict, and that their lives were not lost in vain. Bush said he hadn't spoken to his brother before clarifying his position on iraq, the washington post reports. \" i am loyal to him, \" he said. \" i don't think it's necessary to go through every place that i disagree with him. \" as for the current situation in iraq, bush said the us needs to \" reengage and do it in a more forceful way \" to combat the \" barbaric islamic threat, \" the post reports. Analysts say they're surprised at how badly bush has fumbled a question long seen as the elephant in the room. \" the question about iraq is not an illegitimate, hypothetical question, \" gop strategist steve schmidt tells cnn. \" if you're sitting around pondering a jeb bush candidacy, it's the first obvious question that you have to be able to answer. \"",

        "summary": "Aaron hernandez had a bible verse scrawled on his forehead when he was found hanged in his prison cell early wednesday, sources tell wbz. The sources say the former nfl star had the words \" john 3: 16 \" on his forehead, along with red marks on his hands and feet. The bible verse, one of the best known in the new testament, reads: \" for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. \" law enforcement sources also say hernandez may have smoked \" k2 \" synthetic marijuana the night that he died. In other coverage: abc news looks at hernandez's life in two massachusetts prisons, where staff were told to treat him like any other inmate. He reportedly got into gang-related fights in the bristol county house of correction and the souza-baranowski correctional center, where he was sent after being convicted of murder in 2015. Kevin cullen at the boston globe recaps what he calls the \" squandered life \" of the 27-year-old. Despite his success at the highest level of his sport, \" hernandez enthusiastically embraced the ethos of gang life, the guns, the posse, the tattoos. All except one: doing time, \" he writes. \" real gangsters accept prison as a price to pay for the life. In the end, hernandez couldn't or wouldn't. \" the orlando sentinel looks at early signs of trouble in the three years hernandez spent playing college football with the florida gators. Robert monroe, one of the jurors who found hernandez not guilty of a double murder last week, tells the boston herald that he's confused by the timing of the apparent suicide. \" i thought he was really happy at the verdict. If he hung himself not too long after... Clearly, i must have been wrong, \" he says. The ap reports that hernandez isn't believed to have left a suicide note — apart from the bible verse — and his death is a mystery to people in boston's dorchester neighborhood, where he grew up. \" i just think it got to him — the guilt, \" says a local resident. \" each man has to live with himself. You can put on an act like nothing happened, but you've got a soul. You've got a heart. \"",

Then finally, relief: \" ladies and gentlemen, we found the device. Luckily only the name of the device was changed to ' galaxy note 7 '.

        "summary": "China is willing to buy up nearly $ 70 billion in us products like soybeans, corn, natural gas, crude oil, and coal in the first year of a deal if the trump administration forgets about its threatened trade tariffs. Extending what business insider calls \" a massive olive branch, \" chinese negotiators presented commerce secretary wilbur ross with the option over the weekend on the condition that the administration dump threatened tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of chinese products, to go into effect after june 15, officials briefed on the negotiations tell the wall street journal. President trump previously suggested this might be done if a $ 375 billion us trade deficit with china is reduced by $ 200 billion annually. The offer — representing \" a 50 % increase in us exports from 2017 levels, \" economist chad bown tells the washington post — could make a dent. However, us officials argue there would be little impact on the trade deficit as energy exports would have to be diverted to china from other destinations. There are also concerns about the ability to ramp up agricultural production to meet china's needs. On top of that, the deal \" would not address the underlying, long-run concerns the united states has with china, \" including its foreign investment restrictions and requirement that us cloud-computing firms share their technology with chinese partners, bown says. Still, china appears optimistic, with a negotiator claiming the two sides \" have made positive and concrete progress. \" per the new york times, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said tuesday \" we're in the negotiation process \" and \" our focus is to make sure we get good deals. \"",

Inside a 10-foot-wide inflatable ball attached to paddles, 25-year-old lindsey russell set off from donaghadee in northern ireland at 6: 30am on thursday in an attempt to raise money for sport relief, which helps fund children's education, vaccines, mental health initiatives, and more. The journey to scotland's portpatrick harbor — which would see russell roll the ball or \" zorb \" from the inside with her hands and feet — was expected to take about 14 hours, or the same time it would take to swim the distance, per the belfast telegraph and bbc. But 10 hours and 17 nautical miles into the trek, russell was forced to give up because of bad weather. \" the sea has been crossed in so many ways — jet skiing or swimming — but this just felt different and silly and a bit mad, \" the host of cbbc's blue peter said before setting off. She completed the london marathon and the swiss army's mountain race for practice and was soon running up to seven hours per day. She also practiced fighting huge waves, though it wasn't enough to beat the harsh weather on the open water. Still, russell was greeted by cheering fans when she arrived in scotland by boat. The \" challenge was always going to be incredibly hard and zorbing many miles across the irish channel is a huge achievement, \" a sport relief rep says. It was \" the most epic day, \" russell tweeted, adding she's proud but tired. ( this woman completed the \" world's toughest swim \" last summer. )",

But he stopped short of expressing willingness to impose more sanctions on north korea, saying moscow views them as \" useless and ineffective. \" putin said north korea's neighbors should engage with it, not whip up \" military hysteria. \" \" it's a road to nowhere. Whipping up military hysteria — this will lead to no good, \" he said. \" it could cause a global catastrophe and an enormous loss of life. \" the russian president, who was in china for a summit of leading emerging economies, told reporters that he had remarked to one of his counterparts at the talks that north korea \" will eat grass but will not give up the ( nuclear ) program if they don't feel safe. \" putin said it was important that all parties affected by the crisis, including north korea, not face \" threats of annihilation \" and \" step on the path of cooperation. \"",
            "Moscow ( ap ) — russian president vladimir putin has refrained from making any criticism of u.s. President donald trump. Speaking at a news conference on tuesday, putin dismissed a question whether he was disappointed in trump as \" naive. \" in comments carried by russian news agencies, putin said trump is \" not my bride, and i ' m not his groom. \" asked how russia would feel if trump were impeached, putin said it would be \" absolutely wrong \" for russia to discuss domestic u.s. Politics: russian officials cheered trump when he was elected last year, and putin praised him as someone who wanted to improve ties with russia. However, further u.s. Sanctions on russia and the u.s. Decision to close a russian consulate have raised concerns that the two countries remain far apart."

        "summary": "Not since martin shkreli has there been such outrage over the spiking costs of a life-saving device or drug. Mylan, the maker of the epipen, has bumped up costs by almost 500 % over the past few years, and because the drugmaker enjoys a near-monopoly on the epinephrine-delivering device — the ap notes the epipen patent doesn't expire until 2025 — many people who rely on it to combat severe allergic reactions have been forced to pay the full hefty cost ( around $ 600 for a two-pack ) to stay safe. Unless they purchase what's the only commercially available option on the market so far, per the washington post: the adrenaclick, a generic version of the epipen that consumer reports says it found at walmart and sam's club for a relatively reasonable $ 140 and change, with a coupon. Like the epipen, this device releases epinephrine, and in the same exact dosages. But there's a problem: most people — including teachers and nurses — know how to work epipens, and the technology on the adrenaclick is different, which could lead to people using them incorrectly or moving too slowly during an emergency situation, potentially leading to injuries. In fact, an american college of allergy, asthma, and immunology study found that people prescribed epinephrine who don't use it for at least three months risk losing their injection skills and need retraining. Another cheaper option: homemade delivery systems made from syringes that people fill with epinephrine themselves. But that could prove even more risky than the generic device, experts say, per consumer reports: while the adrenaclick at least houses the same dosages of the drug, people filling their own syringes could put in too little or too much, adding another complication on top of the training issue. ( while epipen costs went up, so did the salaries of top mylan execs. )",

That's more than 20 times taller than the world's current tallest building, the nearly 3,000-foot-tall burj khalifa tower in dubai. So why a space elevator? because rockets ( and, presumably, the space tourists inside them ) require less force to launch when starting that much closer to the destination. \" landing at 12 miles above sea level will make space flight more like taking a passenger jet, \" says thoth technology ceo caroline roberts in a press release. The inventor says astronauts would reach the top via electrical elevator, from where rockets can launch in a single stage to orbit as well as return to refuel. If this seems far-fetched, it's actually less ambitious than obayashi corporation's hope to build a space elevator a quarter of the way to the moon by 2050, reports cnet. Even so, thoth's ambition still requires building just beyond what is known as the \" armstrong limit, \" or \" the point at which atmospheric pressure is so low that your bodily fluids would boil off without a protective suit, \" reports global construction review. The idea is gaining so much traction that seattle is actually hosting a space elevator conference later this month.

        "summary": "One of the best-reviewed movies of the last 12 months is an epic story about... Lego people? believe it or not, the lego movie is getting virtually unanimous critical praise — as of this writing it's at 99 % on rotten tomatoes, with just one top critic offering a negative review. Here's what critics are saying about their improbable darling: \" my fingers rebel, but type it i must: the lego movie is the first great cinematic experience of 2014, \" writes ty burr at the boston globe. \" the keys to the movie's absurdly high enjoyment factor are its exuberance, timing, wit, and willingness to stoop to its source \" — unlike, say, transformers or battleship, this is \" rooted in the wonky hobbyist esthetic of the lego system itself. \" \" i ' m going to level with you: i went in hoping at best for something intermittently amusing, \" admits dana stevens at slate. Instead she got a symphony of \" precisely orchestrated silliness, \" that's at times even kind of subversive and profound. Thanks in part to a \" perception-shifting \" third-act twist, the movie \" really sets itself apart, not just from most branded entertainment, but from most films for children, period. \" \" it may be a helter-skelter kiddie adventure built out of plastic toy components, \" writes owen gleiberman at ew, but it's also \" conceptually audacious, \" \" visually astonishing, \" and \" startlingly sophisticated. \" like toy story before it, the movie \" invents a kind of child-friendly meta universe \" in which \" the transparently fake lego constructions embody the pure spirit of make-believe. \" andrew o ' hehir at salon also took \" wonder and delight \" in the movie, which \" could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap. \" but he can't help over-analyzing the fact that this fable about rejecting the stifling strictures of \" lord business \" was corporate-processed. In that light, \" the movie's critique of conformity becomes its opposite, a benevolent reassurance that the dominant order can tolerate a bit of disorder at the micro-lego level. \" who's the lone grump? kyle smith at the new york post. Like o ' hehir, he sees some hypocrisy: \" here is a movie in which a $ 15 billion toy merchant and a $ 57 billion entertainment conglomerate join forces to lecture us on the evils of buying. \" but really, he just can't take the movie's \" toddler-meets-red-bull chaos.

Local officials are working to rescue people stranded atop a levee, and urging residents to move to higher ground. Isaac made landfall as a category 1 hurricane last night before heading back out over the gulf of mexico and then making landfall again. \" think about a spinning top that's dropped onto a tabletop, moving forward for a while, but then jumping to the right, and you have an idea of what has happened to isaac, \" explains the times-picayune.

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from low-lying areas in louisiana and mississippi but the mood is calm in new orleans, which was hit by hurricane katrina seven years ago today, reports the ap. \" we don't expect a katrina-like event, but there are things about a category 1 storm that can kill you, \" says mayor mitch landrieu, warning residents to stay away from streets that might flood. \" we're going to see heavy rain and serious winds, \" says louisiana gov.

        "summary": "A group of south korean scientists says it's finally come up with the perfect metallurgical cocktail to create a new form of steel that's flexible, lightweight, relatively inexpensive — and as strong as titanium, popular mechanics reports. The south korean study published in nature, which is being heralded by the researchers as \" one of the biggest steel breakthroughs of the last few decades, \" as pm puts it, claims the strength-to-weight ratio of the new steel alloy matches that of the best titanium alloys and can be made at 10 % of the cost. It will also reportedly be possible to churn out the steel on a smaller scale with currently existing equipment used to make automotive-grade steel, the researchers say. Steel is already a widespread building block, from framing out skyscrapers to its use in turbines and shipping containers. But scientists have scratched their heads for years on making it light enough for automotive and aircraft applications, as well as increasing an alloy's ductility — what discovery describes as a material's \" ability to be stretched or bent without breaking. \" adding lightweight aluminum to the steel mix helps with the first issue, but scientists couldn't get around that alloy's brittleness. The korean scientists figured out a way to separate bunched-up crystals inside the steel and spread them out so they'd be better protected from breakage. It may take awhile to transition these reported results into mass production, but steel giant posco is already curious enough to be planning a trial using the steel on an industrial scale, the economist reports.

Today a team of material scientists at pohang university of science and technology in south korea announced what they're calling one of the biggest steel breakthroughs of the last few decades: an altogether new type of flexible, ultra-strong, lightweight steel. This new metal has a strength-to-weight ratio that matches even our best titanium alloys, but at one tenth the cost, and can be created on a small scale with machinery already used to make automotive-grade steel. The study appears in nature. \" because of its lightness, our steel may find many applications in automotive and aircraft manufacturing, \" says hansoo kim, the researcher that led the team.

Surveillance footage from walmart and lowe's showed a man buying most of those items, but he used cash so there was no name. A man also used cash to buy a backpack and gray spoon at rei. Notably, he also used an rei membership under the name michael estes, and estes was arrested in downtown asheville on oct. 7.

But until the republicans find someone who can defeat him, obama has to be considered a favorite to for re-election. The gop may have the person who could beat obama, but new jersey gov. Chris christie still insists he will not be a candidate for president or vice president next year. Our polling found that christie was the only one of seven possible republican candidates leading obama in a hypothetical 2012 match-up. As a spectator, i'd love to see how a race between these two men of very different personal and governing styles. Our interactive poll conducted from dec. 30-jan. 3 found christie was the top choice for 27 % of republican voters to be the 2012 nominee, putting him ahead of mitt romney ( 17 % ), sarah palin ( 16 % ) and mike huckabee ( 14 % ). Christie led among conservatives and born-again christians, and only trailed romney by a few points among the few moderate republicans. In head-to-head polls against obama, christie led, 43 % -40 %. Romney tied obama at 40 % -40 %, and all the other republican names we offered ( palin, huckabee, john thune, mitch daniels and tim pawlenty ) trailed by from three",

New york &#124; new york ( reuters ) - new jersey governor chris christie is a rising star of the republican party seen as having a shot at a white house run, raising questions whether his obesity could impede his chances. American views on overweight candidates may help determine the political future of christie, an alternative to fit fellow-republican sarah palin. While americans like female candidates slim, they seem to better tolerate their male politicians on the heavy side. Christie rose to prominence on the national scene after his 2009 election when he closed an $ 11 billion deficit on a $ 29 billion budget while putting a cap on property tax increases. Now a recent zogby poll of hypothetical republican candidates showed him first in the field, ahead of palin, and the only republican beating president barack obama. Although bill clinton was teased for being overweight, america has not had a truly obese president since william howard taft a century ago. \" image does matter.... That is something that is in the voters'subconscious whether they want to admit it or not, \" said patrick murray, director of new jersey's monmouth university polling institute.

You were humiliated. \" he staunchly defended new white house press secretary sean spicer, saying it was a \" badge of honor \" to have the media question his integrity. \" the media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work, \" bannon said. At cnn, jake tapper's response to bannon's request to shut up was a simple \" no, \" while the aclu tweeted that it will see the trump administration in court if it tries to shut the media up. Erik wemple at the washington post wrote that since bannon \" helmed a campaign heavy on deceit, division, and cynicism, we don't want any praise from his likes. \"",

The \" modern use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may have advantages in a connected world, \" researcher dr. Andrew przybylski tells the paper. But his study in the journal psychological science didn't measure whether kids ' physical health was damaged by time spent on devices, or the cumulative effect of several devices. Researchers agreed that using devices to avoid exercise or social interactions was not good. Previous research has found that too much time on devices can shrink kids ' brain, hype them up, and disrupt sleep, notes the telegraph. Przybylski was among a group of experts who signed an open letter in the guardian last week disputing a plea issued by other experts urging policymakers take action against excessive screen time they said was hurting kids.

        "summary": "Did william shakespeare pen double falsehood after all? texas researchers say he probably did after comparing the play to \" psychological signatures \" they worked up for the bard, lewis theobald ( the supposed author ), and shakespeare contemporary john fletcher. The study, published in psychological science, used text-analyzing software and psychological theory to analyze the 1728 play, which theobald supposedly based on three original shakespeare manuscripts. The authorship has long been debated, with some believing theobald adapted it from shakespeare's works, others arguing it was written by shakespeare, and still others theorizing that theobald wrote it himself and just said he'd based it on shakespeare. To get the the bottom of it, university of texas at austin researchers considered 33 plays by shakespeare, 12 by theobald, and nine by fletcher. They ran them through a program that looked for word patterns ( e.g., use of \" function \" words like pronouns and prepositions ) and thematic categories, like religion or family. They also focused on how analytical or socially inclined each text was, then combined all the features to set up a psych profile for each writer, which they then compared to double falsehood. Study author ryan boyd says in a press release he \" had just kind of assumed that it was going to be a pretty cut and dry case of a fake shakespeare play \" — and yet shakespeare emerged as the most likely match, though the analysis showed fletcher's influence on the play's two final acts. A university of nottingham professor who has long contended that fletcher and shakespeare wrote the play together says, per the independent, \" i think that shakespeare's dna can be found in the play, so anything that supports that view is good. \" ( among the odder shakespeare studies: the bard is why you hate zits. )",

Abstract more than 100 years after shakespeare's death, lewis theobald published double falsehood, a play supposedly sourced from a lost play by shakespeare and john fletcher. Since its release, scholars have attempted to determine its true authorship. Using new approaches to language and psychological analysis, we examined double falsehood and the works of theobald, shakespeare, and fletcher. Specifically, we created a psychological signature from each author's language and statistically compared the features of each signature with those of double falsehood's signature. Multiple analytic approaches converged in suggesting that double falsehood's psychological style and content architecture predominantly resemble those of shakespeare, showing some similarity with fletcher's signature and only traces of theobald's. Closer inspection revealed that shakespeare's influence is most apparent early in the play, whereas fletcher's is most apparent in later acts.

The findings are published in psychological science, a journal of the association for psychological science. \"research in psychology has shown that some of the core features of who a person is at their deepest level can be revealed based on how they use language. With our new study, we show that you can actually take a lot of this information and put it all together at once to understand an author like shakespeare rather deeply, \" says researcher ryan boyd of the university of texas at austin. The study, conducted in collaboration with james pennebaker, also at ut-austin, goes beyond examining authorship from the standpoint of word counts and linguistic regularities, providing a deeper exploration of an author's psychological profile. \"this research shows that it is indeed possible to start modeling peoples ' mental worlds in much more complete ways.

Multiple analytic approaches converged in suggesting that double falsehood's psychological style and content architecture predominantly resemble those of shakespeare, showing some similarity with fletcher's signature and only traces of theobald's. Closer inspection revealed that shakespeare's influence is most apparent early in the play, whereas fletcher's is most apparent in later acts. Double falsehood has a psychological signature consistent",
            "News shakespeare's plays reveal his psychological signature shakespeare is such a towering literary figure that any new insight into the man, or his work, tends to generate a jolt of excitement in academic and non-academic communities of shakespeare aficionados. Applying psychological theory and text-analyzing software, researchers at the university of texas at austin have discovered a unique psychological profile that characterizes shakespeare's established works, and this profile strongly identifies shakespeare as an author of the long-contested play double falsehood. The findings are published in psychological science, a journal of the association for psychological science. \"research in psychology has shown that some of the core features of who a person is at their deepest level can be revealed based on how they use language. With our new study, we show that you can actually take a lot of this information and put it all together at once to understand an author like shakespeare rather deeply, \" says researcher ryan boyd of the university of texas at austin. The study, conducted in collaboration with james pennebaker, also at ut-austin, goes beyond examining authorship from the standpoint of word counts and linguistic regularities, providing a deeper exploration of an author's psychological profile. \"this research shows that it is indeed possible to start modeling peoples ' mental worlds in much more complete ways.

What is known, however, is that the man believed to have been the source of the information promised is an expert in kompromat, which the new york times describes as \" the russian art of spreading damaging information to discredit a rival or an enemy. \" indeed, yuri chaika exploited kompromat back in the 1990s to become one of the most powerful figures in russia's justice system, claiming a video leaked to russia's state media showed then-prosecutor general yuri skuratov in bed with two women, though skuratov denied he was the man featured, reports the times. Skuratov, who was investigating then-president boris yeltsin for corruption, was subsequently relieved of his position, which chaika took on temporarily. Chaika was again named prosecutor general in 2006 after a nomination from russian president vladimir putin, who would later award him for services to the state, reports newsweek. In an email exchange ahead of the june 2016 meeting, publicist rob goldstone told trump jr. That \" the crown prosecutor of russia \" had offered to pass incriminating information on clinton through veselnitskaya. Since there is no crown prosecutor in russia, it's believed he was referring to chaika, whom veselnitskaya was working with in an attempt to repeal the us law known as the magnitsky act, per the wall street journal.",

So say researchers at the university of aberdeen after examining mri scans of the hearts of patients with takotsubo syndrome, otherwise known as broken-heart syndrome. The syndrome, which nine out of 10 times is found in women and seven times out of 10 times is directly linked to an emotional stressor, like the death of a loved one, happens when the heart is literally stunned, per bustle. This causes a change in the heart's pumping and squeezing motions and results in tiny scarring that makes the organ more stiff and not able to contract properly, reports the bbc. Symptoms are similar to cardiac arrest. For the latest study, published in the journal of the american society of echocardiography, researchers found that in the 52 participants with the syndrome whose hearts they examined, the damage was not as temporary as previously thought. \" this disease has much longer lasting damaging effects on the hearts of those who suffer from it, \" the lead researcher says. In some patients, these heart abnormalities last at least four months after the trigger, suggesting that there isn't always full recovery, or that it might be much slower than previously thought. The condition was first described in 1991 in japan, reports the guardian, and 3 % to 17 % of patients die within five years of being diagnosed. That's a similar survival rate to heart attack victims.

            "The actual facebook has been playing clumsy defense against the film, including having the real mr. Zuckerberg pop out of nowhere on \" oprah \" to donate $ 100 million to the schools of newark, but my hunch is that the company doesn't have much to worry about. Regardless of what the courts, the media or former partners say, mr. Zuckerberg's reign as boy-king of america's new capitalism will only grow. ( perhaps the company realized as much. On friday, mr. Zuckerberg made the smart move and attended a screening with other employees from facebook. Why pretend? ) however lacking mr. Zuckerberg may be in the social graces that drive civil society, he embodies the optimism and creativity of millennials. To many who will see the film, the spectacular ends make the means seem beside the point. As played in the film by jesse eisenberg and written by aaron sorkin, mr. Zuckerberg is a social autistic who pivots between brilliance and hubris on his way to becoming the youngest billionaire the world has seen. As the characters around him chatter and amble about, mr. Zuckerberg is often seen looking away, into a future that only he can see. And when people don't come around to that vision, he runs them over or blows past them. Whether you see those people as",
            "The ubiquitous social-networking site facebook has mushroomed into a global pop-culture phenomenon, since the site launched in 2004. So, perhaps it's not too surprising that the flick \" the social network, \" which is based on the rise of the social-media juggernaut, found a huge audience at the box office. The much-anticipated film, featuring performances from web-averse leading lad jesse eisenberg and pop hitmaker-turned-thespian justin timberlake, opened friday with $ 8 million. \" network \" kicked last week's box-office winner, \" wall street: money never sleeps, \" down to second place. The long-awaited sequel to the oliver stone-helmed 1987 stock-market tale rang up roughly $ 3.3 million in ticket sales. The numbers from friday's box-office showing bumped the michael douglas and shia labeouf vehicle's total estimated haul to just over $ 29 million.

Juan jasso — who's been pegged \" super juan \" in local media for his composure as he was verbally abused on a manchester tram tuesday by the apparently inebriated trio, ages 16, 18, and 20 — was filmed by another passenger on the crowded train after he raised the youths ' ire by telling them to watch their language, the guardian reports. \" you're not even from england, you little f --- ing immigrant. Get off the f --- ing tram now. Get back to africa, \" said one of the young men, while another splashed booze on jasso. Jasso then pointed out he had likely been in the uk longer than one of the youths had been alive, per the new york times. One commuter yelled after the three perpetrators as they disembarked, \" you are an absolute disgrace … to england. \" although it's technically true that jasso is an immigrant ( he came across the pond from brownsville, texas, 18 years ago ), the times points out that he doesn't fall under the umbrella of immigrants who usually face the wrath of xenophobes in europe — he's of mexican heritage, not middle eastern, african, or eastern european. And his pro-brexit stance — which he says was impacted somewhat by a military background that pushed a nationalistic stance — has surprised many britons who've come to defend him after the video made the news. But jasso notes that he thinks the men, who were arrested for their actions on charges of \" affray \" ( public fighting that disturbs the peace ), were an anomaly in the tolerant city of manchester. \" the people who attacked me probably had the same mentality before the brexit vote, \" he tells the times. \" my impression is that they were uneducated and ignorant. \" ( some brexit reactions railed against xenophobia. )",

More and more women are robbing banks for quick cash, south florida sun sentinel in a look at the trend, and it's completely devoid of the glam of yesteryear. Gone are the days where a battalion of masked gunmen swooped down on a branch and escaped into a getaway vehicle. Now robbers can enter a branch looking like a customer, pass a threatening note to a teller, and walk away with cash, no weapon needed. The heist is simply less dangerous than it used to be, penn state criminologist darrell steffensmeier tells the paper. In fact, fbi records show women across the us in 2015 committed 7.5 % of all bank robberies, still comprising a small minority but also up a dramatic 25 % from their 6 % share in 2005. \" i think [ the trend ] will continue increasing... Because of the nonviolent nature of the note-passing robbery, \" forensic sociologist rosemary erickson says. The payout tends to be small — the women committing most of the robberies the sentinel describes are walking out with less than $ 5,000, and they're often using the money to pay the bills. \" they are more likely to be robbing for personal financial needs, \" erickson says. \" being homeless, or single and alone, especially if they have children... They are literally robbing for pampers. \" ( this babysitter was on the job when she allegedly robbed a bank. )",

Between the beginning of 2016 and the end of october 2017, a 60 minutes investigation uncovered more than 100 serious mechanical incidents the airline experienced: from hydraulic leaks and air pressure loss in the cabin to rapid descents, aborted takeoffs, and more — including 60 unscheduled landings. The airline has just 99 planes, yet experienced 25 engine failures or malfunctions in two years, and its planes are three and a half times more likely than those of other carriers to experience \" serious in-flight mechanical failures, \" per the report. But allegiant air, a budget carrier based in las vegas, is one of the most profitable airlines in the us, even if most customers are unaware of those problems. A former member of the national transportation safety board says he won't fly the airline and encourages his family and friends not to fly it, either. The aviation experts 60 minutes spoke to during its 7-month investigation believe the problems stem from allegiant's ultra-low-cost fares; in order to keep them so affordable, the airline must keep its own costs down — and keep its planes flying as long as possible. Almost 30 % of its planes are mcdonnell-douglas md-80s, which are old and difficult to find parts for. Those planes, nearly all of which were bought secondhand from foreign airlines, are responsible for most of the problems the investigation uncovered. Some also fault the faa for being too lax in its oversight of the airline. Allegiant is calling the story a \" false narrative, \" while the ap reports shares of its parent company were down in early trading. See cbs news for more.",

        "summary": "About 25 years ago, astronomer carl sagan and his team noticed something a little odd about images coming back from the galileo spacecraft: they showed glints of light seemingly coming from earth. Now, a nasa study appears to have cracked the source of the mystery: floating ice crystals. In a news release, astronomers explain that the mysterious flashes were spotted again in images shot by a weather satellite launched by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in 2015. Sagan's team saw the flashes only over oceans, which could theoretically be explained by the sun reflecting off smooth patches of water. The problem? \" we found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well, \" says alexander marshak of nasa's goddard space flight center. Marshak's team then theorized that a different form of water might be responsible for the flashes — \" flecks of high-flying ice crystals in the atmosphere glinting in the sun, \" as live science puts it. They pored over data from all 866 flashes found in the images from the deep space climate observatory, or dscovr, and concluded that chunks of ice floating horizontally in the atmosphere were the culprit. One telltale clue, per tech times: the scientists found that the flashes seemed to occur around high-floating cirrus clouds, and those clouds are made up of ice crystals. \" the source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground, \" says marshak, per the release. ( in another new study, scientists say that the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs hit in the worst spot possible. )",

The pledge, which is being put forth by an iowa-based group called the family leader, is ostensibly primarily about marriage; it's called \"the marriage vow — a declaration of dependence upon marriage and family. \" but some, like thinkprogress, have been criticizing it for also including a clause condemning porn.

Other eyebrow-raising things the pledge calls for include: \" rejection of sharia islam \" ( though a later clause calls for a \"fierce defense \" of \"religious liberty \" ) \"recognition that robust childbearing and reproduction is beneficial \" to the us support for a \"cooling-off \" period for anyone wanting a divorce \"vigorous opposition \" to any recognition of \"unions which are bigamous, polygamous, polyandrous, same-sex, etc. \"",

The statement did not provide details on when or if duterte would visit washington, but it said trump is looking forward to his philippines trip in november. This man compares himself to hitler this man compares himself to hitler 01: 21 this man compares himself to hitler the invitation spurred questions about whether the white house should extend a visit to a leader who has been much criticized for alleged human rights abuses, such as extrajudicial killings in duterte's war on drugs. Priebus agreed that human rights matter but he argued that the north korean problem takes precedence. \" the issues facing us developing out of north korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row, \" he said. \" we have got to be on the same page. \" escalating tensions with north korea the us military has moved an aircraft carrier strike group into the region, docked a powerful nuclear"

Satellite images collected between 1983 and 2009 show two trends: clouds have been migrating away from the equator toward the earth's poles, and the tops of those clouds are reaching higher into the atmosphere, say the scientists behind the study in nature. Add it up and it amounts to what the washington post calls \" one of the most profound planetary changes yet to be caused by a warming climate. \" clouds moving toward the poles means that dry zones in mid-latitude areas are expanding; clouds reaching higher means that a thicker cloud barrier has formed, one that traps heat radiation instead of letting it escape into space. The upshot is that both changes suggest clouds will worsen climate change instead of relieving it, reports the christian science monitor. \" i guess what was surprising is that a lot of times we think of climate change as something that's going to occur in the future, \" one of the researchers tells npr. \" this is happening right now. It's happened during my lifetime — it was a bit startling. \" climate change models had predicted this kind of thing would happen, but clouds are notoriously difficult to study and predict, and this study seems to be the first confirmation of it.

The deficit plummeted by more than a third in october, november, and december — the first three months of fiscal 2014 — the congressional budget office announced yesterday, reuters reports. In fact, december actually saw the government run a $ 44 billion surplus, and while that was a one-time thing that, according to the la times, \" resulted from some special circumstances, \" it's still a good sign. From october to december of 2012, the government had a $ 293 billion deficit, compared to $ 182 billion this time around — even though 2012 saw a december revenue surge from wealthy individuals hoping to avoid a 2013 tax bump. About 40 % of the improvement came from revenue gains, while the rest came from spending cuts. And if the economy continues to grow at its current rate, the deficit should keep declining all year.

            "Outgoing federal reserve chairman ben bernanke hinted last month that the u.s. Deficit is now coming down too fast. ( andrew harrer, bloomberg / ) washington — the capital may be enduring a brief spell of record-low temperatures this week, but the federal deficit continues to melt away. According to the latest figures from the nonpartisan congressional budget office, the red ink for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, which began oct. 1, dropped by almost 40 % compared with the same period a year earlier. The deficit has gone down so much that the federal government actually ran a surplus for december — a one-time occurrence that resulted from some special circumstances but still an indicator of the rapidly improving state of the government's finances.

( andrew harrer, bloomberg / ) washington — the capital may be enduring a brief spell of record-low temperatures this week, but the federal deficit continues to melt away. According to the latest figures from the nonpartisan congressional budget office, the red ink for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, which began oct. 1, dropped by almost 40 % compared with the same period a year earlier. The deficit has gone down so much that the federal government actually ran a surplus for december — a one-time occurrence that resulted from some special circumstances but still an indicator of the rapidly improving state of the government's finances.

As originally reported by the texas lawyer website tuesday, terry lee morris, who'd been found guilty of sex crimes against a child and given a 60-year prison sentence, will receive a new trial after the 8th court of appeals in texas found judge george gallagher ordered his bailiff to administer electric shocks to morris for not answering questions the way gallagher wanted, per the bbc. The shocks — which the court's feb. 28 ruling on courthouse news service says were delivered three times \" as a show of the court's power \" — were administered via a stun belt, a device the bbc and washington post report is sometimes used in courtrooms in texas'tarrant county if defendants become violent or try to flee. Per transcripts cited by the post, gallagher warned morris during the trial about his \" outbursts \" and finally ordered the shocks with a \" hit him \" to the bailiff when morris wouldn't stop talking. Morris says he was so frightened by the experience he never went back to court for the rest of his trial or sentencing, which the appeals court notes was a violation of his sixth amendment rights to be present at his own trial. Morris ' attorney, meanwhile, tells the texas lawyer he didn't think his client was really getting shocked, and that morris had acted \" like a loaded cannon ready to go off. \" the attorney adds to the star-telegram that he had tried to calm morris down and was \" scared to death of what morris might do. \" but the appeals court disagreed it was ok to shock morris, noting that courts must not \" allow practices like these to...

Terry lee morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge george gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one tarrant county in texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the texas eighth court of appeals in el paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 february that mr morris'shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the texas lawyer news website on tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial.",

            "Image copyright texas lawyer image caption judge george gallagher a texas appeals court has overturned a man's conviction after finding a judge had inappropriately electrified him in court, us media report. Terry lee morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years. Judge george gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions. The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court. Mr morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly. The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one tarrant county in texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent. Mr morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the texas eighth court of appeals in el paso heard. The appeals court ruled on 28 february that mr morris'shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the texas lawyer news website on tuesday. He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial.",

An la natural history museum trustee bet brian brown, the museum's entomology curator, that the city's smog-filled nooks were no place for new insect species to be found. The first bug brown caught proved to be previously undiscovered, inspiring the biodiversity science: city and nature project, a three-year experiment that ended up turning up not one, but 30 discrete flies from the megaselia species in the city, says a museum release. The bioscan study, set to be published april 6 in zootaxa, erected 30 \" sampling sites \" with traps and weather stations, recruiting 30 locals to offer their backyards as outdoor labs. \" i'd be less surprised to find hundreds of new species of megaselia at a remote site in costa rica than i was to find 30 new species right here in la, \" lead author emily hartop tells the washington post. Hartop analyzed more than 10,000 fly samples, and to figure out which species was which, she had to get a bit personal. \" i ' m going to say 90 % of our identification work focuses on [ genitalia ] for flies, \" she writes in an nhm blog post. ( interested parties can check out gizmodo's fly genitalia chart. ) she even came up with pet names: \" this one's genitalia look like bunny ears, i ' ll name it ' bunny,'this one has setae … that remind me of a 1980s troll doll, i ' ll name it'troll, ' \" she says. Not only did this report prove biodiversity doesn't have to take place on a lush, tropical isle — it also offers hope of finding even more hidden creatures in urban areas. Fringe benefit for volunteers: each new species was named after the participant in whose yard it was found. ( but do the flies have individual personalities like cockroaches do? )",

The discovery is about 2,000 feet from a pyramid recently unearthed at the ancient royal site of dahshur, south of cairo. Inside a chamber at the necropolis, diggers found a wooden box engraved with hieroglyphs containing four canopic jars filled with organs. Egypt's ministry of antiquities says in a release the tomb's occupant was likely the daughter of king emnikamaw of the 13th dynasty; the organs are likely hers, reports the bbc. Last month, archaeologists uncovered a relief with 10 lines of hieroglyphs and emnikamaw's name, along with the remains of a sarcophagus. One of the most impressive sites in egypt, dahshur sits on the west bank of the nile river and is perhaps best known as home to the 341-foot red pyramid, the first smooth-sided pyramid, per the bbc. King sneferu, of the 4th dynasty, built it some 4,600 years ago, along with the nearby sharp-angled bent pyramid. Sneferu's heir, khufu, built the great pyramid of giza, the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world. ( this \" impressive \" pharaoh statue was found in a cairo slum. )",

There are certainly reasons to be concerned about these scanners, including how horrifically expensive they are. But these photos were misleading and not reflective of what can actually be done with tsa porn. Neither gizmodo nor drudge have acknowledged that the photos they posted were fake, though gizmodo commenters have pointed it out. Gizmodo titled its post: \"is it this easy to pull straight nude pics from airport scanners?",
            "S the drudge report has an image of a woman from an airport scanner up right now. It's scandalous enough as is, but it's shockingly easy to make it look even more like a normal nude photograph. Updated view gallery » reader sigfried discovered that by simply inverting the image in photoshop, you restore the photo to a more realistic tint. Of course, we're not sure where this image came from or if it's an accurate example of what these machines produce. But if so, let me just deliver a message to all you airport security workers out there: i just got out of a cold pool, i swear. Update: fear not, these aren't real. Your nipples are safe, for now."

That was the experience on a southwest airlines flight from atlanta to houston last week, nbc news reports, when retired air force col. Tom mccay fell unconscious as he and his wife were flying home to texas. Mccay tells kprc2 he began feeling \" clammy \" and \" dizzy \" during the flight, and the last thing he remembers before passing out was his frightened wife, maggie, asking if he was ok. She started yelling for assistance, and texas oral surgeon dr. Jeffrey aycock was one of the first to respond — followed by about 20 other doctors. Aycock and a few of the doctors stretched mccay across the seats so he could breathe better and so they could take his vitals and stabilize him. The other 15 or so doctors, meanwhile, hovered close by, ready to assist if needed. It wasn't just some weird coincidence that placed all of these medical professionals on board mccay's plane: they were returning from an annual conference in atlanta. While aycock thinks mccay may have fainted because he didn't have enough fluids during the flight, another doctor who helped speculates mccay may have mixed meds and alcohol. Mccay tells nbc he got checked out at debakey clinic in houston once he arrived home and will be self-monitoring. It turns out what happened to him has long been a dream: he'd always harbored a \" fantasy \" of rushing to help a pilot in distress. \" turns out it was me this time, \" he tells nbc.

        "summary": "After an elderly woman wouldn't leave the grounds of a boys and girls club in rural georgia last friday, police were called — and the situation culminated with martha al-bishara, 87, being tased. Cnn reports the 911 caller described al-bishara as walking on the bike trails while holding a knife, though the caller specified she wasn't trying to attack anyone. \" it looks like she's walking around looking for something, vegetation to cut down or something. She has a bag, too. \" the caller added that the woman said she doesn't speak english — wtvc reports al-bishara is from syria and speaks arabic — something the two chatsworth officers and police chief josh etheridge soon encountered. Per the police report, al-bishara was calm, but did not comply with requests that she drop the knife. Wtvc reports etheridge pulled out his own knife and dropped it as an example, \" trying to make her understand. \" as for what she was doing with the knife, martha douhne says her grandmother was cutting dandelions to put into a salad with what was a kitchen knife; al-bishara lives across the street, and wtvc notes there were no signs marking the property she was found on as being owned by the boys and girls club. Etheridge says the officers opted for the \" least force necessary \" in striking the woman in the chest with the taser from a distance of about 15 feet. Douhne complains emts weren't called by the officers. Al-bishara has been charged with criminal trespass and obstructing an officer. Etheridge says an internal use-of-force review is underway, per the ap.",

That one-week increase of 493,000, or 207 %, is the biggest since nielsen soundscan began tracking such things in 1991.

It's also the biggest grammy bump of the past 21 years, easily outdoing norah jones ' come away with me ( 621,000 in 2003 ) and carlos santana's supernatural ( 583,000 in 2000 ).
