Orwell's 1984, first published in 1949, is now at no. 1 on amazon.com's best-seller list and publisher penguin is planning to print another 75,000 copies to meet demand, according to the hollywood reporter. The surge in sales follows kellyanne conway's claim that the trump administration was presenting \" alternative facts \" instead of falsehoods, an assertion critics described as distinctly orwellian. The book hit no. 6 on the list on monday and reached no. 1 tuesday night, reports the telegraph, which notes conway's comments inspired social media users to share 1984 quotes including: \" the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command. \" the ap reports that sinclair lewis ' 1935 novel about an authoritarian president, it can't happen here, is at no. 46 on amazon's list, with aldous huxley's brave new world at no. 71 and hannah arendt's the origins of totalitarianism also performing strongly. Trump's art of the deal, meanwhile, is at no. 31. ( orwell's classic also surged during the 2013 nsa surveillance controversy. )",

It pummeled the mississippi coast with relentless roundhouse jabs, while pinning southern louisiana under a saturating rainfall. On its crawl up from the coast, isaac dumped more than a foot of rain in some places and shoved before it a violent storm surge that would soon bring back the terrible old images of 2005: people marooned on",
            "At 1 a.m. Cdt, tropical storm isaac is moving toward the northwest at about 5 mph. This general motion is expected to continue today followed by a turn toward the north-northwest by tonight or early friday. The maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph with higher gusts. The strongest winds are primarily occurring over water or near the coast. Steady weakening is expected during the next 48 hours as isaac continues to move over land. Isaac should become a tropical depression by tonight. Even though isaac is no longer a hurricane, life threatening hazards from storm surge and inland flooding are still occurring",

            "Isaac moved water this morning into eastern plaquemines parish, stranding residents and leading to massive rescue and flood control efforts throughout the day. But less noticed was the massive deluge of water pushed on large portions of western st. Bernard, flooding affecting large portions of the about 80-mile stretch from jesuit bend to port sulphur. The majority of that flooding occurred for north of myrtle grove down past pointe-a-la-hache, where nearly 10 feet of water laid over portions of communities and about 5 feet of water turned that section of louisiana 23 - the only way up and down western plaquemines - into a river."

A third suspect, a 32-year-old woman, was also arrested, but she has not been named.

The vermont senator was actually booed wednesday during what politico calls a \" tense \" q&a in which house democrats turned the screw on sanders to drop out of the race and offer his unequivocal support for hillary. Sanders'response ( and the line that got booed ), per multiple sources who were at the closed caucus meeting: \" the goal isn't to win elections, the goal is to transform america. \" it was a reaction that only exacerbated the frustration of party members ready to pull together a united front to take on donald trump. Cnn notes that, until now, many democrats haven't wanted to publicly chastise sanders for continuing his campaign because they don't want to alienate his supporters. But on wednesday, \" he went in there with his canned talking points from the stump, \" an anonymous source who was in the meeting tells the los angeles times. \" people just weren't having it. \" some of the attendees even started chanting, \" timeline! timeline! \" when they thought sanders was evading questions and hyperfocusing on platform items he wanted to talk about, which included trade, climate change, minimum wage, and what sanders believes is an unfair superdelegate process. Ohio rep. Joyce beatty told the senator she felt \" like a hostage \" due to his platform demands, a source who was present tells the washington post. Sanders did have at least one supporter: a representative from his own state. \" a lot of members are anxious about when is he going to explicitly support hillary, \" pete welch tells politico. \" but if we want to win, we've got to take the long view that we need a platform that is going to genuinely create excitement for our nominee. \"",

She has been chased by opium farm guards with ak-47s ( \" i remember making sure my team [ was ] ok, and then having to wander away from them and having an emotional moment to myself \" ), encircled by three lions at her campfire in the namibian desert ( \" it was almost like an out-of-body experience... Their muscles rippling \" ), and eaten fertilized eggs with bear grylls, which she says are far worse than maggots, which have the benefit of being \" quite cheesy. \" as for breaking gender expectations, hines says: \" there isn't a place for macho style in survival because that sort of behavior gets you and other people killed or injured. \" ( grylls ' kid saved a girl when he was just 7. )",

The men are part of a renegade amish sect led by apparent revenge-seeking bishop sam mullet, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. Two of mullet's sons were among those arrested in connection with the attacks, in which groups of men wielding scissors and electric clippers allegedly forced their way into victims ' homes to clip off their beards and hair. Members of other amish groups describe mullet's 18 family-strong group as a cult, a description the bishop firmly rejects. He denies ordering the beard-cuttings, but says he should be allowed to punish people as he chooses. \" you have your laws on the road and the town — somebody doesn't obey them, you punish them. But i ' m not allowed to punish the church people? \" he tells ap. \" i just let them run over me? if every family would just do as they pleased, what kind of church would we have? \"",

Among those he calls out is david brooks of the new york times, who last week called trump's candidacy a \" joe mccarthy moment \" for the party. But feehery also cites comments of a similar nature from the likes of george will ( see here ), michael gerson ( here ), and ross douthat ( here ), all of whom seem to think that trump is the personification of evil who will do long-term damage to the gop unless stopped. \" to these so-called smart people, i say: stop being so stupid, \" writes feehery. This opposition to trump reveals \" their biases against democracy and the will of the people, \" he argues. Instead of knocking him down, they should pay more attention to why trump is so popular, writes feehery, who provides some theories of his own: trump is a \" real outsider who represents real change, \" he has explicitly denounced the iraq war as a mistake, and his economic message ( \" the middle class is getting screwed by the political class \" ) is resonating. Most trump supporters \" are by no means stupid, irrational, racist or anti-democratic, \" writes feehery. They're just tired of the status quo and see trump as the only candidate who can destroy it.

Two neat factoids: it's actually firm, with a compact surface of densely packed flowering buds on long stems, so you can lie back on it. And it grows incredibly slowly — like about half an inch per year — so what did your random llareta do last century? oh, grew a little less than a yard-and-a-half. What's more, the dry desert plant makes for fine kindling. So yes, llareta plants that pre-date the golden age of greece are regularly used to start campfires in chile's atacama desert. It's good for muscle pain too, according to a bolivian guide's youtube video. Thinking of going there? the atacama is home to other offbeat finds, like an ancient whale graveyard and so-called \" white gold. \" but if llareta is what grabs you, check out photos in the book the oldest living things in the world, which looks at continuously living things dating back at least 2,000 years, the washington post reports.",

Bartlomiej plebanczyk on friday told his country's tvn24 he's \" almost certain \" the amber room, a chamber made of gold leaf and amber panels, lies under an old world war ii german bunker in northern poland. Plebanczyk's theory was born out of his use of ground-penetrating radar at the site, he tells the mirror, which reports the previously unknown room measures only 65 square feet. \" we need to drill into the room in the bunker and lower a camcorder there, \" says plebanczyk, who feels confident he ' ll find the amber room, which is valued at around $ 500 million and was stolen by the nazis from russia's catherine palace in 1941, the ap reports. The nazis carted the room to what was the german region of koenigsberg, which the british bombed repeatedly in 1944. The bunker is about 60 miles from there, near the polish village of mamerki, and the entire bunker-and-tunnel complex once held 250 german buildings where 40 senior nazi officers and 1,500 other men lived. The other evidence cited by plebanczyk, who heads the mamerki museum? he says a resident claimed to see german trucks carting big cases to a bunker there immediately after the war. And in the 1960s, other residents said erich koch — a senior nazi who reportedly knew the room's location — was taken to the site from a prison in poland where he was serving time for crimes during the war. But the telegraph notes that the soviets themselves concluded the british bombing, or perhaps even russian shelling, likely obliterated the amber room.

Berlin ( reuters ) - a pensioner has started digging in germany's western ruhr region for the amber room, a priceless work of art looted by nazis from the soviet union during world war two and missing for 70 years, but says he needs a new drill to help him. Dubbed the eighth wonder of the world, the amber room was an ornate chamber made of amber panels given to czar peter the great by prussia's friedrich wilhelm i in 1716.

The 18th-century amber room, made of amber panels and gold leaf, was fitted into russia's catherine palace near st. Petersburg, where it remained until it was looted by germany's nazis in 1941.

The good news: the rate of deforestation worldwide has been halved over the last 25 years. The bad news: we lost 500,000 square miles of forest — an area twice the size of texas, or equal to 1 % of the planet's land area — in that time, reports the washington post. The bbc reports the losses were mostly in africa, southeast asia, and south america, which lost 3.5 million hectares annually from 1990 to 2000. However, just 2.1 million hectares have been lost in south america annually since 2010. \" even though, globally, the extent of the world's forest continues to decline... The rate of net forest loss has been cut by over 50 %, \" the report states, per the guardian. Just 0.08 % of forests are now disappearing annually, down from 0.18 % in the 1990s. \" the direction of change is positive \" but this trend \" needs to be strengthened, especially in the countries that are lagging behind, \" fao's director general says. Climate change is still a major concern as deforestation has released an average of 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year from 1990; total carbon emissions in 2014 reached 32.3 billion tons. Climate change also raises the risk of droughts and fires, which further harm forests. Should we let off conservation efforts, we could lose 170 million hectares in 20 years, according to the world wildlife fund. \" fundamental changes in how we think about forests are needed. And they are needed in the next few years, \" a rep says. \" otherwise, we will continue to lose forests at a rate of eight football fields every 10 seconds. \" ( the planet has only half as many trees as when humans began farming. )",

Those people and their pyramids fell, and fast, with 10 % of the local population murdered in a day as their pyramids were torched into oblivion. But as legend has it, one mud-brick pyramid was hidden, perhaps accidentally by vegetation, and was for centuries mistaken for a mountain, until locals began to construct an insane asylum in 1910. That's when they discovered the largest monument ever constructed anywhere in the world. Tlachihualtepetl, or the great pyramid of cholula, stands more than 200 feet tall and nearly 1,500 feet wide, dwarfing the great pyramid of giza in volume, reports the bbc. The spaniards settled in cholula and kept up with the local affinity for religious monuments, erecting enough churches so that there is now at least one for every day of the year. But when they built the iglesia de nuestra señora de los remediosa on what they believed was a big hill, they were actually placing a sort of ornamental top on what is in reality a pyramid setup modeled similarly to russian stacking dolls, this one stacked at least six pyramids high. The original is thought to date back to around 300 bc, with each successive pyramid built over it by future civilizations. Today the \" odd landmark \" doesn't look like much more than a \" grassy pre-hispanic pyramid, \" as afar magazine reports, but the marketplace that winds up from the pyramid's base to the church at its top is a testament to its exceptional endurance.

John kerry, meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in paris, said ceasefires in aleppo and damascus are under consideration, as are prisoner swaps and the creation of humanitarian corridors, reports the bbc. But president assad's government scoffed at the paris talks, saying they were \" closer to illusions than reality. \" in other details: lavrov questioned whether the west would stand firm amid vicious syrian fighting. \" there are many terrorists in syria and they are becoming more numerous, \" lavrov said. \" we do not want a cease-fire which would be used by terrorist groups. \" kerry also met with ahmad al-jarba, president of the us-backed syrian opposition coalition. The coalition has said that long, fruitless peace talks would only undermine its influence, the new york times reports. The group will decide by friday whether to attend. ( assad's government says it will send a delegation. ) the un, russia, and the us openly disagree about whether iran should be invited. The un and russia are in favor, and the us opposed, saying iran can't attend without agreeing to the purpose of the talks: creating a transitional body that would oversee syria if assad steps down.

And, in fact, the name of his cryptic new website sounds strikingly similar to the cult tv show: x.com, which gizmodo reports he launched under cover of darkness early friday morning. \" it's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow, \" the space x and tesla ceo joked ( we think ) in a tweet, referring to the fact that the website currently hosts just one piece of content on it — a tiny letter \" x \" in the upper left-hand corner on the home page. Musk apparently used to own the domain when he was a co-chief at paypal, but he lost it when he left the company. \" we are delighted to sell the domain x.com back to its previous owner, elon musk, \" a paypal rep said last week after the sale, per business insider. A domain management expert tells quartz the domain, which musk said had \" sentimental value \" in a tweet last week, may have been rescooped up by him for eight figures ( so maybe $ 10 million or so ). Gizmodo unpacks the history of single-letter domain names, the sale of which were nixed in 1993; there are just six that were grandfathered in, with q.com and z.com being the only other.com ones. Meanwhile, everyone remains puzzled by musk's new baby, with mashable even digging into the source code to see if it could find any clues — but instead of \" hidden wizardry, \" all that was uncovered was \" good old classic html \" setting up that small letter on the screen. Everyone's having a bit of fun imagining what will appear next on the site, with suggestions ranging from a capital \" x \" to a showcase for tesla's model x suv to gizmodo's theory that musk could \" build the website one letter at a time. \"",

Root, he said, was \" just one more american life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. \" trump said a \" border crosser \" had killed root, though he didn't provide details, and the washington post fills in some background: police say that 19-year-old eswin mejia, an undocumented immigrant from honduras, was drunk when he slammed his pickup truck into the back of root's suv at a high rate of speed in january of this year. Mejia, who was believed to be drag racing at the time, posted bond days later and hasn't been seen since. Root was from council bluffs, iowa, and had graduated from bellevue university near omaha the day before the crash. Related coverage: mejia entered the country illegally as a 16-year-old in 2013, and border agents first encountered him nogales, ariz. He was designated an unaccompanied child and sent to live with his brother in advance of an immigration hearing, reports fox news. The family eventually moved from tennessee to omaha. Why was he allowed to post bail after the accident? \" a world-herald review of mejia's case shows a systemic failure — from county pretrial release staff to the county judge to federal immigration enforcement officials — to ensure that the man charged with felony motor-vehicle homicide in root's death would answer in court to the charge. \" the des moines register also did a deep dive into the case, reporting that, prior to the fatal crash, mejia had failed to appear in court for two earlier driving infractions. See more details about root and the case at heavy.com. Root's family released a statement thanking trump for mentioning her, per kmtv. A critic at slate, however, thinks \" the way trump's speech uses her death is one of the greatest shames of this convention. \" read it here.",

You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can bring our whole selves to work. \" the tweet got mixed reactions, but many of them were positive, with people sharing stories of companies that don't have the same attitude toward mental health days — and personal examples of why it's so important to change that. Parker herself has shared before about the struggle to balance mental health with work. One person pointed out that \" a day off now and then \" for mental health might \" save someone from being gone for weeks if not months. \" and after some users asked why parker felt the need to make her private reasons for being out of the office public, she noted that she wanted her team to know they could also take sick leave for mental health reasons — even if they don't feel comfortable specifically explaining that's what they're doing.

The retro report video about the lawsuit featured here this week has been watched more than a million times on several websites and attracted hundreds of comments, many vehement. The documentary, which i produced over months of reporting, showed that many misconceptions had arisen since a 79-year-old woman, stella liebeck, ordered coffee at a mcdonald's drive-through, spilled the coffee, suffered severe burns, sued the company and was given a jury award of $ 2.9 million, later reduced to about $ 500,000.

That would be the fastest quarterly growth this year, beating the commerce department's initial estimate of 2 percent. \"the economy's momentum has picked up a bit \" as the fundamentals of the private sector \"are improving, \" said jan hatzius, chief economist at goldman sachs in new york.

Help is coming from a housing recovery, strengthening job market and healthier household finances that are driving gains in consumer confidence and spending.

        "summary": "The new white house plan to prevent school shootings doubles down on arming teachers but backs away from gun control measures. The new justice department program announced sunday includes help for states to provide \" rigorous firearms training \" to teachers and support for military veterans and retired cops who want to become teachers, politico reports. The administration says education secretary betsy devos will chair a federal commission on school safety that will look into issues including mental health programs, background checks, school discipline programs, violent video games, and the impact of press coverage, the washington post reports. The administration, which says president trump has made school safety a priority after last month's mass shooting in florida, is also urging states to pass risk-protection orders that will make it easier to take guns away from dangerous individuals. \" today we are announcing meaningful actions, steps that can be taken right away to help protect students, \" devos told reporters sunday night. But the white house proposals were slammed for failing to include trump's earlier proposal to raise the age limit for buying assault weapons from 18 to 21, the ap reports. Senate minority leader chuck schumer described the plan as \" tiny baby steps designed not to upset the nra, when the gun violence epidemic in this country demands that giant steps be taken. \"",

        "summary": "A huge tsunami apparently struck an island off the coast of africa in prehistoric times — and if so, people living on islands and coastlines today should take care for their safety. According to a new study, a tsunami over 50 stories high swept through the cape verdean island of santiago about 73,000 years ago and tossed around boulders weighing as much as 770 tons, livescience reports. The apparent cause isn't too unusual: a volcanic landslide, or so-called \" flank collapse \" that occurs when a volcano's slopes give way, notes the guardian. Yet the volcano, called fogo, is 34 miles away, and scientists have been unsure whether volcanic collapses can cause tsunamis that travel so far across open seas. In fact, lead author ricardo ramalho was baffled when he saw the gigantic boulders so far inland on santiago. As popular science puts it, how could \" enormous, truck-sized hunks of striated limestone and submarine basalts \" be found up to 2,000 feet inland when the boulders matched rocks on the island's shore? \" we got really excited when we realized that the only way to explain the origin of those boulders was with a massive tsunami impact, \" ramalho says. His team dated the event based on isotopes in the boulders — which change while the rock is exposed to open air — and said fogo, which remains active, may be to blame. Now they're analyzing whether volcanic collapses might trigger other long-range tsunamis. \" there is a growing awareness that extreme geohazards such as these will eventually, one day happen, \" ramalho says, \" so we might as well coolly and realistically see what can be done to mitigate their effects. \" ( visit an island near india, and \" you may not leave alive. \" )",

Scientists have found evidence that a tsunami triggered by a volcanic collapse swept huge boulders like this one into the highlands of the island of santiago. A mega tsunami taller than a 50-story skyscraper once engulfed an island off the west coast of africa, researchers say. This finding suggests the giant landslides and killer waves that such tsunamis can trigger might pose a major hazard to people living on islands and coasts, scientists added. Tsunamis are monster waves that are often caused by earthquakes. The 2004 banda aceh earthquake and tsunami killed about 250,000 people, while the 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami that struck offshore of japan killed about 20,000 people and triggered a nuclear catastrophe. Not all tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. Some of these giant waves are caused by landslides, for instance, those occurring in submarine canyons or on the flanks of volcanoes. For example, in 1792, part of japan's mount unzen collapsed, resulting in waves as high as 300 feet ( 90 meters ) that killed about 15,000 people. In 1958, an earthquake sent a landslide into alaska's isolated lituya bay, generating a titanic wave 1,724 feet",

Jeffs, the 57-year-old brother of polygamist warren jeffs and a leader of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, was captured in south dakota late wednesday and is being held at minnehaha county jail in sioux falls, report the salt lake tribune and fox 13. Details about how he was captured weren't immediately made public. Apart from evading police, he's accused of involvement in a scheme to convert food stamps into cash for the church. One of 11 flds leaders arrested in utah in february 2016, jeffs was charged with fraud and money laundering. But weeks after a judge approved home monitoring — even though prosecutors claimed he was a flight risk — jeffs is thought to have used olive oil to slip out of an ankle monitor. Nine other church leaders have since pleaded guilty to charges and escaped jail time, while one had his charges dismissed, per the ap. But the fbi, which offered a $ 50,000 reward for information on jeffs — says he will stand trial. He could face an additional charge of fleeing to avoid prosecution.",

        "summary": "In a move to protest skyrocketing tomato prices in india, the indian national congress political party launched the \"state bank of tomato, \" a parody bank taking fruit deposits and distributing loans. But the political stunt by the youth wing of the opposition party has gained traction in uttar pradesh's capitol, lucknow, reports the times of india. Operating during typical business hours daily, the bank claims it will return five times an initial tomato deposit and provides loans to those who cannot afford the popular fruit at current market rates. Per the washington post, the hike in tomato prices, said to have quadrupled since june to $ 1.60 per kilogram, comes after a monsoon wreaked havoc on the crop. Though the prices will likely stabilize in a couple weeks, the toll of such a hike is being felt well beyond the country's poorest. As a result, people began lining up to use the bank in fear of having their tomatoes pilfered from their homes. Meanwhile, armed guards are watching over an indore market to protect vegetable traders following a mumbai \"tomato heist, \" where more than 30 crates were stolen. \"i ' m 103 years old. I never thought [ i'd ] have to see this, \" says bank customer srikrishna verma; the indian express reports that he deposited 1.1 pounds of tomatoes and expects a return of 2.2 pounds after six months.

            "Tucson -- a federal judge could sentence a mexican national monday to up to 30 years to life in prison for the 2010 killing of border patrol agent brian a. Terry just south of tucson, a slaying that led to the unraveling of the failed federal gun-tracking operation known as fast and furious. Manuel osorio-arellanes pled guilty in october 2012 to first-degree murder. He was part of a group of bandits who engaged in a shootout with terry and three other border patrol agents in southern arizona. Terry's mother, josephine terry, is expected to testify before the court, a family spokesperson said in a prepared statement. Terry's sisters, brother and chairman of the brian terry foundation are also expected to show at the sentencing. In a prepared statement, terry's sister kelly terry-willis stressed the importance of border security before consideration of any immigration overhaul. \"i understand the need for compassion, but first we must address this dire public safety issue so that the men and women of the border patrol who worked with my brother will not unnecessarily be in harm's way, \" she said.

Now a change.org petition asking for ceo ellen pao to \" step down \" has racked up nearly 160,000 signatures, claiming pao has sent reddit into a \" new age of censorship \" since she was named interim ceo in november. \" a vast majority of the reddit community believes that pao, ' a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top, ' has overstepped her boundaries and fears that she will run reddit into the ground, \" the petition reads. It was started more than three weeks ago, cnet notes, but gained momentum after taylor's departure led to angry moderators shutting down almost 300 subreddits, including the ama subreddit, reports the times. Pao was unpopular in the reddit community even before taylor's dismissal: last month she banned some subreddits for harassing behavior, which led to people harassing pao, per the washington post. But moderators say the taylor firing especially \" blindsided \" them, npr notes, as taylor played an \" essential role \" in the sections she oversaw. \" i want to apologize to our community, \" pao acknowledged to time on friday. \" we handled the transition in a way that caused some disruption, and we should have done a better job. \" she adds they should have kept moderators ( mostly unpaid volunteers ) in the loop and that they can look forward to improved tools.

Cornejo's father rushed in to try save them — even though he couldn't swim. Soon he was in trouble, too. That's when surfer tony barbero, 17, came to the rescue, grabbing the cousin. \" i take [ the boy ] on my surf board, i paddle him in. And once he's in … i look back out and i see the dad and he's just bobbing up and down in the water. \" he gave the boy the board, and swam back out to save the father.

This time, he says he has been practicing open-water swimming for hours every day to deal with the physical challenges, and \" visualization and dissociation \" to occupy his mind during the long hours of swimming. Lecomte, who now lives in texas, tweeted monday that he'd been preparing for the swim for six years. He plans to swim for eight hours a day and sleep on an accompanying boat with a six-person crew — and will use gps to make sure that he sets off each day from where he finished the night before. He plans to use the swim to raise awareness of climate change and ocean pollution. His crew will collect around 1,000 water samples for scientific partners. Lecomte tells npr that his children will join him for the last leg of the 5,500-mile journey from choshi, near tokyo, to san francisco. \" they are with me right now, they were on the boat last night with me and they are going to be on the boat tonight, and love it, \" he says. \" we swim very often together, so we share the same passion. \" ( a 9-year-old swam from san francisco to alcatraz and back. )",

Puerto rico pulled the plug on the $ 300 million deal sunday, hours after gov. Ricardo rossello called for the move, reports the washington post. The contract between the puerto rico electric power authority and whitefish energy has been a continual source of controversy for the commonwealth, which is still struggling to restore electricity to 80 % of its residents more than a month after hurricane maria. When the hurricane hit, the 2-year-old whitefish only had two employees, raising questions as to why it was picked by prepa over other, more-established companies. The company's pay scales are also much higher than is common, and a clause in the contract prohibited oversight or review by fema. At the same time, questions have been raised about the possible involvement of interior secretary ryan zinke in the deal. Whitefish, mont., is zinke's hometown and one of his sons worked for whitefish energy last summer. Zinke, however, denied any involvement with the negotiations, calling any allegations to the contrary \" baseless, \" politico reports. The white house has also denied any involvement, pointing out that the contract was determined by prepa and that the federal government had no role. However, several congressional committees were investigating the agreement. One of whitefish's primary financial backers is joe colonnetta, who was a big financial contributor to president trump's 2016 campaign.",

Kenneth tarr, 32, allegedly called the likes of ex-tampa bay buccaneers and indianapolis colts coach tony dungy, offering him a head coach position at the university of southern california, nbc news reports. Others targets included minnesota vikings head coach leslie frazier, university of hawaii head coach norm chow, and cincinnati bengals offensive coordinator jay gruden. Tarr was arrested yesterday on suspicion of eavesdropping after he allegedly recorded the calls; recording without consent is illegal in california. He seems quite open about the pranks, having apparently written to deadspin boasting of them. \" i ' m amazed that they're returning any of these calls, \" he told deadspin's dom cosentino ( along with the \" most safe \" line above ). In an interview with abc news, tarr notes, \" andy kaufman, andy warhol, great, i ' m glad they existed, but they're nothing compared to me... People are not in on what i've accomplished. \" tarr previously made a name for himself by inventing fake personas that would get him on talk shows and other reality tv shows, as the village voice has reported; it called him \" one of the most prolific television hoaxers in us history. \" deadspin and the village voice have more on his backstory.",

The post calls the survey \" one of the most comprehensive polls of long-term opioid users to date. \" another 187 people who said they share a household with an opioid user were also surveyed, and their responses to the question of addiction or physical dependence were different from the users'responses: more than half of them suspected the users they live with are addicted, and they were also more likely to say that the drugs have caused harm to the users ' health, finances, or relationships. But, while the survey \" raises sharp questions about the responsibility of doctors for an epidemic of addiction and overdose that has claimed nearly 180,000 lives since 2000, \" as the post puts it, it also found that most long-term opioid users say the drugs improve their lives, allowing them to walk, work, and do other things that pain would otherwise prevent. Two-thirds of those surveyed said the risk of getting addicted was worth it because of how much relief the drugs offer. The survey results were released as the cdc announced opioid deaths ( from both prescription and illegal sources, such as heroin ) skyrocketed again last year. A new study is also out showing that doctors discussing the risks of opioid abuse with patients could reduce misuse and abuse. The post says about 5 % of us adults have used prescription opioids for at least two months during the past two years, and around half of those people say they've taken them for two years or more.

Yet there i was in the depths of a colombian bamboo forest, knocking back a liquid containing a psychoactive drug - under the supervision of a shaman who didn't speak a word of english. During my month in colombia i didn't join the thousands of backpackers indulging in the country's most famous product - cocaine. But i was sold on ayahuasca.

The group of republicans, led by lt. Gov. Casey cagle, the frontrunner in this year's gubernatorial election, have threatened to torpedo a measure that would have eliminated the state's tax on jet fuel, saving the atlanta-based airline tens of millions of dollars a year, cnn reports.

Nathan deal, is being blocked in the state senate and cagle says he will kill it and any other tax legislation that benefits delta \" unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the nra. \" delta is one of georgia's largest employers, and deal described the tax break as part of a plan to \" keep georgia competitive as a major international hub of commerce. \" but as senate president, cagle — who has an a-plus rating from the nra — will probably have enough influence to have the jet fuel measure dropped, the new york times reports. \" corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back, \" he tweeted monday. Delta argues that its decision on nra discounts \" reflects the airline's neutral status in the current national debate over gun control. \" ( on sunday, the nra slammed the \" cowardice \" of companies cutting ties with it in the aftermath of the parkland school shooting. )",

The state's republicans — including a major candidate for governor — are threatening to kill part of a bill that would eliminate a state tax on jet fuel.

Delta ( dal ) on saturday announced that it would end discounted rates for national rifle association members. Hufstetler told cnn on monday that if the airline does not reverse its stance on the nra soon, he and others will push for the tax break to be stripped from the bill.

Things changed over the weekend. Delta became one of several companies — others include united airlines ( ual ) and hertz ( htz ) — to abandon its relationship with the nra after a school shooting in florida two weeks ago left 17 dead. That shooting has sparked renewed public debate over gun laws and reform.

Sam brownback amended the state of emergency declaration he signed last week to include the new storm. \" this storm has the potential to be more dangerous than last week's storm, \" said brownback, who held a briefing sunday night along with emergency officials in his state to warn residents about the weather. He urged motorists"

Pesquet, as the new york times explains, is a french astronaut spending six months aboard the international space station. The images he's been posting recently to social media — mostly pics of europe and his home country — have literally highlighted belgium, glowing like a nightlight among its darkened euro counterparts. One photo posted tuesday, for instance, shows a sprawled-out europe, punctuated with the show-stopping aurora borealis, but it's belgium that also catches the eye in the upper left of the image. Another pic tweeted that day shows london, paris ( at bottom ), and brussels ( to its northeast ) forming what pesquet calls a \" very european triangle. \" belgium's brightness comes courtesy of the country's decision to keep its tightly packed roadways illuminated all through the night, even in the remote countryside. That's about 2.2 million bulbs ( or 186 bulbs per square mile ) shining until dawn, the times notes. Phys.org in 2011 noted that most other countries, save for nearby luxembourg, couldn't afford to do this even if they wanted to. Belgian officials shrug, saying people complain when the lights are turned off. ( see an incredible shot of the iss. )",

With a 148-foot diameter and the mass of a cruise ship, the asteroid is relatively small, but still comparable to one that flattened 80 million trees in siberia in 1908, reports the christian science monitor. At its closest, it will be just 17,200 miles from earth — closer than some satellites. Astronomers believe objects the size of da14 come this close to earth roughly once every 40 years — and smash into it every 1,200 years or so — but this one wouldn't have been spotted as recently as 20 years ago, before the search for near-earth objects was stepped up, cnn reports. The asteroid was spotted around a year ago by a team of amateur astronomers in spain. \" its orbit is very well-known, \" a nasa expert says. \" we know exactly where it's going to go, and it cannot hit the earth, \" though there is a slightly higher but still very small chance that it could make impact when it flies by in 2110.

The sun adds that students were tearing flags off vets ' cars in the parking lot and throwing beer bottles from balconies. \"i am personally offended and disappointed by the behavior that has been described to me, \" says uf vice president of student affairs david kratzer, a retired army general. \"this is not representative of our students or of the university. \" three members have been expelled from the frat so far as the school investigates.

        "summary": "Jeremiah wright may not be making an appearance in the 2012 election after all. A new york times story today created a buzz because it said billionaire conservative donor joe ricketts was considering an ad strategy to go after president obama's old ties to the volatile minister. Today, ricketts issued a statement via a spokesman rejecting the idea, reports the wall street journal. \" not only was this plan merely a proposal... It reflects an approach to politics that mr. Ricketts rejects, \" said the statement. Ricketts will try to help defeat obama, it adds, \" but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally. \" mitt romney, too, dismissed the idea, notes politico. \" i want to make it very clear, i repudiate that effort, \" he said. \" i think it's the wrong course for a pac or a campaign. I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about a vision for america. \"",

Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as what the proposal calls a \"metrosexual, black abe lincoln. \" a copy of a detailed advertising plan was obtained by the new york times through a person not connected to the proposal who was alarmed by its tone. It is titled \"the defeat of barack hussein obama: the ricketts plan to end his spending for good. \" the proposal was presented last week in chicago to associates and family members of mr. Ricketts, who is also the patriarch of the family that owns the chicago cubs. Brian baker, president and general counsel of a super pac called the ending spending action fund, said mr. Ricketts had studied several advertising proposals in recent months and had not signed off on a specific approach to taking on mr. Obama. \"joe ricketts is prepared to spend significant resources in the 2012 election in both the presidential race and congressional races, \" mr. Baker said in an interview wednesday. \"he is very concerned about the future direction of the country and plans to take a stand. \" the document makes clear that the effort is only in the planning stages and awaiting full approval from mr. Ricketts. People involved in the planning said the publicity now certain to surround it could send the strategists back to the drawing board.
