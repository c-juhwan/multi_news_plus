The agent was hospitalized with a shotgun pellet lodged in his leg. Rodvelt, 66, faces a felony count of assault on a federal officer over the sept. 7 incident, the mail tribune reports. He had been ordered to sell the home as part of a $ 2.1 million judgment against him in an elder abuse case involving his 90-year-old mother. He had been in jail in oregon after an armed standoff with authorities in april last year but was released for two weeks in august to prepare the property to be turned over, according to court documents. Authorities were contacted when the estate's acting receiver saw a sign saying the property was \" protected with improvised devices. \"",

When fremont cops driving in hayward spotted the vehicle around 5: 20pm tuesday, they tried to make a traffic stop, but as officers neared the car, the driver allegedly drove his car right into the police vehicle, hurting two detectives. Police started shooting, and elena was struck by gunfire before the car sped away. The panicked driver crashed the car not far from the scene, however, and fled on foot. Two other passengers besides mondragon were taken into custody, but although firefighters tried to save the teen, she eventually succumbed to her injuries at a nearby trauma center. The coroner notes the girl, known as \" ebbie \" to family and friends, looked to be in her first trimester. A gofundme that has already collected more than $ 3,000 to help defray funeral costs has been set up in her name. Meanwhile, police arrested the man they believe to be the driver wednesday night in san francisco, hauling him in on an outstanding warrant for various robbery charges.

A space elevator, the idea of which was first proposed by a russian scientist in 1895, would travel to a space station via cables connecting the station to earth, and could drastically reduce the cost of getting cargo to space, cnet explains. But there are a number of technical obstacles, including the need to develop cables that can resist high-energy cosmic rays, the need to keep space debris and meteorites from colliding with the elevator, and the need to transmit electricity from earth to space. Japanese construction firm obayashi, which is acting as the technical advisor for researchers on this project, plans to build its own space elevator to allow tourists to reach space by 2050. ( a canadian company is also working on its own space elevator. )",

It's no. 1 in terms of owner satisfaction for the second straight year, with 92 % saying they would buy one again, reports nbc news. \" the volt is indeed an engineering marvel, \" writes joann muller at forbes, and some common knocks against it — that it was \" dictated \" by the obama white house or that gm loses about $ 50,000 a car — are just flat-out wrong. Still, the volt has problems, writes muller: the back seats are cramped because of the battery, the controls are poorly laid out, and it takes way too long ( 16 hours ) to charge on the typical household current. Upgrading to shorten that time is expensive. The big drawback, though, remains the $ 40,000 price for a compact car.

That's when the 4-1 division leaders saw the wheels come off. At the seven-minute mark of the game, packers superstar quarterback aaron rodgers was tackled as he was throwing a pass and landed on his throwing arm, espn reports. Though rodgers was able to walk off the field, upon inspection by medical personnel, it was announced that the two-time nfl most valuable player had broken his right collarbone and could miss the rest of the season. The last time rodgers spent any significant time on the sidelines was during the 2013 season, when he missed seven games after breaking his left collarbone. The packers went 2-4-1 during that stretch. After leaving the game sunday rodgers was replaced by third-year pro brett hundley, whose first pass of the day was intercepted, setting up a vikings touchdown. Hundley is the only other quarterback on the packers. Some sports writers have already begun floating the possibility that packers could sign colin kaepernick, the former san francisco 49er whose protests during the national anthem last season led to this season's league-wide demonstrations.

To search for clues that life may exist on kepler-438b and other planets, researchers plan to examine kepler data for signs of moons, which help stabilize orbits and temperatures, and for gas giants in the same solar system, which reduce the odds of catastrophic asteroid hits, the guardian reports.

The planet, named kepler 438b, is slightly larger than earth and circles an orange dwarf star that bathes it in 40 % more heat than our home planet receives from the sun. The small size of kepler 438b makes it likely to be a rocky world, while its proximity to its star puts it in the \"goldilocks \" or habitable zone where the temperature is just right for liquid water to flow. A rocky surface and flowing water are two of the most important factors scientists look for when assessing a planet's chances of being hospitable to life. Kepler 438b, which is",
            "After five years of searching, researchers using data from nasa's exoplanet-hunting kepler spacecraft have discovered what look to be two of the most earth-like worlds yet. Dubbed kepler 438 b and kepler 442 b, both planets appear to be rocky and orbit in the not-too-hot, not-too-cold habitable zones of their stars where liquid water can exist in abundance. Astronomers announced the planets along with six other newfound small, temperate worlds today at a meeting of the american astronomical society in seattle. Their findings will be published in the astrophysical journal. The discoveries double the number of known potentially habitable exoplanets. They also push kepler's tally of vetted, confirmed worlds to just over 1,000, marking a milestone in the mission's epochal search for alien earths. Both planets are many hundreds of light-years away and orbit stars smaller and dimmer than our sun. Like most of kepler's"

She testified that she left everything behind three days later to follow him because she believed they had a budding romantic relationship. She testified in december that her feelings faded when she realized manson was routinely sleeping with other women, including underage girls, became physically and emotionally abusive, and trafficked krenwinkel to other men for sex. She said she left him twice only to be brought back, that she was usually under the influence of drugs and rarely left alone. \" it started with love, and then turned to fear, \" she said.",

Researchers knew that nicotine exposure caused genetic changes in animals that could be passed down through generations, and the study set out to determine whether the same \" epigenetic inheritance \" happened with humans who smoke, reports webmd. \" we found that smoking in previous generations can influence the risk of asthma in subsequent generations. This may also be important in the transmission of other exposures and diseases, \" study co-author caroline lodge says in a press release. The researchers say the inheritance of risk could help explain why there has been a steep rise in asthma cases over the last 50 years, even though smoking rates have declined. They now plan to investigate whether the same risk is passed down through the male line by looking at people whose grandmothers smoked when they were pregnant with their fathers.

Their computers, one in iowa ( owned by two people ) and one in germany, downloaded and processed the data that found the pulsar, which is in the milky way, approximately 17,000 light years from earth in constellation vulpecula. \" the way that we found the pulsar using distributed computing with volunteers is a new paradigm that we're going to make better use of in astronomy as time goes on, \" said astronomer jim cordes of cornell university. \" this really has legs. \" about 250,000 volunteers run einstein@home, on average donating about 250 teraflops of computing power – equivalent to a quarter of the capacity of the largest supercomputer in the world, says program developer david anderson of university of california at berkeley's space sciences laboratory, co-author of the aug. 12 discovery announcement in science. Einstein@home has been searching for gravitational waves in the data from the us ligo observatory since 2005, and since march 2009 has dedicated one-third of its power to searching for radio pulsars and black holes in the arecibo data. As of this week, it will start dedicating half of its processing power"

According to the baltimore sun, adults in maryland could already be criminally charged with providing alcohol to minors, but tuesday's ruling from the state's court of appeals adds — in the words of another lawyer — \" one more disincentive \" to parents thinking about letting their kids and their kids ' friends drink at their home. \"underage persons are not solely responsible for drinking alcohol on an adult's property because they are not competent to handle the effects of this potentially dangerous substance, \" the christian science monitor quotes the court's decision as saying. The ruling stems from two recent cases. In one, an 18-year-old driver hit a woman walking her dog after drinking at a party where an adult was tending bar. In another, a 17-year-old got into a fatal crash after drinking alcohol believed to have been provided by an adult. A madd executive director praised tuesday's ruling, saying it's a myth that underage drinking with a parent's supervision is safe; the only safety comes from not letting kids drink at all. In order for an adult to be held legally responsible, they must have \" knowingly \" and \" willfully \" provided alcohol to people who are under 21.

At the washington post, catherine rampell runs through some of the reasons, including high unemployment among the young, student debt, rising home prices and rents, and stagnant wages. Considering all that, it's \" rather financially prudent \" for millennials to stay with mom and dad longer, a situation that's not all that unusual in the rest of the world, she writes. But her bigger message is for those \" crusty \" baby boomers complaining about a lack of character in the younger set: \" well, boohoo. \" \" today's boomers have benefited for decades from huge public intergenerational transfers of wealth, \" writes rampell. \" is it really so much to ask that they make some much smaller private intergenerational transfers to their own children? \" they've paid low tuition and too-low taxes for the services they get back, and they ' ll hand over an enormous public debt. Plus, today's millennials will have to make up for their out-of-whack medicare benefits. \" in this light, the return home of young adults should be seen less as an act of morally bankrupt mooching and more as a step toward balancing the intergenerational ledger. \" click for the full column.",

And the answer why seems obvious: \" old comedy central habits die hard. \" colbert is alienating conservative viewers with jokes at the expense of such targets as people who oppose gay marriage or the resettlement of syrian refugees, according to the washington post. A new survey of 1,000 late-night viewers from the hollywood reporter found only 17 % of people tuning into colbert are republicans. And 72 % of colbert viewers say they'd vote for clinton over trump. Meanwhile the split between democrat and republican is pretty much even among viewers of jimmy fallon and jimmy kimmel. That could be important for the future of cbs ' late show because — while it was always getting trounced by nbc and fallon — it's now being beaten regularly by abc and kimmel, mediaite reports. Colbert is finding a niche in political satire — something both kimmel and fallon tend to stay away from — but he's going after republican targets far more often. While that was expected on comedy central, on network tv it has \" a result about as predictable as whom and what his political targets will be during each night. \" according to the post, colbert needs to find balance if he's going to succeed on cbs. \" colbert knows how to bring down the house by painting conservatives as a bunch of backward xenophobes, \" the post writes. \" but huge chunks of the electorate probably won't be laughing along \"",

But newly declassified documents from the 2009 probe into the agency's wiretapping show that — in 2009, at least — the nsa's surveillance system had grown so large and unwieldy, no one actually understood it. \" there was no single person who had a complete technical understanding, \" government lawyers told the courts at the time.

Congress also didn't understand the nsa, so members also didn't know what they were approving, lawyers determined at the time. The documents reveal the full scope of the abuses that led to the 2009 crackdown — of the almost 18,000 phone numbers on the government's watch list, only about 2,000 actually met fisa's standard for \" reasonable articulable suspicion \" for targeting, reports the wall street journal. Following these findings that the nsa \" frequently and systematically violated \" its own procedures, the judge ordered an overhaul of the system. The white house says regulations have now been tightened, and software on the nsa's servers stops the agency's analysts from snooping illegally. But, notes the ap, these are the same checks that were supposed to stop someone like snowden from stealing vast troves of classified documents. And we all know how that turned out.",

Crowley. The developments raise the question: why is the press coming under such fire? the logic of attacking reporters amid the egyptian demonstrations is one that is common in political uprisings, says barbara degorge, academic dean at northwood university in west palm beach, fla. \"the demonstrators see the journalists as being aligned with the mubarak government and are angry at them for their support of a repressive regime, \" says ms. Degorge, who has just returned from six years stationed in dubai."

        "summary": "California's latest environmental and health crackdown has monsanto in its crosshairs: reuters reports that as of july 7, glyphosate, the herbicide serving as the main ingredient in the agrochemical company's roundup weed killer, will take a spot on the golden state's list of cancer-causing chemicals, per the state's office of environmental health hazard assessment. The new designation falls under the umbrella of proposition 65 ( aka the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 ), under which an annually updated list of chemicals that cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm is required. Scott partridge, the vp of global strategy for monsanto, which has been battling the designation in trial court, called the decision \" improper \" and \" unwarranted on the basis of science and the law \" in an email to newsweek. It's not just glyphosate's new ranking that has monsanto fuming: abc news notes if the company doesn't win an appeal in the case, in a year's time it may have to add onto its roundup labels that the product is carcinogenic, making california the first state to issue such a mandate. Whether that happens will depend not only on the results of monsanto's appeal, but also on whether state health officials determine roundup contains enough of the odorless chemical to pose a health risk. As the company defends the chemical widely used by landscapers, farms, and vineyards, as well as by individual consumers, environmental groups are applauding california's move. \" [ the state's ] decision makes it the national leader in protecting people from cancer-causing pesticides, \" a senior scientist for the nonprofit center for biological diversity says in a statement to newsweek.",

That's the most recorded since the san francisco landmark opened in 1937, per the chronicle. Campaigners say those lives could have been saved by the safety net that the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district approved years ago, but the project is still at least $ 45 million short on funding. One big complaint from families of suicide victims, per abc7: the bridge will this year see the installation a $ 26 million moveable barrier designed to prevent head-on collisions — though only one person has died in such a crash on the bridge in the last 15 years. Some 1,600 people have jumped to their deaths since the bridge opened, and campaigners say many of them would still be alive if they had been prevented from acting on impulse. \" if it wasn't for the easy access at the bridge, i still believe my daughter would be alive today, \" says a man whose 17-year-old was one of 10 people to commit suicide from the bridge in august 2013 alone. Friends and family members of victims held a demonstration outside san francisco city hall yesterday, reports the san francisco appeal. \" the 4-foot railing on the golden gate bridge is the equivalent of a loaded gun in the middle of a mental ward, \" says one man who survived the fall in 2000.

Christine calderon, 23, was walking with her co-worker when she took a cellphone photo of the signs, which apparently paired requests for money with four-letter obscenities and a smiley face, reports the la times. After refusing to hand over a dollar, her co-worker was allegedly pinned to a store's wall by two of the men; the third attacked calderon, say police. She was stabbed multiple times, including in the torso, according to the ap, and collapsed just feet from the scene; she was pronounced dead three hours later. One witness told the times that people in the popular tourist area pressed on her stomach in attempt to staunch the bleeding, which turned her white top to red. Meanwhile, her mother said calderon had signed up for classes at a community college just days before the attack. \" her plan was to become an engineer, \" she told the times. \" she didn't want to waste years.

The 61-year-old daughter of the last king of romania and her husband, john, pleaded guilty yesterday to running an illegal gambling operation from their oregon ranch. The admission came as part of a government deal in which charges of animal fighting and conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act were dropped, the ap reports. The princess admitted to profiting from what authorities say were at least 10 rooster \" derbies \" that she and her husband hosted in which the birds fought to the death with sharp knives strapped to their legs. \" i provided food and beverage, your honor, and the location, \" she said in court. Prosecutors alleged the husband-and-wife team made a pretty penny from the operation: they charged 100 or so spectators a $ 20 cover and kept profits from alcohol sales, according to the oregonian. Irina also attempted to make food to sell to the crowd, but prosecutors said attendees deemed her offerings \"unacceptable \"; the walkers then commissioned a mexican woman to make tacos ( they reportedly let her keep her concession cash after charging her a fee ). The walkers are set to be sentenced in october, with an expected government recommendation for the duo to pony up $ 200,000 from their cockfighting proceeds and get three years of probation, says the ap.",

In a statement, the fda says women with breast implants \" have a very low but increased risk \" of alcl. The fda has received 359 reports of alcl cases tied to breast implants, including nine people who've died from the cancer. Alcl appears to be more common in women whose implants have a textured — rather than smooth — surface, according to medscape. Whether the implants are filled with saline or silicone gel doesn't appear to make a difference. Alcl takes an average of a decade to develop after the implant procedure. But it's easily treated if caught early, which typically happens when women start suffering pain and swelling. Most cases of alcl have been treated by removing the breast implant. Some cases have required chemo and radiation. Breast implants are the second most popular cosmetic procedure for women. More than 300,000 breast implants were performed in 2015.",

Rudd won a party caucus vote 57 to 45, after gillard — who ousted rudd as prime minister in 2010 and fought off a leadership challenge earlier this year — called for another leadership vote earlier today, amid growing internal opposition and slumping public support ahead of an election later this year, reuters reports. \" anybody who enters the ballot tonight should do it on the following conditions: that if you win you're labor leader, that if you lose you retire from politics, \" gillard said before the vote, as per the bbc. But rudd isn't pm again just yet — the change still has to be approved by the governor-general ( the queen's aussie rep ), and several independent and minority party members, whose support is needed to keep the labor party in power, have said they will support a \" no confidence \" vote against rudd, the age reports. That would leave the country in a sticky and unprecedented political situation, reports the news, one that could see the entire parliament dissolved or conservative opposition leader tony abbott being installed as pm.",

Jack daniel's only recently started publicly recognizing green's vital role in its history, according to a new york times story that went viral last year. But green's time as — per a press release — \" the best whiskey maker the world never knew \" is coming to an end, if one best-selling author who learned about green in that times story has her way. The ap reports green started distilling whiskey for his owner, dan call, in the mid-1800s in lynchburg. It was on call's farm that green taught jack daniel how to make tennessee whiskey. Call later gave his distillery to daniel, and the green and daniel families continued to work together for decades. This week, author fawn weaver launched the nearest green foundation, the tennessean reports. Among the projects planned by the foundation: a tennessee whiskey museum, the nearest green memorial park, and a scholarship fund for green's descendants. Weaver even bought the call farm where green and daniel first started distilling whiskey together. She calls green \" the greatest teacher in the fine aft of distilling tennessee whiskey. \" in addition to the activities of the foundation, green is also finally getting his own whiskey. Uncle nearest 1856 premium whiskey launched in portland, oregon, on wednesday.

        "summary": "The name stephen miller has been in the news a great deal since the inauguration, often paired with steve bannon as president trump's top advisers. Over the weekend, however, the 31-year-old miller got his biggest exposure yet as he appeared on four sunday talk shows to defend trump policies, particularly on immigration. The boss was a big fan: \" congratulations stephen miller- on representing me this morning on the various sunday morning shows. Great job! \" trump tweeted. Related coverage about miller: a washington post profile calls him a \" key engineer \" of trump's \" america first \" agenda and notes that miller first began voicing his conservative views while still in high school, in phone calls to a national radio show. He didn't let up as a college student at duke. The word \" workaholic \" comes to mind. As an aide to then sen. Jeff sessions, miller wrote so many emails to republican colleagues that they were essentially regarded as spam, according to a new york times profile. A post at breitbart pushes back against the times ' characterization: \" miller is a tough and determined populist, but he is portrayed merely as a bomb-throwing email spammer in the article. \" read the defense of miller here. On the sunday talk shows, miller made several claims about voter fraud being a problem in the us. The washington post fact checker blog goes through them one by one and gives miller its worst rating of four pinocchios, \" over and over again. \" one of miller's most-quoted lines from sunday: \"the end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned. \" it came during his appearance on face the nation. See the clip. The week compiles highlights from all his appearances in a two-minute clip here. Trump may have been a fan, but joe scarborough and mika brzezinski were not. They panned miller's appearances during the morning joe show monday. \" that was horrendous, an embarrassment, \" said scarborough, per mediaite, which has the clip. Brzezinski even started a #millertime2go hashtag. Sean hannity of fox soon came to miller's defense: \" steve miller works 18 hour days serving the country and the @potus, \" he tweeted to scarborough. \" what do you do? basically talk to yourself &amp; @morningmika nobody watches! \"",

The grisly find, which is at least the 13th foot to wash up on the province's coastline since 2007, was made by a man walking his dogs along a beach in jordan river, vancouver island, the vancouver sun reports. The man, worried the foot his dog had found might be washed away or taken by a bear or an eagle, took it home before contacting authorities, reports the cbc. The mounties searched the area before turning the investigation over to the coroner, who will try to identify the deceased and determine a cause of death. The last such find was in early 2016, when two feet from the same person washed up separately. When the feet started to wash up, there were fears that they could belong to victims of a disaster or even a serial killer. Authorities later identified eight of 12 feet as belonging to people who died in accidents or suicides. They believe the feet naturally separated from the bodies after a long period in the water. \" it makes sense to me that if a body is in the ocean and decomposes, you end up with a shoe that floats and an ankle where it would disconnect from the tibia and fibula, \" local cafe owner joshua constandinou tells the new york times. \" that is what they are finding on the beaches. \"",

The body of cruz-echevarria was found nov. 11 — veterans day — near a disabled, stolen car on the side of a deltona, fla., road, the orlando sentinel reports. He had been shot in the head multiple times. His own truck was gone, later discovered burned some 30 miles away. This week, authorities arrested three suspects in the killing, which they now believe is connected to a murder-for-hire plot hatched to keep cruz-echevarria from testifying in a road rage case. Six months before he was murdered, cruz-echevarria honked at a vehicle that didn't move when a traffic signal turned green. The driver of the other car — later identified as kelsey terrance mcfoley, 28 — caught up with cruz-echevarria and brandished a gun. Cruz-echevarria got mcfoley's license plate number and later identified him in a police photo lineup. With a record that included 29 felony charges, per the ap, mcfoley was facing serious prison time. He discovered cruz-echevarria's address on a court document and, authorities say, hired benjamin bascom, 24, to kill the man before his dec. 7 deposition. Driving around the area near cruz-echevarria's home, authorities say, bascom's vehicle got stuck in a ditch. Cruz-echevarria pulled up to help, and bascom shot him in the head. The case went unsolved for months, and the road rage charges against mcfoley were dropped. Later, though, investigators used dna evidence and phone records to link mcfoley, bascom, and mcfoley's girlfriend, melissa rios roque, to the slaying of cruz-echevarria. All three face first-degree murder charges.",

Investigators say the army veteran was targeted and executed to prevent him from testifying in a road-rage case. \"i've been a cop for 32 years, \" chitwood said during a news conference thursday. \"this is one of the most heinous, despicable, cowardly acts i've ever witnessed. \" volusia county sheriff's office kelsey mcfoley kelsey mcfoley ( volusia county sheriff's office ) cruz-echevarria was found shot multiple times in the head near a disabled, stolen car that was stuck in the grass near malaga avenue and puritan street on nov. 11, 2017.

            "Reed albergotti and vanessa o ' connell's \" wheelmen \" is a well-written, documented, organized book, and an easy read. One needs not be a cyclist to follow most of the book, but one who has cycled will perhaps receive a more visceral appreciation for this work. As a former mountain bike and cyclo-cross racer, who has put a lot of time on the roads, i am neither an antagonist of, nor an apologist for lance armstrong. I remember a conversation among racing friends during the early 2000's about armstrong and the professional peloton. While most defended lance, one, with perhaps more insight than the rest of us commented, \" they are all dirty \". I will use a somewhat different tact with my review. My review will be more about feelings i had during the reading of \" wheelmen \". If albergotti and o ' connell's wheelmen has any weakness at all, it falls short in categorizing the participants of the professional peloton as the cream of the crop,",

The darvaza gas crater, nicknamed the \" gates of hell \" or the \" door to hell, \" has been on fire since 1971, when scientists were looking for oil fields in the karakum desert, then part of the soviet union. The spot where they began drilling turned out to be a haven for natural gas — and the site collapsed under the weight of the drilling gear, smithsonian magazine reports. Several craters were formed, the biggest of which is 230 feet wide and 65 feet deep, and it was full of methane gas that began killing local animals. So scientists decided to burn the gas away, a common practice when unwanted natural gas is sticking around. They thought it would be gone in a few weeks; now, more than 40 years later, it's still burning, and experts aren't sure how much gas remains. Officials have called for action to stop the flames, to no avail, the smithsonian notes. The spot, which is visible from miles away, has become a tourist attraction, oilprice.com reports. Visitors can stay in tents and view the site — as well as \" huge and largely harmless spiders \" that hang out nearby.",

            "The cosmopolitan delights of azerbaijan's boomtown capital baku are well known to international oil industry types, so it's not surprising that the authoritarian country is heavily promoting itself as a tourist destination. With endless beaches, ancient ruins, snowcapped mountains and the chance of glimpsing the critically endangered caucasian leopard, the country has plenty to offer visitors. Add mud volcanoes to the mix, and azerbaijan begins to look like paradise for jaded travelers. Mud volcanos -- typically, small conical mounds that bubble up a clayey slurry -- aren't as spectacular as etna or mount st. Helens, but they are safer to view – normally – and azerbaijan has more of them than any other country: 344, according to adil aliyev of the geology institute of azerbaijan, co-author of \"what do we know about mud volcanoes? \" the most popular place to see mud volcanoes is gobustan national park, about 37 miles from baku. Famous for its ancient petroglyphs, gobustan is also dotted with small mud volcanoes that can be viewed close up. These geological oddities are generally well-behaved but can occasionally erupt in magnificent bursts of flame. The lokbatan volcano near baku belched fire hundreds of feet into the air in 2001, and its 2012 eruption left a layer of mud spread over an area of two hectares, according to the geology institute.",

Other highlights in coverage: ' nail-biter ': this one is tough to predict, with some members of the federal open market committee that is meeting open to a hike and others opposed. \" officials could seek some middle ground, such as holding rates near zero while sending a signal that a rate increase is likely at the fed's oct. 27-28 or dec. 15-16 policy meetings, \" notes the wall street journal. \" given the uncertainty, how ms.

After that, however, all bets are off. And that's bad news for democrats, explains the ap: franken would not have faced re-election until 2020, and he likely would have kept his seat as the incumbent. Now, the seat will be up for grabs next year, and republicans stand a decent chance of winning it. Franken's resignation may be a \" total game-changer in terms of control of the senate, \" republican strategist alex conant tells nbc news. That's assuming, however, that republicans field a strong candidate, and for now, eyes are turning to tim pawlenty, a former governor and 2012 presidential candidate. Pawlenty is in the private sector now as ceo of financial services roundtable, and he has said he's done with politics. But that's not stopping supporters from raising his name. The situation is similar to the republicans ' plight in alabama, where a once-safe seat is in play because of the roy moore scandal, notes chris cillizza at cnn. After assessing the whole senate landscape, however, he concludes that it's still possible for democrats to have control of the chamber by the time 2019 rolls around. As for minnesota, the minneapolis star tribune looks at the political calculus involved with the interim pick — caretaker or someone who would run again in 2018? for now, the best bet is that gov. Mark dayton will select lt. Gov. Tina smith, though the newspaper reports that smith would likely not run in the 2018 election.",

More like a village, refuge houses 120 offenders in 61 concrete bungalows amid the cane fields of pahokee, fla. \" here is exile that is also asylum from the larger, unforgiving world, \" writes jay kirk in gq. \" here is, weirdly enough, real community. \" told that many residents did \" the statutory boyfriend-girlfriend thing \" rather than child molestation, kirk finds them warm and welcoming. He also sees the founding nonprofit, matthew 25 ministries, carefully vet potential new members. And the residents ( mostly men wearing ankle monitors ) help each other with life's problems. \" if it weren't for city of refuge, they'd be out there on their own, \" kirk writes. Sex-offender support groups like one reported in the edmonton journal seem to pale by comparison. Yet there's a dark side: when ministries moved into this village, once used by migrant cane workers, remaining ex-workers saw their children forced out. \" they got to go, \" says one. \" because of the sex offenders. \" and when kirk looks up refuge's offenders on the national sex offender registry, he sees crimes including minors and forced acts: \" my skin grows colder with each click, \" he writes. This makes their identity as \" undeniably over-punished \" victims ( even comparing themselves to jews in nazi germany ) harder for kirk to accept. Short of conclusions, he visits refuge's small chapel, where kirk says the choir sings \" as if to expunge their names \" from the sex registry. \" you are wor-thy! \" they sing. \" you are wor-thy! \" click for the full article, or read about a couple on trial for having sex on a beach.",

They've got their own little colony out in the cane fields. Down here in pahokee, florida. They call it city of refuge. As everybody now knows, sex offenders have a rough time of it after they get out of prison. Because of the registry. Because the state says they can't live within a thousand feet of a school or a playground or a bus stop. Because they can't live anywhere children assemble, etc. So they end up living out of their cars, under highway overpasses, or in the woods, like fearful animals, like homeless lepers.

The ocean's deepest parts remain a mystery — as evidenced by the logistical issues during the search for still-missing malaysia airlines flight 370, as the bbc notes — but the jason-1 and cryosat-2 satellites worked together to bounce radar signals off the earth to detect topographic \" dips and peaks. \" the discovery is important to conservation scientists — \" wildlife tends to congregate \" near the mounts ' peaks, notes the bbc — as well as to researchers who study seafloor makeup to determine water current and heat-transfer patterns. So how come we've never spotted the mountains before? a release from the scripps institution of oceanography cites \" drastically improved remote sensing instruments \" and new data combined with old. \" you may generally think that the great age of exploration is truly over; we've been to all the remotest corners of continents, and perhaps one might think also of the ocean basins, \" a university of sydney professor tells the bbc. \" but sadly this is not true — we know much more about the topography of mars than we know about the seafloor. \" ( tons of plastic in the ocean seems to have disappeared, and that's probably not a good thing. )",

        "summary": "If your netflix account seems to be running slower than usual these days, that's because it very likely is slower. Traffic conflicts between the service and major broadband providers — especially verizon fios — are resulting in a slowdown, wall street journal reports. Netflix says its average primetime speeds for verizon customers sank 14 % in january, though performance has been getting progressively slower via many broadband providers since november, around the time when netflix made super-hd video available to all users, possibly ramping up the traffic load. Fees are at the heart of the issue: netflix is pushing top providers to link to its new \" open connect \" distribution system, but verizon, comcast, time warner, and at&t want payment before they ' ll do it. Central to the problem is netflix's heavy bandwidth usage; at times, it's responsible for a third of peak online traffic in north america, analysts say. According to verizon's rules, networks should pay if they're putting out more data than they're carrying. As it stands, netflix uses middlemen like cogent communications to carry traffic, and those carriers dish out far more than they take back. Both netflix and verizon could take steps to help fix the problem, which will likely play a role in federal regulators'decision on the comcast-time warner merger, the journal notes.

            "Netflix's speed rankings show that video streaming performance on verizon and comcast has been dropping for the past three to four months.

Comcast stayed in 14th place out of 17 rated providers, while verizon dsl dropped from 16th to 17th, trading places with clearwire. The story is really in how each provider's megabits per second changed from month to month.

Determining the actual cause of such performance slowdowns is never easy, though. That the latest performance complaints came after verizon's win over the fcc in a court battle over net neutrality rules led to claims that verizon was celebrating its victory by throttling netflix traffic.one such claim was backed by some traceroutes and a quote from a hapless customer service representative, but we explained last week why that wasn't enough evidence to declare that verizon is suddenly throttling netflix as a result of the net neutrality ruling. Still, that doesn't mean verizon isn't taking steps that degrade netflix performance.

( note that if you want to see a graph containing all isps, or get different data sets, check out this netflix link. The charts in this story were generated using netflix's tool, which rearranges the values in the y-axis depending on the data being presented. Make sure to check the mbps numbers in the y-axis when examining each chart. ) verizon dsl dropped for four straight months from 1.42mbps to 0.97mbps, with the largest single-month drop occurring between december and january. Comcast also dropped for four straight months, from 2.11mbps in september to 1.51mbps in january. Verizon customers have been complaining about poor netflix performance lately, so the numbers aren't necessarily a surprise. Determining the actual cause of such performance slowdowns is never easy, though. That the latest performance complaints came after verizon's win over the fcc in a court battle over net neutrality rules led to claims that verizon was celebrating its victory by throttling netflix traffic.one such claim was backed by some traceroutes and a quote from a hapless customer service representative, but we explained last week why that wasn't enough evidence to declare that verizon is suddenly throttling netflix as a result of the net neutrality ruling. Still, that doesn't mean verizon isn't taking steps that degrade netflix performance. If anything, the netflix data shows that verizon's performance problems started before it got the net neutrality rules overturned. And verizon and comcast have each garnered their share of netflix-related complaints for months, if not years. Netflix didn't offer any analysis of why performance would have"

        "summary": "The first full-service national chain to get rid of tipping is, for the most part, reinstating the practice that its former ceo once called \" antiquated. \" joe's crab shack, which had tried out the gratuity-included model in 18 of its 130 or so restaurants across the country, is going back to the old way of doing things in 14 of those restaurants, cnnmoney reports. The reason for the backtracking was made clear in the company's first-quarter earnings call last week: \" our customers and staff spoke very loudly [ about the policy ], and a lot of them voted with their feet, \" said bob merritt, the ceo of parent company ignite restaurant group. Test eateries — which had compensated for the lack of gratuities by raising menu prices and giving increased, fixed wages to staff — lost between 8 % and 10 % of their customer base, per the new york times. Reuters reports that some workers at the test sites got a $ 12-an-hour minimum, and that menu prices were boosted less than 20 %; advocates of the no-tipping model say it allows servers to count on a fixed income and eliminates patrons ' need to do math. But about 60 % of the chain's customers didn't take to the new model, company research revealed: patrons apparently didn't think the waitstaff would be as motivated to provide decent service if they couldn't count on a tip, and they were also wary that management might not share the extra money being pulled in through higher menu prices with staff. So why is joe's keeping four of the test restaurants on the no-tipping system? merritt says the model actually worked in those locations, though they're trying to figure out why.

But a study published last week in science advances finds the san andreas could have an equally dangerous partner in creating the state's next catastrophic quake. The los angeles times reports geophysics professor julian lozos, while trying to solve the mystery of the earthquake of 1812, determined that it's possible the san andreas fault combined with the san jacinto fault to cause a magnitude-7.5 earthquake — and could do so again. According to a press release, the 1812 earthquake was one of the biggest in california's history and now appears to have been caused when a rupture in the san jacinto spread to the san andreas. \" people shouldn't just be thinking about the san andreas fault, \" lozos says in the press release. The lesser-known san jacinto could actually be a more serious \" seismic hazard \" because it runs directly under a number of population centers east of los angeles. If it combined with the san andreas to create a \" big one \" — as evidence shows it has in the past — the resulting earthquake could kill more than 1,000 people while destroying buildings and starting fires, what the times calls a \" grim seismic scenario. \" lozos says it's important to understand how one fault rupturing can trigger ruptures in others. A recent report taking similar multi-fault thinking into account raised california's odds for having a magnitude-8 or larger earthquake by 2045 from 4.7 % to 7 %.",

The family says majors had harassed and stalked the jabara family for years, taunting them with anti-muslim insults, even though they're lebanese christians. \" this suspect had a history of bigotry against our family, \" the victim's sister, victoria jabara williams, wrote on facebook, calling them \"dirty arabs \" and \"filthy lebanese. \" on friday, jabara called 911 to report his concern that majors was home and armed. The police came and went, and minutes later, majors is accused of shooting khalid jabara as he stepped outside the family's house in tulsa to get the mail. Police said they found majors drunk and chugging beer and arrested him after a brief stand-off. There was no cause to detain him earlier in the day, police said, because majors hadn't done anything wrong. Majors had been in jail awaiting trial for allegedly plowing into jabara's mother with his car, then leaving the scene. The family says he never should have been allowed to post bond for what they deemed a hate crime, reports the tulsa world.

After initially being denied bail for assault and battery with a deadly weapon among other crimes and spending eight months in jail, district judge william lafortune reversed that decision and allowed majors to be released on bond in may. On friday, jabara called police to inform them that he had heard majors had acquired a gun — as part of a restraining order jabara's mother had taken out on majors, which he had been charged with violating, the 61-year-old was not allowed to possess firearms.

Sources tell cbs philly and nbc news that judge maryanne trump barry, who sits on the us court of appeals for the 3rd circuit, received the letter in philadelphia on friday. The sources say that unlike the letter received by trump's son eric on thursday, the letter sent to the 78-year-old judge did not contain white powder, though it apparently contained a similar demand for trump to drop out of the gop race. The fbi says it is \" aware of the incident and is working closely with the united states secret service and us marshals service, \" the ap reports. Trump barry — who was appointed by ronald reagan and promoted by bill clinton — is a \" moderate-conservative republican centrist, \" legal blogger matthew stiegler told the washington post when it profiled her earlier this month. She has not played an active role in the trump campaign, though ted cruz denounced her as a \" radical pro-abortion extremist \" last month when trump joked that he would consider appointing her to the supreme court.",
