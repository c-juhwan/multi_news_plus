        "summary": "An oscar nominee for best picture, american sniper stars bradley cooper as the late navy seal chris kyle, considered the deadliest sniper in us history. Based on kyle's 2012 autobiography, the clint eastwood-directed flick follows the soldier to war and back. Is it worth the journey? here's what critics are saying: ty burr at the boston globe writes that this \" great and terrible \" flick is \" a soldier's story, as honest as its director can make it. \" in fact, the lack of glory means \" american sniper may be the hardest, truest movie ever made about the experience of men in war. \" sienna miller is \" very touching \" as kyle's wife, while a sandstorm at the climax of the movie is a \" brilliant \" sequence, burr writes. However, eastwood \" botches the ending of this story. \" cooper is \" very good, \" portraying a \" humble and companionable movie hero caught in a war eastwood has no interest in putting up for geopolitical discussion, \" writes michael phillips at the chicago tribune. Miller, too, is \" effective every second. \" the film is \" one life-and-death sequence after another, and the filmmaking's efficient, crisply delivered, \" phillips writes. \" but eastwood honors his subject without really getting under his skin. \" soren andersen at the seattle times says american sniper is arguably eastwood's \" best picture since unforgiven. \" cooper rounds off \" the harsher edges of the persona kyle presents in the book, \" but \" all movies based on real-life incidents take such liberties, \" andersen writes. Cooper is able to deliver \" a performance of great subtlety, \" while the film as a whole is \" powerful and intense. \" jake coyle agrees american sniper is eastwood's \" best movie in years. \" it's \" quintessentially eastwood: a tautly made, confidently constructed examination of the themes that have long dominated his work, \" coyle writes at the ap. Cooper is \" extraordinary, \" while the film is \" both a tribute to the warrior and a lament for war \" that leaves politics behind. The downside: \" it's lacking context. Few iraqis here are seen as anything but the enemy. \"",

        "summary": "The ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee has fallen into president trump's crosshairs after attacking the president over the weekend. \" little adam schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington, \" trump tweeted monday, adding schiff is \" right up there \" with previous trump targets, including former fbi director james comey and former cia director john brennan. Schiff \" leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! \" trump added. Schiff was among those to oppose a gop memo accusing the fbi and justice department of malfeasance, which received trump's approval for release on friday. In an esquire op-ed published a day later, schiff accused trump of trying to turn the doj into his \" personal political tool. \" trump views the idea \" that the doj should be anything other than an extension of his political operation as an unacceptable constraint on his authority, \" the california democrat wrote. Schiff — who cited trump's alleged attempts to secure the loyalty of comey and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein — also said trump \" would take the reins of the fbi to protect himself and to deploy their immense investigative powers against his political opponents at will. \" following trump's rebuttal, schiff tweeted, \" instead of tweeting false smears, the american people would appreciate it if you turned off the tv \" and did \" anything else. \" schiff is expected to push for the release of a democrat memo to counter the gop version on monday, per the los angeles times. If trump disapproves of its release, \" it would force the house into a full, closed session to override him, \" says politico's kyle cheney.",

            "In the run-up to the release of a deliberately misleading memo, some republicans hyped the underlying scandal as \" worse than watergate. \" when it was published, however, it delivered none of the salacious evidence of systemic abuse that it promised — only a cherry-picking of information from a single fisa court application. The memo's release provided none of the vindication the president sought or would claim, but it was hugely consequential nonetheless, in how it undermined the system of checks and balances designed to insulate the fbi from white house meddling established in the wake of watergate.

Under the leadership of director j. Edgar hoover, who served in that role for nearly 40 years, the fbi targeted domestic political groups it deemed to be \"subversive \" for unconstitutional surveillance and covert actions. The targets of these actions included socialist groups, anti-war protesters, and civil rights groups and leaders, among them martin luther king, jr. Getty images jimmy carter campaigned for president in 1976 promising a scandal-weary nation that he would wall off the department of justice and fbi from political influence and direction. As president, carter did just that, for the first time putting in place formal rules to govern interactions between the department of justice and the white house. Perhaps more important, he established an expectation that the extraordinary powers of the department of justice and the fbi would not be wielded as a cudgel against the political opponents of the",

The bill passed the state senate 23-14 after emotional testimony from \" death with dignity \" advocates including state sen. Hannah-beth jackson. She testified that when her mother was dying of leukemia, she asked only to keep her dignity and not to die alone, reports the new york times, which notes that that doctor-assisted suicide is already legal in montana, oregon, vermont, and washington — and the california bill will triple the number of americans who have that option. The bill's supporters include the family of brittany maynard, who moved from california to oregon to die after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. It is not clear whether brown will approve the bill, which faced opposition from organizations including the catholic church and seniors ' groups, who argued that the bill could lead to elderly people facing pressure to die from poor or greedy relatives, reports reuters. To combat such pressure, the california bill — unlike the oregon law it is based on — will require doctors to have private consultations with the patient who wants to end their life, the times notes. Yesterday was a busy day for state lawmakers: a bill to regulate california's first-in-the-nation medical marijuana industry for the first time made it through the legislature just before a midnight deadline last night, reports the san francisco chronicle.",

But not just any men — nearly a year of authentication proved that the photo shows billy the kid and members of his gang of outlaws, the regulators, and now the picture ( which, the sacramento bee notes, actually cost guijarro only 88 cents ) is going to auction and could sell for $ 5 million, usa today reports. \" when we first saw the photograph, we were understandably skeptical — an original billy the kid photo is the holy grail of western americana, \" says the senior numismatist at kagin's, the firm of experts that authenticated the tintype and will negotiate its sale.

Hillary clinton is closing in on a historic nomination as the first female presidential nominee with one more round of states -- california, new jersey, new mexico, south dakota and montana -- set to vote tuesday. Her nomination would become official during the democratic national convention in philadelphia. Generally, clinton has kept a low profile on the trail, commenting on how he didn't want to \" make news, \" and keep the focus on his wife.

        "summary": "America's biggest tax law overhaul in more than 30 years contains a provision that some experts say is going to make divorce a more difficult process — especially for lower-income couples. The final version of the republican tax plan removes the tax deduction for alimony payments, which are support payments generally made to an ex-spouse who earns less money, cnn reports. Since spouses receiving the payments were typically in a lower tax bracket, divorce lawyers tend to \" use this tax deduction as a way to make a settlement go down easier — because there was more money in the pot to be able to split up, \" says divorce attorney lisa zeiderman. The deduction is used by an estimated 600,000 americans. They won't be affected under the tax bill, which repeals the alimony deduction only for divorces that happen after dec. 31 next years. Zeiderman warns that without the deduction there will be \" less money to go around \" in future settlements, which could affect how child support, etc. Is calculated. The final house and senate compromise version of the tax bill, which slashes the corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, was unveiled friday. It is expected to sail through the house, though three republican senators haven't committed to it yet and the gop will need their votes to pass it, reuters reports.

The final version of the tax plan, which was released friday and is set for votes next week, eliminates the tax deduction for alimony payments. Divorce lawyers say this move could make ending marriages an even more drawn-out and expensive process, and the change could be particularly painful for lower-income couples. Alimony payments, typically codified in the terms of a divorce settlement, are separate from child support. They are the payments that someone gives to an ex-spouse who earns less money. If the tax bill becomes law, the alimony deduction repeal would affect divorces carried out after december 31, 2018. The new rule wouldn't affect anyone already paying alimony. But it ' ll mean big changes for divorce proceedings in the years ahead. Right now, alimony payments are tax free for the payer, and they're taxed like regular income for the recipient. Since the recipient usually makes less money -- and is thus in a lower tax bracket -- it keeps more money in the family unit and away from uncle sam.

File photo: the u.s. Congress capitol building is seen from the congressional visitors center in washington, u.s. December 6, 2017. Reuters/aaron p. Bernstein/file photo passage of the biggest u.s. Tax rewrite since 1986 would provide republican lawmakers and president donald trump their first major legislative victory since he took office in january. Prospects for approval soared after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged support. Three republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trump's party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: susan collins, jeff flake and mike lee. The final version hammered out between senate and house of representatives republicans after each chamber previously passed competing versions contained no surprises. It would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, according to a summary distributed to reporters by congressional tax writers. Corporate tax lobbyists have been seeking a tax cut of this magnitude for many years.

King recalled the 1958 incident in which a woman stabbed him at a harlem book signing; doctors had told him that had he sneezed, the knife blade that sat perilously close to his aorta would have ended it all. Telling that story \" seemed to transport him into a profound gloom about mortality — his mortality, \" writes rosenbloom, who notes that while king talked about death on many occasions, it was never in such a morose tone. \" this night in memphis, however, he seemed near panic. \" the full excerpt explains why.",

Director bill condon recently told attitude magazine that josh gad's lefou — villain gaston's ( luke evans ) eccentric sidekick — will be disney's first-ever lgbtq character — a way of honoring the original 1991 animated film's late lyricist howard ashman. \"josh gad, incidentally, plays gaston's worshipful stooge lefou as maximally silly and fawning, but i must have missed the memo where that spells 'gay, ' \" variety chief film critic owen gleiberman wrote in his review.

State attorney general jorge winckler ortiz said the bodies are drug cartel victims murdered while authorities in previous administrations turned a blind eye. He described veracruz state, a cartel battleground for years, as a giant mass grave. \" when they finish opening the clandestine cemetery in the state it will be seen as the largest grave, \" he told the televisa network, per npr, \" because for years organized crime has disappeared and murdered people with the complicity of the authorities. \" the graves were found with the help of colectivo solecito, an activist group formed by the mothers of some of the state's estimated 2,400 missing people, the new york times reports.

The team on twitter linked to a five-paragraph letter by the owner. \" i believe it is time to turn the franchise over to new ownership, \" richardson wrote, saying he wouldn't begin discussions until after the season. The panthers, who lost in the super bowl two seasons ago, are in playoff position again. \" i hope everyone in the organization, both on and off the field, will be firmly focused on one mission: to play and win the super bowl, \" said richardson, 81. The nfl awarded richardson, a former player with the baltimore colts, an expansion franchise in 1993, and he has been the team's only owner. Richardson attended sunday's win over the green bay packers and was photographed sitting beside his wife rosalind in his luxury box. Richardson's announcement comes after a sports illustrated report sunday that cited unnamed sources who said richardson made sexually suggestive comments to women and on at least one occasion directed a racial slur at an african-american panthers scout. The sources said at least four settlements with former panthers employees came with non-disclosure requirements forbidding the parties from discussing the details.",

        "summary": "A greek drama will unfold this week, and some commentators are already calling it a greek tragedy. The country's current bailout expires tomorrow — the same day greece is due to make a $ 1.8 billion payment it probably won't have the funds for. And on sunday, voters will be asked to decide whether they're willing to accept continued austerity in a referendum widely seen as a vote on staying in the eurozone, reports the atlantic, which notes even if a bailout deal is reached and voters accept creditors'tough proposals, the greeks will be stuck with the same economic problems for a long time to come. Greece has announced that its banks will stay closed all week, and the effect of the crisis on world markets was apparent today, with asian and european markets dropping as soon as trading started this morning, the bbc reports. Withdrawals at atms, which saw huge lines all weekend, have been limited to $ 66 per person per day. At quartz, jason karaian predicts a \" bitter week of recriminations, unease, and fear \" leading up to the referendum. Prime minister alexis tsipras will push hard for a \" no \" vote, karaian notes, but with polls showing a majority of greeks wishing to remain in the eurozone, a \" yes \" vote could trigger the collapse of his government and new elections. A \" no \" vote would swiftly lead to \" government default, bank collapses, \" and other troubles that would force the government to introduce a new currency, and possibly cause it to leave the wider eu as well as the monetary union, according to simon nixon at the wall street journal. But for all its problems, greece has \" proved a beacon of prosperity and stability compared with the rest of the balkans, \" he notes, and has a special place in the european imagination that means more aid will probably be forthcoming if voters choose that path. A \" yes \" will mean an extension of the \" grinding era of austerity \" for greeks in return for stability, while a \" no \" could mean a rebound with a new currency after short-term chaos, writes neil irwin at the new york times, describing this week as a \" transformational moment \" for the eu project. A greek exit might not mean financial armageddon, he writes, but it could push greece closer to russia and send the message that the eu is \" more fragile than its leaders would like the world to think. \" but whatever happens this week, life is unlikely to improve soon for the millions of greeks hit hard by a crisis that has driven unemployment above",

When michelle and robert duchouquette, of plano, texas went away on vacation last year, the couple left their two dogs and betta fish, gordy, in the hands of prestigious pets. After returning from their vacation, the couple noticed that gordy's bowl was cloudy — a consequence of overfeeding. So the duchouquettes posted a negative review on yelp — and prestigious pets countered with a friendly $ 1 million lawsuit. Seems entirely reasonable. The company claims that the couple had signed a contract agreeing \" not to make negative comments about prestigious pets and to not disparage prestigious pets. \" according to the lawsuit, the duchouquette's allegations went beyond a simple one star yelp review and included a variety of written and broadcast mediums, including facebook, abc, and nbc.

The company, prestigious pets of dallas, claims the review is a breach of a non-disparagement clause and defamation. Paul alan levy, a public citizen lawyer who is defending the couple, summarized the company's revised suit ( pdf ) targeting the couple.

            "Fish — one of nature's most fragile, and litigious, pets. When michelle and robert duchouquette, of plano, texas went away on vacation last year, the couple left their two dogs and betta fish, gordy, in the hands of prestigious pets. After returning from their vacation, the couple noticed that gordy's bowl was cloudy — a consequence of overfeeding. So the duchouquettes posted a negative review on yelp — and prestigious pets countered with a friendly $ 1 million lawsuit. Seems entirely reasonable. The company claims that the couple had signed a contract agreeing \" not to make negative comments about prestigious pets and to not disparage prestigious pets. \" according to the lawsuit, the duchouquette's allegations went beyond a simple one star yelp review and included a variety of written and broadcast mediums, including facebook, abc, and nbc. As if that wasn't ridiculous enough, grab your popcorn, reader — there's more. Prestigious pets argues that as a result of the duchouquettes supposed defamation, the company has received \" numerous rape and death threats... In addition to other forms of harassment such",
            "A texas pet-sitting business is seeking up to $ 1 million in damages from a couple who gave a one-star review on yelp and criticized the company's treatment of their tiny blue tropical betta fish \" gordy \" while the family was away on vacation. The company, prestigious pets of dallas, claims the review is a breach of a non-disparagement clause and defamation. Paul alan levy, a public citizen lawyer who is defending the couple, summarized the company's revised suit ( pdf ) targeting the couple.

The crude walls have been compared to easter island and stonehenge because like those two ancient sites, their origins are shrouded in mystery. No historical documents exist to shed light on who built them, or when, and as a naturalist told the monthly in 2014, \" the mystery walls never attracted serious scholarship, so all we have is in the realm of people spinning ideas. \" now, local archaeologist jeffrey fentress is measuring and mapping them so as to gain them entry into the state archive, which would lend protection from things like development. In light of fentress ' effort, the mercury news takes a look at what we know, or think we know, about the walls. At the turn of the 20th century, scholars speculated the 3- to 4-foot-tall mortar-free walls, which do not run continuously, were built by ancient civilizations, or by the mongolians. A recent testing of lichen growing on the rocks suggests otherwise. While not a perfect dating technique, it places them in the 1850-1880 period. Modern experts ' best guess is they contained the cattle of post-gold rush european immigrants, though there's no consensus on which country those immigrants hailed from — or whom they may have tasked with building them ( mexicans? the chinese? native americans? ) but those unknown builders are forever captured in the walls, says fentress: \" they are essentially the archaeology of the working class, the common people who came here and made a living. \"",

Amid uncertainty over future us tariffs, china has canceled several shipments from american soybean producers and tripled the amount it is buying from russia, bloomberg reports. According to the russian government's latest statistics, russia sold 850,000 metric tons of soybeans to china between july last year and this week, compared to 340,000 tons in the whole of the 12 months before that period began. Analysts say that while russia is a very minor soybean supplier compared to countries like brazil, it is now likely to expand production in its far east, the russian region closest to china. Rep. Cheri buston, an illinois democrat and a member of the house agriculture committee, slammed president trump after the russia statistics were released, accusing him of breaking his promise to \" end the war on the american farmer, \" the quad city times reports. In brighter news for us farmers, china announced friday that it is ending an anti-dumping investigation of us sorghum because it would have raised prices for china's livestock producers and eventually affected the cost of living for chinese consumers, the ap reports.

        "summary": "An italian computer engineer has produced fresh insight into homer's the odyssey — or, more specifically, one long-intriguing copy of it. In 2007, the university of chicago library was given a copy of the book dating to 1504. But alongside about 20 of the pages making up book 11 were handwritten lines in french and some kind of script. All that was known about the \" mystery marginalia \" was that it was likely penned in the mid-19th century, reports phys.org, and in hopes of unlocking its secrets, mc lang, the collector who donated the book, put up a $ 1,000 prize to the person who could translate it. The honor has now officially gone to daniele metilli, a student of digital humanities who teamed up with giula accetta, a colleague with knowledge of both the french language and contemporary italian stenography, nbc news reports. Using the french words and a date written in the margins — april 25, 1854 — as a starting point in terms of which stenographic systems to review, they ultimately unmasked the script as a system of shorthand created by jean coulon de thévénot in the late 1700s. But the translated copy ended up being somewhat pedestrian: largely french translations of portions of the greek text. But there's one mystery left, metilli wrote on his website. \" we still know next to nothing about the annotator. There are no personal references in the annotations, and in the few instances in which the author uses the first person it is only to explain why he or she committed a translation mistake. \" the two are now trying to suss out the author's identity, and figure out why the writing appears only in one portion of the text. The library notes that two runners-up arrived at the same correct conclusion. ( another annotated mystery: does a musical score reveal the location of nazi treasure? )",

Cook was paid $ 33,000 to have one child — plus an extra $ 6,000 for each additional child — via iv fertilization with cm's sperm and eggs from a 20-year-old donor, the post notes; all three implanted embryos went on to develop normally. Per the father's lawyer, robert walmsley, cm did ask cook to abort a fetus, but only after doctors recommended it for health reasons, the post notes. He didn't go after cook for monetary damages and he's still making medical payments to her, walmsley says, adding that cook has become a pawn for anti-surrogacy activists. As for cook, her statement to people says: \" i have a deep empathy for men who want children. However, i now think that the basic concept of surrogacy arrangements must be re-examined, scrutinized, and reconsidered. \" she tells the daily beast that \" i will be prepared to take all three [ kids ]....

The vehicles will be unveiled next year alongside tesla's existing fleet of electric cars. \" from reuters.

        "summary": "The death toll has skyrocketed to 141 after an indonesian military transport plane slammed into houses and a hotel in medan yesterday. Though it initially wasn't clear how many people were on board the c-130b hercules, officials now say it was carrying 122 passengers — including \" maybe five to eight children, \" an official tells the guardian — and 12 crew, meaning several were killed on the ground. Not all those on board were military personnel or relatives, who can fly with special permission. A woman tells reuters her brother, a civilian, bought a ticket for the flight from medan to the riau islands. The air force chief says no one should have been asked to pay. \" what we fear is that there may be certain people offering to take passengers on board without permission, that is what we are investigating, \" he says. Meanwhile, indonesian president joko widodo has called for a thorough investigation after smoke was seen billowing from the plane before the crash. He also promises \" an evaluation of the age of planes and defense systems \" in the country, adding, \" hopefully, we can stay away from disasters. \" vice president jusuf kalla tells the jakarta post the plane \" was an old aircraft, already 50 years, but it was about to undergo a retrofit. \" it was built in the us in 1964. \" this incident shows us that we must renew our aircraft and our military equipment, \" adds a lawmaker and member of the parliamentary commission for defense. \" as parliament we will support giving more funding to the military so that they can upgrade. \" the aviation safety network notes 10 fatal plane crashes over the last decade have involved indonesian military or police aircraft.",

With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge arched windows, and nine floors, it sits on — or, rather, commands — the block of 71st street between fifth and madison avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not surprising — until 1989 it was the birch wathen private school. Now it is said to be manhattan's largest private residence. Inside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you feel you have stumbled into someone's private xanadu. This is no mere rich person's home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries. The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from england, where they were made for injured soldiers.

The 19-year-old, who has been charged with using weapons of mass destruction and told he could face the death penalty, is being questioned in the presence of doctors every few hours. He has told investigators that he and his brother acted alone, without the involvement of any islamic terrorist groups, though officials say the pair's religion motivated the attacks. The tsarnaev brothers got bomb-making instructions off the internet, adds nbc. Tsarnaev's gunshot wounds have left him barely able to speak, but he communicated mostly by nodding during a court hearing held in his hospital room, the new york times reports. He spoke only once, to say \" no \" when asked if he could afford a lawyer, according to a transcript. \" i find that the defendant is alert, mentally competent, and lucid. He is aware of the nature of the proceedings, \" the judge said, setting tsarnaev's next court date for may.",

It predicts the first bills will be doa but the second set could result in compromise. Here's why.

The complete title — \" never mind brexit, who won legs-it! \" — accompanied a photo of prime minister theresa may and nicola sturgeon, scotland's first minister, calling attention to their limbs instead of their difficult conversation about the fate of the united kingdom. The inside pages didn't fare much better, with a headline blaring, \" finest weapons at their command? those pins! \" and a column describing sturgeon's legs as being \" [ tantalizingly ] crossed … a direct attempt at seduction. \" outcry has been swift, with one ex-labour party head tweeting, \" the 1950s called and asked for their headline back. \" labour mp harriet harman called the cover \" moronic, \" while labour chief jeremy corbyn noted the year we live in and said, \" this sexism must be consigned to history. \" tony blair's ex-press secretary went so far as to tweet that people should rip up their copies of the mail. Memes that \" fixed \" the original also cropped up. Per the guardian, sturgeon's spokesman calls the cover treatment \" slightly surprising \" and notes \" there is no need for coverage of events to lead the way \" back to the ' 70s.

Antiquities minister khaled al-anani announced the find at the site of the tomb in saqqara, just west of cairo, which is also home to the famed step pyramid. One of the things making the find so unique, per reuters: it hasn't been looted or otherwise touched in all that time. Another thing: the drawings on the 33-foot-by-10-foot tomb's walls are \" exceptionally well-preserved, \" per the ap. Adds npr: \" particularly striking are their well-preserved colors — light yellows, rich blues, and a reddish-brown skin tone. \" the drawings depict the official — a purification priest named wahtye — and his family, and the tomb also contains a total of 45 statues carved in rock. Again, they depict the wahtye and his family. And that's potentially not all: another egyptian official says five shafts have been found under the tomb, per livescience, four of which are sealed. The plan is to now excavate those in hopes of finding a sarcophagus of wahtye. In recent years, egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in the hope of attracting more tourists to the country. The vital tourism sector has suffered from the years of political turmoil and violence that followed the country's 2011 political uprising.

A deaf-mute indian girl, geeta couldn't explain exactly what happened, but mimed an explosion, ducking out of the way, and then her discovery at the lahore railway station, report reuters and the indian express. Assuming she was from pakistan, officials placed her in a children's home in lahore and renamed her fatima. She would often point to india's jharkhand state on a map, leading officials to believe she was indeed from india, but it was only in august — 13 years after she strayed into pakistan — that her home country acknowledged geeta was among its citizens and a search for her family began, per the bbc. Now in her 20s, geeta was reunited with individuals she had identified in photographs in new delhi on monday. \" geeta stayed with us for 13 years. Now it's time for her to go home, \" a rep for the pakistani charity that cared for geeta says. After smiling and waving to cameras, geeta was greeted by janardhan mahato from bihar, who says he is her father, and another man who says he is her brother, though at least two families claim she is their daughter. \" if the dna doesn't match, the indian authorities will continue the search for her family, \" the charity rep says. \" i don't care about how many tests they want, if she embraces me that will be the biggest test for me, \" says mahato. \" i spent five years looking for her in ludhiana and have spent the last six years mourning. This is like rebirth for our family. \" if dna tests prove negative, officials say geeta will be kept at a shelter home in india while her long-lost family members are found.",

Drawing on surveys of more than 374,000 adults in 50 us cities, gallup says the top five for lgbt residents are san francisco ( 6.2 % ), portland, ore., ( 5.4 % ), austin ( 5.3 % ), new orleans ( 5.1 % ), and seattle ( 4.8 % ); politically conservative salt lake city ( 4.7 % ) came in seventh. Why the latter? well, the higher percentage of self-identifying gays in western cities may reflect the particular lack of acceptance they face in nearby rural areas, the new york times reports. The bottom five are raleigh ( 3.2 % ), cincinnati ( 3.2 % ), memphis ( 3.1 % ), pittsburgh ( 3 % ), and birmingham ( 2.6 % ). No huge surprise about birmingham, the times notes, considering the prevalence of anti-gay attitudes in the south. Yet consider the statistical similarities: the percentage of americans identifying as gay runs at 3.6 % nationwide, including roughly 3 % outside some big cities. And the data may simply reflect how comfortable lgbt residents are coming out to a pollster: \" i ' m as out as out can be, and my first thought was,'do i really want to tell gallup that i ' m gay?

        "summary": "Apple's fight with the feds over unlocking the san bernardino shooter's phone has dominated the headlines, but a judge demanded a woman's fingerprint be used to unlock her iphone — a first in a federal court case, reports the los angeles times. Paytsar bkhchadzhyan's phone was seized from a home in glendale, calif., associated with her boyfriend, an alleged armenian gang member. Less than an hour after bkhchadzhyan's arrest, a judge ordered the 29-year-old to unlock her iphone through apple's touch id. She later pleaded no contest to a felony count of identity theft, but the law is murky here: police can get a warrant to search a phone and can take fingerprints without court approval. But whether they can demand fingerprints to unlock a phone is unclear, per engadget. An expert says bkhchadzhyan's phone may have contained incriminating information, meaning the court order violated her fifth amendment right in essentially forcing her to testify. \" it's the same as if she went home and pulled out paper documents, \" she says. According to a 2014 court ruling, however, fingerprints are considered \" real or physical evidence, \" the extraction of which doesn't violate the right against self-incrimination. Pass codes, on the other hand, are a form of knowledge and are generally protected. \" this is why i tell my criminal procedure students that they have more protections if they use a pass code rather than fingerprint to guard entry to their phones, \" a law professor tells ars technica. \" while i don't conduct crimes on my cellphone, i still decline to use my fingerprint out of an abundance of caution. \"",

Anthony filed for bankruptcy in january; most of the debts are to jose baez, her defense attorney in her murder trial. But the case is not yet closed, and it's not clear how much ( if any ) money anthony will have to pay, the sentinel notes; the judge's order simply does away with anthony's legal obligation to pay most of the debts, but could leave her still responsible for certain debts including any related to taxes, student loans, or fines in criminal cases. One thing that means: taxpayers will likely end up footing the almost $ 200,000 bill related to what law enforcement agencies spent searching for anthony's murdered daughter caylee, which anthony was originally ordered to pay back after she was convicted of lying to investigators, wftv reports. But, a legal analyst says, it's likely anthony will at least have to pay more than $ 80,000 in federal income taxes on the $ 200,000 she got for selling pictures and videos of caylee to abc television.",

The $ 200,000 is how much the orange county sheriff's office and other local law enforcement agencies said they spent in the search for anthony's 2-year-old daughter, caylee, when anthony said the girl was missing. Channel 9 legal analyst bill sheaffer said anthony will have to pay federal income taxes on the $ 200,000 she received for selling her videos and photos of caylee to abc television. Anthony went on trial in 2011 on first-degree murder charges in the death of caylee. Anthony was acquitted. In her trial, which took place three years after she was indicted on the first-degree murder charges, anthony's defense attorneys told the jury that caylee drowned on the day she reportedly disappeared and that she was never really missing. That led to convictions for lying to investigators and to an order by chief judge belvin perry that anthony pay back what the sheriff's office and other law enforcement agencies spent looking for caylee. Wednesday's federal bankruptcy order discharging anthony's debts does not specifically address whether she still owes that money, but sheaffer said that most likely she does not. \" if this is a debt compensating law enforcement for a loss, it's usually not a debt that can survive bankruptcy, \" said sheaffer. But sheaffer said anthony does have to pay more than $ 80,000 in income taxes because of when she filed for bankruptcy. Those taxes were assessed in november 2010, but since less than three years passed between then and when she filed for bankruptcy in january 2013, she still owes the internal revenue service. Anthony could still be forced to pay in two defamation lawsuits. If the tampa bankruptcy judge decides that anthony's accusatory statements about a woman with the same name as her made-up nanny and about the man who found caylee's remains were malicious and willful, those defamation lawsuits would come back to orange county for juries to decide how much she would have to pay for them."

According to a government investigation, cho ( also known as heather cho ) became enraged when a flight attendant brought her macadamia nuts in a bag, not on a plate, so she screamed at him and demanded the plane be brought back to the gate to dump him. The crew chief also talked to local media and said that cho cursed him out and jabbed him with a document folder, reuters reports. Although cho, the daughter of korean air ceo cho yang-ho, has since resigned from all posts, notes cnn, seoul officials want to charge her with inflight violence and changing a flight route, the guardian reports.

The arrest was announced just an hour after the publication of a bombshell national security agency report from may 5 detailing russian hacking of a voting equipment vendor and attempts to hack 122 local election officials just days before the election. The latest: the intercept story based on the document allegedly supplied by winner describes it as the \" most detailed us government account of russian interference in the election that has yet come to light. \" it details how, contrary to vladimir putin's claim that russia had never tried to interfere in the election, russia's military intelligence agency hacked an american company and used information from that hack for a \" spearphishing \" campaign targeting local government officials. Prosecutors say winner printed the classified document earlier this month while working for defense contractor pluribus international corporation, the guardian reports. Winner, who grew up in texas and had a top-secret security clearance during the six years she served in the us air force, had been working for the company in augusta, ga., since february of this year. Winner was a frequent critic of president trump on twitter, but her mother says she never talked about her job and the family is shocked by the arrest. \" she's very passionate. Very passionate about her views and things like that, but she's never to my knowledge been active in politics or any of that, \" the mother tells the daily beast. Winner has been charged under the espionage act and faces up to 10 years in prison. \" releasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation's security and undermines public faith in government, \" deputy attorney general rod j. Rosenstein said in a statement, per the washington post. He praised the fast work of investigators in tracking down winner. The outline looks at how winner was caught, which it says shows \" how not to leak secret documents. \" she allegedly communicated with the intercept from a computer at work before printing the document and mailing it to a news outlet. One of the clues that led investigators to winner was a tell-tale crease mark on a copy an intercept reporter showed another government official; the mark suggested it had been printed and folded, leading the government to probe who could have printed it. According to a justice department affidavit, winner has admitted taking the document and sending it to the news outlet. She is",

        "summary": "Kids are capable of thinking strategically, including using competitiveness and lies to their own benefit, by the time they're 7. So report researchers out of the university of minnesota who studied 69 kids ages 3 to 9 playing two games. Kids typically figure out how to infer what others are thinking and what motivates them — and act strategically based on this information — somewhere between 6 and 7 years old, reports abc science. What's more, by that age they've sorted out that they don't have to trust others, and they don't have to be truthful themselves. The researchers call this the \" strategic theory of mind. \" in the first game, kids play either sender or receiver; the sender knows which of two boxes contains candy, and the receiver must guess after the sender points to one of the boxes. The sender keeps the candy if the receiver guesses the wrong box, and the receiver keeps it if he or she picks the correct box. In the second game, a kid and an experimenter are tasked with choosing one to five stickers simultaneously; the player who selects the fewest keeps that number of stickers, the other doesn't get any, and neither gets any if they pick the same number. By 6.5 years of age, kids'thinking while playing such games is sophisticated enough to resemble an adult's, reports medical xpress.

        "summary": "Thailand's military ruler said authorities are searching for yingluck shinawatra — the prime minister he ousted three years ago — after she failed to appear for a verdict friday in a criminal case that could send her to prison for 10 years. Yingluck's whereabouts were not immediately known, and her absence fueled speculation — so far unproven — that she might have left the country, the ap reports. Her lawyer could not be reached for comment. Yingluck, who became thailand's first female premier when her party swept elections in 2011, is accused of negligence in overseeing a money-losing rice subsidy program. She pleaded innocent and decried the charges as politically motivated. A verdict had been expected friday, as thousands of yingluck supporters gathered outside the court and thousands of police stood guard. But yingluck never appeared, and a judge read out a statement saying her lawyers had informed the court she could not attend because of an earache. The country's supreme court then issued an arrest warrant, saying it did not believe the excuse because no medical verification was provided. Sources close to the shinawatra family told reuters that yingluck has indeed fled the country, though they didn't comment on her current whereabouts.",

            "One of the last remaining veterans of world war ii in congress called thursday afternoon for his colleagues to end the government shutdown, suggesting that members of the legislative body who have appeared at the world war ii memorial this week are not doing enough to support those who served in the conflict. \"if this congress truly wishes to recognize the sacrifice and bravery of our world war ii veterans and all who've come after, it will end this shutdown and re-open our government now, \" john dingell, ( d-mich. ), said in a joint statement issued with former republican sen. Bob dole of kansas, a combat-injured veteran of world war ii. The department of veterans affairs warned this week that its progress is cutting the backlog of disability claims by 30 percent over the last six months is likely to be reversed by the shutdown. The department said that it is no longer able to pay overtime to claims processors, an initiative begun in may that officials say was supposed to continue until november. \"the current shutdown has slowed the rate at which the government can process veterans'disability claims and, as the va has stated, it is negatively impacting other services to our nation's veterans, \" dingell and dole said in their statement. Dingell and rep. Ralph hall, ( r-tex. ), are the only veterans of world war ii remaining in congress. Several veterans groups, including the american legion, have issued statements calling for an end to the shutdown. \"the american legion wants congress to stop its bickering and stop making america's veterans suffer for its own lack of political resolve in the face of this national crisis, \" the organization said thursday."

        "summary": "Shipwreck hunters are planning to excavate around a lake erie wreck this summer that they think could be the remains of a schooner that went down nearly two centuries ago. Its size, design, and location point toward it being a sailing ship called the lake serpent, which sank in 1829, the national museum of the great lakes said monday. Per the ap, the schooner was built in 1821 in cleveland to carry cargo — produce, flour, whiskey, limestone — to ports along the lakes. It went down in a storm eight years later with a load of stone and a small crew near kelleys island off the ohio shoreline. The bodies of the schooner's owners, brothers ezra and robert wright, washed ashore in lorain county a week later, cleveland.com reports; where exactly the ship went down — and what happened to the other two crew members — remained a mystery. Tom kowalczk, a lake erie wreck diver, spotted the wreckage on his sonar screen in 2015. Members of the cleveland underwater explorers and the museum narrowed the list of ships it might be to three, with the lake serpent being the most likely answer. The ship had an unusual carving of a serpent's head on the bow, and the museum is raising money so that divers this summer can remove the sediment that surrounds the bow to see if they can find the serpent's head. They also plan to take measurements, examine how the ship was constructed, and look for artifacts that could id the ship as the lake serpent. If it's confirmed to be the schooner, it will be the oldest shipwreck ever found in lake erie, per the museum's archaeology director. Searchers don't expect to find any bodies: \" after 189 years, i don't expect there to be any organic material left, \" the director says.",

Dyer had no idea he had done so until she happened to see him cutting the lawn one day. \" he's like right there, practically in my backyard and that kind of makes me nervous and not want to go home ever, \" she says.

Because of dyer's case, that may soon change. State rep. Kyle hilbert tells people that while he's happy for dyer, the protective order issued by the judge covers only her case. He plans to introduce a law in the next legislative session to prevent similar cases in the future. \" she is almost certainly not the only person going through this right now, \" he says.",
