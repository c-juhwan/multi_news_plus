Jeff mizanskey — sentenced to life without parole in 1994 — will be greeted by family members as he leaves jefferson city correctional center this morning, reports komu. Gov. Jay nixon altered his sentence to life with the possibility of parole in may, and after his first parole hearing on aug. 4, the board took just four days to grant mizanskey's release, rather than the usual six to eight weeks. \" it's like a dream come true, \" mizanskey told kctv. Though he feels guilty for missing important moments in his kids ' and grandkids ' lives — \" that's something i ' ll probably die with, \" he says — he now plans to spend time with family, assist youth offenders, and perhaps start a construction business, per kmbc. He ' ll also support marijuana reform, but he won't smoke the stuff, even in states where it's legal, as long as it's illegal federally. It's part of a promise he made to his mother before her death that \" i'd never do anything knowingly to break the law to get put back in ( prison ), \" he says. After two convictions for marijuana possession in 1984 and 1991, mizanskey was jailed for his role in the purchase of several pounds of marijuana in 1994 under missouri's three-strikes law, repealed in 2014, reports kctv. His son recently drew attention to his case, starting a petition that drew 400,000 signatures, while the group show-me cannabis put up billboards asking residents to call nixon to plead mizanskey's case. The group has now started a \" going-home \" fund for mizanskey, which has reached $ 7,000 of a $ 25,000 goal.",

Regulators — who vote on a recommendation to ban the desk-toy magnets later this month unless they're large enough to not be considered a choking hazard — have revealed that some 7,700 emergency room visits have been caused by children swallowing the powerful magnets, and they caused the horrific death of a 19-month-old girl last year, usa today reports. Annaka chaffin swallowed seven magnets from a necklace and died when they attached to each other inside her, perforating her bowel. Doctors first believed a virus was making annaka unwell, but she died the day after a hospital visit after being found with blood coming from her nose and mouth. An autopsy found the magnets. \" this case illustrates how difficult it is to diagnose the injuries associated with ingested magnets: the symptoms seemed to indicate a common stomach ailment or poisoning, \" the cpsc says. The founder of buckyballs dissolved the company in 2012 — after slamming a recall as \" government gone absurd \" — and now sells larger \" liberty balls \" that regulators consider less dangerous. According to vice, the founder of zen magnets, which still sells the smaller magnets, said last month that he plans to battle \" the cpsc's magnet prohibition until triumph, or until a glorious death of insolvency on the legal battlefield. \" ( the deaths of two kids recently prompted a massive bean bag chair recall. )",

( photo: family photo ) federal regulators said for the first time wednesday that a child died last year and about 7,700 children have visited emergency rooms after swallowing small, high-powered magnets like those found in popular desk toys. The consumer product safety commission's staff announced the deaths and ingestions in a proposed final rule it sent to the full commission. It would ban the type of high-powered magnets made popular by buckyballs, which were recalled in july. The full commission is expected to vote on the rule later this month. Magnets would be allowed only if they were large enough to not fit through a cylinder used to test choking hazards. Buckyballs founder craig zucker, who dissolved the buckyballs company in december 2012, has a new company called united we ball, which is believed to have the only magnetic product that would be allowed under the rule.

        "summary": "You ' ll find shells on the shores of many bodies of water; on the banks of the dead sea, you ' ll find sinkholes, and more than 3,000 of them at that. Their existence isn't new — abc news reports the first one opened up three decades ago, and a 2005 smithsonian article tallied more than 1,000 — but their number and pace are grabbing notice. An environmental expert puts it plainly: we're to blame. \" these sinkholes are a direct result of the inappropriate mismanagement of water resources in the region, \" says gidon bromberg, a director with ecopeace middle east. And they're causing real problems. Haaretz in late january reported that sinkholes have crept up to route 90, the road adjacent to the dead sea, causing part of the road to sink and triggering a temporary closure that a local official framed as devastating for tourism in the region. \" you might as well just wipe it off the map. \" experts have long warned the dead sea itself could be wiped off the map: it's dropping four feet per year, and smithsonian explained the science of the shrinkage: \" the fresh water aquifers along the perimeter of the lake are receding. As this fresh water diffuses into salt deposits beneath the surface of the shoreline, the water slowly dissolves the deposits until the earth above collapses without warning. \" the sinkholes are not just unpredictable, says bromberg. They also emerge in groups and open into each other, growing mammoth ones. He sees a path to stabilization, though: diverting more of the jordan river's fresh water into the dead sea. Meanwhile, israel and jordan last month signed an agreement that will see water from the red sea channeled into the dead sea, the jerusalem post reported, though some have expressed skepticism about the plan.

On friday, the president himself emphatically denied the allegation made by his former attorney. \" no, i did not know of the meeting with my son, don jr., \" trump tweeted. \" sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam ( taxi cabs maybe? ). \" the latter is a reference to this.

Plus, cohen may be looking for a deal to avoid prison time after the fbi raid on his offices, and thus \" there may be reason to doubt that cohen's allegations are true. \" but one other thing to note: cnn says others were present at the meeting cohen mentions, meaning robert mueller might be able to corroborate.

The oct. 4 ambush took the lives of staff sgt. Jeremiah johnson, staff sgt. Bryan black, staff sgt. Dustin wright, and sgt. La david johnson. In all, the investigative team interviewed 143 witnesses, reports the washington post. It \"examined documentary, photographic, audio, video and testimonial evidence, \" per cnn. One survivor even returned to the battlefield with the team. The patrol was submitted and approved as a low-risk recon assignment, but the team was actually on a high-risk mission searching for islamic state leader doundoun cheffou; their true mission was never approved by the proper chain of command, though the team notes this was a result of \" sloppiness \" rather than an intent to deceive. The patrol, which did not rehearse the mission before setting out and was missing key equipment and training, encountered light fire at first but then was engaged by a larger group of militants on motorcycles and in trucks mounted with machine guns. The report found that the arrival of french mirage planes disrupted the fight and may have saved lives, reports the new york times. The remains of three of the us soldiers who were killed were retrieved quickly, but the body of la david johnson was not retrieved until the evening of oct. 6. The delay in recovering johnson's body had led to speculation that he had been taken captive. That speculation was bolstered by locals who said that they saw the body and that johnson's hands appeared to be tied behind his back. The report, nevertheless, concluded that his hands were not bound and he was killed in action while \"actively engaging the enemy. \" the full report remains classified.",

A separate, ongoing review will make that determination. Marine gen. Thomas d. Waldhauser, who heads u.s.

A separate, ongoing review will make that determination. Marine gen. Thomas d. Waldhauser, who heads u.s. Africa command, said the team of 11 americans involved in the firefight was inadequately trained and prepared even before it stepped off its base for the ill-fated mission near the village of tongo tongo.

Trump will also generously allow american citizens, including those serving abroad in the military, to return home from traveling overseas no matter what their religion is, reports the washington post. More: trump brought up the 9/11 attacks and denied he was a bigot when abc's barbara walters asked him about the policy, mediaite reports. When walters suggested that his rhetoric is very helpful for isis, trump said: \" i ' m the worst thing that's ever happened to isis. \" some of the strongest overseas criticism of trump came from britain, where prime minister david cameron called his attitude \" divisive, unhelpful, and quite simply wrong, \" the bbc reports. As for trump's claim that some parts of london are so radicalized that the police are afraid, mayor boris johnson called it ridiculous, saying, \" the only reason i wouldn't go to some parts of new york is the real risk of meeting donald trump. \" amid heavy criticism from gop leaders — including house speaker paul ryan, who said trump's proposal is \" not conservatism \" and not what the us stands for — trump touted a poll that found 68 % of his supporters would stand by him if he ran as an independent, the hill reports. Stephen king can be added to the growing list of people scared by trump. \" that anyone in america would even consider voting for this rabid coyote leaves me speechless, \" the author tweeted. As with earlier controversies, trump's latest remarks are damaging his business interests, the telegraph reports. The dubai-based landmark group says all trump home products will be removed from stores in the middle east. The globe and mail reports that in vancouver and toronto, officials are calling for trump towers to be renamed.

The event was eventually handed over to activists with more experience in logistics. \" i didn't really think it would've ever gone viral, \" says shook, who will attend. \" i don't even know how to go viral. \" a university of california-santa barbara poli sci professor, however, says it makes sense that a woman, not an organization, was the impetus behind the event, which is expected to see gloria steinem and amy schumer, among other big names, in attendance. \" each organization has its own image that draws some people and pushes others back away, \" she notes.",

            "Kyodo/reuters japan doesn't really believe in dying young. At least, not according to conventional timelines. New data from the country's ministry of health, labor, and welfare reveal japan has broken its own record for most centenarians by population for the 46th straight year. With 32,000 new 100-year-olds, there are now more than 65,000 people in japan who've lived 100 years or more. Though it trails first-place us by roughly 10,000 centenarians, japan's population is only a third of america's. In other words, no country on earth has a larger percentage of people who have reached their 100th birthday. The feat sounds positive, especially in a country where longevity is so prized that september 19 — respect for the aged day — is a national holiday in which members of the 100-plus club traditionally receive a silver sake dish. But having so many people live that long is actually becoming a burden on the nation's economy. Seniors, though revered, are eating up resources at a pace younger generations can't match. In 2014, for instance, awarding 59,000 centenarians the silver dish cost the country approximately $ 2.1 million. Compare that to 1966, when the country only had to give out a few hundred. By 1998, the number had climbed to 10,000, and today",

The supposed riders involved in the account — which the san francisco chronicle compares to the \" phantom hitchhiker \" urban legend — were generally young people, and kudo has a theory about that. \" young people feel strongly chagrined [ at their deaths ] when they cannot meet people they love, \" she tells asahi shimbun. \" as they want to convey their bitterness, they may have chosen taxis, which are like private rooms, as a medium to do so. \" but the drivers don't seem overly spooked by the incidents. \" it is not strange to see a ghost [ here ], \" one driver says. \" if i encounter a ghost again, i will accept it as my passenger. \" japanese taxi drivers start the meter as soon as a passenger gets in, and these drivers all reportedly ended up paying the unpaid fares for their mysterious riders.

The unnamed man, who was 17 at the time of the rape, has now served the maximum sentence allowed under indian law, reports the bbc, and was released sunday to a charity amid protests, legal challenges seeking to block his freedom, and fears for his safety. His release had been expected, with victim jyoti singh's mother speaking out a few days ago; the ap reports that singh's parents led protests in delhi against his release though the bbc notes that their efforts were largely thwarted by indian police. A legal challenge ended friday with a court ruling that \" we agree it is a serious issue. But after 20 december, the juvenile cannot be kept at a special home per law. \" the man is among six convicted in the attack; four are appealing death sentences, while one died in prison.

Fleming and her 3-week-old daughter, serenity, were reported missing by her boyfriend in anderson, more than 100 miles away, after they never returned from what the woman claimed was a court hearing, and police found fleming's body on friday. She had been stabbed multiple times, doused in bleach, and dumped in a plastic bin, the chicago tribune reports. Police say they found the baby at the gary home with a woman who said it was the child of her sister, who had left town. Serenity was returned to relatives and the 36-year-old suspect was tracked down to the texas hospital. She appears to have planned this for a long time and learned enough about fleming to convince her she was a social worker, a police spokesman tells the tribune. He says the woman had set up a room in the home with everything needed for a baby girl. Police say the suspect told relatives she was pregnant with twins, later claiming one died during delivery.

        "summary": "A new study finds that 200 million deaths could be avoided by the year 2025 if we triple the taxes placed on tobacco around the world, medical news today reports. In some countries, the increase would double the price; the difference in cost between the cheapest and most expensive brands would also be diminished, meaning smokers wouldn't be likely to simply switch brands, because doing so wouldn't save them much money, says the world health organization. In addition, the study notes, the higher cost of cigarettes would likely discourage young people from smoking. Extra revenue generated by the tax hike — the authors estimate $ 100 billion a year — could be spent on health care, the authors say. Though the strategy would be most effective in low- and middle-income countries, the authors say high-income countries would also see a decrease in consumption. Right now, taxes make up 30 % to 40 % of tobacco's cost in lower-income countries, the mirror explains, while in higher-income countries, that number is between 50 % and 60 %.",

            "According to the world health organization, tobacco use is a cause of death for more than 5.4 million people worldwide every year. But a new review published in the new england journal of medicine suggests that by tripling the taxes on tobacco globally, 200 million tobacco deaths could be avoided by 2025. Authors of the review, including dr. Prabhat jha, director of the center for global health research of st. Michael's hospital and the dalla lana school of public health at the university of toronto, say that the tax increase would double the retail price of tobacco in some countries, as well as reduce the price difference between the cheapest and most expensive cigarettes. They add that rather than pushing smokers to swap to a cheaper cigarette brand, the strategy would encourage them to quit smoking and discourage young people from taking up the habit. Dr. Jha says tripling tobacco taxes would be particularly effective in low- and middle-income countries, where smoking rates are on the rise and the price of tobacco is relatively low. But he adds that high-income countries would also see benefits from the approach. He uses france as an example, noting that the country halved its cigarette consumption between 1990 and 2005 by increasing taxes to well above inflation. Dr. Jha adds: \" death and taxes are inevitable, but they don't need to be in",
            "Tripling tobacco taxes around the world could cut smoking by a third and prevent 200 million premature deaths by the end of this century, researchers claim. The tax boost would encourage people to quit smoking rather than switch from more expensive to cheaper brands, and help to stop young people taking up the habit, say the scientists. They came to the conclusion after conducting a systematic review of 63 studies on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in different countries. Research has shown that a 50 % higher inflation-adjusted price for cigarettes reduces tobacco consumption by about a fifth, with the biggest impact on the young and poor. In most high-income countries, about 50 % to 60 % of the price of a pack of cigarettes is tax. But in most low and middle-income countries, tax makes up only 30 % to 40 % of the cost. Study co-author professor sir richard peto, from the charity cancer research uk, said: \"the two certainties in life are death and taxes. We want higher tobacco taxes and fewer tobacco deaths. \" it would help children not to start, and it would help many adults to stop while there's still time. \"globally, about half of all young men and one in 10 of all young women become smokers, and, particularly in developing countries, relatively few quit."

        "summary": "A 600-foot tunnel below a pyramid in the ancient mexican city of teotihuacan has given up 50,000 artifacts — but its latest reveal could indicate something far more significant lies in wait. After six years of toiling below the pyramid of the plumed serpent, archaeologist sergio gomez says he's uncovered \" large quantities \" of liquid mercury at the end of the tunnel, which leads to three chambers that have been untouched for 1,800 years. Though the reflective metal has been found at maya sites to the south of teotihuacan, outside mexico city, \" it's something that completely surprised us, \" gomez tells reuters. Rare in ancient mexico, liquid mercury may have been used to symbolize a lake or river that would carry a spirit to the underworld and experts suggest an unexplored chamber may house the first royal tomb ever discovered in teotihuacan. \" mirrors were considered a way to look into the supernatural world, they were a way to divine what might happen in the future, \" an archaeologist explains, per the guardian. \" it could be a sort of river, albeit a pretty spectacular one. \" teotihuacan, separate from the maya civilization, rose to prominence 1,900 years ago and became the largest city in the americas before it was abandoned around 700ad. As no written record was left behind, archaeologists know little about the city and the 200,000 people who probably once called it home. While gomez hopes a king's tomb will give insight into teotihuacan's system of power, excavations have revealed no royal residence and the city's various murals don't portray a single ruler, an archaeologist notes, suggesting gomez may instead find a tomb of one of four lords who may have shared rule. Gomez says a study of the tombs should wrap up in october. ( click for more teotihuacan discoveries. )",

Over the next 20 years, the city, which sits some 90 miles north of the arctic circle, will move itself two miles east, in a relocation effort the wall street journal calls \" virtually unprecedented. \" kiruna is home to the largest iron ore mine in the world ( what's extracted from it in a day could construct six eiffel towers, notes the afp ), and that very identity is what's forcing the move. Nearly a decade ago, the country's state-controlled mining company alerted kiruna to the fact that recovering more iron ore from the kiruna mine meant digging deeper — digging that may ultimately cause the city's center to collapse. In may a deeper main level of the mine was opened, reports the rail engineer, and now the clock has really started. The entire city center and some 3,000 apartments and homes will be uprooted; most buildings will be razed, but 19 historic ones will be transported to the new location, notes the epoch times. Because the town's economy is so dependent on the mine, residents are largely in favor of relocating, but concerns persist, from whether the timetable can be met to the amount of compensation residents will get for their homes.

Then things fell apart. \" today for the first time in my life... I experienced someone call the police because they got fouled hard in basketball, \" reads a tweet accompanying a photo of the two players involved and the responding sheriff's deputies. The man who went tumbling during the game reportedly stormed out and to the front desk, where a worker placed a call to the loudoun county sheriff's office. Abc news reports the incident report referenced an \" assault, \" but the situation didn't escalate into charges. The men were reportedly warned, however, that they needed to \" keep the game civil \" or they'd be tossed out of the gym for the day. Then came what fox 5 calls the \" perhaps most bizarre \" element of the incident: the men went back to the court and finished the game.",

But since the \" savory \" taste ( also called umami ) was added as a fifth taste about a decade ago, the list is expanding — and rapidly — as scientists better understand how we taste; there could be as many as 20 other candidates, the new york times reports. So how does this all work? when food enters our mouths, chemicals pass over our taste buds and help us differentiate between items that are nutritious ( which tend to register as pleasant ) and poisonous ( which tend to cause revulsion ). Some tastes are registered unconsciously, while many are more conscious, set apart by having their own sets of receptor cells. Molecular biologists began to learn which cells in our mouths detect bitter and sweet tastes about 15 years ago; in the past few years, they've proposed receptor cells on the tongue dedicated to calcium, water, carbonation, soapiness, electric, alkaline, and metallic, among others. The next big contender? fattiness, previously dismissed as just a texture. Coolness ( think peppermint ) and piquance ( think hot peppers ) are also proposed, reports business insider. \" the taste field has been absolutely revolutionized, \" one biologist says. \" we've made more progress in the last 15 years than in the previous 100. \" ( as for scents, check out exactly why bacon smells so good. )",

First off, the republican signed a bill allowing faith-based groups to deny adoption placement to anyone who defies their beliefs, the washington post reports. Gay rights advocates say this will leave more children in limbo and let organizations funded partly by taxes to deny prospective parents. \" oklahoma has now joined a small group of states that have broken the cardinal rule of child welfare — that the needs of children should come first, \" says rev. Stan j. Sloan, who heads an lgbtq rights group. Another group says it will sue oklahoma for apparently violating the separation of church and state. Fallin also vetoed a bill that would have let oklahomans carry a handgun in public without proper training, the ap reports. Law enforcement officials supported her, saying the law would have damaged public safety and softened background checks. But the nra called it a broken campaign promise. \" make no mistake, this temporary setback will be rectified when oklahoma residents elect a new and genuinely pro-second amendment governor, \" says an nra official. Indeed, fallin is in the final months of her second term and cannot run for a third.

        "summary": "There are all sorts of ways a person can be distracted at the wheel — kids screeching, sleep deprivation, arguing — and they predate cell phones. But research in the journal scientific reports pits two types of distraction ( being \" emotional \" or \" absent-minded \" ) against texting and finds the latter far worse. It turns out most people have a sort of sixth sense that allows them to maintain a straight line in spite of many distractions. But texting \" wreaks havoc \" on that sixth sense, university of houston researcher ioannis pavlidis says in a eureka alert news release. The study was small with only 59 participants, but the results are striking. The part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, which the researchers write is \" known to automatically intervene as an error corrector, \" requires hand-eye coordination, reports live science. Texting disrupts this built-in auto correct so that we no longer subconsciously correct our mistakes, which the researchers observed watching drivers navigate the same segment of highway four times ( non-distracted driving was the control ). The findings could help make cars safer. \" we are currently looking into the development of a car system to monitor outward driving behaviors, such as steering jitter or lane deviation, as well as the internal state of the driver that causes them, \" pavlidis says. A \" stressalyzer \" could serve as a \" black box \" in car accidents as well as warn drivers if they are distracted. ( here's how people who text drivers could also be held liable. )",

The sanders campaign says the staffer responsible has been fired, though sources tell the new york times that no fewer than four sanders-linked accounts searched clinton data while the firewall was down on wednesday. The dnc has now temporarily suspended the sanders campaign from accessing its voter database, which could prove to be a major setback if the suspension continues for long, cnn reports. In a statement, a sanders spokesman admitted the clinton data was accessed but blamed ngp van for repeatedly dropping the firewall between democratic campaigns, even though the sanders campaign had alerted the dnc to the problem months ago. When it was dropped again this week, \" after discussion with the dnc, it became clear that one of our staffers accessed some modeling data from another campaign, \" the spokesman said. \" that behavior is unacceptable and that staffer was immediately fired. \"",

The knock that he's being \" engineered \" has drawn plenty of criticism, but josh tells wpix that he shrugs it off. \"i don't read the articles or the comments, \" he says. \" i just go out and play football. It's the game i love and the game i've played all my life. \" click to read the full profile by stanmyre, headlined \" how to build a sports superstar in 2015. \" ( this female teen runner might be the best ever someday. )",

        "summary": "Subway is back in the news over a controversial figure that appears in its advertising — and thankfully we're not talking about jared again. No, this time the culprit is subway's footlong subs that aren't always a foot long. The milwaukee journal sentinel reports a federal judge agreed to a preliminary settlement this month for a class action lawsuit on behalf of everyone who purchased a sandwich at subway since 2003. Unfortunately, the tens of millions of us that applies to won't get any money — or even a free sub. Instead, subway has agreed to take steps to \"help ensure that the bread sold to customers is either 6 or 12 inches long, \" according to the wall street journal. And usa today reports subway will no longer train employees to have \" a small tolerance in the size of a footlong sandwich. \" the lawsuit on behalf of what is possibly the largest number of plaintiffs ever started in 2012, when one brave subway customer complained on social media that his footlong sub was more like 11 inches, the journal sentinel reports. That was followed by a number of lawsuits from around the country that were eventually combined. As part of the settlement, nine customers who participated in the lawsuit could get up to $ 1,000, but subway doesn't have to admit to any misleading advertising about the length of its sandwiches. You might think this sounds like a lot of work to get an extra inch of chicken &amp; bacon ranch melt, but attorney thomas zimmerman disagrees. \" as a result of this litigation, subway enacted some significant quality-control measures, \" he says.",

Share by of the size does matter after all, in sandwiches if not class action settlements. After lengthy litigation over the measurement of subway's foot-long and six-inch sandwiches, a federal judge in milwaukee has signed off on a preliminary resolution of several class action lawsuits over the issue. The final approved class may be one of the largest in any kind of lawsuit — everyone who bought a subway sandwich in the u.s. Since 2003. No court records even try to put a number to that besides tens of millions; there are 27,000 subway shops in the u.s. But all most of the class members will get from the deal is the assurance that subway now pays more attention to the dimensions of its subs. Nine named plaintiffs, as representatives of the class, could get up to $ 1,000 each. Despite the enormity of the class, the final payout for attorney fees and costs, including the class representative payments, will not exceed $ 525,000, according to court records. Thomas zimmerman of chicago, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys, noted that won't cover all the time all the parties spent on the case, which included thousands of pages of information from both sides, as well as third parties.

The biggest knock from critics is that he is yet another white guy in the late-night lineup. Here's a sampling of what's out there: frank rich, new york: \" it's hard to imagine a better choice than colbert, whose talents are many and will be even more apparent once he's liberated from his colbert report character. \" willa paskin, slate: it will be a \" tragedy \" if colbert is reduced to fawning interviews, but the brilliance of his current show makes that unlikely. \" if colbert can bring his ire and pointed wit to bear on the format — turn the monologue into more of an argument or op-ed than a string of lame jokes; invite authors, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals to join him after the celebrities — that will be a boon to himself, cbs, audiences, and the genre. \" tim goodman, hollywood reporter: brilliant move. \" yes, fans of colbert ' in character ' will miss his show, but the truth is that the format, despite being an excellent vehicle that launched colbert to stardom, was far too limiting for colbert's talent. He's absolutely going to blossom with this new freedom. \" erin gloria ryan, jezebel: the move draws attention to \" the pervasive and pesky problem of a lack of diversity in late night talk show hosts, \" she writes. \" if comedy central replaces colbert with a similarly formatted program, will the new kid on the block be another white guy? or will they take a risk and let a woman or a person of color take a shot? colbert got his big promotion because he busted his ass for years and proved he was up to the task. It would be great if more women had the chance to do the same. \" popular tweet: \" in spite of being white, male, straight, popular, competent, and rich, stephen colbert has overcome the odds and succeeded, \" writes teju cole. Pete dominick, daily beast: \" can colbert drop the character and still succeed? of course, \" writes dominick, who worked on the show for six years. \" hosting the report has always been far more difficult than a late night network-style talk show.

The study focused on \" proprioceptively dynamic activities, \" that is, ones that involved proprioception and a second factor ( like locomotion or navigation ) at the same time, the researchers write in perceptual and motor skills. Proprioception is basically your ability to sense your body's position and movement in space, and a 2013 io9 article gave a great visual: if you can close your eyes and touch your nose, you have proprioception to thank. So the researchers had adults between the ages of 18 and 59 do activities like climbing trees, running barefoot, and walking on a balance beam. There were also two control groups: a college class and a yoga class. All participants had their working memory tested at the start and two hours later, and the researchers found that while the control groups showed no change, those who completed the proprioceptively dynamic tasks had a 50 % jump in their working memory capacity. And the higher one's working memory, the better one can process information, with a press release noting the benefits can extend \" from grades to sports. \" ( a previous unf study also found it can make you a better liar. ) the researchers think the \" environment and terrain changes \" associated with the proprioceptively dynamic activities — versus sitting in a classroom or getting into downward dog — have an effect, and were encouraged to see gains were made so quickly. \" by taking a break to do activities that are unpredictable...

Lawyers for alexandra nicole laird, 21, moved to have the new mom released on bond to a detox program following tuesday's birth. Laird was arrested after giving birth to a daughter in march 2016 who was found to be addicted to opiates. The newborn spent a month in the icu for withdrawal, and laird allegedly admitted to using heroin throughout that pregnancy. She was free on bond in that case when she was arrested for failure to appear in court in august; in september, she told authorities she was pregnant again. When she admitted she had been using heroin daily, authorities moved to lock her up until she delivered. The move touched off a debate over the treatment of pregnant addicts. \" i ' m doing my damndest to try to prevent any further damage to this child, since it's obvious the mother doesn't seem to care, \" pleasant grove police lt. Danny reid told a judge at the time. Reactions are still strong, according to comments posted on al.com, with one reader calling the case \" unbelievably sad. \" a drug-addicted baby is born in the us every 19 minutes, per reuters. Laird spent the duration of her pregnancy at uab hospital. After she gave birth on tuesday, her lawyer filed a papers seeking her release on bond but indicating she would remain in the hospital's detox program. Police did not oppose laird's release since she has given birth, but the judge has not yet ruled on the motion. Authorities did not release information on the baby, citing privacy laws. Laird, who does not have custody of her first child, still faces child endangerment charges. ( a mom's viral photo shows the harsh reality of heroin. )",

Two democratic state representatives switched parties, claiming they could no longer support president obama and his policies.

            "Color kentucky red now. As of tuesday night, consider the political realignment of the south from blue to red complete. Kentucky democrats just lost control of the state house they had held on to for nearly a century — and with it, the party's last southern legislative chamber. The development was a year in the making. Democrats ' control of the chamber had been hanging on by a thread as republicans swept most other statewide offices in the 2015 elections. The gop wave was led by gov. Matt bevin, a businessman whose outside appeal and flare have been likened to donald trump and who came from behind to become only the second republican to lead the state in four decades. ( speaking of trump, the gop nominee won kentucky on tuesday with more than 60 percent of the vote. ) after kentucky democrats lost the governor's mansion and several statewide offices, they nearly lost the state house due to party defections. Two democratic state representatives switched parties, claiming they could no longer support president obama and his policies. And two more democratic state representatives resigned to accept appointments by kentucky's new republican governor, bevin. Suddenly four seats in the chamber were open. And four just happened to be the magic number republicans needed to take control of it ( democrats held control at 50-46 ).",

        "summary": "A sixth-grader in austin, texas, has turned a lemonade stand into a booming business now that she has expanded her reach to multiple states through a deal with whole foods, reports time. Mikaila ulmer's secret recipe for beesweet lemonade comes from her great-grandmother, and contains flax seed and honey as the sweetener. Things really got going last year when she was just 9 and took the locally popular lemonade to abc's shark tank and earned a $ 60,000 investment. The whole foods deal gets her lemonade on the shelves at 55 whole foods in states including texas, oklahoma, arkansas, louisiana, and florida, reports nbc news. Mikaila's lemonade isn't just tasty. After being stung by bees twice in a week at the age of 4, she \" was terrified \" of the insect but soon developed a fascination of them, and has decided to use local honey in her lemonade — and direct some of the proceeds to help the dwindling bee population. Her success even earned her a spot at at the white house kids'state dinner last summer, reports cnbc, and she announced earlier this month, while being honored with other black innovators at the south by southwest festival, that she's expanded distribution even further thanks to a deal with united natural foods, reports atlanta blackstar. She says she works on her business after she finishes her homework and on weekends and holidays. ( see why the government forced this girl to shut down her stand. )",

According to the washington post, those expenses were estimated at $ 97 million over eight years. Trump and his family are on pace to exceed that total in just seven months, and taxpayers are footing the bill, new york magazine reports. It starts with the president himself. Despite once promising he would \" rarely leave the white house, \" trump is spending the weekend at mar-a-lago for the third week in a row. Those three trips are estimated to have cost the us treasury about $ 10 million. And the palm beach sheriff's office says it pays $ 60,000 in overtime for every day trump is at his golf resort. But it doesn't end with the president. New york city is paying $ 500,000 per day for security at trump tower, where melania trump and barron are living, and estimates it will spend more than $ 180 million per year. Meanwhile, trump's adults sons and their secret service detail are in the united arab emirates for a trump-brand golf course opening this weekend. A similar trip to uruguay recently cost the secret service and us embassy nearly $ 100,000. All told, the trump family's \" unusually elaborate lifestyle \" is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years — far more than is typical for presidents.

Offer your own in the comments section. Winners * mitt romney: we expected romney to shine in this economic-focused debate and shine he did. Romney was knowledgeable and detailed — as expected — but also relaxed to the point where he let a little bit of his personality show. Romney's biggest hurdle in this race is that he strikes lots of people as inauthentic and awkward. Not only was he head and shoulders above the other candidates on stage when it came to looking presidential, romney also showcased his human side.

            "All eyes might be on texas gov. Rick perry at tonight's debate, but mitt romney stole the pregame buzz by trotting out an unexpected endorsement from new jersey gov. Chris christie. The new jersey governor announced his support for mr. Romney at a tuesday afternoon news conference and followed up with a call to thousands of voters across the country. Mr. Christie declared the former massachusetts governor the \"best person to lead our party \" and the best candidate to unseat president barack obama next year.

            "The washington post-bloomberg news presidential debate at dartmouth college is in the books. ( that's seven presidential debate for those of you counting. ) we live-blogged every minute of it but also came out with a quick take on who won and who lost. Our thoughts are below. Offer your own in the comments section. Winners * mitt romney: we expected romney to shine in this economic-focused debate and shine he did. Romney was knowledgeable and detailed — as expected — but also relaxed to the point where he let a little bit of his personality show. Romney's biggest hurdle in this race is that he strikes lots of people as inauthentic and awkward. Not only was he head and shoulders above the other candidates on stage when it came to looking presidential, romney also showcased his human side. His best debate in a string of very solid performances. * 9-9-9/herman",

        "summary": "New trump chief of staff john kelly has won generally rave reviews for setting a more disciplined tone within the white house, a shift that includes the ouster of the volatile anthony scaramucci. Now, the daily beast reports that he's already begun work on what might be a trickier task: repairing relations with democrats. Spokespersons for nancy pelosi and chuck schumer confirm that kelly called them both over the weekend as a first step in attempting to ease tensions. As one white house official says, alienating democrats unnecessarily makes little sense if trump hopes to move forward with tax reform and other components of his agenda. More coverage: not all rosy: the db also points out, however, that some democrats, including sen. Richard blumenthal, are wary of kelly given his short stint in charge of homeland security. They cite roundups of undocumented immigrants, a lack of progress in protecting young \" dreamers, \" and kelly's role in implementing the president's travel ban on travelers from certain countries. His big tests: axios lays out kelly's five biggest challenges, the first one being whether he can recruit \" sane, successful, proficient republicans \" to join the trump team. That's especially true given that another big wave of departures can be expected at the end of the first year. Another challenge will be reining in trump from \" petty tussles \" and \" pointless tweets. \" podesta's advice: john podesta, who served as bill clinton's chief of staff, writes in the washington post that he would have advised kelly not to take the job. Podesta views kelly's biggest challenge as protecting robert mueller and the integrity of the russian investigation from white house attacks. Podesta, however, writes that kelly has one key advantage: \" the president needs kelly more than kelly needs him. \" that is, trump can't afford to have him walk. Relations with the media: politico reports that kelly has a healthy respect for reporters going back to his days as a general, though he's known to bristle if he feels journalists aren't covering issues fairly. His generally good relations, however, raise the tricky question of how he ' ll handle a president who routinely berates the media. Confronting trump: the ap begins a kelly story with an anecdote of him confronting the president over aspects of trump's travel ban when kelly was still in charge of homeland security. At one point, kelly asked all other advisers to leave the room so he could speak frankly, and raised voices could then be heard through the thick oval office door.",

Per the verge, new dashboard functions allow users to see how much time they've spent in the apps, set limits on usage time, and snooze those enticing notifications for a set amount of time ( up to eight hours ). The move is a bid by the social media behemoth to address growing concerns about the negative impacts too much screen time can have on users. Doesn't facebook make money from me staring at my phone as much as possible, you ask? yes, but facebook might be betting that more controlled ( read: less habitual ) use of its app might cut down on that fatigue we've all felt after finding ourselves scrolling for hours each day. By that logic, the company could be hoping that users will have a more positive takeaway when they do use the app. It's all summed up with an increasingly common buzz term in the social media sphere: \" time well spent. \" it's a term instagram product director ameet ranadive used in explaining the new feature to recode. \" it's really important for people that use instagram and facebook to feel like the time that they spend with us is time well spent, \" ranadive said. \" that's the whole purpose of this release. \"",

The mongolian bestowed upon his dynasty a chinese name, yuan, and built a palace that marco polo described as \" the greatest... That ever was, \" with a vermilion, yellow, green, and blue roof and a dining hall with a capacity of 6,000, per the bbc. But polo's writings have been among the best remains of the imperial palace, which effectively disappeared sometime after the yuan dynasty's 1368 end — until, perhaps, now. The south china morning post reports that archaeologists believe they know where the yuan palace was built. The forbidden city served as the palace for the ming and then qing dynasties, and the post reports that it's long been thought the yuan palace stood near there. A little closer than \" near, \" it turns out: archaeologists found a 10-foot-thick \" rammed earth and rubble foundation \" beneath three previous layers of construction done under early and late ming and qing rulers. Wang guangyao, the deputy director of the palace museum's institute of archaeology, tells the post the style of the foundation is identical to the ruins of another capital of the yuan dynasty. Wang adds that the size of the foundation is atypical of yuan buildings and suggests it could have been part of a massive hall. It's not the only recent kublai khan-related find: last july archaeologists found a portion of the hull of a ship he sent as part of an armada that tried in vain to invade japan, the telegraph reported.

            "Archaeologists have discovered the wreck of a mongolian ship that was part of a fleet dispatched by kublai khan to invade japan in the 13th century. The ship is the second to be located off southern japan from two massive armadas – each reputedly made up of more than 4,000 ships and with an invasion force of 140,000 men – sent by the emperor of the yuan dynasty to conquer japan in 1274 and 1281. Both invasion fleets were destroyed by devastating typhoons, with the storms going down in japanese history as \" kamikaze \", or divine wind, that saved the nation from foreign invasion. The kamikaze were again invoked in the dying days of the second world war,",

        "summary": "A fascinating ( and somewhat macabre ) new study may explain the so-called \" near-death experiences \" described by many people. Scientists studied the brains of nine rats as they were being euthanized and found that just after the rats ' hearts stopped, their brains became more active than normal, npr reports. This sort of \" overdrive \" or hyperconsciousness continued for about 30 seconds, gradually declining over that period of time, smithsonian reports. The lead researcher says the results \" blew our mind, \" and the findings are \" consistent with what patients report \" experiencing. Explains a co-author, \" at near-death, many known electrical signatures of consciousness exceeded levels found in the waking state. \" \" when you turn off a light switch, the light immediately goes from on to off, \" explains a neuroscientist who was not involved with, but was impressed by, the research. \" the brain doesn't immediately go off, but it shows a series of sort of complicated transitions. \" the bbc explains further: the scientists measured an increase in gamma oscillations, high-frequency brainwaves that connect information from one part of the brain to another. How to explain this? the lead researcher thinks the surge in brain activity may be \" the byproduct of the brain's attempt to save itself, \" as well as to make sense of what's happening. Of course, the results will be difficult to replicate in humans, but the researchers say human brains are similar enough to rat brains that this could explain the \" near-death \" phenomenon. Of course, not everyone is convinced: \" we have no evidence at all that the rats had any near-death experiences or whether animals can have any such type of experience, first of all, \" says one scientist. ( a 2010 study found carbon dioxide may be a factor in the \" heavenly lights \" seen in near-death experiences. )",

Therefore, the irrelevant document is: Document 2",
            "The summary discusses a study on near-death experiences in rats and how their brains showed increased activity after the heart stopped. Document 2 contains information about near-death experiences in humans and their perceptions, which is relevant to the summary. Document 3 also discusses the surge of electrical activity in the brain during near-death experiences, which aligns with the key points of the summary. Document 1 is related to the brain activity in dying rats that provides insights into near-death experiences. Therefore, all documents are relevant to the summary. None"
