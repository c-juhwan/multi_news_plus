        "summary": "Brad pitt filed a request to seal details of his child custody dispute with angelina jolie, but at an emergency hearing wednesday, a judge denied that request, tmz reports. Earlier this week, jolie filed documents that spelled out details of her temporary custody agreement with pitt, an agreement that requires pitt only have monitored visits with the kids. Those documents revealed that a psychologist specializing in child custody issues is the one who makes the call as to when and how pitt can see the couple's six children, and that pitt has agreed to undergo random alcohol and drug testing four times a month. Sources tell tmz pitt's request to seal the custody dispute details was a direct response to her filing of those documents. Jolie sources say she filed the document because she fears pitt is going to attempt to be allowed to see the children with no monitoring, but pitt sources say he's made no such move and that the filing publicized details of the custody dispute for no reason other than to air the couple's dirty laundry in public, hurting pitt — but also causing their kids unnecessary pain. Some sources connected to the case say that since pitt was cleared of wrongdoing by the department of children and family services, he wants solo time with the kids, and that he's been acting like a \" celebrity who is used to getting whatever he wants \" and trying to \" push past the process \" in order to get that solo time. Other sources, predictably, deny that. And then there are the sources who told tmz this week that jolie has been plotting for more than a year for how to get out of the marriage, take the kids to london, and work for the un.",

In one month, cruz raised what kasich has collected over the entire course of his long-shot bid. Trump has raised relatively little money as he \" self-funds \" his effort. On the democratic side, bernie sanders outraised hillary clinton for the second month in a row, but he still started march with about half as much cash on hand as clinton. Some highlights from the latest campaign finance reports, per the ap: kasich had about $ 1.3 million in available campaign cash as this month began. Cruz continued to lap him fundraising: his $ 12 million in february roughly equals kasich's entire campaign haul, dating to last summer, which includes $ 3.4 million in february. Trump loaned himself another $ 6.9 million, bringing his total self-loans to $ 24.4 million. Trump's campaign manager has said the candidate has no intention of trying to recoup the money. And while trump continues to boast about self-funding his campaign, he collected about $ 2 million in new contributions in february, bringing his total raised this cycle to $ 9.5 million. Wealthy donors handed over $ 25 million last month to a super pac backing marco rubio. And his campaign had its best month yet, raising about $ 9.6 million, though it still wasn't enough to prevent an embarrassing loss to trump in florida and keep his campaign alive. Jeb bush spent $ 3.6 million before dropping out on feb. 20, but he raised just $ 1.18 million over the month, including around $ 400,000 that he loaned to his own campaign, the washington post reports. Bush-allied super pac right to rise raised $ 119 million over the course of the race and finished february with $ 16 million of it. Chris christie raised about $ 420,000 in february. The republican suspended his campaign feb. 9, after the new hampshire primary. His campaign ended with roughly $ 200,000 more in debt than available cash. Ben carson, who dropped out at the beginning of march, raised $ 5.7 million in february and had almost $ 5 million in cash when he exited. He was the top gop fundraiser of the 2016 contest at the time he dropped out, but he also maintained above-average costs for raising that money. Sanders ' campaign raised more than $ 43 million in february, outraising clinton by about $ 14 million. He continued to draw substantial support from low-dollar donors. In february, more than 60 % came from people who had given $ 200 or less to federal candidates",

In the last weeks of his flagging presidential bid, former florida governor jeb bush loaned or gave his campaign nearly $ 407,000 as it struggled to pay its bills. New federal election commission filings show that bush's campaign spent $ 3.6 million last month before he dropped out feb. 20 — raising just $ 1.18 million in the same period. A large share of the money came from the candidate himself, who gave his campaign $ 56,983.50 on feb. 1. The next day, he loaned the campaign $ 250,000. And on feb. 16, four days before the south carolina primary, he gave an additional $ 100,000. Former florida governor jeb bush announced to supporters in south carolina that he was suspending his presidential campaign after a disappointing performance in the state's gop primary.

            "Officials in northern orange county spent sunday assessing the damage from friday's magnitude 5.1 earthquake. The temblor caused damage to businesses -- mostly spilled merchandise and a few shattered windows. Friday night, dozens of dwellings were red-tagged as officials looked for structural damage. Officials in the cities hardest hit -- fullerton, brea and la habra -- have not yet released damage estimates. It appears the damage was modest, and there were no serious injuries. About 50 residents were let back into their fullerton apartment units, which had been red-tagged friday night after the 5.1 earthquake near la habra, according to fullerton fire battalion chief john stokes. City building department inspectors were out in force saturday to examine the 20 units at the building on associated road. They were deemed safe. Elsewhere in the city, about 19 residents in six single-family homes across northern fullerton remained displaced, stokes said. Most appeared to be staying with friends or relatives after a nearby shelter at a la habra community center was closed by the red cross due to lack of requests for assistance. About 13 water line breaks were reported in fullerton after friday's quake, including three ruptures under city streets. By saturday night, they had all been repaired, stokes said. In buena park, a 60-year-old man was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries",

Instead, they ended the night feeling shocked by what appeared to them to be a case of racial discrimination. All because of a pair of pants. The logan square residents claim parlor pizza in the west loop denied jackson entry when an employee said the husband's pants were \" too street. \" the couple say the pants were black herringbone wool trousers made by vince, a luxury contemporary fashion brand. Jacobson wrote on facebook publicly the next day, \" only thing i can think of for the reason we were turned away is one. \" the couple, who are black, later confirmed in an interview with the tribune that they believed they were the victims of racial discrimination. Jackson filed a discrimination complaint monday with the chicago commission on human relations, and first deputy commissioner kenneth gunn confirmed his office received the complaint tuesday.

The us fish and wildlife service has released photos of trash and damage at the oregon refuge, which a spokesman says is a \" microcosm of how bad it really was. \" the photos show government offices ransacked, damaged, and strewn with trash, as well as the \" poop trench \" the militiamen dug near a burns paiute tribe site. A massive cleanup operation is underway, and authorities estimate that it will cost $ 4 million to restore, repair, and upgrade the refuge, the oregonian reports. Fish and wildlife service director dan ashe visited the refuge this week and vowed that it would soon be better than ever and serve as a reminder of the value of cooperation. An agency spokesman tells the guardian that federal workers who have returned to the refuge are \" thrilled to be back, \" though they're angry about the damage and have to work in trailers while refuge buildings are repaired. \" these are people who generally don't become biologists to be in the public sphere, \" he says. \" they love creatures and places and are passionate about doing their jobs. \" ( one of the dozens of occupiers facing charges is suing the federal government for $ 666 billion. )",

The officials claim that intelligence from spies and diplomatic sources directly links the russian leader to the hacks. One high-level source says the original goal was to take down hillary clinton and expose corruption in american politics, but it became \" an effort to split off key american allies by creating the image that [ other countries ] couldn't depend on the us to be a credible global leader anymore. \" michael mcfaul, us ambassador to russia from 2012 to 2014, tells nbc that putin had a \" vendetta \" against clinton, and claims that he oversaw the use of hacked material are \" most certainly consistent with the putin that i have watched and used to work with when i was an ambassador and in the government. \" officials tell reuters, however, that the office of the director of national intelligence has yet to endorse the cia's assessment that the hacking was done with the intention of helping donald trump defeat clinton. The washington post reports that a yougov poll released wednesday found that there has been a big shift in putin support among republicans, with his net negative rating falling from 66 points to 10 over the last two years. The poll also found a 74-point swing among the same voters in favor of wikileaks.",

A padlock is displayed at the alert logic booth during the 2016 black hat cyber-security conference in las vegas, nevada, u.s. August 3, 2016. Reuters/david becker while the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) does not dispute the cia's analysis of russian hacking operations, it has not endorsed their assessment because of a lack of conclusive evidence that moscow intended to boost trump over democratic opponent hillary clinton, said the officials, who declined to be named. The position of the odni, which oversees the 17 agency-strong u.s. Intelligence community, could give trump fresh ammunition to dispute the cia assessment, which he rejected as \"ridiculous \" in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates russia in the cyber attacks. Trump's rejection of the cia's judgment marks the latest in a string of disputes over russia's international conduct that have erupted between the president-elect and the intelligence community he will soon command.

In layman's terms, it's a massive hairball that extends from one's stomach into the small intestine or beyond. As io9 explained in 2013, hair is made of keratin, a substance so steely that the human body can't break it down — nor can it move it out of the digestive system, possibly because \" it's too slippery to get pulled out along with the rest of the stomach contents. \" just how long one of these hairballs, called a trichobezoar, can be is made clear by the removal of one from a 15-year-old girl in india: it measured 5 feet in length. The mirror shares the fairly graphic story of kavita kumari, a teen whose hair-swallowing addiction was so severe she allegedly ate the hair of her classmates as well as her own. When the 15-year-old experienced a protruding stomach and severe pain, her parents began taking her to doctors and ultimately to a hospital in uttar pradesh. A ct scan there revealed the hairball, as well as a sizable lesion. \" her condition was so bad that i had told her parents she might not make it through the surgery, \" says dr. Lal bahadur sidharth, who described the teen as so weak she could hardly stand. But kavita did indeed make it through the two-hour surgery, and the mirror reports she should be able to eat again soon, which she apparently hadn't been able to do. A 2009 study in clinical medicine &amp; research found that \" trichobezoar with rapunzel syndrome is an uncommon diagnosis in children with less than 40 cases reported. \" a 9-pound hairball was recovered in one patient last year.",

Occasionally, women experiencing abdominal pain go to the hospital to find that there are dark masses in their stomach. When they are opened up, doctors pull out cat-sized hair balls. Why? because your parents were wrong when they told you that gum stays in your system for years without being digested. Actually, it's hair. Hair is made of keratin, the same stuff that goes into hooves and horns. It's a tough substance.

And though the wall street journal reports they were \" frequently repetitive \" and heavily redacted, they did contain some standout numbers: specifically, that the nsa furnished the fbi with an average two tips a day in 2006. The next year, the nsa estimated that daily number rose to three, indicating a yearly total of more than 1,100; that pace continued until march 2009, at which time the references to the number of fbi tips in the documents end. The journal notes that the documents, which were revealed following president obama's speech on an nsa overhaul, don't discuss the tips ' quality or what types of inquiries they may have resulted in. That speech put a number of key decisions on snooping in the hands of congress. Lawmakers appear to largely oppose the government's widespread phone data collection, but several leaders of both parties support it, the washington times notes.

Now the atlantic wire has dug up twitter users like melanie karin, who writes, \" resigning for health reasons! yeah. That's it. Not because of anything scandalous like... Having a nazi youth past. \" sex scandal. Not only has a sex-abuse scandal rocked the catholic church, pope benedict is said to have personally approved an accused molester's transfer to therapy. One tweeter directed a curious piers morgan ( \" as a catholic, i ' m not buying this \" ) to see an hbo documentary on the subject, mea maxima culpa. The prophecy. Of course, there's a prophecy. A bishop named malachy may have proclaimed in 1140 that the 111th pope — the one after benedict — will reign during the downfall of the church. But as the national review explains, malachy's predictions were likely invented for political reasons. Fatal illness. \" italians are great conspiracy theorists, so they are all looking for other reasons why he may have quit, \" says a telegraph reporter. \" i think the most popular reason that people were coming up with was that they just think perhaps he is much more ill than we have been told. \" weight of scandal. Not exactly a conspiracy, this theory holds that church scandals ( like \" vatileaks \" ) have been hard on benedict's health. \" it is difficult to imagine the degree of intrigue that is present in rome, \" a longtime friend tells der spiegel.

Steven storey, one of the patients who's received the new treatment, tells the bbc he \" went from running marathons \" to being wheelchair-bound and unable to \" hold a spoon and feed myself \" within a year of his ms diagnosis. Four months after the treatment, he can stand without help. \" it's been incredible, \" storey says. \" i was in a dire place, but now i can swim and cycle, and i am determined to walk. \" according to the guardian, hsct can be used to treat the most common type of ms, known as relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, although researchers stress that more study is needed and it may not be suitable for all patients. Hsct has a one-time cost for patients of a little more than $ 40,000 — comparable to a full year of traditional ms treatment, the bbc reports.

Weiner's attorneys had argued for probation, saying the 53-year-old's repeated online dalliances showed he needed help, not punishment. He had faced up to 27 months. In court monday, weiner wept upon hearing the sentence, reports the ap. Earlier, he had tearfully told the judge that he was \" a very sick man for a very long time \" and referred to his crime as \" rock bottom. \" in regard to jail, however, judge denise cote sided with prosecutors, who argued that \" transmitting obscenity to a minor to induce her to engage in sexually explicit conduct by video chat and photo — is far from mere'sexting, ' \" per the daily beast. Before sentencing, weiner's legal team had sought to depict the messages to the minor as an anomaly. Weiner exchanged \" thousands of messages with hundreds of women ( but this ) was his first teenager and his last teenage victim, \" said a defense attorney, per a tweet from a newsday reporter. As part of his guilty plea, weiner will not appeal the sentence. He must report for prison on nov. 6, reports the new york times, which adds that weiner remained seated between his attorneys after the judge left the courtroom, \" crying, his face in his hands. \" huma abedin filed for divorce last year when news of the teen sexting scandal emerged. And all of this played a role in james comey's decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton's email late in the election.",

Per josh duggar's lawyers, he suffered \" unwarranted public scrutiny \" like his sisters did after the story came out. The sisters involved — jill duggar dillard, jessa duggar seewald, jinger duggar vuolo, and joy duggar — say they were promised confidentiality by investigators ( they were minors when the police report on the matter was written ). But lawyers say that promise was not kept: though their names were redacted in the report intouch obtained, the sisters argue the magazine was easily able to identify the victims as duggar girls because their parents ' names were not redacted. The sisters are also suing the city of springdale and washington county in arkansas for breach of privacy. In his complaint to join the suit, josh duggar says the intouch story forced him \" to relive painful memories and experiences \" and that he was \" subject to the humiliation and extreme mental anguish of being publicly identified. \" his attempt to join the lawsuit has resulted in some incredulous reaction: the huffington post headline on the matter, for example, reads, \" josh duggar has the audacity to claim molestation reports caused ' emotional injury. ' \" the site also notes that, unlike his sisters, josh was legally an adult when he first spoke to investigators, though his name was redacted, too; his sisters'suit argues that children who have been molested need to be protected, noting that \" revealing juvenile identities under these circumstances is unacceptable, and it's against the law. \"",

Tom harkin today called on democrats to reject the deal, furious over president obama's apparent willingness to up his tax threshold to $ 450,000. \" they think republicans may object? we may object, \" the iowa senator told cnn today, before going to the senate floor and urging democrats to do just that. \" the deal must be one that really does favor the middle class, the real middle class, those making 30, 50, 60, 70 thousand dollars a year, \" he said. \" i have said before no deal is better than a bad deal, and this looks like a very bad deal the way this is shaping up. \" in other lawmakers-on-tv news: steny hoyer was sizing up harkin's bandwagon, telling politico that \" i frankly am not enthusiastic about the compromise being talked about today. \" while \" nobody wants to go over this cliff, \" hoyer seemed to indicate that the white house was compromising too much. Bob corker made some waves on msnbc today, by declaring that \" whatever happens today is really inconsequential. It really doesn't matter. \" the tennessee republican later clarified for politico that he meant that the deal might have an impact on the economy, but it \" isn't going to have an impact on long-term deficits. \" lindsey graham, meanwhile, again predicted that obama would prevail, but dismissed that as \" a political victory that is hollow in nature, \" and would fail to address the country's deficit woes, he told cnn. He called obama \" small-minded \" saying, \" i find him to be a hard guy to know and understand. \"",

            "Negotiations with russia to replace an expired cold war-era arms control treaty are unlikely to be concluded by the end of the year as the white house had hoped, u.s. Officials said thursday. As the two sides seek a breakthrough, u.s. President barack obama and his russian counterpart, dmitry medvedev, plan to discuss the nuclear negotiations in a meeting friday on the sidelines of united nations climate talks in copenhagen, denmark. The two leaders are not expected to seal a deal. U.s. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, say negotiations with russia to replace the strategic arms reduction treaty have become hung up on a disagreement about how to monitor the development of new intercontinental ballistic missiles. Obama and medvedev initially had instructed negotiators to seek a fully ratified deal by the dec. 5 expiration of start. Recently obama had expressed hopes that a deal could be completed by the end of this year. The obama administration has sought to make the negotiations a vehicle for demonstrating improved relations with russia. They hope that greater cooperation on arms control can lead to russian help on stickier issues including efforts to rein in iran's suspected nuclear ambitions. Officials said u.s. Negotiators would continue working with their russian counterparts on the treaty through the weekend in geneva after the meeting of the two presidents. Top negotiators may pause for the christmas holidays, however. On thursday, u.s. Secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov discussed disagreements standing in the way of a deal. Lavrov blamed the u.s. Delegation for slowing negotiations in the past few days. He told reporters in moscow that the talks have now resumed their pace, but a deal is unlikely to be reached in time for obama and medvedev to sign it when they attend the climate summit in copenhagen on friday. He urged the united states to accept deeper cuts and less intrusive verification measures. U.s. Officials said russian negotiators were seeking changes from the original treaty on the encryption of missile flight data. The now-expired treaty banned such encryption so that each side could monitor missile tests from a distance. Using such data, monitors could determine whether the other side was developing missiles restricted by the treaty. According to daryl kimball, executive director of the washington-based arms control association, russia has less of an interest in monitoring such data because it is seeking to upgrade its missile arsenal while the united states has not been testing new missiles. \" the missiles the u.s.

Abbott says he wants the fullest investigation possible, as it \" now seems certain it's been brought down by a russian-supplied surface-to-air missile. \" un chief ban ki-moon joined malaysia's president in calling for a \" full, transparent, and international investigation, \" while hillary clinton made some of the strongest remarks from the us side, saying it is time to put vladimir putin \" on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by. \" in other developments: ukraine's security services released an intercepted call in which pro-russia rebels reportedly brag about having shot down a plane, then react in horror when they realize it was a civilian aircraft, the guardian reports. The recordings have yet to be verified. \" we warned you, stay away from our skies, \" says a now-deleted post on a social media account attributed to a rebel leader, though it's not clear whether the account is genuine, vox reports. At the crash site, which spans a wide area of ukrainian farmland, rescue workers, police officers, and off-duty coal miners are continuing to search for bodies amid the wreckage, where there is a lingering acrid smell, the bbc reports. More than 100 bodies have been recovered so far and there is no sign of any survivors from the 298 passengers and crew, including scores of experts on their way to an international aids conference in australia. The rebels who control the area say they have found the aircraft's black boxes and are deciding what to do with them, reports the ap, which notes that the development has \" profound implications for the integrity of the plane crash investigation. \" ukrainian investigators have not been able to access the site, and there are at least five rebel checkpoints on the road to the area from donetsk, the nearest large city. The airspace the malaysian jet was apparently shot down in was not closed, but airlines are now rerouting their flights to avoid ukraine, the ap finds. Many carriers had been steering clear of the troubled region for a long time. \" i find it pretty remarkable that a civil airline company — if this aircraft was on the flight plan — that they are flight-planning over an area like that, \" a former national transportation safety board vice-chairman says. \" you wonder a little bit about malaysia airlines, if that's true",

In a consumer fraud lawsuit filed in polk county district court, attorney general tom miller argues that colorado-based company osmosis has been selling what it claims is the world's first drinkable sunscreen without proof that the product actually protects skin from the sun's harmful rays, per courthouse news. And he very much doubts that it does. According to osmosis, the \" sunscreen \" that is sold for up to $ 40 a bottle is water containing a \" form of radio frequencies called scalar waves \" that, when ingested, \" vibrate above the skin to neutralize uva and uvb, \" per buzzfeed. Osmosis says its product offers \" protection comparable to an spf 30. \" but assistant ag steve st. Clair tells radio iowa that's \" almost certainly pure bunk \" attributed to \" seriously flawed \" research. He says that in addition to putting consumers at risk from cancer-causing rays, osmosis also leads consumers to believe that an ingestible bug repellent would protect against zika-carrying mosquitoes. The lawsuit notes, too, that osmosis stresses co-owner ben johnson is a doctor, but he was forced to give up his colorado medical license 16 years ago. However, johnson says he is licensed in california. He adds that the sunscreen has been on the market for five years, and \" it would be ridiculous to think we could convince people to keep buying it if it doesn't actually work. \" ( sunscreen is generally pretty bad, according to one study. )",

The fda gave the green light tuesday to large-scale trials of the drug, which is the last step before it can be approved as a prescription drug, the new york times reports. A recent smaller-scale clinical trial in canada found that the drug eased ptsd symptoms in 56 % of patients, in part by helping them access repressed memories. \" some people will say ' i don't know why they call this ecstasy ' as they're going through the therapy, because there can be a lot of emotions they may not be in touch with, \" researcher alison fudaccia tells the cbc. The drug, also known as mdma, releases hormones that reduce fear and increase trust, researchers say. Two recent us trials focused on long-term ptsd sufferers, including emergency workers and combat veterans, whose symptoms had not been eased by other drugs or therapies. A few experts fear that using the drug for ptsd therapy will increase recreational use, as happened with opioids, the verge notes, but some patients say taking it in therapy was enough. \" it gave me my life back, but it wasn't a party drug, \" a former firefighter who got his life back together after the treatment tells the times. \" it was a lot of work. \" ( a recent study found that male and female brains react differently to trauma. )",

They were given either mdma or a placebo two to three times, in conjunction with non-drug therapy sessions.

Ted cruz was one of the first: \" we owe it to him, &amp; the nation, for the senate to ensure that the next president names his replacement, \" tweeted the man who hopes to be that next president. More crucially, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell agrees, saying the vacancy should remain open until then, reports reuters. And a spokesman for republican sen. Mike lee of utah, who sits on the judiciary panel, sent out a quick tweet saying that any obama nominee would face \" less than zero \" chances of making it through the panel, reports the hill. There was no immediate word from the white house on the nomination plans of the president, but politico predicts he would face \" fierce — if not insurmountable pressure \" — to any nominee. Usa today agrees that winning confirmation \" would be difficult, if not impossible. \" the stakes are huge, of course, given that the replacement of the justice who is perhaps the court's strongest conservative voice with a more liberal-leaning one would tilt the 5-4 balance back to the left. \" it's been more than 80 years since a supreme court justice was confirmed in an election year to a vacancy that arose that year, and there has never been an election-year confirmation that would so dramatically alter the ideological composition of the court, \" says ed whelan, who served as a law clerk under scalia and is now a top conservative when it comes to legal matters. \" let the people decide in november who will select the next justice. \" the longest delay in a supreme court justice's confirmation is 125 days, and obama has the better part of a year left in office, notes thinkprogress.",

        "summary": "A construction worker's ancient jotting on a wall might rewrite the history books. The wall scrawl suggests that the roman city of pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of mount vesuvius in october of ad79, two months later than historians have long believed, reports the bbc. Uncovered by archaeologists in a previously untouched area of the city, the charcoal writing perhaps left by a worker renovating a home gives the date of the work as \" xvi k nov \" or 16 days before november, meaning oct. 17 in our modern calendar, per cnn. The problem is that historical records point to an august eruption. For instance, pliny the younger described his uncle, pliny the elder, setting out from miseno, across the bay of naples from pompeii, on aug. 24 in a rescue attempt from which he never returned. The charcoal marking isn't the first discovery to hint at an error, though. Cnn mentions previous discoveries of woolly clothing and chestnuts — items that suggest the fall rather than the summer — while reuters adds a note about a calcified branch of autumn berries. Suggesting an actual eruption date of oct. 24, archaeologists say that pliny the younger might have forgotten the real date ( his account of the eruption came 25 years later ) or that it could have been lost along with his original writings. It's \" an extraordinary discovery, \" says italy's culture minister. ( it follows the first body found in decades at pompeii. )",

Dust blown from the sahara in northern africa has dulled the bright sun with a haze that shrouds everything in uncharacteristic gray. The darkening skies mirror the bleak outlook of an island that us law calls a unincorporated territory and others call one of the world's last colonies. Puerto rico is floundering under $ 73bn in debt and a rapidly deteriorating ability to pay. The unemployment rate is hovering at 14 %. There has been a surge in violent crime.

        "summary": "Feeling smug when you clock 10,000 steps each day? not so fast: while that target has widely been hailed as a goal to beat cardiovascular disease, a new study suggests upping it to 15,000 steps. Uk researchers who studied 111 postal workers in glasgow found profound differences in the health markers for those who were on their feet the longest each day, the new york times reports. Some of the workers, who were mostly aged 40 to 60, sat for 15 hours or more daily at office jobs and at home, and others were mail carriers who walked their routes. The volunteers wore an activity monitor for a week, at work and off duty, that measured how many steps each took and how much time they spent seated. Writing in the international journal of obesity, the scientists reported that those who walked at least 15,000 steps each day, or about seven miles, showed no increased risk of heart disease. Those who moved the most had normal waistlines and bmis, but any amount of walking or even standing shrank a worker's waistline and risk of cardiovascular disease. For the sedentary workers, the picture was the opposite. After five hours of sitting a day, each additional hour in the chair boosted their chance of developing heart disease by.2 %. The results highlight the importance of moving around — a lot. For 15,000 steps, that means walking for two hours at a very brisk pace of 4mph, lead author dr. William tigbe tells the times. He suggests tackling that target \" in bits \" by doing 30-minute walks a couple of times a day, with shorter walks in between. \" our metabolism, \" he says, \" is not well-suited to sitting down all the time. \" ( there's a new daily recommendation for fruits and veggies. )",

        "summary": "A group of archaeologists in jamestown, virginia, is busy doing the opposite of what one would normally expect: building something new, rather than searching for what once was. Popular archaeology reports that an effort is underway to rebuild a potion of the church where pocahontas wed john rolfe in 1614 ( an event that smithsonian notes established \" eight years of peace between the colonists and the powhatan indians \" ). The discovery of its footprint was announced in fall 2010; archaeology, which branded it one of the top 10 discoveries of the year, reported that archaeologists came upon it while looking for men's barracks. Historic records describe the 1608 church as 60 feet long, and \" it didn't take a mathematical genius \" to figure out the significance of the five postholes found at 12-foot increments, said historic jamestowne director of archaeology bill kelso. \" now we can actually point to the spot where pocahontas got married, \" added kelso at the time. Soon, visitors will be able to stand in that very spot. As senior staff archaeologist dave givens explains in the site's dig updates blog, \" our intention here is not to recreate the entire church but give some notion of the space, so that when people are standing inside the church they can understand what the walls would have looked like. \" though the colonists built a structure with mud walls, the archaeologists are using one modern ingredient in their walls: a fiberglass-containing concrete that will add stability and, therefore, safety. The blog post notes the site bears the \" oldest remnants of a church structure yet found in an english colony in north america. \" ( in 2013 it was announced that another pocahontas site would be preserved for eternity. )",

        "summary": "Russia has begun launching airstrikes in syria for the second straight day despite us concerns, reports the bbc. The kremlin insisted again thursday that the strikes are against terrorists, reports reuters, though the us isn't buying it. American officials say vladimir putin is going after rebels trying to overthrow moscow ally bashar al-assad, not isis, and the new york times reports that one of the groups hit wednesday was in fact trained by the cia. The washington post characterizes us officials as in a \" scrambled \" response to the fast move by putin — which came after just an hour's notice — and sets things up thusly: the white house said it \" would not be bullied into supporting president bashar al-assad and that it was about to significantly expand its own syrian air operations. \" john kerry and russian counterpart sergey lavrov had lengthy talks wednesday, and military officials might meet as early as thursday. Also: kerry: \" it is one thing, obviously, to be targeting isil. We are concerned, obviously, that is not what's happening. \" lavrov: \" don't listen to the pentagon about the russian strikes. \" potential for trouble: \" right now you've got the aircraft of the syrian air force, the russian air force, and the us-led coalition operating in a very confined area, \" a military analyst tells cnn. \" these are high-performance aircraft — lots of weapons, lots of people on edge when they're flying these missions. \" ' new cold war ': \" syria has been threatening to become a proxy battleground for what some are calling the new cold war for months, \" and the russian airstrikes \" may have tipped the balance, \" per an analysis at cnbc. It suggests that putin might eventually \" have to compromise on his support \" for assad and work with the west, but that's still palatable for him \" if syria was brought back into... The russian sphere of influence, and if he could say with confidence that the is threat had been lessened. \" who's doing the fighting: the new york times has an explainer about the convoluted agendas in syria, involving not just the us and russia, but saudi arabia, iran, france, britain, and others.",

            "Scientists at fred hutchinson cancer research center have cleared a major technical hurdle to making umbilical-cord-blood transplants a more widely-used method for treating leukemia and other blood cancers. In a study published in the jan.17 edition of nature medicine, colleen delaney, m.d., and colleagues describe the first use of a method to vastly expand the number of stem/progenitor cells from a unit of cord blood in the laboratory that were then infused into patients resulting in successful and rapid engraftment. The relatively small number of stem cells in cord blood units ( about one-10th the number a patient receives from a conventional transplant ) has been a reason that cord blood transplants take much longer to engraft than standard stem cell transplants from donors. The longer the engraftment takes, the higher the risk is that immunocompromised patients will acquire life-threatening infections because they have essentially no white blood cells to fight them. Despite the numbers disadvantage, cord blood is a promising source of stem cells to replace diseased blood and immune systems in stem cell transplantation because the donated cells don't need to be perfectly matched to the patient. The lack of a suitable match is why about 30 percent of patients overall who need a stem cell transplant to treat cancers such as leukemia can't find suitable donors. Among racial-minority patients the number who cannot find suitable donors is about 95 percent. The",

            "Scientists at fred hutchinson cancer research center have cleared a major technical hurdle to making umbilical-cord-blood transplants a more widely-used method for treating leukemia and other blood cancers. In a study published in the jan.17 edition of nature medicine, colleen delaney, m.d., and colleagues describe the first use of a method to vastly expand the number of stem/progenitor cells from a unit of cord blood in the laboratory that were then infused into patients resulting in successful and rapid engraftment. The relatively small number of stem cells in cord blood units ( about one-10th the number a patient receives from a conventional transplant ) has been a reason that cord blood transplants take much longer to engraft than standard stem cell transplants from donors. The longer the engraftment takes, the higher the risk is that immunocompromised patients will acquire life-threatening infections because they have essentially no white blood cells to fight them. Despite the numbers disadvantage, cord blood is a promising source of stem cells to replace diseased blood and immune systems in stem cell transplantation because the donated cells don't need to be perfectly matched to the patient. The lack of a suitable match is why about 30 percent of patients overall who need a stem cell transplant to treat cancers such as leukemia can't find suitable donors. Among racial-minority patients the number who cannot find suitable donors is about 95 percent. The",

To the ire of environmentalists, it has since ballooned to its largest size since mapping began in 1985, says noaa. Covering 8,776 square miles — that's the size of new jersey — the low-oxygen zone is now more than 3 % larger than 2002's record-setting size of 8,497 square miles, mostly due to heavy rains in the midwest that increased agricultural runoff this year, reports time. The equivalent of 2,800 train cars of fertilizer was carried into the gulf in may alone, reports national geographic. Once there, nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers trigger algae blooms that suck up oxygen in the water as they die, leaving too little for fish and other marine life to survive, per npr. Researchers say the zone is even larger than the numbers indicate because time constraints meant the whole thing couldn't be mapped and winds have been helping to compress it. That's despite a task force that's working to shrink the zone to 1,950 square miles by 2035. That would require a 59 % reduction in the amount of nitrogen flowing into the mississippi river, yet \" river nitrate concentrations have not declined since the 1980s, \" researchers write in proceedings of the national academy of sciences. A separate study from environmental group mighty earth blames our \" factory farm system, \" per inhabitat. A mighty earth rep says \" companies ' practices need to be far more sustainable.

The neuroscientists say that brain activity during eye flickers in rem sleep is \" very, very similar \" to when people see a new image when awake, strongly suggesting that the eye movements are linked to a \" change of scene \" during a dream, the bbc reports. The researchers, whose study is published in the journal nature, worked with sleeping volunteers with epilepsy who had electrodes implanted into their brains, reports new scientist. Lead researcher dr yuval nir tells the bbc that the region of the brain where most of the electrodes were located — the medial temporal lobe — and where the activity was observed deals not with vision so much as mental imagery. That may explain why rapid eye movements have been observed in fetuses and people who are blind. As for the activity that researchers saw, it peaked roughly a quarter of a second after the eye flicker, much like during wakefulness. That leads nir to say he's \" sure that the brain is alternating between different mental imagery. Every time you move your eyes, a new image forms in the mind's eye. \" but one british neuroscientist tells the bbc that while one question may have been answered, a larger one looms: \" the most fascinating question of all is why do we have to have rem sleep? why does our brain have all this circuitry to do that? this paper doesn't answer that. \" ( rem sleep has also been linked to religious experiences. )",

Meadow walker, 16, is suing porsche, alleging that the carrera gt his friend roger rodas was driving lacked safety features that could have prevented the accident, people reports. The lawsuit says the vehicle — which even a former porsche manager calls \" the most dangerous car on the road \" — became a literal deathtrap after the crash when a \" defective \" seat belt left walker unable to escape before it burst into flames. Meadow's lawyer says the carrera gt is a \" dangerous car \" that \" doesn't belong on the street, \" though authorities say dangerous driving is to blame for the deaths. The porsche was going between 80mph and 93mph when it crashed in a 45mph zone, according to investigators who determined that unsafe driving was the sole cause of the accident. A porsche spokesman tells cnn that \" we are saddened whenever anyone is hurt in a porsche vehicle, but we believe the authorities'reports in this case clearly established that this tragic crash resulted from reckless driving and excessive speed. \" ( after walker's death, his younger brothers helped producers finish fast &amp; furious 7. )",

But residents of the 35 mega-mansions lining the private, oval-shaped street are pushing back, reports the san francisco chronicle. South bay couple tina lam and michael cheng scooped up the street at a city-run auction for a little over $ 90,000 in 2015. The street was up for grabs due to unpaid property taxes that the community's homeowner's association neglected to pay for 30 years. Seeking to recover the $ 14 owed per year, the city put the street up for sale. ( plus interest and penalties, the bill amounted to a whopping $ 994. ) residents say they didn't know about the back taxes or sale until this may, when a title search company hired by cheng and lam sent out letters asking if property owners were interested in buying the street back. Per curbed, the presidio terrace association filed a complaint claiming that the address the city used to bill the association was not associated with any of its members. A treasurer-tax collector spokesperson says the city followed all requirements, adding that almost all local homeowners \" pay their taxes on time — and they keep their mailing address up to date. \" according to the chronicle, cheng and lam's property comes with plenty of financial opportunity, including making residents pay for street parking. But lam asserts that owning the once white-only property goes beyond dollar signs: \"i really just wanted to own something in san francisco because of my affinity for the city. \" meanwhile, the association has petitioned the board of supervisors to negate the sale — a hearing is scheduled for october — and sued the couple and the city in an attempt to block the property being sold to anyone else while the appeal is pending.",

A dozen major airports tell the journal there were no unusual delays or lines yesterday, and politico notes that no passenger complaints or horror stories have cropped up online. It seems napolitano may have been referring mostly to customs — she specifically mentioned miami and jfk airports, but while miami confirmed there was a customs delay saturday, jfk says it isn't aware of any recent issues. And miami was one of the airports to report smooth operations yesterday. The journal notes that while delays are likely to increase, it will probably take some time, as staffers are gradually reduced thanks to freezes on hiring and overtime. ( politico puts the fallout about 30 days away. ) some republicans, of course, are saying the administration's dire sequester-related warnings are overblown.",

        "summary": "A us government report to be released as soon as tomorrow will provide one of the final pieces of groundwork ahead of an expected strike on syria, reports the washington post. The report will set out the timeline of how bashar al-assad's regime used chemical weapons in last week's alleged nerve agent attack outside damascus. According to foreign policy, the evidence includes \" panicked \" phone calls between syria's foreign ministry and the leader of a chemical weapons unit, raising the possibility that a rogue officer could have been responsible. Key syria ally russia has starting pulling its citizens out of the country ahead of a western air assault that many now see as inevitable. Russia's foreign minister warned that intervention \" will lead to the long-term destabilization of the situation in the country and the region, \" the ap reports. Deputy pm dmitry rogozin had harsher words: \" the west behaves towards the islamic world like a monkey with a grenade. \" in other developments: military action could happen as soon as tomorrow, when british pm david cameron calls an emergency meeting of parliament to vote on british involvement, reports the ap. France and turkey are also expected to contribute, but the arab league has refused to support intervention. Us officials insist that the strikes being considered are to \" deter and degrade \" syria's ability to launch chemical attacks — not to bring about regime change. But some analysts warn that a largely symbolic assault will hand assad a propaganda victory by allowing him to claim that he faced down the world's only superpower, the new york times notes. While the us says it has proof of a chemical attack, un investigators are still at work; they were seen leaving a damascus hotel today and anti-regime activists say they were headed for one of the areas affected by last week's alleged attack. A un spokeswoman says they might need more than two weeks to finish. Indeed, any intervention by the us, britain, and france may come before the un inspectors complete their investigation — and will also likely come without the approval of the un security council, as russia and china have long been against a strong response, the ap reports. Britain is putting forward a security council resolution condemning the syrian government and, the bbc reports, \" authorizing necessary measures to protect civilians \" today, though it will likely be vetoed by russia and china. Un special envoy to syria lakhdar brahimi says security council approval is needed for any military action — despite the fact that \" it does seem clear that some kind of substance was used... That killed a lot of people. \"",

On tuesday, president trump's personal attorney sued the research firm that compiled the dossier along with buzzfeed, which made it public. In his separate suits against fusion gps and the media outlet, attorney michael cohen said the document contained \" false and defamatory \" accusations about him that have caused \" harm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities, \" per abc news. Meanwhile, buzzfeed editor ben smith has written an op-ed in the new york times in which he says he's proud of the controversial decision made one year ago to publish the 35-page dossier. \" a year of government inquiries and blockbuster journalism has made clear that the dossier is unquestionably real news, \" writes smith. \" it has helped journalists explain to their audience the investigation into russian influence on the 2016 election, \" while the pro-trump camp — even trump himself — is citing the dossier as a way to try to discredit the robert mueller investigation into russian collusion. \" the chorus of criticism of our decision to publish has faded, \" writes smith, who asserts that publishing the dossier was in the public interest. \" i haven't had a single person approach me to say, ' i wish i hadn't read the dossier, and wish i had less insight into the forces at play in america. ' \" ( newser initially reported that the suit was filed on trump's behalf. The story has been corrected to reflect that cohen is the plaintiff. )",

But now, thanks to the latest 3d scanning and imaging tech — typically used for medical purposes — scientists say they've been able to \" virtually unroll \" the 2.75-inch scroll and read it, reports afp. So what's written on the ancient, charred remains? the first eight verses of leviticus in the old testament, which present the rules of ritual sacrifice. The jewish village of ein gedi, known as the site where king david fled to escape king saul, had \" completely burnt to the ground, \" says the archaeologist who found the scroll nearly 50 years ago. \" after the dead sea scrolls, this is the most significant find of a written bible, \" pnina shor, curator and director of the israel antiquities authority's dead sea scrolls project, tells livescience. Since its discovery, the ein gedi scroll has been stored alongside the 2,000-year-old dead sea scrolls in the iaa's climate-controlled vault, until merkel technologies offered up its micro-ct scanner last year and the resulting images were sent to the university of kentucky, which developed the software to read it. \" this discovery absolutely astonished us; we were certain it was just a shot in the dark but decided to try and scan the burnt scroll anyway, \" says shor.

A rep says leffall's exit will allow him to focus on his work at howard university, where he became provost in december.

Leffall, the first board member to make a move, will be replaced by retired founding board member robert taylor. Meanwhile, the executive exodus from the organization has expanded: now at least five execs have parted ways with the group, the ap notes. Those include three high-ranking officials in the dallas office as well as the ceos of the new york and oregon affiliates.

The problem is they ' ll have to download the app but won't get any bells and whistles or the ability to connect with google chat, hangouts, spaces, the upcoming allo messaging product, or google's android sms app. Google's adding one more silo to its mess of communication apps. Duo was announced at google i/o in may and rolls out globally today on android and ios 9 in 78 languages. It will be a hard sell considering how late to market duo is compared to strong, sensibly intertwined products like facebook messenger and apple's imessage/facetime. You can watch our video demo of duo here: duo is best understood as a no-frills facetime competitor that works with android devices instead of just apple products. Nabbing those users who want to video call their android friends is one avenue for success. Duo looks a bit bland, though, since it can't do group calling, video effects or text chat. If you want to video call someone without duo, you ' ll have to invite them over sms with an app download link. Starting from zero users",

( associated press ) san francisco ( ap ) — knock, knock, google's video chatting app has arrived. The app, dubbed duo, represents google's response to other popular video calling options, including apple's facetime, microsoft's skype and facebook's messenger app. Duo isn't much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature, \" knock, knock. \" the new app, announced in may, is being released tuesday as a free service for phones running on google's android operating system as well as apple's iphones. Like facetime for iphones, duo only requires a person's phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its hangout feature for several years, but the internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable"

One of the foremost naysayers: jerry boykin, executive vp of the family research council and a former army lieutenant general. He's been on fox, written for cnn and usa today, and more. But william saletan of slate has been less than impressed with his arguments. Here are a few of them: women are too weak. Boykin believes soldiers still need certain \" levels of sheer physical strength, speed, and endurance that are relatively rare among women. \" but wait, if they're \" relatively rare \" doesn't mean that they, you know, exist? soldiers need to pee in front of each other! boykin warns that combat missions often offer no access to base facilities. \" living conditions can be abysmal and base. … soldiers and marines have to relieve themselves within sight of others. \" apparently women aren't just weak, they're squeamish. It would humiliate men. Even if some few women can cut it, boykin has argued, \" i certainly don't want to be in that environment with a female, because it's degrading and humiliating to do your personal hygiene and other normal functions \" in front of them. So it's not just the women who are squeamish. Women are too sexy. Soldiers won't be able to focus, boykin argues, \" in an environment that combines life-threatening danger with underlying sexual tensions. \" given that one va survey found that 49 % of women serving in the middle east had been sexually harassed, apparently things are already pretty sexually tense. Women might quit. Boykin worries that women will have \" very little protection \" from being put on the front lines, which would force them to \" reconsider their place in the armed services. … that would be tragic. \" saletan's response: \" you can almost feel the general's tears of sorrow. Women who have voluntarily joined the armed forces — that would be 100 % of them — might run away, tragically, if their unofficial exposure to mortal risk, unshowered men, and outdoor urination becomes official. \" read saletan's full column here.",

        "summary": "A woman in washington state who fell ill earlier this year and died is now said to have died from pneumonia caused by measles — making it what health officials say is the first measles death in the country since 2003, the seattle times reports. The cause of death of the woman, who was in her 20s, was determined only after her autopsy, reports usa today. Her illness is likely linked to an outbreak that took place in clallam county in the spring: she was reportedly treated at a medical center at the same time as another patient who later developed a rash and was determined to be contagious for measles; the paper notes the disease can be spread even before outward symptoms manifest. The woman's death makes it the sixth confirmed measles case in clallam county, and the 11th in washington this year, per the times. Many of the cases nationwide — 178 so far this year, notes the cdc — were part of a larger outbreak believed to have started in disneyland. State health officials say the woman had \" several other health conditions \" and was taking meds that helped suppress her immune system. A california state senator and pediatrician who advocated for his state's tougher vaccine laws tells usa today that he was \" so sorry to hear about this preventable tragedy \" and that it underscores \" exactly why the law \" is necessary.

Despite years of warnings from scientists that earth's supply of helium is quickly running out, the results of a study announced wednesday in prague show there could still be large deposits of the element hidden underground, the guardian reports. Helium, as important to the nuclear industry as the birthday party industry, is essential to everything from mris to the large hadron collider, according to phys.org. But as phd student diveena danabalan explains, \" helium is the second lightest element in nature, it is so light that it leaks away into space. \" that makes it a finite resource, and most of the helium we've used so far has come as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. But \" no one could really pinpont where the next deposit would appear, \" says danabalan. That problem that led researchers to look at 22 natural gas wells in the united states and canada. According to phys.org, whenever helium was found in those wells, so were neon isotope tracers, a chemical almost always associated with groundwater. \" this, we realized, meant that helium has to have been dissolved in groundwater and then transported throughout the us and canada until it met a geological structure that drew it back out of the water, \" danabalan tells the guardian. Knowing how and why helium got into natural gas reservoirs means scientists have a starting point in terms of where to look to find new helium deposits. Now, they just have to actually find them.

Despite it being the second most abundant element in the universe, here on earth it's rare - it is so light that it leaks away into space – and our major resources are running low.

What may be light on the wallet is heavy on the planet, according to a new study on the environmental costs per calorie of beef, pork, poultry, dairy, and eggs — which, combined, make up 96 % of the calories americans get via animal sources. But, as livescience reports, the worst offender is beef: not only does it require about 10 times the resources as pork and poultry ( including 28 times the land ), but when compared to calories gotten from plants, beef uses 160 times more land, 19 times more fertilizer, 11 times more greenhouse-gas emissions, and 8 times more irrigation water. While this isn't the first study to pinpoint the resources used to raise cattle, the authors say it is one of the largest ever conducted to investigate the full extent of environmental costs across different types of livestock in the us, thereby allowing for direct comparisons. Not ready to drop meat from your diet altogether? \" eliminating beef, and replacing it with relatively efficient animal-based alternatives such as eggs, can achieve an environmental improvement comparable to switching to plant food source, \" one researcher tells the bbc.

On aug. 5, the day before cole hansberger's first birthday, his mom, jackie, noticed a few strange things: first, his drooping head while he was crawling around, then a complete cessation of crawling by 5pm that day, and finally, an inability to sit up by early the next morning. Cole was rushed to the er at banner thunderbird medical center, where doctors at first scratched their heads on what caused this sudden deterioration. On a gofundme page set up by robert hansberger, id'd by fox news as cole's dad, robert explains how the baby underwent a plethora of ct scans, blood and urine analysis, and \" tests upon tests with no answers, \" until finally, on wednesday, an update revealed that cole had tested positive for botulism. A banner thunderbird spokesperson tells abc15 cole may have contracted the disease — a rare condition in which toxins attack the body's nerves — from soil and dust near his home in peoria. Dr. Rahul chawla, the doctor treating cole, tells the republic cole's symptoms were textbook: weakness starting in his face before drifting to other parts of his body. The cdc also notes that infants with this disease will often seem lethargic, appear \" floppy, \" and not want to eat. Even though cole is still on a ventilator and can barely move his arms and legs, chawla says after a stay of another week to 10 days in icu, he should eventually start getting back to normal if all goes well. He ' ll have to go to physical therapy, though, and regain muscle memory in his motor skills. Jackie, whom chawla calls \" a rock \" who hasn't left cole's side, says, \" sometimes you get frustrated with your children, but i would pay a million dollars just to hear my son cry. \" ( a dad of two died of botulism from nacho cheese. )",

If that's the case, they'd mark the only surviving bronzes by the artist, and as the guardian puts it, \" in art history terms, the attribution is sensational. \" the unsigned, undocumented sculptures had actually previously been attached to michelangelo, but the 19th-century theory was subsequently brushed aside, with dutch artist willem danielsz van tetrode most recently awarded attribution, reports the bbc. But a drawing from circa 1508 proved the vital clue, say the team of experts behind the announcement. Cambridge prof. Paul joannides last fall noted a muscular male atop a panther \" drawn in the abrupt, forceful manner that michelangelo employed in designs for sculpture \" in a drawing by one of michelangelo's apprentices found in france's musee fabre; the sheet is described as a \" faithful copy of various slightly earlier lost sketches by michelangelo. \" the supporting evidence that was then assembled: it was verified that michelangelo twice sculpted in bronze, though neither of the verified works exist today; anatomists who participated determined the sculptures ' anatomy was similar to works he completed between 1500 and 1510; and a neutron scan dated the bronzes to that same range. The experts believe a 30-something michelangelo sculpted them between 1506 and 1508, between his completion of the david and his beginning work on the sistine chapel ceiling.

He was 77. Jenkins, who feared being killed on patrol or being sent to vietnam, had planned to seek asylum at the russian embassy and return to the us in a prisoner swap, but he came to bitterly regret the 1965 desertion, the bbc reports. North korea held him and other americans prisoner and he endured brutal mistreatment including the removal of a us army tattoo without anesthetic. Jenkins, who grew up in north carolina and left school at 15, taught english in north korea and played american villains in propaganda movies. He married hitomi soga, a japanese citizen kidnapped by north korea, in 1980. Soga was allowed to return to japan in 2002.
