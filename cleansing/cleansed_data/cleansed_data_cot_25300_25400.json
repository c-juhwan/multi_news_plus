        "summary": "For the first time since 2000, neither the us president, first lady, vice president, nor a former president will be attending the olympic games. But the us is sending a delegation to sochi â€” a delegation that includes two openly gay athletes, the ap reports, calling it \" a clear message \" to russia about how the country treats gays and lesbians. The washington post calls it \" a pointed snub, \" and notes that the us is also in conflict with russia on a number of other issues, including foreign policy. Heading up the delegation? recently departed homeland security chief janet napolitano. Tennis legend billie jean king will attend the opening ceremony, while hockey player caitlin cahow will attend the closing ceremony; both are gay. The white house didn't specifically mention russia's anti-gay laws when announcing the delegation last night, but noted that the group \" represents the diversity that is the united states. \" king, for her part, recently discussed russia's anti-gay laws, telling usa today in september that, \" sometimes i think we need a john carlos moment. I would hope the majority of the athletes would speak out. It's a great platform. I wish i was 21 again and in the olympics. \" now king will get her chance, and usa today calls the president's choice \" genius. \" it's not the only recent blow to the sochi games: the presidents of germany and france are also skipping.",

        "summary": "This winter saw the second-largest recorded ice cover on the great lakes, and the five lakes still haven't fully melted. As of april 10, the atlantic cities notes, they remained nearly half frozen over; typically, it's about 3 % at this time of year, an expert tells accuweather. All this poses a range of problems for both humans and wildlife. Coal shipping on the lakes, for instance, was down 69 % this march compared to a year before. This month, an indiana us steel plant had to reduce production because of a lack of iron ore. Meanwhile, ducks starved because they couldn't reach fish â€” and fish themselves may be \" younger and far weaker \" next year thanks to migration delays, stephanie garlock writes. Some of the weather-related changes, however, could be more welcome. The great lakes have suffered several years of unusually low levels, but the melting ice is expected to help restore their depth. That could ultimately help increase shipping later in the year, without the need to spend on pricey dredging projects. Shallower water can favor non-native species, so the melt could help boost wildlife diversity. Of course, these benefits could fade if the summer is particularly hot, garlock notes. \" we don't know, as this winter really exemplified, what's going to happen, \" says a scientist. ( climate change is also wreaking havoc on these seven world wonders you should see before they vanish. )",

Lawyers tell the week what complicates matters is that the school is managed by the federal bureau of indian education. Which leaves the discrimination claims. \" there's absolutely racial disparity in how these cases are charged, \" says a lawyer at a portland firm that takes on pot cases, and buzzfeed notes in colorado, pot arrest rates have dropped for white teens since the drug was legalized, while arrest rates for black and latino teens have substantially increased.

Photos: celebrities who have gotten pregnant over 40 mira sorvino gave birth to her last child when she was 44, while kelly preston was 48 when she and john travolta, who was 56, welcomed their son benjamin. Mariah carey was blessed with totally cute twins, moroccan and monroe, otherwise known as dembabies when she was 42, and madonna gave birth to her last child, rocco ritchie, at the same age. Hln host nancy grace was 47 when she brought her twins, john david and lucy, into the world. Desperate housewives star marcia cross also got pregnant with twins eden and savannah when she",
            "Dimitrios kambouris / getty images halle berry is speaking out about her pregnancy for the first time since confirming last week that she and her fiancÃ© olivier martinez are expecting their first child together. \" i feel fantastic. This has been the biggest surprise of my life, to tell you the truth, \" berry said in an interview with cnn. \" i thought i was kind of past the point where this could be a reality for me, \" the 46-year-old actress added. \" so it's been a big surprise and the most wonderful. \" in the interview, berry said she doesn't know yet if she is having boy, as has been reported by some media outlets. Berry -- who confirmed her engagement to martinez, 47, about a year ago -- already has a five-year-old daughter, nahla, with her ex-boyfriend, gabriel aubry. Pics: star sightings the star also talked about her new collaboration with designer michael kors",
            "When the news broke that halle berry is pregnant with her second child at the ripe old age of 46, most of us reacted with something along the lines of, \" good luck, honey... Hope you're ready! \" sure, we're happy for her and all, but it's pretty tough for a lot of women to imagine being pregnant ( not to mention dealing with a newborn ) well into their 40s. But even though halle admits finding out she is pregnant was the biggest surprise of her life, everything does happen for a reason -- and age is only a number anyway, right? that seems to be the philosophy of quite a few other women in hollywood -- like kelly preston, for instance."

Dustin hood suffered a cardiac arrhythmia on the basketball court and died at the hospital shortly after. He's believed to have imbibed three large, 24-ounce cans of the \" mega monster energy \" beverage, per the inquistr. That means hood may have ingested more than 700mg of caffeine in a 24-hour period. The mayo clinic reports that up to 400mg \" appears to be safe for most healthy adults, \" while the american academy of pediatrics is even more conservative in its estimates for teens, saying child and adolescent caffeine consumption shouldn't exceed 100mg per day ( and that kids shouldn't be drinking energy drinks at all, as they have \" no therapeutic benefit \" ). The suit in hood's case notes that the amount he drank would be equivalent to guzzling 14 12-ounce cans of coke. The hood suit notes that others have also suffered cardiac arrest after \" acute consumption \" of the beverage, which is described on the product's website as being \" the ideal combo of the right ingredients in the right proportion to deliver the big bad buzz that only monster can. \" the inquistr points out it's not known if hood had a preexisting heart condition or other malady, or an unusually strong reaction to caffeine itself, that may have made him vulnerable to the cardiac arrhythmia that killed him.

South korea's national intelligence service further says a number of sources have confirmed that two of jang's aides were publicly executed over corruption last month. Jang has apparently faced disagreements with fellow leaders before: reports in 2004 said he was under house arrest or facing \" re-education, \" but he apparently returned to power two years later. Jang is married to kim jong il's sister, though yonhap cites reports stating he and his wife have grown apart.

        "summary": "Head lice might be a bit harder to nit, er, nip in the bud this year: a study out of southern illinois university-edwardsvillle finds the pests have developed resistance to popular over-the-counter medications in at least 25 states. Kyong yoon, who helped discover ultra-resistant strains, collected 109 samples of lice from 30 states. \" what we found was that 104 out of the 109 lice populations we tested had high levels of gene mutations, which have been linked to resistance to pyrethroids, \" he says in a press release. Pyrethroids â€” a family of insecticides including permethrin, the active ingredient in common lice treatments â€” kill insects by latching onto receptors in their nervous systems. But lice have evolved so the chemicals no longer find a perfect fit. That doesn't mean the treatments won't work, but you ' ll need a higher dose. Cbs news reports 12 million american kids, ages 3 to 11, get lice each year. Yoon specifically tested the samples for a trio of genetic mutations known as kdr. Samples in 25 states were most resistant with all three. Samples from four states, including new york, new jersey, new mexico, and oregon, had one, two, or three. Michigan was the only state where lice hadn't developed resistance. A dermatologist recommends following medication directions, which means applying a treatment a second time, five to seven days after the first. If the first treatment didn't kill all the lice eggs, they ' ll hatch after a week, reports today. If all else fails, a pediatrician can prescribe a treatment lice aren't resistant to. What to avoid: home remedies like olive oil and mayonnaise, since there's no proof they work. The same goes for fine-toothed combs, an expert says. The one all-natural treatment that is proven effective: destroying the habitat, aka shaving your head. ( home lice remedies can be deadly. )",

South korea's unification ministry agreed to provide the funds, which will go towards programmes for infants and pregnant women, days after the un security council agreed a further round of sanctions in response to the regime's recent nuclear test.

The resolution passed the security council 14-0 with the us abstaining from the vote. Israeli settlements are seen as a major sticking point in relations with palestine, but the us has blocked similar resolutions in the past. Here's what you need to know: cbs news calls it a \" stunning culmination of years of icy relations \" between obama and netanyahu that puts the president and the president-elect in direct opposition on a major foreign policy issue. Speaking of, donald trump issued a statement thursday calling for the us to veto the resolution, resulting in egypt withdrawing it, according to usa today. But the resolution was reintroduced by new zealand, malaysia, senegal, and venezuela on friday. \" as to the un, things will be different after jan. 20, \" trump tweeted following friday's vote. The vote was, predictably, condemned by israeli officials. \" the united states abandoned israel, its only ally in the middle east, \" haaretz quotes israeli minister yuval steinitz as saying. In an opinion piece for the washington post, eugene kontorovich calls the vote a \" folly \" that will make it harder to resolve the \" palestinian issue \" and may end up weakening the un.

Cosby's legal team argues the label â€” legally defined as someone with \" a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses \" â€” would hurt cosby's reputation and his relationship with his grandkids, as unsupervised contact with minors wouldn't be allowed. Lawyers say that'd be unfair considering \" no misconduct regarding children has ever been alleged. \" it's unclear when a judge will decide on the label. Cosby faces up to 30 years for rape at his sept. 24 sentencing.",

        "summary": "James comey's thursday testimony before the senate intelligence committee is expected to have dramatic moments â€” but the drama began early with the release of prepared remarks wednesday detailing private meetings with president trump. At the lawfare blog, comey ally benjamin wittes describes the written testimony as \" the most shocking single document \" about presidential conduct since watergate. With his account of trump \" attempting to enmesh him in an inappropriate relationship, \" the former fbi director is describing \" conduct that a society committed to the rule of law simply cannot accept in a president, \" wittes writes. The hearing starts at 10am eastern. A roundup of coverage: the white house put a positive spin on the release, in which comey says trump was not the target of a counter-intelligence operation, the new york times reports. \" the president is pleased that mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any russian probe, \" trump lawyer marc kasowitz said in a statement. \" the president feels completely and totally vindicated. \" at axios, mike allen thinks the white house might have reason to be relieved. \" here's a truth bomb, \" he writes. Comey's account describes \" unprecedented and, to most, disturbing behavior by the president. But it presents no new information that proves a crime. \" after the release, chris christie defended trump, saying he is an \" outsider president \" and his talks with comey, in which he allegedly told the fbi chief he needed loyalty, are what trump \" considers to be normal new york city conversation, \" vox reports. The washington post looks at whether comey is likely to be asked to provide more details on his conversations with trump â€” and at whether the focus of congressional inquiries may now switch to obstruction of justice allegations. At politico, rich lowry notes that comey may face an \" expectations problem \" at the hearing. Some are expecting the hearing to be \" watergate and the clinton impeachment rolled into one, \" though the release suggests comey may \" fizzle \" by that standard. It appears that \" comey doesn't have trump nailed for high crimes and misdemeanors, \" lowry writes. \" rather, he has him dead to rights for amateurish and ham-handed scheming, which is not an impeachable offense. \" the ap profiles the eight republicans and seven democrats on the senate intelligence panel that will question comey, and looks at what line of questioning each of them might pursue.",

Aldawsari retained criminal defense attorney rod hobson, who issued a statement saying that \" the eyes of the world are on this case and the treatment of this accused person, \" the lubbock avalanche-journal reported. \" this is a wonderful opportunity for us to show the world how truly fair our legal system is, even to those who are accused of trying to harm our country, \" he said. The defendant came to the united states as a student in september 2008, but his plan all along was to kill americans, according to journal entries cited in an fbi affidavit. As a saudi who entered the united states legally on a student visa, he evoked memories of the sept. 11, 2001, hijackers, 15 of whom were saudis. Aldawsari's attempts to purchase a chemical used in explosives quickly prompted calls to police from american companies, conduct that law enforcement officials praised. Unlike in a number of recent arrests of suspected terrorism plotters, however, authorities said that aldawsari had managed to advance his plans and assemble some of the ingredients for a bomb before the fbi became aware of him. \" he was meticulous and a serious threat, \" said",
            "Terrorble terror suspect wanted to make bombs out of baby dolls khalid ali-m aldawsari, the 20-year-old saudi arrested in texas yesterday on terror charges, had a lot of ideas. In addition to blowing up the crawford home of george w. Bush and bringing a backpack bomb into a dallas nightclub, aldawsari allegedly hoped to wreak havoc in new york city with car bombs placed in highly trafficked areas and, Ã  la the rock, baby dolls rigged to explode: a bloodthirsty saudi arabian college student was busted in texas for a sickening plot to pack baby dolls with explosives, put them in strollers and set them off at the statue of liberty and empire state building and on wall street, police sources told the post yesterday.... Aldawsari's [ sic ] obsessively pored through online pictures of realistic-looking baby dolls, including some that could be altered to conceal bomb equipment, according to the complaint. He also looked at sites related to strollers, baby clothes and diapers."

The new york times zinged the choice of lawrence for the role because her \" womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission, \" although it made no similar comment about the male characters. The hollywood reporter grumbled about lawrence's \" lingering baby fat. \" \"these kind of messages are toxic, \" yale psychology professor kelly brownell tells abc news. \"they pressure people, especially girls, to be at odds with their bodies. They force into the public psyche an arbitrary and unrealistic ideal that is attainable by few, and leaves a great many scars in its wake. \" having a \" strong woman character is always a positive, \" adds carol bernstein, an associate professor of psychology at new york university. \" it's unfortunate that the discussion has been sidetracked. It's upsetting the media puts so much focus \" on weight, \" which makes young girls who are very susceptible to eating disorders think twice about how they look. \" so far lawrence, like katniss, is fending off all attacks. \"i ' m so sick of these young girls with diets, \" she said in a recent interview. \" i think it's important for girls to have people to look up to and to feel good about themselves. \"",

If you've seen the pint-size assassins in the recent action flicks \"kick-ass \" and \"hanna, \" which feature prepubescent girls who lock, load and shoot without batting a lash, you may think you've also seen it before. You haven't, not really. Although the girls in those movies are vaguely sexualized, their age exempts them from the narrative burdens of heterosexual romance.

A female lion named bibi â€” who appeared on the show from 1996 to 2008 â€” was found dead monday, according to the bbc. \" one of the more unpleasant sights of my career this morning, last night the lions of the marsh pride in the mara were poisoned, \" tweets a bbc photographer who was there when bibi was found.

The bbc reports three people have been arrested in connection with the poisoning, which sickened five lions total. The survivors are receiving treatment. Local farmers have been known to leave poisoned meat out as punishment when lions attack their cattle. According to national geographic, the marsh pride has been pushed to the edges of its territory as an increasing number of farmers illegally let their livestock graze within the reserve. Grazing within the reserve has increased more than 1,100 % in the past few decades. \" the situation has escalated beyond all reason. \" a zoologist says in his blog. The punishment for poisoning lions ranges from fines to life imprisonment, the bbc reports. \" the poisoning of lions in the mara is a disgrace to all kenyans, \" a representative of kenya's wildlife direct charity says.",

Leading the charge for action was bob corker, the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee, who said he believes chemical agents were used and \" i think we will respond in a surgical way. Something that gets their attention, that causes them to understand that we are not going to put up with this kind of activity. \" corker's democrat counterpart in the house, eliot engel, was equally hawkish, saying, \" we have to move, and we have to move quickly. Congress needs to be involved, but perhaps not initially. \" there were calls for caution, however: rhode island democrat jack reed said he wants to \" verify that it was directed by the assad regime because that will allow us to build an international coalition, \" while texas republican mike mccaul worried about public support for action, saying, \"i don't think that american people have an appetite to put troops on the ground in syria. \" elsewhere on your sunday dial: corker on whether he knows what the nsa is spying on: \" no.

Alfred and annette rockefeller, 77 and 66, have received a summons to appear in court tomorrow over a feeder in their garden that has prompted complaints from neighbors; officials say it violates local rules. Feeding wildlife is generally banned, though enclosed, hanging feeders are allowed, the record reports. The one in question is made of wire in the shape of a wreath and contains peanuts ( see it here ). A local official says birds don't eat peanuts, alfred notes; the president of the local audubon society disagrees. The rockefellers bought it after they were told they couldn't spread birdseed on the ground. Alfred is disabled and can rarely leave the house; the feeder is \" one of few things i get pleasure out of, \" he says. But neighbors were upset when it attracted other animals like deer and squirrels, who \" decimated \" pricey plants, says the official. The rockefellers received several warnings and rejected an offer of mediation with neighbors, the police chief says. They now face a fine of up to $ 500.

Premiums would be up 25 % by next year and would double by 2026. The cbo found that by 2020, about half of all americans would live in counties without any insurers in the individual market. That would increase to about three-quarters of americans by 2026, according to bloomberg. The obamacare repeal reconciliation act would remove the aca's mandate that people have insurance while keeping its rules about what insurance plans must cover, leading to the pool of people with insurance getting older and sicker, usa today reports. That's what's behind the increase in premiums. The bill, which is an updated version of a bill passed by congress in 2015 but vetoed by president obama, would reduce deficits by $ 473 billion over the next decade. Sen.

The statement added jordan's brothers witnessed his \" senseless murder, \" though it also called for no violence toward the police, and no \" protests and marches \" for the teen as the family sets up his funeral. The shooting has met further scrutiny after balch springs police chief jonathan haber said monday he \" misspoke \" during his initial description of the incident, per the washington post.

Haber first said the car had been backing up toward cops \" in an aggressive manner. \" body-cam video showed that wasn't the case: the car was moving forward, away from cops, per haber, who retracted his original statement monday and said he doesn't believe the shooting \" met our core values, \" per the dallas morning news.

King also calls for the cop who shot jordan to be fired and arrested. \" what we desire only second to having our beloved jordan back, is justice for jordan, \" the family's statement reads.

Residents will see if drastic action is not taken to address climate change. \" the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the united states and are projected to intensify in the future, \" the researchers say. The last few years have smashed records for damaging weather in the united states, costing nearly $ 400 billion since 2015. In a worst-case scenario, the researchers say, climate change could deliver a 10 percent hit to the nation's gdp by the end of the century.

        "summary": "Apple scored a victory today in its lawsuit against smartphone-maker htc, the new york times reports. A us trade commission ruled that htc will have to tweak some functions on its us smartphones in order to avoid patent infringement. The ruling, which can be appealed, involves technology that allows you to tap on a phone number or a date in an email to call someone or add an appointment to your calendar. Htc says it will change the software before the ruling kicks in on april 19, the wall street journal reports. The ruling also worked against apple, overturning an earlier decision about how htc organized software in its phones. The taiwanese company would have had to work harder to avoid infringing on that patent. But htc is just a drop in the legal bucket for apple: its ultimate target is google, which made the android system that runs on more than half of the world's smartphones. In fact steve jobs once vowed \" to destroy android, because it's a stolen product. \"",

That's according to a case study published in a centers for disease control and prevention report that discusses one family in australia that didn't learn they'd moved into a former meth house until all family members began to suffer. Symptoms ranged from persistent coughing and watery eyes to weight loss, memory problems, high energy, and difficulty sleeping. After months of testing in 2014 revealed high levels of meth residue, as live science reports, the family vacated their $ 500,000 dream home, which ultimately may have to be demolished. Australian officials call the meth problem there so pervasive it's become an epidemic. Last year alone, police broke up hundreds of clandestine meth labs, where chemicals that include drain cleaner and acetone make for an especially toxic mix. \" there's no way i'd buy a house or rent a house in australia without testing for meth first, \" the owner of a company that cleans up former meth labs tells australia women's weekly.

Deputy prime minister jaroslaw gowin says a mass protest that saw tens of thousands of women go on strike monday \" gave us food for thought and certainly taught us humility. \" the country's right-wing ruling party had been considering a complete abortion ban after a citizen initiative collected 450,000 signatures. The guardian calls the law and justice party's sudden rejection of the proposed ban just weeks after recommending it \" humiliating. \" one member of the justice and human rights committee who voted against the proposal wednesday had just days earlier called people opposed to it \" fans of killing babies. \" while there's still a chance the proposed abortion ban will continue to be discussed in parliament, it appears dead. \" abortion will certainly not be banned when the woman is the victim of rape or if her life or her health is in danger, \" the bbc quotes gowin as saying. And prime minister beata szydlo says the law and justice party \" is not working \" on the ban, npr reports. Poland already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in europe. The procedure is only legal in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother may die, or when the fetus would be permanently damaged. Despite the initiative, a recent poll found only 11 % of poles want further restrictions on abortion. There are believed to be up to 150,000 illegal abortions performed in poland every year.",

        "summary": "Police have not released a 28-minute cellphone recording left by the austin bomber before his death, but the austin american-statesman reports that mark conditt offers no motive or remorse for killing two and injuring five. Sources tell the newspaper that the 23-year-old describes himself as a \" psychopath \" in the recording and acknowledges that his actions took loved ones from their families. \" i wish i were sorry, but i ' m not, \" he says. Conditt also says he made a big mistake in using a fedex office, where surveillance video allowed police to get his license plate. And he threatened a chilling finale if police closed in: he would go into a crowded mcdonald's and detonate a suicide bomb. Rep. Michael mccaul, who represents the area in congress, tells cnn that conditt spoke of employment troubles and other \" aggravating factors. \" one more disturbing detail: mccaul says conditt had purchased \" slow down children at play \" signs, which mccaul thinks means he planned to leave more tripwire bombs in residential areas. Meanwhile, the lack of a motive is playing a role in why authorities generally are not calling him a \" terrorist, \" reports nbc news. By federal definition, a terrorist has a political motive, and conditt appears to have lacked one. Critics, however, see a double standard at play because conditt is white. Consider this tweet from pakistani-born actor and comedian kumail nanjiani: \" if this terrorist bomber was a brown guy, my mom wouldn't be able to leave her house for a week. \" ( conditt's pink gloves also played a role in his capture. )",

In his first face-to-face meeting with the new president, trudeau will also meet with trump to talk about trade and participate in a working lunch, the ap reports. A white house official and a senior canadian government official say the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the united states canada council for the advancement of women business leaders-female entrepreneurs. Ivanka trump was involved in setting the agenda for the roundtable and recruiting participants. Relations with the us are crucial as more than 75 % of canada's exports go to the us, meaning that despite the fact that the liberal prime minister has many ideological differences with the republican president, he is expected to focus on common economic interests instead of issues like trump's travel ban. The visit may look very different from last year's love-in with the obamas, but \" that's another world, \" former canadian diplomat paul frazer tells the toronto star. \" that world is not here right now so you have to deal with a different world. \" frazer adds that since dc is a \" bloody chaotic town \" right now, trump will probably be \" open to a little calm. \"",

He was arraigned from his hospital bed sunday on charges including vehicular aggravated assault, auto theft, and reckless endangerment, reports nbc philadelphia.

The incident happened about 1: 30pm in upper darby on the township's busy 69th street, where many families were attending a children's show at the tower theater. Philly.com reports that philadelphia police were looking for dirt bikes and atvs, illegal on city streets, when they tried to pull douglass over. They say he sped away, eventually hitting the girl at full speed, then the aunt, sending them both into the air. Police say douglass then fled and carjacked a 2002 nissan, which was soon found near a wooded area, where douglass was injured and a homeless man was helping him walk. When he was first brought to the hospital, he reportedly asked a nurse if the little girl he hit had died. Police were reviewing their pursuit policy in the wake of the incident, given that douglass wasn't being sought for a serious crime and that the pursuit went beyond the city limits of philadelphia.

        "summary": "Men may run faster marathons than women, but women are \" better \" at running them, a new study finds. Specifically, women are 18.61 % better than men at keeping a steady pace over the entire 26.2-mile course, the guardian reports. Researched looked at more than 1.8 million results from 131 marathons held across the globe between 2008 and 2014, and found that both genders slowed down between the first and second halves of the race â€” but that men slowed down between 16.96 % and 27.27 % more than women did. Researchers think this could be due to \" differences in psychology and decision-making, \" the guardian says; perhaps women, for example, underestimate their abilities or men overestimate theirs. The bottom line, according to the study: \" [ although ] men are faster marathon runners than women ( due to genetics ) they are not the smartest. \" a previous study, which looked only at the chicago marathon, offers other theories as to why: when women run at the \" submaximal intensity \" that is necessary for marathon completion, they may burn a higher percentage of fat than men, thus making them less likely to see their glycogen depleted and \" hit a wall. \" also, women typically \" dissipate a larger percentage \" of the heat produced by running, the study found, because they \" tend to have a larger surface area-to-mass ratio than men. \" advice for both sexes? according to the new study, \" start out slower than what feels natural \" to improve your overall result.

In a specific dig at ceo jeff bezos, the independent vermont senator on wednesday introduced the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies ( stop bezos ) act, which would tax companies with at least 500 employees for the value of public assistance those workers receive, in an effort to save $ 150 billion in government spending per year. Bezos ' wealth increases by $ 260 million per day, yet he \" continues to pay thousands of his amazon employees wages that are so low that they must rely on food stamps, medicaid, or subsidized housing in order to survive, \" said sanders, who also took aim at walmart, burger king, mcdonald's, and american airlines, per cnn and business insider. \" we do not believe that taxpayers should have to expend huge sums of money subsidizing profitable corporations owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country, \" continued sanders, who's partnering with california rep. Ro khanna on the bill. It could prompt a quicker transition to an automated workforce or discourage companies from hiring people likely to need public assistance, though there's little chance of it passing, per vox. Still, amazon is responding to what it calls \" inaccurate and misleading accusations \" by sanders based on data for part-time and temporary workers. \" in fact, the median us salary for full-time amazon employees is $ 34,123, \" the company writes in a blog post, adding \" the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers...

A retired cop wanted a gun requirement to make a statement against gun control talk since the sandy hook shootings, but the town council voted down his measure 4-0 on tuesday. The local police chief said people \" have the right not to bear arms. \" virgin, utah. About 95 % of the town's residents already had a firearm when the law passed in 2000. As in other towns, the measure isn't really enforced, though. \" it's not enforcement, \" says the mayor, \" it's a statement. \"",

It is asking churches to ring their bells 26 times today for the victims of last week's elementary school massacre in connecticut. And it has no plans to change a law requiring residents to own guns. No town in the u.s. Has been as public about its support for guns as kennesaw, population about 30,000, where city leaders for 30 years have required that every household have at least one gun.

        "summary": "For those looking to lose weight, a two-year study suggests that wearing a fitness tracker helps. What surprised researchers, however, is that not wearing one seems to help even more, reports ars technica. The study in jama, perhaps the most comprehensive to date on the subject, followed nearly 500 overweight people ages 18 to 35 over 24 months. For the first six months, all participants used the same strict diet and exercise regimen, and all lost weight. For the last 18 months, half the group got a fitness tracker and half went tech-free. The bottom line: those who wore no monitor ended up an average of 13 pounds lighter than when they began, while those who wore the device ended up 8 pounds lighter, reports the new york times. \"we were definitely surprised, \" says dr. John jakicic of the university of pittsburgh. So what's going on? scientists aren't sure and hope to do follow-up studies to find out, but they theorize that some people wearing the trackers might get discouraged when they fail to hit daily goals and give up. One caveat: the device in the study was a fitcore armband, which isn't quite as advanced as devices on the market today, typically worn around the wrists. \" instead of using heart rate to estimate activity like some devices do, it measured the heat generated by exercise, \" explains npr. A spokesperson for fitbit says its devices go far beyond such data collection to provide \" insights \" and \" motivation, \" per the guardian.",

But unlike the petitions to reduce gun violence that obama addressed last week, this one isn't likely to receive a favorable response. The petition takes aim at morgan for his impassioned defense of proposed gun control legislation on air this week. It accuses him of launching \" a hostile attack against the u.s. Constitution by targeting the second amendment. \" but according to immigration attorney mark schifanelli, it would take more than expressing an opinion on television to get morgan booted out of the country.

            "( image credit: whitehouse.gov ) a petition asking president obama to deport cnn anchor piers morgan gathered more than 33,000 signatures in just three days. The petition on the white house's \" we the people \" website posted friday has crossed the 25,000 threshold needed to solicit a response from president obama. But unlike the petitions to reduce gun violence that obama addressed last week, this one isn't likely to receive a favorable response. The petition takes aim at morgan for his impassioned defense of proposed gun control legislation on air this week. It accuses him of launching \" a hostile attack against the u.s. Constitution by targeting the second amendment. \" but according to immigration attorney mark schifanelli, it would take more than expressing an opinion on television to get morgan booted out of the country. The department of homeland security would have the power to start a deportation process on morgan",

It so happens there are several words in the swedish language that refer to male masturbation, but none for the ladies, and the swedish association for sexuality education ( rfsu ) decided it was time for a change, the local reports. \" historically, women's sexuality and not least female masturbation has been taboo, \" the organization says in a statement. \" women are not expected to have desires and be turned on in the same way as men, which is reflected in the lack of words [ for masturbation ]. \" rfsu received about 200 unique suggestions, but it was \" klittra \" that emerged the victor. Other choices included \" klinka, \" \" flick, \" \" pulla, \" \" selfie, \" and \" selfa, \" according to the telegraph.

Three starks finally joined up in winterfell, and that wasn't even the most exciting part of season 7's portentously titled \" the spoils of war. \" what everyone's buzzing about the morning after: vanity fair notes that the \" affectionate but awkward \" reunion between sansa and arya ( followed by a meetup with bran ) was the \" most important yet \" and that the show \" nailed it. \" that's because of the \" tense, emotional subtext \" running through every scene â€” including the girls ' backstory ( they shared a lot of previous screen time together, making their reunion feel \" earned \" ), a touch of jealousy and fear on sansa's part, and the fact that the sisters \" had so little in common as kids and don't yet know each other as adults. \" the fourth installment of the season was \" the best episode yet, \" per rolling stone, which offers a detailed recap. At the top of the agenda: the ( literally ) scorched-earth conflict between jaime lannister's forces and those of daenerys targaryen, her dragon, and the dothraki, in which \" irresolvable conflicts get cranked up to an even more unbearable level. \" this episode-ending battle doesn't disappoint, with \" shout-at-the-screen, cower-on-your-couch moments \" that game of thrones fans live for. Over at io9, no time is wasted: viewers jump right into a crowdsourced discussion about that \" jaw-dropping ending. \" vox agrees this episode was a triumph and pulls together a list of winners and losers â€” except this time around, there are no losers.

The emails in question are mostly between jobs producer scott rudin and sony pictures co-chairman amy pascal, and the profanity-laden back-and-forth shows how the relationship between rudin and sony devolved to the point that sony ended up losing the project to rival studio universal. But the most entertaining parts of the highly entertaining exchange ( which defamer has in full ) are the parts in which rudin slams angelina jolie. \" what does angelina jolie have to do with all this? \" you ask. Well, apparently, she wasn't happy that david fincher was slated to direct jobs instead of her version of cleopatra, defamer explains. Some of rudin's choice slams: \" you better shut angie down before she makes it very hard for david to do jobs. \" \" there is no movie of cleopatra to be made ( and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me ). \" \" i have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and i will tell her this myself if you don't. \" \" i ' m not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat who thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for eighteen months so she could go direct a movie.

At least five people have died in new jersey, having been poisoned by fumes from their gas- or diesel-powered generator. With gas lines hours long in some places, tempers are flaring. Case in point: a 35-year-old who tried to cut in line at a queens gas station allegedly responded to a complaining motorist by pulling a gun on him, reports the ap. Sean bailey faces 15 years in jail. That's not the only alleged crime to occur: the times of trenton reports on home invasions that have hit hamilton, nj, where men imitating township workers have forced their way into at least two homes with claims to be checking on the water; cash and jewelry were taken. Those looking to get out of new jersey won't find it an easy task.

Although it passed along party lines and is considered token legislation for the republican party, it wasn't a unanimous \" yes \" vote for house republicans. These are the republicans who voted against the tax bill: rep. Dan donovan, new york rep. John faso, new york rep. Rodney frelinghuysen, new jersey rep. Darrell issa, california rep. Walter jones, north carolina rep. Peter king, new york rep. Leonard lance, new jersey rep. Frank lobiondo, new jersey rep. Dana rohrabacher, california rep. Christopher smith, new jersey rep. Elise stefanik, new york rep. Lee zeldin, new york these 12 lawmakers voted \" no \" on the earlier house version of the bill, too. California republican rep. Tom mcclintock also opposed that version, but flipped to vote \" yes \" on the final bill tuesday. Read more",
            "The house passed a tax overhaul tuesday in a 227-203 vote that stayed mostly along party lines, except for the 12 republicans voting no. So who are the republican rebels? here's a breakdown the names, a look at these members'districts, and why they bucked the tax bill. New york and new jersey most of the 14 house republicans from new york and new jersey opposed the republican tax bill, largely because their constituents would be adversely affected by a $ 10,000 cap on state and local tax, or salt, deductions. Dan donovan: donovan, who represents staten island and part of brooklyn, sought to maintain the salt deduction for families earning less than $ 400,000 per year and phasing it out for higher-income earners john faso: a freshman from a politically competitive hudson valley district, faso said the bill's positives, including preserving the medical expense deduction and the tax exemption for interest paid on so-called private activity bonds, weren't enough to overcome his \" overwhelming concern with the state and local income tax deduction \" rodney frelinghuysen: frelinghuysen, the chairman of the appropriations committee, is for the first time in his career facing serious democratic opposition in a district that includes most of morris county, new jersey peter king: king represents parts of nassau and suffolk counties on long island leonard lance: lance represents an upper-income district in north-central new jersey that narrowly backed hillary clinton in 2016 over president donald trump, when lance won the primary and the general election with 54 percent of the vote; lance said he wanted full deductibility of state and local taxes frank lobiondo: lobiondo, a"

        "summary": "As the protest in north dakota against the dakota access pipeline escalates, so has the main crowdfunding page linked to it. The ap reports that since april, a gofundme account set up to raise money to aid protesters has far surpassed the $ 5,000 its organizer had originally hoped it would reach: over the past six months, more than 21,000 people have contributed to boost the fund to over $ 1 million. \" it still feels unreal sometimes because it is such an astronomical figure to me, \" says howaste wikaya, a protester who set up the fundraising page. But wikaya adds the money is spent practically the moment it's received: a local tribal historian tells the ap that only about $ 100,000 from the fund remained as of friday night for the camp, situated near cannon ball where the missouri and cannonball rivers meet â€” and north dakota's unforgiving winter is coming. Where the money has gone: groceries that run about $ 2,000 every two days, 20 yurts ( $ 160,000 in total ), and bail money ( about $ 7,000 so far ) for those arrested for protesting the $ 3.8 billion pipeline, which protesters say will disturb drinking water and plow through cultural artifacts of the nearby standing rock sioux reservation. Per insidesources, however, the protests have benefited from other fundraising as well â€” one effort has set aside more than $ 860,000 just for \" the legal defense of warriors protecting land, water and human rights \" â€” and some even claim donated supplies have been wasted. But donors continue to send financial support, including one new hampshire woman from a community that fought its own natural gas pipeline. \" this really, really struck a chord with me, \" she tells the ap.

Specifically, a steel hook that held up a high voltage line on a pacific gas &amp; electric transmission tower, sources tell nbc bay area. There had already been much speculation that pg&e, the state's largest utility, is to blame for the wildfire that burned through more than 153,000 acres, destroying the entire town of paradise and killing at least 85. One of the company's power lines was reportedly causing sparks just before the fire started nov. 8, and multiple lawsuits have been filed against the utility by fire victims. Now, sources say, investigators have determined a hook on a nearly century-old pg&e transposition tower failed in high winds the morning the fire started â€” and it started at the base of that tower. Neither cal fire nor pg&e would comment on nbc's story, but an attorney representing fire victims alleges pg&e failed to properly maintain its equipment, and another attorney suggests the utility may have more problems in store if it can't keep its aging equipment safe.

Investigative reporter jaxon van derbeken reports. ( published wednesday, dec. 5, 2018 ) nbc bay area has learned that authorities investigating the deadly camp fire have tied its origin to the failure of a single steel hook that held up a high voltage line on a nearly 100-year-old pg&e transmission tower. The fire began at the base of a transposition tower, which serves to redistribute the electricity on the system to balance the load and assure safety. The tower has two arms holding out the \"jumper, \" a part of the line that's being shifted to another point at the top of the tower. The arms each hold electrical insulators, which resemble a series of white discs. Authorities believe the fire started with the fracturing of a steel hook that holds up the insulators to the arms above. It is one of those hooks, sources with knowledge of the investigation say, that failed in high winds the morning of nov. 8. \"pg&e failed to maintain the tower, and they have an obligation to do that -- and it means they are liable for this disaster, \" said attorney dario de ghetaldi, who is suing the utility over the fire. Cal fire would not comment for this story, citing the ongoing investigation.

        "summary": "After seven months as president trump's chief strategist, stephen bannon is out of the administration. Vox looks at what bannon's departure means for the white house and debunks the idea that bannon was \" trump's brain. \" long story short: bannon was one of the few trump aides that actually cared about \" policy details and lower-level appointments, \" but his departure changes little besides that. Bannon had been losing influence ever since the travel ban debacle, and his embrace of outright nationalism will likely continue in the white house without him. Here's what else you need to know: politico reports that with the loss of bannon, the white house may have lost one of its biggest leakers â€” or at least that's what bannon's enemies in the administration suspect. A former breitbart editor used pop culture to explain what's next for bannon. \" bannon understands that in the game of thrones, you win or die; he doesn't intend to die. Now that he's been beheaded by trump, look for him to try to become the night king, leaving destruction in his wake, \" mediaite quotes ben shapiro as saying. Axios reports that destruction could take the form of war on remaining members of the trump administration, including jared kushner, ivanka trump, and hr mcmaster. Sources say bannon is teaming up with the billionaire mercer family to go \" thermonuclear \" on \" globalists. \" breitbart itself seems to be expecting a bannon vs. White house battle with the headline quote, \" get ready for bannon the barbarian. \" meanwhile, jennifer rubin at the washington post warns americans not to believe it when the white house inevitably claims getting rid of bannon represents a pivot toward a more presidential future for trump. The new republic concurs: \" the problem with the trump administration is not that there was a white nationalist whispering in trump's ear; the problem was that there is a white nationalist whispering inside trump's own brain. \" at the daily caller, roger stone writes that while he personally likes bannon, losing him is no reason for conservatives to fret, as bannon was too interested in self-preservation and self-aggrandizement to be effective in the white house. Ineffective or no, chris cillizza at cnn says bannon has already won because \" his worldview and mindset have been adopted almost in toto by the one person whose opinion matters in this white house: donald john trump. \" which explains house minority leader nancy pelosi's statement, as quoted by the hill: \" bannon's firing is welcome news, but it doesn't disguise",

Nancy wilson, a three-time grammy winner and host of npr's \" jazz profiles, \" died thursday at her home in pioneertown, calif., after a long illness, her manager confirms to npr. She was 81. Known for telling stories through her music, particularly jazz, wilson actually dabbled in many genres, from pop to r&b to broadway show tunes. Born in ohio, she began testing her pipes at age 4, and was lead singer of her choir by 10, reports the new york times. Five months after moving to new york in 1959, she'd signed with capitol records and put out her first album with nat king cole's own producer. Despite no formal training, wilson went on to release more than 70 albums ( including three in a single year ), winning the grammy for best r&b recording in 1964, and two for best jazz vocal album in 2005 and 2007. Her performances of songs like \" ( you don't know ) how glad i am \" became her signature. \" audiences want to see a song as well as hear it, \" as wilson put it, per the times. \" part of what i do is in my body language, my hands, my arms. You miss a lot by just hearing my voice. \" by 1965, a writer applauded one of her shows as an \" extraordinary demonstration of the attainment, by a splendid singer, of an almost unprecedented mixture of commercial appeal, physical and music charm, and artistic integrity. \" two years later, wilson â€” a civil rights advocate inducted into the international civil rights: walk of fame â€” became one of the first african-american tv hosts, with the nancy wilson show on nbc. \" i ' m so glad i was able to spend time with her and hear her beautiful voice in person, \" john legend says in a tweet, per cnn.

Though the letter was reprinted and circulated throughout europe, only about 80 copies remain â€” and now the us is sending one of them, a stolen one, back to europe, reports the los angeles times. The us immigration and customs enforcement says the $ 1.1 million \" plannck ii \" copy donated to the library of congress in 2004 was being delivered to italy after an investigation found it was stolen from florence's riccardiana library and replaced with a high-quality photocopy decades ago, per the local and delaware news journal. After a researcher finally detected the forgery in 2012, authorities received a tip that the real one was in washington. New tests have revealed that to be true. Among other things, researchers detected bleach on the library of congress ' copy, suggesting that the riccardiana library's stamp was once there but had been removed. It isn't clear when the letter was stolen from the museum, but officials say a swiss collector somehow obtained it and sold it to an american in 1990. It was then purchased at a new york auction in 1992 before that owner donated it to the library of congress in 2004. \" it is interesting how 500 years after the letter was written it has made the same trip back and forth from america, \" says italy's culture minister, per nbc news.

She described the attacks as \" a fight for freedom against a dark ideology. \" israeli pm benjamin netanyahu, meanwhile, is calling for jews to return to israel in the wake of the attacks.",

        "summary": "Richard iii's final resting place just keeps giving up secrets, from possible infidelity to his bad case of roundworms, and now the unexplained presence of a woman's remains. The woman's posh coffin was found a year after the 2012 discovery of the king's remains, the leicester mercury reports. She was elderly and appears to have been of high status, notes livescience; her bones show that she ate well through her life, and she was found in a lead coffin emblazoned with a crucifix. She appears to have been buried shortly after a church was completed on the site in leicester, england, in 1250. She was laid at \" an important part of the church, \" says the dig's head, matthew morris. \" it's fairly central; it's probably quite close to the high altar. \" that could mean she was \" an important benefactor of the friary, \" or \" even the founder. \" going even further, some experts have wondered whether the remains could have belonged to one emma holt, a woman of the time who was praised by a bishop in documents, the telegraph reports. The bbc describes the discovery as a \" coffin-within-a-coffin. \" the outer section was made of limestone, with the well-preserved lead coffin inside, morris says, per the mercury. Her body was in good company, being in one of 10 known graves at the site known as grey friars. Five graves were left alone â€” but all of those examined, except richard's, contained female remains. ( as for the king, his remains point to a terrible death. )",

        "summary": "Louisiana holds its republican primary tomorrow, and the state probably won't snap mitt romney's southern losing streak, analysts say. Romney hasn't spent much time or money there, and its high proportion of conservative voters and relatively low household income make it fertile ground for rick santorum, the wall street journal finds. Public policy polling's numbers back that up: it has santorum up 42 % to 28 %, with newt gingrich and ron paul bringing up the rear once again, at 18 % and 8 %, respectively. Some 20 delegates are up for grabs in the last primary until maryland, wisconsin, and washington, dc, vote on april 3. And with four candidates still in the race, this is the first meaningful louisiana primary since the state's gop started holding them in 1980, usa today notes. The vote comes as republican leaders step up calls for the party to get behind the front-runner. After a meeting with romney, south carolina's jim demint, one of the senate's most outspoken conservatives, said it was time for his rivals to do some \" self reflection. \" he stopped short of endorsing romney but said he was not only comfortable with him, he was \" excited about the possibility of him possibly being our nominee. \"",

        "summary": "The new anthony weiner revelations have put wife huma abedin back in the public eye, even more so this time because she chose to defend him publicly. A sample of the reaction: no sympathy: \" clearly, there is something very wrong with abedin â€” whether it's simply that she shares her husband's vaulting ambition or that she has a pathological need to be publicly humiliated, something's up, \" writes maureen callahan at the new york post. Abedin played along with weiner's i ' m-a-changed-man interviews knowing it wasn't true. She \" was happy to lie to a public that had been nothing but sympathetic toward poor, brilliant huma, saddled with such a dud. Perhaps they're a better match than we knew. \" steinem puzzled: \"i have no way of knowing whether huma, for whom i have great respect, is responding out of new motherhood, the stockholm syndrome or a mystery, \" gloria steinem tells the new york times. But \"i strongly object to holding one spouse responsible for the other's acts, \" she adds. \" he's the one who should get out of the race. \" jenny sanford supports: sanford did the opposite of abedin and left husband mark during his \" appalachian trail \" wanderings. But each marriage is different, she tells politico. \"since [ weiner and abedin ] made a decision to stay together and work it out, it makes perfect sense that she stand up there now. â€¦ she obviously knew this would be a difficult race. \" but... This isn't just about a marriage, it's also about a mayor's race, writes keli goff at the washington post. If abedin wants to stand by weiner the husband, fine, but weiner the candidate? \" right now it looks like huma is putting her family's political ambition ahead of the city's needs, and perhaps her own. \" political savvy: don't underestimate abedin's, writes elizabeth dias at time. She learned from the best, hillary clinton, and who knows, she might end up being chief of staff to the first female president. As for personal matters, she laid out her decision in clear terms. \" to sincerely support a women's right to choose their own future, the public has to let huma be huma. \"",

If kelly doesn't voluntarily resign, he could be recalled, supervisor todd spitzer noted, adding that kelly had ventured beyond a judge's duty of following the law, actually making it himself instead. Rojano-nieto also spoke at his sentencing, pleading, \" despite my actions and what people might say about me, that is not what is in my heart, \" the times reports.

Cnn reports he's looking at zero to six months of prison time, with federal judge emmet sullivan making the call. But the washington post reports the hearing may not be so \" uneventful \" after all. That's because flynn's attorneys'sentencing submission suggests he was tricked by the fbi into making false statements because he did not receive advance warning from them that such lies would be a crime. The guardian reports prosecutors didn't buy the argument: \" a sitting national security advisor, former head of an intelligence agency, retired lieutenant general, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents. \" judge sullivan asked for additional documents in response.

            "When leonard cohen was twenty-five, he was living in london, sitting in cold rooms writing sad poems. He got by on a three-thousand-dollar grant from the canada council for the arts. This was 1960, long before he played the festival at the isle of wight in front of six hundred thousand people. In those days, he was a jamesian jew, the provincial abroad, a refugee from the montreal literary scene. Cohen, whose family was both prominent and cultivated, had an ironical view of himself. He was a bohemian with a cushion whose first purchases in london were an olivetti typewriter and a blue raincoat at burberry. Even before he had much of an audience, he had a distinct idea of the audience he wanted. In a letter to his publisher, he said that he was out to reach \"inner-directed adolescents, lovers in all degrees of anguish, disappointed platonists, pornography-peepers, hair-handed monks and popists. \" cohen was growing weary of london's rising damp and its gray skies. An english dentist had just yanked one of his wisdom teeth. After weeks of cold and rain, he wandered into a bank and asked the teller about his deep suntan. The teller said that he had just returned from a trip to greece. Cohen bought an airline ticket. Not long afterward, he alighted in"

The joint us-european aida â€” that's asteroid deflection and assessment â€” mission intends to crash a probe into a 525-foot-wide asteroid known as didymoon to see if the impact will change its orbital path. The egg-shaped asteroid is actually part of a binary system and orbits its larger partner, didymos, every 12 hours, per phys.org. Nasa's double asteroid redirection test ( dart ) probe will crash into didymoon at a speed of roughly 13,420mph, while esa's asteroid impact mission ( aim ) will study the effects so researchers can determine whether didymoon's orbit was indeed altered, reports itv news. As esa mission manager ian carnelli explains, \" we will gain insight into... How the technique could be applied if a real threat were to occur. \" \" to protect earth from potentially hazardous impacts, we need to understand asteroids much better â€” what they are made of, their structure, origins, and how they respond to collisions, \" an esa lead investigator says of the plan, revealed wednesday at the european planetary science congress in france. As such, before aim retreats to a safe distance to watch the impact, it will first study didymoon's mass, density, and internal structure. The mission is set to launch in october 2020 and will meet up with the binary system in may 2022. Per the esa, didymos will be \" comparatively close \" to earth in 2022, at a distance of about 6.8 million miles; the independent reports it came within 4.5 million miles of our planet in 2003.
