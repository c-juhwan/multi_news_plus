Coverage: the meeting: trump and kim will meet at 9pm eastern on singapore's sentosa island ( that's 9am tuesday in singapore ), shake hands, take a ceremonial walk, and then go behind closed doors for their meeting. It will be just the two of them and their interpreters, reports the washington post. No timetable is set on how long the session will last, but the white house has set aside two hours. Change of schedule: kim took in some of the sights in singapore monday evening and was seen waving and smiling to onlookers, reports reuters. President trump, meanwhile, told reporters he is confident the summit is \" going to work out quite nicely. \" trump will head back to washington tuesday evening instead of wednesday morning as originally scheduled, because talks are moving \" more quickly than expected, \" per a white house statement.

            "Singapore ( reuters ) - u.s. President donald trump said on monday his historic summit with north korean leader kim jong un in singapore could \"work out very nicely \" as officials from both countries sought to narrow differences on how to end a nuclear stand-off on the korean peninsula. Kim, one of the world's most reclusive leaders, made an evening tour of sites on singapore's waterfront, on the eve of the summit due to start on tuesday at a nearby resort island. In a tweet early on tuesday, just hours before the summit, trump said staff-level meetings between the countries were \"going well and quickly... But in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen! \" while trump was optimistic about prospects for the summit between the old foes, u.s.

Here's what they're saying: \" you'd expect a boxing movie to deliver the body blows, but what's surprising are the various tender caresses the movie delivers, \" writes joe dziemianowicz at the new york daily news. Creed not only \" packs a mighty punch, \" but it's \" an exciting, amusing, and well-acted crowd-pleaser, \" he says. Sylvester stallone will \" knock your socks off, \" he adds. Sure, the david-versus-goliath angle is \" corny, but it still works. \" \" despite getting laid out in excruciatingly graphic detail, the kid somehow comes roaring back, not so much struggling to his feet as leaping. Which is exactly what this energetic, hugely entertaining film does for the four-decades-old franchise, \" writes tom russo at the boston globe. Michael b. Jordan and stallone are each great on their own and \" develop a terrific, relaxed chemistry, \" he says. The movie also \" works on two levels, tending equally to nostalgists and a younger crowd. \" \" this is the best rocky film since the original \" and \" one of the year's warmest and most crowd-pleasing surprises, \" praises lou lumenick at the new york post. A training montage shows writer-director ryan coogler \" not only respects but totally gets what made the original underdog classic win the best picture oscar in 1977. \" it's this that helps him deliver \" a knockout punch. \" stallone, meanwhile, delivers \" one of his most careful and nuanced performances in years. \" \" creed follows the themes and gambits of classic fight films but this is no paint-by-numbers imitation, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. \" this excellent sequel introduces new characters to the series while paying homage to the enduring appeal of its predecessors, \" he says. \" it unabashedly manipulates audiences...

        "summary": "A timeline of the final days of the washington family killed in an apparently intentional car crash in california is coming together. Jennifer hart, 38, was caught on surveillance footage at a safeway store in fort bragg, calif., around 8am on march 25, the day before the family's suv plunged off a cliff about 15 miles north of the area, fox news reports. The bodies of jennifer hart ( who was driving the suv ) as well as her wife, sarah, and three of their six adopted children have since been found; authorities are still searching for the couple's three other children. Jennifer hart was purchasing bananas and other groceries during the safeway trip; it's not clear where the rest of the family was, nbc news reports. The children ranged in age from 12 to 19; their parents were under investigation for alleged abuse or neglect at the time of the crash. Investigators have also been interviewing neighbors, searching the family's washington home, and looking into cellphone pings. So far, they know the family was south of portland by 8: 15am march 24, and then drove south along the coast until, by 8pm, they were in the fort bragg area. They were there a little more than 24 hours, then headed north up the coast. Their gmc yukon went off the cliff, falling 70 feet to an embankment below, on march 26; a passerby reported it to police around 3: 30pm. Authorities say it appeared to have accelerated over the edge and that no skid marks were found near where it went over. \" as of this date it is still unclear if the missing children were inside the vehicle during the incident, \" the chp said in a news release, but the missing children are tentatively presumed dead. The local sheriff tells koin there is \" every indication \" they were in the car when it crashed. ( a former friend of the couple has come forward to speak out about the alleged abuse. )",

In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the wall street journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \" engaging in cycling and rowing ( high cardiovascular intensity ) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket ( low cardiovascular intensity ), \" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \" over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging, \" says a study author.

Watch from anywhere the meteor shower's radiant - the point in the sky where the meteors appear to emerge from - rises along with the constellation aquarius, in the very early morning hours. The meteor shower should be visible from about 3 a.m. Local time, until dawn, on both mornings. The eta aquarid radiant in the eastern sky, at 4 a.m. On may 5 and may 6, 2016. Credit: stellarium/s.

The eta aquarids is one of the fastest meteor showers. Its specks pierce the sky at about 148,000 miles per hour."

The reason? it's all part of a strategy to help the monkeys identify their own species and avoid crossbreeding with others, new research finds. Guenon monkeys, sometimes known as cheek pouch monkeys, are a group of perhaps 30 species that tend to live side by side. To prevent mating across species and possible unhealthy offspring, researchers think each species developed varying features — like mohawks, pursed lips, or white noses — as markers, livescience reports. Us and uk researchers spent a year and a half snapping photos of 22 guenon species, then compared their features using a human-face-recognition program — the first time such a thing has been used on non-humans. What they found: the monkeys ' faces evolved to look different from guenons in other species, especially those with whom they were in close contact, reports the bbc. \" in other words, how you end up looking is a function of how those around you look, \" a researcher says.",

New research published in the international journal of obesity finds that the average adult eats 92 % of the food on his or her plate. The reasons have yet to be hashed out, but the reality is clear: \" if you put it on your plate, it's going into your stomach, \" says brian wansink, director of the cornell food and brand lab, in a eureka alert press release. The findings hold across several developed countries. Researchers observed 1,179 diners in the us, canada, france, taiwan, korea, finland, and the netherlands, and regardless of location or gender the results were almost identical. There is, however, one exception: kids. Observing 326 participants under 18, researchers found that the typical child eats 59 % of the food he or she puts on the plate. Whatever the reason, we grow up to belong to the clean plate club, as researchers call it, they say this can be a wake-up call to be more mindful of what we serve ourselves in the first place. The la times susses out one piece of good news along those lines: those who pile on fruits, veggies, whole grains, and other healthful stuff tend to clean their plates more thoroughly than those who eat less healthful foods.

While turkish customs and economy officials either wouldn't comment or didn't respond to bloomberg, the owner of a turkish trucking company said that \" every day we have four or five trucks carrying red bulls to syria. \" he adds that those picking up the goods on the syrian side don't id themselves, and the imports are then loaded onto syrian trucks and driven away. Meanwhile, caffeinated militants may also be fortified by the \" good wives of jihadi \": the independent recently documented a new isis media arm that posts and tweets out nursing, morale, and cooking advice for militants ' wives, including recipes to \" replenish the mujahidin. \" ( here's how you can get your portion of a $ 13 million red bull payout. )",

            "Guidelines for women on how to be the ultimate wives of isis fighters in syria and iraq are now being distributed by the militant group's new media arm. The zora foundation is the latest isis media group operating across social networks. Isis ( also known as islamic state ) regularly release propaganda showing brutal executions and violent atrocities, training regimes for fighters and threats to the west as the us-led coalition air strikes continue. But unlike most of isis ' propaganda that addresses men and attempts to recruit them, this specifically targets women supporting islamist fighters by circulating advice on how to be ' good wives of jihad '. The organisation's slogan is \" preparing for the honour of jihad \", with videos and tweets explaining the ways in which women can contribute to isis ' insurgency. Its social media accounts have already garnered over 2,000 followers after being established just over two weeks ago. Zora's material, all of which is in arabic, has been shared by isis supporters across social media. Charlie winter, a researcher at counter-extremism think tank the quilliam foundation, said the organisation is aimed at those preparing to go out and support the group, while also acting as a facility for the women already out there.

If you visited the red planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say nasa scientists. Their new study arrived at that \" solid estimate... By determining how much water was lost to space, \" says lead author geronimo villanueva. The guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in mars ' atmosphere: h2o and hdo, in which deuterium ( aka \" heavy \" hydrogen ) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As national geographic explains, mars ' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of hdo to h2o in martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While national geographic observes the findings back up \" reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface \" of mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \" the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer, \" a scientist says.

Today the vatican called the posting of the draft \" incorrect \" and suspended the press credentials of sandro magister, the magazine's longtime vatican reporter and \" most reliable and revered vaticanisti, \" per his own chiesa website. However, magister claims he's not the one who obtained or leaked the document — his editor is, he tells the ap. \" i just wrote the introduction, \" he texted, confirming that he had promised the vatican his lips were sealed about the encyclical, which features francis hitting global warming as being predominantly caused by humans and our insistence on burning fossil fuels. Who is under the microscope, according to some observers: vatican conservatives who wanted the pope to keep his nose out of science and stick to church doctrine. The ap cites la stampa, an italian daily, as saying that those old-school conservatives don't appreciate the pope's attempts at reform. Some commentators say the leak may have been planned to devalue thursday's launch, which will be assisted by decidedly non-church-affiliated professionals, including an atheist scientist and an economist, per the ap.

To date, the benefits of using antibacterial hand soap haven't been proven.

The conservatives still have the most seats but jeremy corbyn's labour party was the night's big winner, gaining more than 30 seats in parliament, while the pro-brexit united kingdom independence party saw its share of the vote collapse. In scotland, the scottish national party saw a fall in support, with former party leader alex salmond among those losing their seats. The latest: with corbyn — and plenty of angry conservatives — calling for her resignation, may signaled that she will stay on for now, reuters reports. \" at this time, more than anything else this country needs a period of stability, \" she said early friday after she was re-elected to her own seat in parliament. The inconclusive election was result was seen as a disaster by negotiators in brussels, where brexit talks are due to begin within days, the guardian reports.

        "summary": "We now have the most definitive sign yet — courtesy of a nasa orbiter — that the european space agency's mars lander crashed onto the planet's surface in what the ap describes as a \" fiery ball of rocket fuel. \" esa lost contact with the schiaparelli lander wednesday, approximately 50 seconds before it was supposed to land on mars. What exactly happened to the lander has been a mystery, but a crash seemed likely. Now, images from a nasa orbiter released friday show an approximately 6,500-square-foot dark patch on the martian surface a few miles from where the lander was supposed to touch down, the bbc reports. That spot is likely the result of an exploding lander. Esa reports the lander's parachute deployed then released as planned ( it's probably the small light spot in the new image ). But the lander's nine thrusters fired for only a few seconds instead of half a minute for some reason. The lander probably free-fell for up to 2.5 miles before hitting mars at more than 185mph. And since the thrusters didn't use much of the stored rocket fuel, a decent-sized explosion was probably the result. Nasa plans to get a better picture of the crash site next week. The lander was meant to be testing technology for another esa landing in 2020. Its failure means nasa is still the only agency to successfully land a robotic vehicle on mars, having done so several times.",

The remains of six soldiers have been discovered so far, but that's just the start. The australian broadcasting corporation reports they were found in one of about 200 sealed caves on peleliu. An estimated 10,000 japanese men were killed in a weeks-long battle with us troops during the war, and the bodies of 2,600 of them were never found. The japanese used a network of caves and tunnels during the 1944 fighting, recounts the telegraph, and largely \" staged their defense \" from within the caves. About 1,600 american troops were killed, but the us military blew up many of the caves ( essentially sealing the japanese within ) and eventually gained control. The six newly found bodies were found in the vicinity of an anti-tank gun, and \" it's my understanding that those [ bodies ] were the crew, perhaps the officer and his men that were manning that gun, \" says one of the search officials. \" a number of us soldiers died in that vicinity as well. \" the task is painstaking because searchers need to guard against booby traps or the detonation of old munitions. An interesting side note from the telegraph: some 35 japanese soldiers who had been hiding in the caves surrendered in april 1947 — more than a year after the war's end.

The site — one of around 200 sealed caves on the island of pelileu — was recently opened again for the first time in nearly 70 years. The caves were used when us and japanese forces fought a fierce battle on the island's beaches in september 1944. Steve ballinger, operations director with non-government organisation cleared ground demining, said the bodies of the six soldiers would be repatriated. \" the cave itself is in an area known as the promontory which is the defining point on the west coast of the island of pelileu, \" he told radio australia's pacific beat program. \" at that location was an anti-tank gun in a heavily fortified concrete bunker and it took a number of days actually to capture this fortified position. \" it's my understanding that those [ bodies ] were the crew, perhaps the officer and his men that were manning that gun...

The grim and painstaking task, undertaken by a team of local and japanese archaeologists and munitions experts, is aimed at finding the remains of japanese soldiers trapped inside by united states forces during one of the toughest battles of the war. The japanese used the caves, connected via tunnels and narrow passageways, as a base for their defence of peleliu, a narrow island only six miles long. More than 10,000 japanese soldiers died, but the bodies of 2,600 were never found. Now, palau has agreed to open about 200 remaining sealed caves to try to locate the remains ahead of a visit early next month by japan's emperor akihito and empress michiko. The macabre task is risky and involves clearing a way into the caves through thick forest littered with unexploded ordnance. A team of experts took five days last week to clear their way into just one small cave with a 7ft opening.

The site — one of around 200 sealed caves on the island of pelileu — was recently opened again for the first time in nearly 70 years. The caves were used when us and japanese forces fought a fierce battle on the island's beaches in september 1944. Steve ballinger, operations director with non-government organisation cleared ground demining, said the bodies of the six soldiers would be repatriated. \" the cave itself is in an area known as the promontory which is the defining point on the west coast of the island of pelileu, \" he told radio australia's pacific beat program. \" at that location was an anti-tank gun in a heavily fortified concrete bunker and it took a number of days actually to capture this fortified position. \" it's my understanding that those [ bodies ] were the crew, perhaps the officer and his men that were manning that gun... A number of us soldiers died in that vicinity as well. \" mr ballinger said other war relics were also found in and around the cave. \" during the detection and",
            "On a remote coral island in the tiny pacific nation of palau, officials have been inching through foliage littered with explosives to open up a network of sealed caves and search for thousands of bodies believed to have lain inside since the second world war. The grim and painstaking task, undertaken by a team of local and japanese archaeologists and munitions experts, is aimed at finding the remains of japanese soldiers trapped inside by united states forces during one of the toughest battles of the war. The japanese used the caves, connected via tunnels and narrow passageways, as a base for their defence of peleliu, a narrow island only six miles long. More than 10,000 japanese soldiers died, but the bodies of 2,600 were never found. Now, palau has agreed to open about 200 remaining sealed caves to try to locate the remains ahead of a visit early next month by japan's emperor akihito and empress michiko. The macabre task is risky and involves clearing a way into the caves through thick forest littered with unexploded ordnance. A team of experts took five days last week to clear their way into just one small cave with a 7ft opening. Archaeologists found a set of bones which are believed to be human and will be taken back to japan for testing. \" they found some bones while they were clearing the entrance of"

Both monks immolated themselves at 10 a.m. Local time ( 0200gmt ) on monday, he said. The two monks suffered slight burns and were in stable condition, state news agency xinhua said, citing doctors. The report added that \" the suicide attempt is under further investigation. \" when asked about the self-immolations",
            "Successor chosen by dalai lama ' illegal ': china beijing — china said monday any successor chosen by the dalai lama would be \" illegal \" after the tibetan spiritual leader announced that he, and not beijing, would decide whether he should be reincarnated. The dalai lama, who is 76, said on saturday he would decide when he was \" about 90 \" whether he should be reincarnated, in consultation with other monks, and that china should have no say in the matter. Under tibetan tradition, monks identify a young boy who shows signs he is a reincarnation of a late leader, but many predict china will simply appoint its own successor to the dalai lama. China's foreign ministry said any reincarnation process would have to be conducted in accordance with the country's \" laws and regulation \". \" the title of dalai lama is conferred by the central government and is illegal otherwise, \" ministry spokesman hong lei told journalists. \" there is a complete set of religious rituals and historical conventions in reincarnation of the dalai lama and a dalai lama identifying his own successor has never been the practice. \" the reincarnation of the dalai lama should follow religious rituals and historical conventions and laws and regulations of this state. \" tibet's spiritual leader said he had decided to lay out \" clear guidelines"

Authorities found the body of radcliffe haughton, 45, at the spa where his wife, zina haughton, worked in suburban milwaukee. But police say the discovery was slowed by an improvised bomb found on the scene, the ap reports. Haughton's relationship with his wife had heated up this week when she placed a restraining order against him in a domestic dispute, and he was ordered to hand in all his firearms. But he allegedly carried a handgun into the two-story, 9,000-square-foot azana salon &amp; spa this morning, shooting at women and chasing one out into the parking lot before she escaped, the journal-sentinel reports. Of the four injured women, one is undergoing surgery and is in critical condition; the others are in stable condition or better. Meanwhile, scary eyewitness accounts are coming in, including one from a bystander who saw a woman running outside the building: \" she was screaming, yelling, crying, hysterical, \" he said. \" she was pleading for help.

        "summary": "A michigan town so small it doesn't have a mcdonald's or a walmart is the setting for a dark triple-murder mystery involving drugs, love-fueled jealousy, and a burned-out car, all outlined in the detroit free press. The brutal killings of heather aldrich, her sister carrie nelson, and nelson's boyfriend jody hutchinson — all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated — and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out suv in the woods was linked back to aldrich's relationship with kenneth brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy manistique drug dealer, and his friend garry cordell, who tried to tell brunke that aldrich, the object of brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from brunke ostensibly meant to lure aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to brunke's house, along with nelson and hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first cordell and his girlfriend, marietta carlson, confessed they and brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, carlson died while in custody, and cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: he and carlson had committed all the murders themselves and brunke hadn't been present ( though he says brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims ' bodies in it ). What some believe: brunke may have paid off cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \" one man shall die so that the other may live. \" cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per wluc; brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced jan. 21.

They uncovered what the cbc labels a \" dodo whodunit. \" though scientists had assumed the dodo kept at oxford university museum of natural history died of natural causes, inside its mummified skull were 20 to 30 \" metallic high-density particles \" that left no doubt how the male bird met its end: \" he was shot in the back of the head with a shotgun, \" williams says, adding \" we could be looking at the first examples of lead shots ever used to hunt game birds. \" now begins the search for the culprit: museum director paul smith says a chemical analysis of the lead pellets will hopefully reveal \" what country the shot was made in so we could then determine who killed the dodo. \" the oxford specimen — the most complete dodo to be found and the only one to contain soft tissue and viable dna — was previously thought to be from a dodo displayed in london in 1638 before its natural death, per the telegraph. \" was it shot in the uk? more likely, was it shot in the mauritius and then transferred to the uk? was it shot for food on a ship? \" williams wonders, per live science.

Al-rimi also claims 25 people died in the raid, noting \" dozens of americans were killed and wounded, \" per the ap. The us military has said one navy seal died and three others were wounded. A white house official tells nbc that trump approved the raid after defense secretary james mattis and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph dunford told him al-rimi's capture would be a \" game changer. \" however, an official tells cnn that al-rimi was not essential to the mission, which officials believed would lead to him one way or another.

The fbi says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the new york times reports. The devices — which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the elizabeth station — will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in new york city and elsewhere in new jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: elizabeth mayor christian bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, nj.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \" if that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people, \" the mayor says. The ap reports that thousands of amtrak and nj transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays monday. Nbc new york reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the new york devices and those found in new jersey. Cnn reports that there is now an increased security presence in new york city not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the united nations general assembly. A law enforcement source tells cbs that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the manhattan blast — which ny gov. Andrew cuomo calls \" obviously an act of terrorism \" — and the device that exploded before a new jersey race to benefit marines and sailors early saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in elizabeth, but he is \" extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt. \" an official close to the investigation tells reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low — but",

        "summary": "An earthquake struck wyoming two years ago that made little sense, scientifically speaking — but experts seem closer to solving the mystery, the bbc reports. Called the wind river earthquake, it hit with 4.7 magnitude in an area that rarely sees such seismic power. Hardly surprising, since the wind river area has little tectonic-plate movement that would normally trigger such an earthquake. But a new study in earth and planetary science letters says the quake may not have originated with tectonic plates grinding against each other at all. The wind river earthquake may have started deeper, in what the bbc calls \" the earth's hotter and more viscous mantle. \" such a quake might be caused by crust falling into the mantle, which lies between the earth's higher crust and deeper core. These deeper quakes remain \" a highly controversial topic, \" the scientists write, but this one \" occurred well within the mantle, and likely over 20 km [ 12.4 miles ] deeper than the base of the crust. \" if true, the finding makes the wind river earthquake one of the three deepest ever recorded in the area. Still, some things don't fit: while such deep quakes can occur in volcanic regions, when fluid or magma flows in the earth's mantle, they usually affect a smaller area; the wind river quake ruptured nearly 11 million square feet, notes geology in motion. And wind river is noticeably far from the nearest volcanic region. So what's up? perhaps the mantle was so brittle that it failed and triggered the quake, say researchers, who admit that the causes remain debatable.

        "summary": "A ship's chaplain in the 1740s wrote of sailors ' gums that would grow out of control until they protruded from the mouth and rotted away, leaving a horrific case of bad breath, the bbc reports. So it turns out that not only was scurvy once incredibly dangerous, it was also super gross. Real clear science reports that approximately 2 million sailors died from scurvy, which is caused by a lack of vitamin c, between 1500 and 1800. During his voyage across the pacific, magellan lost 80 % of his crew to the disease called \" the plague of the sea, \" according to the bbc. One historian says scurvy killed more sailors than battle, storms, shipwrecks, and other diseases combined. And, it wasn't a pleasant way to go, either. Scurvy starts with lethargy before causing achy joints, swollen limbs, and loose teeth, according to real clear science. From there, sufferers get swollen gums, bad breath, and bruising. The skin turns yellow, then black, just before sufferers die from internal hemorrhaging. The tragic part is scurvy is ridiculously easy to cure. Real clear science reports someone on the brink of death from the disease could be saved by eating one-fifth of an orange every day for a week. Alas, doctors of the time didn't know what vitamins were, and ships weren't exactly built to store fresh fruit. The disease is mostly gone now, but a post at phys.org notes that nasa scientists are using the lessons learned to ensure astronauts get the vitamins they need to stay healthy in space. ( is it possible kids are getting too many vitamins? )",

            "Denver ( ap ) — a man who lives near oprah winfrey's new property above telluride, colorado, is suing her for allegedly blocking access to hiking trails open to neighbors for decades. Retired physicist charles d. Goodman claims winfrey's yellow brick road company, the property's former owners and the town of mountain village made a secret deal to close access to the trails that cut across the land purchased for $ 10.9 million in march. The denver post ( http://bit.ly/1v9yiqq ) reported thursday that the former owners, hoyt and carol barnett, asked for a correction to property records shortly before selling the land. Goodman claims that erased easements allowing residents of nearby homes to use the trails. Mountain village denies the accusation. Town community development director chirs hawkins said the correction only cleared up ambiguities and that the town and winfrey's team want to continue to allow trail access. In a written statement, yellow brick road spokeswoman wendy luckenbill said the company will continue to work with the neighbors ensure \" reasonable \" access for neighbors over portions of the land. The trails were established in 1989 after negotiations between goodman and the u.s. Forest service, which owned the land at the time. Winfrey plans to build a mansion and guest home on the property starting this summer. Plans for the homes haven't been submitted yet but the project will require building a bridge over a ski run and",
            "Katherine heigl once had an extremely promising career, starring on \"grey's anatomy \" and in a number of ( shitty ) rom-coms, but she hasn't been able to get a job recently thanks to the terrible reputation she and her manager mom have for their diva-like demands. I don't think her latest headline-making stunt is going to win her any fans — she's suing duane reade drugstores for six million dollars because they tweeted the above photo. I guess her argument is that they used her image to promote their stores without her permission and without paying her, which isn't okay because she is \"a highly successful television and motion picture actress, producer and celebrity \" in \"high demand. \" record scratch. Have a stadium full of seats, katie heigl. Highly successful tv and movie actresses don't need to sue drug store chains because they tweeted a photo.

That amounts to each of the 52 cheerleaders getting $ 2,500 per season worked and $ 400 per photo shoot. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. New york state sen. Diane savino, per the new york post, cheered the settlement, calling on the nfl to \" develop uniform rules … to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve. \" nfl teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, cnn notes. In the case of the flight crew, krystal c.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $ 150 per game and $ 100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $ 3.77 per hour. Throw in hair, makeup, and transportation expenses and \" the hourly rate goes below $ 1.50 an hour, \" says the cheerleaders ' attorney. The flight crew isn't alone: cheerleaders have taken to the courts to seek higher pay from the cincinnati bengals ( tentative agreement reached ), tampa bay buccaneers ( settled for $ 825,000 ), oakland raiders ( settled for $ 1.25 million ), and the buffalo bills ( class-action suit on the horizon ).",

But the new york times reports that driskill now faces serious allegations, from drinking on the job to failing to show up at a delivery because he was sleeping with another patient at the time, and his license has been suspended as a result. The new mexico medical board confronted driskill with the accusations, which also include neglecting other patients who were in labor and writing \" inappropriate notations of a personal nature into certain patient medical charts, \" but as of last week, the prosecutor for the board reached an agreement with driskill that could allow him to start practicing again if it's approved by the board next month. The drama has been the talk of the town — and beyond. Cosmopolitan theorized in a headline, \" this might be the worst doctor ever, \" and britain's daily mail, not surprisingly, covered the salacious story from a continent away. The story \" had me wondering if he was drunk on the job when he did my three kids, \" says one hobbs resident. The trouble started when driskill, 42, who is married with four kids, was fired from premier ob/gyn in august for allegedly being intoxicated while working and keeping a \" personal cache of alcohol \" in his office, as well as allegedly sleeping with patients. But the claims seem strange to people like dr. Jose garcia, a pediatrician who's worked closely with driskill and who says he's a \" health nut \" whom garcia has never seen drink at social gatherings. No criminal charges have been filed.

In fact, wkmg reports that auction site united gun group actually had two auctions going — a fake one open to the public destined to attract pranksters like \" john smith, \" and a closed one made up of pre-qualified bidders. \" i would like to thank and give the glory to god for a successful auction that has raised funds for several worthy causes, \" zimmerman said in a statement addressed to \" fellow patriots. \" the trayvon martin foundation declined to comment. Ugg tweeted that zimmerman is \" in the process of vetting several offers and verifying funds, \" adding, \" our part in this process is over and we are going to get back to business as usual. \" the site, though, is taking plenty of heat for facilitating the auction. \" i hope you enjoy your time with the devil in hell, \" reads a representative tweet. Zimmerman's efforts to auction the 9mm pistol have not gone smoothly. Another site, gunbroker.com, backed out. And the fiirst attempt attracted several joke bids, such as the $ 65 million offered by \" weedlord bonerhitler. \" ( in a recent interview, an unrepentant zimmerman said martin's mother and father were bad parents who \" didn't raise their son right. \" )",

It's the first discovery of a new structure in the monument since the 19th century, and it came by using muography, which can pick up on changes in density within rock. What was found, the bbc reports, isn't being called a \" chamber, \" and it explains why: also known as khufu's pyramid, the structure contains voids that are believed to have been incorporated to bolster the structural integrity of the pyramid. While three muon technologies confirmed its existence, \" we don't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined... [ or ] made by one structure or several successive structures, \" says mehdi tayoubi. It sits above the pyramid's \" most striking \" chamber, the grand gallery, a corridor that links the queen's and king's chambers. An archaeologist who reviewed the work says it's possible the void was intended to \" protect the very narrow roof \" of the gallery, though others contend that for the cavity to effectively have that function, it would need to be smaller. The guardian notes the pharaoh khufu's mummy is missing, but a harvard egyptologist tells npr the idea that the cavity is \" a hidden room and the king's body is inside... None of that is responsible speculation at the moment. \" the team next hopes to get approval to drill a 1.2-inch hole that a robot could fit into.

One witness said the pursuit ended when a police cruiser hit the tractor head-on. The impact was strong enough to make the police vehicle's airbags deploy. The witness reported that immediately after, the officer who had been driving the wrecked cruiser used a taser to subdue the tractor driver. Another witness reported the male suspect was apprehended and placed in an ambulance. \" it could've definitely been a lot worse, for sure, \" he said. The second witness also described the actions of the officer who rammed their vehicle into the tractor, ending the pursuit. \" him doing that and going for it -- that takes a lot of dedication, \" he said. Police said officers did not fire their guns. Police have not released the suspect's identity as the investigation is ongoing. Fox31 and channel 2 have reached out to the dpd for details regarding the circumstances of the chase. This story will be updated as authorities make more information available.

            "A local hospital is treating two police officers who sustained injuries on friday night after a dramatic pursuit of a stolen tractor swerving through downtown denver, officials reported. The tractor, which was pulling some kind of farm equipment, struck several cars and buildings as it caromed through streets, denver police spokesman tyrone campbell said later at a press conference. More than a dozen police cars and a helicopter pursued the vehicle. Only when a police cruiser rammed it did the tractor stop."

It requires nine mostly southern states to get federal permission when they want to change voting rules, and antonin scalia and others suggested the measure is no longer necessary, reports the new york times. Scalia called it a \" perpetuation of racial entitlement, \" anthony kennedy wanted to know how long alabama had to live \" under the trusteeship of the united states government, \" and chief justice john roberts wondered whether people in the south were more racist than those in the north. The court's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary, with stephen breyer saying the \" old disease \" of racism, along with the desire to keep minorities from voting, remains. If the court strikes down the act, it would likely require congress to come up with a new formula for it, but both the times and scotusblog think it's unlikely that would be politically possible.",

In front of a rowdy crowd, real nobel winners handed out the awards to those who had the year's oddest research. Winners also received $ 10 trillion — in a single zimbabwean banknote ( us value: less than $ 1 ). Some highlights from the annual ceremony at harvard university, which was presented by the annals of improbable research: \" goat man \" tom thwaites wore his goat legs to the awards ceremony.he tells the bbc that he gained a \" goat buddy \" during his time in the alps — but there were some tense moments. \" i was just sort of walking around, you know, chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realized that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which i hadn't kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and i think i was about to get in a fight, \" he says. Thwaites shared the biology prize with charles foster, another brit who has spent time living in the wild as, among other things, a badger, an otter, and a fox. Science reports that the medicine prize went to a team of neurologists and psychologists, who, with the help of video cameras, mirrors, and volunteers injected with a chemical that causes a mild itch, discovered that scratching the left side of your body will relieve an itch on the right side if you're looking in a mirror at the time. A japanese team won the perception prize with a study published as \" perceived size and perceived distance of targets viewed from between the legs: evidence for proprioceptive theory. \" their research involved bending over and looking at things from between their legs to see if they looked any different. Egyptian urologist ahmed shafik was posthumously awarded the reproduction prize for his research on how wearing trousers of polyester, cotton, or wool affected the sex lives of rats. The rats that wore polyester had the biggest drop in sexual activity, notes the guardian. This year's ig nobel in chemistry went to volkswagen, for \" solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested. \" ( previous ig nobels have gone to scientists who swallowed parboiled dead shrews and a researcher who allowed bees to sting every part of his anatomy. )",

Air navigation services lost track of the swiftair md-83 about 50 minutes after takeoff from ougadougou, the capital of burkina faso, at 1: 55am gmt ( 9: 55pm eastern last night ), the official algerian news agency says. That means that flight 5017 had been missing for hours before the news was made public. Swiftair, a private spanish airline, confirms it has not been possible to make contact with the plane. Swiftair says the plane carrying 110 passengers and six crew left burkina faso for algiers at 1: 17am gmt today, but had not arrived at the scheduled time of 5: 10am gmt. But, as reuters puts it, conflicting information has been given about timing, \" adding to confusion about the fate of the flight and where it might be. \" the plane was over gao, mali, when contact was lost, and a diplomat in mali says there was a powerful sandstorm overnight in the north part of the country, over which the plane would likely have flown. The burkina faso transport minister says the flight asked to change course at 1: 38am gmt because of a storm, according to reuters.",

A rare strain of it produces a toxin called epsilon, and the researches found that this toxin attacks the brain in the same way that ms does. \"to me, if you were going to design a trigger for this disease, this would really fit the mold really well, \" says a researcher at weill cornell medical college in new york.
