        "summary": "A texas girl whose 16th birthday present almost killed her has been awarded $ 760,000 — more than $ 200 for each of the approximately 3,500 feet she plunged after her parachute malfunctioned. Makenzie wethington, now 19, suffered internal injuries as well as a broken pelvis, lumbar spine, and shoulder blade in the jan. 25, 2014, skydive in oklahoma, reports the dallas morning news. After a negligence lawsuit, a judge ordered robert swainson, owner of the now-closed pegasus air sports business, to pay wethington $ 400,000 for physical suffering, $ 350,000 for mental suffering, and $ 10,000 for future medical expenses. Wethington, whose lawsuit alleged that she wasn't given proper training and that she was given the wrong parachute for her skill level, told the judge that after she jumped from the plane, her lines became tangled and she blacked out as she spun out of control, the oklahoman reports. The next thing she remembers is waking up in a hospital bed. Swainson, who now lives in the uk, argued that she \" injured herself \" by panicking \" when things did not go exactly as expected. \" after the accident, the us parachuting association raised the minimum age to 18, a limit that was already in place in most states. ( these skydivers had to jump early to escape a plane crash. )",

            "Makenzie's father, joe wethington, made the 200-mile drive to oklahoma with her and was the first to jump from the plane that morning.

Wethington said that when his daughter jumped, her parachute opened only partially and she began to spin toward the ground. Swainson, the chief instructor at pegasus for more than three decades, disputed that, saying her parachute opened completely and that it had a slight turn — something he said she could have easily corrected using techniques from his five-hour class before the jump. Swainson said he was unable to jump out of the plane to help — another sky diver got cold feet and protocol was for him to remain on the plane — but said the teen was receiving instructions during the jump through a radio in her helmet. \" there are other things you can do to stop the turn, but she didn't do anything, \" he said. \" i think she just panicked. \"",

The owner of a closed skydiving business was ordered to pay the judgment. U.s. District judge timothy d.

The judge also awarded $ 10,000 for future medical expenses. A negligence lawsuit, filed by wethington's mother, accused the owner of pegasus air sports, robert swainson, of failing to properly train wethington for the jump.

According to the ap, petty officer 1st class gregory seerden was arrested april 3 in san diego, where he is stationed, following a three-month investigation. The felony charges against the 31-year-old member of seal team one weren't unsealed until this week. The investigation into seerden started in january after a woman accused him of raping her while they were drinking on a navy base in virginia, the los angeles times reports. The woman says she remembers telling seerden to stop and informed a gate sentry about the alleged rape afterward. Seerden has been charged with four felonies related to child pornography and child sex assault. He's facing a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison. The images on seerden's phone were discovered during the investigation into the alleged rape. Authorities say they include dozens of images of prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts, including one involving a dog. There are also four videos showing a man, allegedly seerden, masturbating next to a sleeping child, who appears to be 5 or 6 years old, and touching her in a sexual way. Photos on the phone show seerden reading a book to the girl and other children. An investigation into the alleged rape of the woman in january is ongoing, and no charges have been filed in that case.",

In 1950, computer scientist alan turing suggested a test which, in its current form, requires a computer to \" trick \" 30 % of judges into believing it's human.

For more than three hours on tuesday, president-elect donald trump's pick to run the education department handled tough questions on school choice, charters and the future of the nation's schools from the senate committee that handles education. In her opening remarks, devos made clear she doesn't think traditional public schools are a good fit for every child. \" parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning meets the needs of every child, \" she said. \" and they know other options exist, whether magnet, virtual, charter, home, faith-based or any other combination. \" the problem,"

        "summary": "Financial writer andrew ross sorkin of the new york times has set off much chatter today with a scathing column about facebook's ipo that pins most of the blame on company cfo david ebersman. Sorkin finds it odd that the 42-year-old has largely escaped mention even though he played a huge role in setting the share price and the number of shares offered. \" ebersman appears to have badly misjudged the demand for facebook's ipo, \" writes sorkin. The result has been a staggering $ 50 billion loss in market value in just three months — and yet very little accountability. Two responses with different takes: mark cuban, gizmodo: \" just ridiculous, \" he writes of blaming the cfo. If investors who lost money ( as cuban did ) are looking to blame anyone, they should look in the mirror, not toward ebersman. He raised about $ 10 billion for his company in the ipo. In other words, he did his job. But investors — or their brokers — who were looking for an easy payday failed to do theirs. Henry blodget, business insider: blaming ebersman is convenient but \" grossly unfair, \" he writes. That's like blaming the housing crash on people who sold their homes at the top of the market in 2007. Sorry, investors, but \" when you choose to participate in this completely voluntary activity, and it doesn't work out the way you had hoped, you have only yourself and your advisers to blame. \"",

Marcus heaney's home sits across the alley, and the kirkbys have been battling it out in court with him since heaney registered the strip of land as his own in 2012, dismantled the fence, and ordered his neighbors to \" make no further use of it, whether for parking or otherwise, \" reports aol money. The kirkbys responded with their own paperwork claiming rights to the land, and the courts have on several occasions ruled in favor of the kirkbys. This latest — and final — win in the court of appeal leaves heaney with nothing but a $ 370,000 legal bill, reports the telegraph. \" it would be a sad day for the law if the courts were to attach too much legal significance to acts which pass for nothing between good neighbors, \" heaney's attorney said in a sort of warning. \" adjoining owners would have to be constantly on the watch in case their rights were being infringed. \" aol notes that brits who can demonstrate they've occupied unregistered land for a period of 12 years can make an ownership claim.

Huffpost reports that 61-year-old desiree fairooz is on trial this week after being arrested by us capitol police for the jan. 10 incident. Fairooz, a longtime activist who once confronted condoleezza rice with \" bloodied \" hands, burst into laughter at the hearing when sen. Richard shelby proclaimed that sessions'record of \" treating all americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented. \" fairooz was sitting in the back of the room, and shelby either didn't hear her laughter or took it in stride, as he continued his speech seemingly unfazed. But the government says fairooz engaged in \" disorderly and disruptive conduct \" designed to interrupt the proceedings. \" the federal government is literally prosecuting someone for laughing, \" snarks vox. Katherine coronado, the capitol cop who arrested fairooz, told the court monday fairooz had laughed \" very loudly, \" causing people to turn around. A fellow code pink member tells huffpost she thinks fairooz's laughter was a spontaneous reaction to shelby's words and not premeditated. Supporters think she had a point, given that sessions lost a federal judgeship in 1986 over allegations that he made racist remarks and his past criticism of civil rights enforcement, notes a post at new york. Fairooz could face six months in prison and a fine of up to $ 500 if convicted. Also on trial are two other code pink members, who dressed in kkk outfits in mock support of sessions.

Researchers found hemocyanin is efficient in a range of temperatures and, as one puts its, undergoes \" functional changes to improve the supply of oxygen to tissue at sub-zero temperatures. \" studying three octopus species, including two from warmer climates for comparison, the researchers found that all pump hemolymph, a blood-like fluid that contains high levels of hemocyanin, reports discovery. The octopus in antarctica, however, has as much as 40 % more hemocyanin than the other two species, which puts it among the highest ever reported. And because it transports oxygen between the animal's gills and tissue even more efficiently when temps are above freezing, it's able to tolerate warmer temps associated with climate change far better than other animals in the area, not to mention hang out in relatively warmer shallow waters, unlike most octopuses.

The information's sources say that before the tempe crash, uber had been \" racing to meet an end-of-year internal goal \" of allowing customers in the area to ride in its self-driving vehicles with no backup driver present. The company is now banned from testing the vehicles in arizona. The \" death provides a tragic reminder that companies shouldn't get too far ahead of themselves, \" writes timothy lee at ars technica. \" getting fully self-driving cars on the road is a worthwhile goal. But making sure that's done safely is more important. \"",

            "As part of its ongoing preliminary internal investigation, uber has determined that its self-driving software did detect the pedestrian who was killed in a recent crash in arizona but did not react immediately, according to the information. The software detected elaine herzberg, a 47-year-old woman who was hit by a semi-autonomous volvo operated by uber, as she was crossing the street but decided not to stop right away. That's in part because the technology was adjusted to be less reactive or slower to react to objects in its path that may be \"false positives�? — such as a plastic bag. Both uber and the national transportation safety board launched investigations into the crash to determine whether the software was at fault. Both investigations are ongoing.

At least two of them were killed in protest outside the court, reports reuters. Prime minister hwang kyo-ahn is now south korea's acting president until an election is held, which, by law, must happen on or before may 9. A spokesman said park, who could now face criminal charges over a corruption scandal, will not be leaving the blue house residence friday. A roundup of coverage: with park's center-right party tainted by scandal, most analysts expect the primaries of the country's liberal democratic party to determine south korea's next president, the ap reports. Front-runners moon jae-in and an heejung have differing views on north korea and the us, with moon more open to dialogue with pyongyang and to challenging the us over the thaad anti-missile system. Prosecutors say the case for removing park from office for her role in the corruption scandal could not have been clearer, but her lawyers have vowed to fight on, the washington post reports. So have her supporters, who tend to be older, more conservative south koreans. The new york times describes the removal of park as part of the backlash against the old order once represented by her father, who ruled as a dictator from 1961 until his assassination in1979. \" her removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated south korea for decades, \" says ahn byong-jin, of the global academy for future civilizations at seoul's kyung hee university. Reuters reports that restaurants acrosssouth korea are selling out of chicken as people order chicken dishes to celebrate the removal of the leader with the derogatory nickname \" chicken guen-hye. \" al jazeera has a day-by-day look at the events that led to park's stunning downfall, starting with the raising of suspicions last summer about organizations connected to her longtime friend choi soon-sil. The bbc reports that the predicted leftward shift in south korean politics could see the reopening of a joint venture industrial complex just across the border in north korea — and could complicate relations with the us when it is trying to isolate pyongyang internationally.",

        "summary": "A mysterious, century-old shipwreck found 40 years ago off israel's coast has been tentatively revealed to be a priceless find: the long-lost ship of a french baron, say haifa university archaeologists. Baron edmond james de rothschild — who moved raw materials from france to a glass factory he constructed in tantura, near the jewish settlement he founded at zichron yaakov — used three ships in the late 19th century, two of which were later sold. The fate of the third had been lost to history, but perhaps no longer. \" the ship we have found is structurally consistent with the specifications of the baron's ships, carried a similar cargo, and sailed and sank during the right period, \" researchers tell haaretz. Carbon-14 dating of the vessel's wood initially dated the two-masted wreck to 1660 to 1960, a huge range. But when researchers returned to the ship in 2008, they found rope that helped establish a late 19th-century date. Its contents — including pots, earthenware, ceramic tiles, roof tiles, barrels, and crates — also provided clues. Manufacturer markings from six french factories in operation in the late 1800s were identified; the motif of one company, apparently in business from 1889 to 1897, further focused the time period. The kicker came with one particular pot containing barium sulfate, used to boost the transparency and shine of glass, per phys.org; baron de rothschild built a glass factory at tantura to produce wine bottles for wineries in zichron yaakov. Researchers admit the wreck could \" be one of dozens of similar ships that plied the coasts of palestine during this period, \" but they tell livescience it is \" very probable \" that it belonged to the baron as \" there seem to be more than a few items that connect it with zichron yaakov, with the glass factory at tantura, and with the baron's ships. \" ( some 1,000 shipwrecks haunt this sea. )",

It felt the appellate court gave this too little attention.

The high court considers that another piece of undervalued evidence. Sex game: the high court resurrected the theory that kercher was killed during an \" erotic game \" that spun out of control. It wants the new trial to more carefully examine the theory, along with the notion that rudy guede — the only person still jailed for the slaying — didn't act alone. Fine, says sollecito's attorney. \" if there was an erotic game then there needs to be a search for the other people involved, who are certainly not raffaele sollecito and amanda knox. \" big picture: the high court \" said the judges in the appeals case had underestimated the evidence against the two accused, assessing clues one by one and not stepping back to view the big picture, \" says reuters.",

Where carson has made the most inroads in recent weeks: among women ( where he's now leads trump ) and with more conservative gopers, such as tea partiers, and evangelicals, where cbs says he pulled 20 points ahead of trump. Trump is still holding his lead with moderate republicans and people without a college degree, and cbs points out that trump nation is much more solid in their candidate than carson's supporters: more than half say their minds are made up, while only 19 % of carson's supporters are ready to pull the lever. Meanwhile, a third poll out of iowa, this time from monmouth university, shows carson roundly trouncing trump with a 14-point lead: 32 % to 18 %, a nine-point gain for carson and a five-point loss for trump since late august, per the hill. Trump, for his part, said tuesday on msnbc's morning joe that he's curious to see how carson holds up to new frontrunner scrutiny. ( maybe iron mike's endorsement will put trump back on top. )",

After around-the-clock work reverted what was a massive sinkhole into a driveable section of road in fukuoka, japan, in just a week, the road seems to be sinking once more.

The guardian reported earlier this month that after the hole — which opened up on nov. 8 — was filled with roughly 220,000 cubic feet of sand and cement, the mayor proclaimed the ground underneath 30 times stronger than before. Local officials now suggest the substance used to fill the hole potentially compressed the soil at the hole's base, hence the new drop. Cnn reports mayor soichiro takashima posted an apology on facebook for not explaining more sinking was possible. The road is currently open.

But that's just the beginning of a sad tale out of florida: police say kathleen steele's 6-year-old son beat his 13-day-old sister to death monday while his mom was inside a cellphone repair shop in st. Petersburg. The boy told officers that he punched his sister in the face, flipped her upside down, banged her head on the ceiling, then let her fall to the floor, reports the washington post — all because she wouldn't stop crying inside the van. Sheriff bob gualtieri blames steele, who described her ivf treatments on a reality show, and \" is, by all accounts, ill-equipped to have a baby. \" when steele returned to the van, she continued to run errands and called a neighbor who is a nurse only when she discovered her daughter blue and cold two hours later, police tell ktla. The nurse called 911. By that point, the newborn looked like she'd \" been pummeled, \" with a skull that was essentially \" mush, \" gualtieri says. As emergency personnel tried to revive the child, gualtieri says steele put away groceries. Authorities say the newborn suffered a minor brain bleed when she was days old — she reportedly fell out of a car seat — but child protective services found no evidence of abuse. Steele, who police say wanted to have more kids, per the tampa bay times, is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child. Her sons are now in foster homes.",

Hassan, a 7-year-old syrian boy living in germany, was born with a condition called epidermolysis bullosa that prevented the outer layer of skin from binding to the inner layer and left him with painful blisters starting when he was just a few days old, npr reports. After skin grafts from the boy's father failed, doctors thought there was no hope, but they managed to save him with a treatment devised by scientists in italy. A team led by michele de luca of the university of modena repaired dna from a sample of the boy's skin and was able to grow whole new sheets of epidermis. In two operations, the italian team was able to graft the healthy skin onto the boy, who was covered in bandages and only had patches of healthy skin on his head and left leg, the guardian reports, noting 80 % of his skin was gone. The team had never attempted the procedure on such a large scale before, but the transplant was a success. Two years later, the boy is living a normal life, attending school, and doesn't need to use medications or ointments. \" hassan feels like a normal person now, he plays, he's being active, he's enjoying his life, and he's not the way he was before, \" his father says, per the bbc.

But did you know about plate-reading cameras? few people do, and that's a worry for the aclu, which says the cameras are infringing on our civil liberties. Unlike the speed and red-light cameras, which are activated only when someone violates a traffic law, plate cameras photograph every license plate that goes by. Vehicles are instantly ided then checked against cars associated with crimes, the washington post reports. The problem, says the aclu, is that the license plate info is being stored, creating huge databases of motorists and where they travel — even though more than 99 % of those recorded are innocent. Aclu privacy lawyer catherine crump calls the cameras \" the most pervasive system of location tracking that people haven't heard of, \" per nbc news. Despite the massive amounts of data, authorities rarely record a \" hit, \" according to an aclu review of 600 local and state police departments. Maryland, for instance, collected data on 85 million plates last year, but only one in 500 matched with a criminal offense, and 97 % of those were for minor violations ( say, an emissions test violation ). Just 47 per million were potentially serious crimes.

So mayor charlie hales ' office is trying to get creative and think outside the standard dorm shelter box: the current top idea under consideration is providing micro-homes for minimal rent to help people get off the streets and into jobs. A task force meets next week to \" assess the viability of using tiny homes as a potential for housing houseless people, \" the director of strategic initiatives tells time, adding that he hopes the first homes will be ready as soon as february 2015.

The price tag: $ 20,000. Each person would have roughly 100 square feet of living space, with the pilot program putting up to 10 structures on four city lots.

Police say that peter hamilton was taking his yellow lab for a walk on sunday morning when he heard a woman's cries for help, reports the cbc. She had made it out onto the porch of a home but was bound with duct tape and cloth, shaking, bruised all over, and naked from the waist down. \" she said, ' i've been kidnapped and i've been held for five days in this house, ' \" recalls hamilton. What's more, she told him her abductor was still inside. Hamilton had left his phone home, but he knew he could neither carry the woman nor leave her there. So he set about trying to free her from the restraints with his only tool, a pair of nail clippers. \" i knew there was an element of danger, \" the tech manager for a media company tells the hamilton spectator. \" but i just felt that i could not leave this woman alone. \" he was right about the danger: as he worked on the restraints, the alleged abductor appeared at the door, took in the situation — and then, to hamilton's relief, fled from the home. Police later arrested rejean hermel perron, 43, and charged him kidnapping, forcible confinement, and assault. They say he kept the 27-year-old woman against her will for five days, subjecting her to \" ritualistic \" sexual abuse that suggests she wasn't his first victim, reports the national post. Authorities say she is a sex worker who initially agreed to come to perron's residence, but felt uncomfortable upon arriving and didn't want to go inside. Perron then forced her in at gunpoint, say police. She is out of the hospital and recovering. ( in the us, a pair of young heroes stopped a kidnapping in its tracks. )",

That's all thanks to \" the watcher, \" an anonymous sender of creepy and ominous letters to the new residents of 657 boulevard. Except \" residents \" is a misnomer: derek and maria broaddus and their three kids never actually moved in, having been so spooked by the contents of the letters, the first of which arrived as they were having renovations done. In a lengthy piece for the cut, reeves wiedeman shares extensive excerpts from the letters, like this: \" will the young blood play in the basement? or are they too afraid to go down there alone. I would [ be ] very afraid if i were them. It is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream. \" wiedeman traces in great detail the ultimately fruitless hunt to unmask the watcher: recounting clues ( one letter referenced an easel on a porch that could only be seen from the backyard or next door ); the neighbors the family suspected; the former fbi agents, security firm, and forensic linguist they hired to analyze the letters and their handwriting; and the one small bit of dna evidence they had. The story simultaneously tracks their quest to get out from under the burden of their purchase, which they were unable to sell; an attempt to raze the home and divide the lot into two smaller ones was prohibited by the town's planning board after an outcry from residents. Some suspected a scam, lawsuits went nowhere, and the renter they finally found received, you guessed it, a letter from the watcher.

The move, expected to be announced tuesday, may also further divide a splintered republican party, reports politico. While gop lawmakers including sen. Lindsey graham and rep. Steve king support an end to protections for immigrants brought to the us illegally as children, king says any delay allowing leaders to \" push amnesty is republican suicide. \" other republicans, meanwhile, are starkly against killing daca altogether. Sen. James lankford, for one, notes americans should \" not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents. \" republican sens. Jerry moran, orrin hatch, and jeff flake have also expressed their support for daca, per nbc news and the washington post, while paul ryan and mitch mcconnell have said they are sympathetic to \" dreamers. \" trump's decision to dismantle daca, after a six-month period allowing congress to come up with a solution, is expected to be announced by jeff sessions at an 11am briefing tuesday at the white house, reports the new york times. Several house republicans tell politico one possible deal in response would involve codifying daca in exchange for funds to start trump's proposed border wall. But republicans will also need democratic support to raise the debt ceiling this month, and dems could make codifying daca a condition of their support.",

Around the country, xbox devotees are lining up for the new system, which, like its rival, the playstation 4, is expected to be in extremely short supply, usa today reports.

Sony says it sold more than one million ps4s in 24 hours when it launched last friday, and xbox is expected to rival that. Analysts say sony's console, which costs just $ 399 to xbox's $ 499, is the favorite to dominate the cycle. But xbox one has the more ambitious strategy of being a living room-dominating media hub. \" the concept of running your television programming through your xbox one is an exciting feature, \" says one analyst. Microsoft also dampened buzz with early plans to ban used games, and force users to be online at all times; it's backed off both, though you will need to go online for a \" day one \" firmware update, gamespot reports. But despite all the hype, the mit technology review wonders if this will be the last big console war, noting the \" historical downward trend in console sales. \" and wired says it's fine to wait if you're not sold on either console yet; both launch with 22 titles, but \" there's just nothing to really get excited about \" in either slate.",

        "summary": "President trump says it's time to \" move forward \" with moscow, but the new york times is out with a front-page story on another meeting between his aides and a russian figure during the campaign. This one took place two weeks after trump clinched the gop nomination and was arranged by donald trump jr. He asked jared kushner and paul manafort to join him as he met in trump tower with natalia veselnitskaya, a russian lawyer with ties to the kremlin. Some details: the significance: it's \" the first confirmed private meeting between a russian national and members of mr. Trump's inner circle during the campaign, \" per the times. It's also the first one known to involve trump's son. Similar take: it \" adds to the roster of curious private meetings between trump allies and russians during and after the campaign, \" says the washington post. Or no significance? \"it was a nothing meeting, \" trump chief of staff reince priebus said on abc news, per politico. He said it lasted about 20 minutes and characterized it as a \" big nothing burger, \" adding that \" talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the american people like adoption, is not unusual. \" the subject: both trump jr. And veselnitskaya say they discussed a russian adoption program halted by the russian government. This dovetails with something called the magnitsky act, passed by congress in 2012, which essentially blacklists russians accused of humans rights abuses. In retaliation for that act, vladimir putin ended the adoption program, which had been popular with americans. \"nothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign, \" said veselnitskaya, who has been working to get the magnitsky act rescinded. False pretenses? a lawyer for president trump said veselnitskaya and her translator \" misrepresented who they were \" in setting up the meeting. And trump jr. Said he \" was not told the name of the person i would be meeting with beforehand. \"",

        "summary": "Two of seven patients infected by a \" superbug \" at an la hospital have died, and now an 18-year old is battling to keep from being the third. According to the ap, the teen had gone to ronald reagan ucla medical center late last year to undergo a procedure that used a duodenoscope — now believed to be one of two contaminated with the superbug — to examine his pancreas. \" shortly after the procedure, he became gravely ill, and it was determined by the physicians at ucla that he had contracted the cre infection, \" lawyer pete kaufman tells abc news. But the los angeles times reports the teen may have been infected twice: kaufman says the teen had been diagnosed with the bug in october, treated for three months, and released; he was reportedly reinfected with cre when he went back in january for a second endoscopy. Though kaufman says the boy had an \" acute illness \" before undergoing the endoscopies, a second lawyer for the family, kevin boyle, tells the ap, \" they were scoping it out, trying to see what was the matter. He had no life-threatening condition before like he does now. \" boyle framed his condition as grave; kaufman tells abc news the teen had been \" gravely, gravely ill \" but \" his prognosis at this time is guarded but optimistic. \" the teen's parents aren't miffed at ucla: they may sue the endoscope's maker for not establishing an effective cleaning process. \" because of the complexity of these scopes … they are very, very difficult to clean. The manufacturer recommendations were followed by ucla, \" a local department of public health official said, per abc news. Another 179 ucla patients were possibly exposed.",

Anyone who put 10 or more accounts into foreclosure got a $ 500 bonus, one employee said, but sometimes employees would get more modest rewards — like gift cards to target or bed bath and beyond.

Employees were told to make up fake reasons for the rejections. \" we were told to lie to customers and claim that bank of america had not received documents it had requested, \" one employee wrote. \" we were told that admitting that the bank received the documents ' would open a can of worms. ' \" underwriters would often have hundreds of outstanding applications awaiting review. Homeowners would be told their applications were \" under review \" when nothing had been done on them — or even if they'd already been rejected. \" employees who challenged or questioned the ethics of … declining modifications for false and fraudulent reasons were often fired.

The gist of the story is that the 45-year-old act is at imminent risk of being seriously watered down. That's due in part to a slew of proposed bills weakening protection for everything from gray wolves to grizzly bears, but, more significantly, to the white house's own proposal to overhaul the esa, which was unveiled last week. The push is intensifying now because republicans control not just the white house but both houses of congress, something that might not be true after the midterms. The proposal from the interior and commerce departments to change the esa is here. It would generally make it harder to add species to the protected list and easier to remove them, and the washington post takes note of a key component: for the first time, it would require officials to weigh economic ramifications in wildlife decisions. Specifically, the proposal would remove the phrase \" without reference to possible economic or other impacts \" from the original. Environmentalists are alarmed, while those in the opposite camp say the esa has gone too far in restricting the interests of developers, farmers, and the like. \" anyone who tries to do even modest reform is completely demagogued, \" complains kathleen sgamma of the western energy alliance. Still, support for the esa among the public is high across the political spectrum, at about 83 %, notes vox.",

        "summary": "The american dream isn't dead, but it's got one foot in the grave, according to new research. The washington post reports that 92 % of people born in 1940 earned more money at 30 years old than their parents did when they were the same age. Researchers say doing better than your parents is the american dream, economically speaking. But for people born in 1980, that percentage had dropped to 51, according to the wall street journal. That means barely half of today's 30-somethings are doing better than their parents. People born in the middle class and the midwest have seen the steepest declines. The new york times calls it some of the \" most eye-opening economics work in recent years, \" as well as \" deeply alarming. \" a slowing economy alone doesn't explain the drop-off, and researchers place the blame largely at the feet of growing inequality. Over the past 30-some years, nearly 70 % of income gains went to just the richest 10 % of americans. Researchers say that if inequality had stayed where it was in 1970, 80 % of today's 30-year-olds would be out-earning their parents. \" we need to have more equal growth if we want to revive the american dream, \" researcher raj chetty says. Without addressing inequality, researchers say the economy would need to grow 6 % annually to reverse these trends. Donald trump is promising to grow it by 3.8 % per year, though experts say it's more likely to be closer to 2 %. ( the american lawn, too, has seen better days. )",

That's a drop from 92 percent of children born in 1940. The fall-off is particularly steep among children born in the middle class, and for those born in several states in the industrial midwest.

Yet the data also helps point the way to some promising solutions. It begins with children who were born in 1940, less than a decade after the publication of adams's book, \"the epic of america. \" the researchers went into the project assuming that most of these children had earned more than their parents — but were surprised to learn that nearly all of them had, said david grusky, one of the researchers, also of stanford. About 92 percent of 1940 babies had higher pretax inflation-adjusted household earnings at age 30 than their parents had at the same age. ( the results were similar at older ages and for post-tax earnings. ) the few 1940 children who earned less than their parents were also, for the most part, doing just fine. They were generally earning less because they had grown up rich — children of top corporate executives, say, who became, or married,"

Using cloning techniques, scientists inserted human genes into cow embryos and implanted the embryos in mother cows. Scientists say the resulting dairy cows produced milk with \" much higher nutritional content \" than regular cow's milk, including extra fat as well as proteins that support the immune system — meaning it could be an alternative to formula for babies. The researchers aim to have the product on shelves \" in 10 years \" — but the idea is already taking heat, due to concerns about its safety for babies and for the cattle who produce it. \"there is a question about whether milk from these cows is going to be safe for humans, and it is really hard to tell that unless you do large clinical trials, \" said a rep for a watchdog group. Of the 42 genetically-modified calves born in two experiments, only 26 survived, reports the daily mail. As for how the milk tastes? \" stronger than normal milk, \" said the lead researcher.",

The two visitors were reportedly climbing on the \" statue of the two hercules \" at the historic loggia dei militi building when the large crown atop the marble sculpture broke off and fell to the ground, italy's corriere della sera paper reports, per the local.

Police managed to track down the perpetrators, though it isn't yet clear if they ' ll face any charges. The blow to this particular statue is especially painful for the city as it is considered a symbol of cremona and once sat on top of the city's gates. Created in 1700, the sculpture depicts two forms of hercules — who founded the city, according to legend, the independent reports — holding the city's emblem, a large kind of shield. It was moved to loggia dei militi on piazza del comune, a square in the center of the city, in 1962. ( a selfie-taking student broke a leg off an italian statue last year. )",

Not so happy: he wants to do it by closing the so-called \" trust fund loophole \" ( ie, vastly increasing the amount of inherited money that can be taxed ), jacking the capital gains and dividend tax rates to 28 % on those making more than $ 500,000 a year ( for context, the ap notes that's the same rate as under president reagan; it currently sits at 23.8 %, up from 15 % ), and rolling out a bevy of bank fees. In short, an administration insider tells the washington post that 99 % of the impact would fall on the nation's top 1 % of earners. How it's going to play: republicans aren't likely to trip over themselves to support the plan, though much of the party has long sought tax reform. But the administration appears to be betting that it ' ll be politically tough to explain to voters why they voted against expanded child credits or trust fund crackdowns — especially, as politico notes, some republicans have already put forward similar proposals. \" if we all focus on middle-class opportunity and try to help middle-class families, there are clearly pragmatic things that we could do that have bipartisan support, and so let's try to get them done, \" says a senior administration official.",

Jordan introduced the boys to alan sacks, producer and co-creator of welcome back kotter; he's now their manager, with malcolm's mom, annette jackson, serving as co-manager. Sacks tells the new york post that sony called after seeing one of the band's viral videos on youtube and was willing to sign the boys over the phone ( the group ultimately got flown to la, gave a private performance, and signed the deal ). If the label ends up making all five albums with the band, the boys could rake in $ 1.8 million in advances, per tmz — as long as they do their homework first. \" if their school work is not done, they don't play, \" tabatha dawkins says, adding that all three are good students.

Yes, the catechism condemns homosexuality, but gays and lesbians must still be \" accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity, \" he continued. \" religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but god in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person. \" more: his answer to the question of whether he approves of homosexuality is another question: \"'tell me, when god looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person? ' we must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being. \" he also addressed criticism that he hasn't gotten all that political, seeing as he doesn't talk much about gay marriage, birth control, or abortion. But the church's teachings on all of the above are already clear, he said, and \" it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. \" further: \" the church's pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently. We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the gospel. \" cnn notes that none of the pope's comments broke with catholic doctrine, but did signal a shift to a more accepting approach; francis himself said he wants to change the church's \" attitude, \" since it sometimes gets \" locked...

A judge awarded ross $ 8 million in damages wednesday for 10 years she was forced to clean, cook, and care for children in a kansas group that court documents are calling a cult, the new york times reports. \" they yelled at her, and generally humiliated, shamed and embarrassed her on a regular basis, \" writes judge daniel crabtree in his ruling. \" she was young, vulnerable and alone during this 10-year period. \" ross apparently moved in with female members of the united nation of islam inc at age 12, got pulled from school at age 15, and was shuttled to jobs in various states. She also lived with cult founder royall jenkins as his servant. At age 21, she bolted when a \" psychic doctor \" in the cult made her \" marry \" a polygamist, court documents say. Now she's facing a financial windfall — perhaps the highest ever in an american coerced-labor case. Ross is \" thrilled \" by the judgment, her lawyer betsy hutson tells the ap, adding that the $ 8 million is collectible because united nation of islam inc ( now called the value creators ) has \" significant properties. \" the group also has its own education system, medical system, a leader it calls \" allah in person \" ( here's his blog ), and preaches that black men are better than men and women of other races. For ross, now 26 and living with ptsd, it's all about justice: \" i mean, they took my childhood, my life and, i mean, i can't get that back, \" she says. \" so i want them to pay for that. \"",

The ap reports that iran's return to world markets is already being felt in oil-producing rivals like saudi arabia, where the stock market fell 5 % on sunday. But the markets may be overreacting: reuters notes that analysts believe it will take time for iran to adjust its infrastructure to export large amounts of oil again, though it does have at least a dozen \" very large crude carriers \" filled up and ready to sell oil.",

The australian catholic bishops ' conference also issued a statement on the decision. Wilson's resignation was the \"next chapter in a heartbreaking story of people who were sexually abused \", it said, adding that the move \"may bring some comfort to them, despite the ongoing pain they bear \". The pope's decision is the latest in a string of child abuse issues he has been forced to address in recent months.

In may, wilson became the most senior catholic cleric to be convicted of not disclosing to police abuse by another priest. He failed to report the abuse of two altar boys by james fletcher, a paedophile priest, in the 1970s. The archbishop was sentenced to 12 months in prison on 3 july and ordered to serve a minimum of six months. He immediately launched an appeal against the conviction. Calls for archbishop philip wilson to resign following conviction read more despite calls for his resignation from many quarters, wilson insisted he would not step aside until his legal options were exhausted. However, in a brief statement released at midday in rome, the vatican announced the pope had accepted wilson's resignation. The australian catholic bishops ' conference also issued a statement on the decision. Wilson's resignation was the \"next chapter in a heartbreaking story of people who were sexually abused \", it said, adding that the move \"may bring some comfort to them, despite the ongoing pain they bear \". The pope's decision is the latest in a string of child abuse issues he has been forced to address in recent months. At the weekend, francis accepted the resignation of the us cleric theodore mccarrick as cardinal after allegations of sexual abuse, including claims involving an 11-year-old boy."

The site was out of commission when we tried to visit at 4: 30 p.m., but according to russia today, it's been up and down over the past half hour or so. 1: 42 p.m.: anonymous's next target: a law firm representing frank wuterich, whose name you may recognize as the only marine convicted of a crime in the haditha massacre in iraq in 2005, and who didn't get any prison time. The website for the law firm puckett and faraj now looks a lot like that of the boston police department, with red writing on a black background and krs-one's sound of the police playing incessantly. But this attack also includes a massive data dump, with a link to a torrent containing \" nearly 3 gigabytes of email correspondence belonging to his attorneys, \" russia today reports. In its screed on the puckett and faraj site, anonymous promises more releases having to do with that recent awful video of marines urinating on afghan corpses: 11: 23 a.m.: the latest of anonymous ' friday hacks is replacing the boston police department website bpdnews with a video for krs-one's",
            "A sensitive conference call between fbi and british police's cybercrime investigators was recorded by the very people they were trying to catch, officials and hackers said friday. Hacking collective anonymous published a roughly 15-minute-long recording of a conference call apparently devoted to tracking and prosecuting members of the loosely-knit group. The fbi said the information \" was intended for law enforcement officers only and was illegally obtained. \" \" a criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible, \" the bureau said in a statement. It's not clear how the hackers got their hands on the recording, which appears to have been edited to bleep out the names of some of the suspects being discussed. \" the fbi might be curious how we're able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now, \" the group gloated in a message posted to twitter. Amid the material published by anonymous was a message purportedly sent by an fbi agent to international law enforcement agencies. It invites his foreign counterparts to join the call to \" discuss the ongoing investigations related to anonymous... And other associated splinter groups. \" the email contained a phone number and password for accessing the call. The email is addressed to officials in the u.k., ireland, the netherlands, sweden and france, but only american and british officials can"

But a \" yes \" vote would still leave a number of hurdles to clear. First, the state legislature would need to re-configure the borders in the state constitution; then, a majority in both houses of congress would need to approve the move ( the president's ok isn't needed, however ). Experts think the chances of success are slim, though it's not without precedent: maine broke off from massachusetts in the 19th century, as west virginia did from virginia; but recent efforts in california, washington, and new york to do the same have gone nowhere.
