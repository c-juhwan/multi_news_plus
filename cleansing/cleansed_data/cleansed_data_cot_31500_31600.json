        "summary": "Make a noise, get hunted. That's the premise of a quiet place, set in a world ravaged by sound-sensitive aliens. Directed by john krasinski ( yes, jim from the office ), the film follows a family led by krasinski and his real-life wife, emily blunt, and has an impressive 96 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: dislike horror movies? see a quiet place anyway, jocelyn noveck writes at the ap. It's \" ingeniously creepy \" with \" jump-out-of-your-seat moments. \" but it also offers \" an inventive premise \" and \" a terrific cast. \" blunt \" can register fear, joy, love and anxiety in one scene without needing to utter a word, \" says noveck. And, impressive for a horror film, a quiet place \" only occasionally strains its own logic. \" \" the quieter it gets, the more noise it makes, \" writes adam graham at detroit news, describing a quiet place as a \" masterful horror tale that will leave audiences gasping for air. \" krasinski gets high praise: he \" makes us think about our own relationship with sound \" and \" sets a gripping mood from the very beginning. \" it makes for \" a bold experiment in fear with a triumphant payoff, \" graham writes. \" you ' ll leave elated or i ' ll eat my words, \" writes jeannette catsoulis of this \" old-fashioned creature feature. \" krasinski \" forces us to pay attention to facial expressions in a way that hearing audiences are rarely required to do. \" and the actors deliver. Seeing deaf actor millicent simmonds \" cycle through hurt, doubt, anger and acceptance is one of the movie's singular pleasures, \" catsoulis writes at the new york times. \" the movie rocks. \" \" if a quiet place has one flaw, it's that it never lets up. There's little breathing space between its breathtaking moments, \" says stephanie zacharek. At time, she calls the film \" one of the most terrifyingly effective horror movies \" and \" one of the most poetic horror movies \" in years. \" its sound design alone is glorious, locating the infinite gradations in that thing we so casually call silence. \"",

She explained that the containers of excrement aboard that train have been transported to and emptied at their intended destination, the landfill operated by big sky environmental about 25 miles away.

Still, they spent july 4th together at the kennedys ' hyannis port compound, but swift was banned from sleeping over at the kennedy mansion there. The mansion, you see, has been taken over by the edward m. Kennedy institute for the us senate, and will be turned into an education center. Even family can't use the facility without paying a fee, because of the institute's nonprofit status; all of this is causing a rift in the family. Even so, it's amusing to think of swift caught in the middle — the boston globe confirms that a request to allow her to stay in the mansion was rejected, and one kennedy watcher snarkily writes in the boston herald that ted kennedy \"wanted his historic, rambling home to become a place of learning for the public, especially young people.

She was subsequently rescued by a group of women and egyptian soldiers, flew home the next day, and is currently recovering in a hospital. All of which is a horrendous, sickening crime. And when the news of the attack broke tuesday afternoon, it took all of minutes before somebody decided to hinge the story on the blond reporter's looks. In a stunningly offensive blog post titled \" lara logan, cbs reporter and warzone ' it girl, ' raped repeatedly amid egypt celebration \" for la weekly, writer simone wilson managed to mention logan's \" shocking good looks and ballsy knack for pushing her way to the heart of the action \" before getting to the assault itself. She then went on to imagine how it happened: \" in a rush of frenzied excitement, some egyptian protestors apparently consummated their newfound independence by sexually assaulting the blonde reporter. \" well, sure, what other motive for an assault could there be, given that logan is, in wilson's words, a \" gutsy stunner \" with \" hollywood good looks \"? and how else do egyptians celebrate anyway but with a gang assault? it's not like she deserved it, but well",
            "Update: \" lara logan confirms she was brutally and repeatedly raped in egypt: why did the media think she wasn't? \" updated after the jump: commenters respond to bloggers respond to reporters respond to tweeters respond to the inexcusable crime against lara logan. Breaking news: south african tv journalist lara logan, known for her shocking good looks and ballsy knack for pushing her way to the heart of the action, was brutally and repeatedly raped while a crowd of 200 celebrated the february 11 resignation of 30-year egyptian president hosni mubarak. Logan was in tahrir square with her \" 60 minutes \" news team when mubarak's announcement broke. Then, in a rush of frenzied excitement, some egyptian protesters apparently consummated their newfound independence by sexually assaulting the blonde reporter: cbs news reports that \" she and her team and their security were surrounded by a dangerous element amidst the celebration. \" then, the horrific assault: in the crush of the mob, she was separated from her crew. She was surrounded and suffered a brutal and sustained sexual assault and beating before being saved by a group of women and an estimated 20 egyptian soldiers. She reconnected with the cbs team, returned to her hotel and returned to the united states on the first flight the next morning. She is currently in the hospital recovering."

        "summary": "A skydiver was killed after he slammed into the roof of a california home monday afternoon after it appeared his main parachute didn't open, kabc reports. \" he hit the roof pretty hard, \" a witness says, adding that the unidentified man's orange emergency chute, which didn't appear to soften the impact, had opened up right before the apparently unconscious skydiver fell onto the perris residence. The man was pronounced dead at the scene, and firefighters and other emergency responders who answered the call around 3pm removed his body on a stretcher with the help of a ladder firetruck. Though a riverside county sheriff's department rep tells the los angeles times that other details on the fall were sparse, nbc los angeles reports the plane the skydiver jumped from appeared to be from a skydiving school at nearby perris valley airport. Reuters notes perris is a hot spot for skydiving, with nbc adding that there've been three local parachuting deaths over the past five years. However, the times notes that skydiving fatalities overall are rare: out of 3.2 million jumps in 2016, a total of 21 people died, per the united states parachute association. A woman who was inside the perris home was in disbelief over the accident. \" i was like, no, this can't be happening, \" christina blanco tells kabc. \" and then it took so long for us to find out if he was ok or not, just waiting. My heart just dropped when they were like, no, he's not ok. \" there were no other reported injuries. ( a florida skydiver sent his wife a \" disturbing \" video before his fatal jump. )",

Let's just say that's not going over well with some. The green bay press-gazette talks to some irked fans and rounds up the angry social media reactions of others, many of whom are threatening to return shares in the team or season tickets. Fox6 reports that there will be more police officers present on the field than is typical, just in case fans start throwing things at players or try to rush the field.

But then there are those like packers shareholder and air force veteran steven tiefenthaler, who says his \" allegiance to our american flag and to our national anthem will always stand far above any loyalty to the nfl. \" ( as cnn notes, the team is the nfl's only publicly owned franchise; more than 360,000 fans own stakes. ) \" we've had a steady stream of feedback beginning monday morning [ after many packers locked arms during the anthem on sunday ] and it continued into wednesday.

        "summary": "Recreational marijuana is legal in the state of oregon, but what's not is trading a bunch of it for a recreational vehicle — and it's extra likely to come to light if a cop is the one selling said vehicle. But jason owen allegedly tried to do just that after seeing a craigslist ad hawking a snowmobile, per the statesman journal, putting out feelers to the seller to see if he or she would be willing to accept a pound of pot in exchange for the snowmobile. The seller, an oregon state police trooper, agreed, kptv reports. When owen showed up at a local gas station saturday night to seal the deal — cops say he had a pound and a half of pot, slightly more than what the original deal called for — he was greeted by a bunch of marked patrol cars, which conducted a traffic stop on owen's car and reportedly found the pot. The craigslist-frequenting trooper told owen that even though pot is legal in the state, all pot transactions are required to go through the oregon liquor control commission or a medical marijuana dispensary registered with the oregon health authority. Owen received a citation for marijuana delivery, and his car got taken away because he was driving with a suspended license.

After a year-long investigation, york regional police have charged fortune teller samantha stevenson, also known as evanna lopez, with fraud, possession of property obtained by crime, and pretending to practice witchcraft, reports the toronto star. The latter charge stems from an old law against fraudulently telling fortunes to obtain money, though the cbc reports it might soon be erased. A bill that would lift it and other outdated laws, introduced by prime minister justin trudeau last year, is close to becoming law. Still, halton regional police det.-const. Sarah mccullagh says the charge is appropriate for those who take \" advantage of very vulnerable people at a very tough time in their life. \" stevenson, 27, told customers they had a curse, bad energy, or were haunted by ghosts so \" you would pay to have her do rituals and cleansing, \" mccullagh tells the cbc. She describes one person defrauded of $ 48,000, while ctv news reports a 67-year-old man is out $ 450,000. According to police, stevenson told him to sell his house and transfer the money to her for safekeeping until evil spirits had dispersed. Police say the man also sold his car and used credit cards to pay stevenson other sums, including $ 4,500 she said needed to be burned to ward off spirits. Stressing that the witchcraft law doesn't affect psychics operating for entertainment, mccullagh has this advice for people seeking them out: \" make sure they're reputable … and if you are told there's a curse on you, don't believe them. \" ( this us case is similar. )",

Pollard, who was convicted of spying for israel and given a life sentence in 1987, was released on parole from a federal prison in north carolina on friday under terms that ban him from leaving the us until 2020, the bbc reports. At least two democratic lawmakers have asked president obama to grant the 61-year-old's request to join his wife, esther, in israel, the new york times reports, but officials seem unwilling to ease the parole conditions despite a request from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. Still, netanyahu praised his release today, saying, \" as someone who raised jonathan's case for years with successive american presidents, i had long hoped this day would come, \" per the ap. Pollard, who was working as a navy intelligence analyst when he gave classified information to israel, was granted israeli citizenship in 1996, two years before the country acknowledged he was an agent, the bbc notes. \" there is nothing good that came as a result of my actions, \" pollard told the ap in a 1998 interview. \" i tried to serve two countries at the same time. That does not work. \" if he's unable to move to israel, pollard plans to live and work in new york city, reports the times, which notes that he is the only american to get a life sentence for spying for a us ally. ( last year, the us offered to free pollard early to get israeli-palestinian peace talks back on track. )",

Tweets are limited to 140 characters, and here is what i tweeted: @ebertchicago kids who wear american flag t-shirts on 5 may should have to share a lunchroom table with those who wear a hammer and sickle on 4 july. Now what do you suppose i meant by that? it was tweeted at the height of the discussion over five white california kids who wore matching t-shirts to school on cinco de mayo, and were sent home by their school. This inspired predictable outrage in the usual circles. Tweeted from lonestarag05: its the usa not mexico. They are allowed to be proud of their country. I wonder sometimes why you even stay here. Many others informed me that americans have the right to be proud of our flag, and wear it on t-shirts. Of course they do. That isn't the question. It's not what my tweet said. What i suggested, in its 108 letters, is that we could all use a little empathy. I wish i had worded it better. Let's begin with a fact few americans know: celebrating cinco de mayo is an american custom. The first such celebration was held in california in 1863, and they have continued without interruption. In mexico itself it is not observed, except in the state of puebla -- the site of mexico's underdog victory over the french on may 5, 1862. Cinco de mayo's purpose is to celebrate mexican-american culture in the united states. We are a nation of immigrants, and have many such observances, for example st. Patrick's day parades, which began in boston in 1737 and not in ireland until 1931. Or pulaski day, officially established in illinois in 1977, and not observed in poland. The first chinese new year's parade was held",

Tweets are limited to 140 characters, and here is what i tweeted: @ebertchicago kids who wear american flag t-shirts on 5 may should have to share a lunchroom table with those who wear a hammer and sickle on 4 july. Now what do you suppose i meant by that? it was tweeted at the height of the discussion over five white california kids who wore matching t-shirts to school on cinco de mayo, and were sent home by their school. This inspired predictable outrage in the usual circles. Tweeted from lonestarag05: its the usa not mexico. They are allowed to be proud of their country. I wonder sometimes why you even stay here. Many others informed me that americans have the right to be proud of our flag, and wear it on t-shirts. Of course they do. That isn't the question. It's not what my tweet said. What i suggested, in its 108 letters, is that we could all use a little empathy. I wish i had worded it better. Let's begin with a fact few americans know: celebrating cinco de mayo is an american custom. The first such celebration was held in california in 1863, and they have continued without interruption. In mexico itself it is not observed, except in the state of puebla -- the site of mexico's underdog victory over the french on may 5, 1862. Cinco de mayo's purpose is to celebrate mexican-american culture in the united states. We are a nation of immigrants, and have many such observances, for example st. Patrick's day parades, which began in boston in 1737 and not in ireland until 1931. Or pulaski day, officially established in illinois in 1977, and not observed in poland. The first chinese new year's parade was held",

The us is \" fully capable of defending against \" a north korean ballistic missile attack, said press secretary jay carney yesterday. Though it's still in development, a us missile defense system known as the ground-based interceptor is on a \" good trajectory \" amid testing, said carney; it's designed to defend against long-range missiles. In east asia, the us has deployed the land-based patriot system and the sea-based aegis systems, which are designed to intercept shorter-range missiles. Noted the top us envoy on pyongyang, per the ap: \" we take all north korean threats seriously enough to ensure that we have the correct defense posture to deal with any contingencies that might arise. \" but the picture may be a little more worrisome for south korea and japan, reports reuters. The former noted in december that the north was capable of launching a \" sudden and massive \" attack on seoul, which is located just 31 miles from the dmz; further, both the south and japan are well within the reach of the north's intermediate-range missiles. And while the north's 1.2 million soldiers would appear to trounce the south's 640,000, reuters notes that the country's impoverished state renders it incapable of sustaining a ground battle.",

Washington ( reuters ) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co chief executive jamie dimon has agreed to testify before congress over the bank's recent trading losses, which have ignited a political debate over whether large u.s. Banks need to be reined in by regulators or new laws. U.s. Senate banking committee chairman tim johnson said in a statement on thursday that his panel will invite dimon to appear before congress.

She said dimon will appear before the panel. Last week jpmorgan announced that it has suffered at least $ 2 billion in losses due to trades that went bad. Johnson said committee staff has been discussing the losses with regulators and the bank since they were disclosed and have determined dimon should testify. Critics of wall street have pointed to the trades as evidence that reforms called for under the 2010 dodd-frank financial oversight law should be strictly enforced once",

Washington ( reuters ) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co chief executive jamie dimon has agreed to testify before congress over the bank's recent trading losses, which have ignited a political debate over whether large u.s. Banks need to be reined in by regulators or new laws. U.s. Senate banking committee chairman tim johnson said in a statement on thursday that his panel will invite dimon to appear before congress. He did not say on what date the committee wants dimon to testify but that it would follow a set of hearings with regulators on the trades and efforts to implement wall street reforms that will conclude on june 6. \" as always, we will continue to be open and transparent with our regulators and congress, \" jpmorgan spokesman kristin lemkau said in a statement. She said dimon will appear before the panel. Last week jpmorgan announced that it has suffered at least $ 2 billion in losses due to trades that went bad. Johnson said committee staff has been discussing the losses with regulators and the bank since they were disclosed and have determined dimon should testify. Critics of wall street have pointed to the trades as evidence that reforms called for under the 2010 dodd-frank financial oversight law should be strictly enforced once",

But it turns out turing won't be lowering the cost of daraprim from its current price of $ 750 per pill after all, according to an announcement from the company tuesday. Instead, the pill — which fights infection in hiv patients, among others — will be offered half-off to hospitals, come in smaller bottles, and be free for some poor patients, according to ars technica. \" this is an important step in our commitment to ensure ready access to daraprim at the lowest possible out-of-pocket cost, \" one turing executive says in a press release. \" no patient needing daraprim will ever be denied access. \" not everyone is impressed. The new york times notes that those measures are industry standard for expensive medications and simply pass increased costs along to taxpayers. And the chairman of the hiv medicine association tells the times that even with the discounts, \" they are still pricing it way above what the price of the medication should be. \" \"this is, as the saying goes, nothing more than lipstick on a pig, \" one director at an aids organization says. Turing acquired daraprim in august and immediately jacked up the price from the previous amount of $ 13.50 per pill. That move earned shkreli a wave of bad press, cost him his punk friends, and started a feud with bernie sanders. Turing is currently being investigated by lawmakers for alleged \" price gouging, \" according to ars technica.",

Novichok — meaning \" newcomer \" in russian — is a class of chemical agents developed in the soviet union in the 1970s and ' 80s \" specifically to get around treaties banning chemical weapons, \" reports nbc news. Only revealed to the wider world by a former russian scientist in 1991, the agents aren't fully understood, but they're believed to be among the most deadly in existence, per cnn. Though there are \" no known previous uses, \" per reuters, one specific agent, a-230, is described as five to eight times as toxic as vx, a weapon of mass destruction used in the february 2017 assassination of kim jong nam, the half brother of north korean leader kim jong un. In powder and liquid form, novichok agents produce effects — respiratory failure and death by asphyxiation at worst — as little as 30 seconds after inhalation or absorption through the skin, reports the bbc. They're also believed to cause more permanent injury and be more resistant to antidotes than other nerve agents. In addition, the agents are easier to handle and harder to detect, as most involve two not-as-toxic components that only become deadly when mixed. This makeup apparently allowed the soviet union to develop such agents even after committing to chemical arms control, experts say. May says it's \" highly likely \" russia is responsible for the march 4 attack on 66-year-old skripal and his 33-year-old daughter, who remain in critical condition. But russia is denying involvement and refusing to explain the use of novichok until samples of the agent are provided, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "A voter-profiling company used by the 2016 trump campaign collected the private data of over 50 million facebook users without their permission — one of the biggest data leaks in facebook history, the new york times reports. According to the guardian, it started with researchers concluding they could form complex personality profiles of people by what they \" like \" on facebook, determining intelligence, history of trauma, and more based on responses to posts on innocuous subjects like curly fries and hello kitty. Researcher aleksandr kogan signed a deal with cambridge analytica — which had stephen bannon in a leading role — and in 2014 developed a personality quiz that would not only harvest the data of the facebook users who took it but also all of their friends. Around 270,000 facebook users took the quiz — agreeing to allow their data to be used for academic purposes; their friends didn't even agree to that — which allowed kogan to harvest the data of over 50 million facebook users and pass it along to cambridge analytica in violation of facebook policies. The company used it to create psychographic profiles of about 30 million us voters and target political ads toward them. Facebook found out in 2015 and demanded the data be deleted, quartz reports. But facebook didn't publicly acknowledge the leak until friday and, despite claims to the contrary, it appears cambridge analyitica still has a good portion of the data. Cambridge analytica, which has now been banned by facebook, is also facing the possibility of having run afoul of us election laws and is being looked into by the mueller investigation.",

        "summary": "Visitors who remove any bit of nature from a state park are breaking the law. But those who remove a chunk of petrified wood from utah's escalante petrified forest state park risk something darker: an alleged ancient curse that visitors claim is the real deal. The park manager tells ksl that each year he's sent as many as a dozen pieces of petrified wood — which time has turned to stone quartz — typically accompanied by an apology in the hope that good fortunes will return to the one-time plunderer. One man wrote that he \" thought the warnings were phony. Since that time, i have had three accidents \" involving broken bones — plus a motor home fire and a dead car engine. Another wrote of three years of bad luck: \" i hope with this act of restitution ( the ) lord will have mercy upon me. I apologize and beg your pardon. \" it's an alleged curse not unique to utah: in 2012 the daily sun looked at the \" conscience rocks \" mailed back to the petrified forest national park in arizona, which claims the most petrified wood of any location on earth. It sees as many as six letters a month, and has a 1,200-page archive of such letters that dates to the 1930s — when the story of the park's curse was believed to have been started. Still, the rumored curses haven't stemmed the thefts: in the case of escalante, visitors now have to hike a mile into the park to even encounter the wood because the areas closest to the parking lot have been cleaned out; as for arizona's 220,000-acre park, the national park service suspects as much as a ton of petrified wood is removed each month.",

But at 28 she began to mysteriously lose weight and vomit after eating. By the time she stepped on a scale to check her weight, she was 112 pounds, down from 140 pounds, reported good housekeeping in 2015. Her eventual diagnosis a few years later? superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a condition in which her small intestine was being pinched and not allowing food to pass through, and gastroparesis, which kept her stomach from emptying correctly, reports people. On saturday, after many therapies and surgery, the 34-year-old — who'd dropped down to 77 pounds and entered hospice — died in brookfield, wis. \" it's my time to go, \" she told people last week. Brown said she'd gotten countless stares from strangers; some were so bold as to tell her to eat a burger or ask why she was starving herself. \" it was very hard to hear, \" she said, \" but i knew the truth. \" brown's story went viral after she posted a video to youtube to offer hope to others fighting similar battles, though her disorder is so rare there are only 400 other reported cases, per people. Brookfield now reported that doctors recommended she get a small intestine transplant, but she was unable to gain the 20 pounds doctors said she'd need to add to her frame in order to have the surgery. Brown's husband, patrick, who started a gofundme page to help pay for her memorial and his unpaid leave from work, says the last thing he told her was, \" go be free. \" ( this toddler has to eat every hour to survive. )",

In an announcement thursday, verizon says companies could use drones connected to its lte wireless network to monitor things like wildfires and oil pipelines. Drones with data plans could send photos and stream videos directly back to devices on the ground while still in flight. According to cnet, verizon has been working on data-enabled drones since 2014 and has been testing the system, known as airborne lte operations ( or alo ), around the us. In addition to allowing transmission of images and data, a wireless network would allow drones to be piloted remotely. At the moment — due both to technological limitations, as well as federal regulations — commercial drones must stay within view of the pilot. A shift to remote piloting would enable things like amazon's proposed delivery-by-drone service. Verizon says it will also use the technology to turn drones into mobile cell towers during emergencies. A test flight thursday hoped to show how much area could be provided with wireless coverage from a drone, fortune reports. Drone data plans are expected to cost between $ 25 and $ 80 per month depending on the size.",

In an email yesterday, the romney camp invited supporters to listen in on a conference call at 11am today, promising \" an update, \" the washington post reports. What supporters will get is clarification on whether he's \" moving towards a run or pulling back from the prospect, \" cnn reports via a source. At bloomberg, mark halperin sees three factors pushing him forward: romney genuinely feels he's the best person to run the country; he believes a shift in message could help him secure key states he lost last time; and polls indicate a lead over other potential candidates nationally as well as in iowa, new hampshire, south carolina, and nevada. What's holding him back? the physical and emotional toll on his entire family, for one thing. For another, sources say romney fears a fierce fight for the republican nomination would leave the winner a little worse for wear, while hillary clinton would likely slide through the democratic nomination unscathed. ( he reportedly sees his main republican opponent as ohio gov. John kasich, rather than jeb bush or chris christie. ) another concern from campaign officials is that the gop plans to label clinton \" as old news and out of touch — both characterizations that could dog the former massachusetts governor, \" cnn reports.",

Her video of the incident, which included footage of connor apparently not responding to her requests for help, recently went viral, leading to calls for the officer to resign, the chicago tribune reports.

            "The cook county forest preserve district police officer who was caught on video seemingly ignoring a woman's call for help has resigned, the district announced late wednesday. Officer patrick connor's resignation is effective immediately, and as of wednesday he \"no longer serves in the police department, �? a district spokeswoman said in a written statement. The announcement came amid a growing chorus of calls for the officer to lose his job over the encounter, which happened in mid-june but became an international scandal this week when video footage of the incident went viral and drew millions of views.

Former north dakota rep. Earl pomeroy: when blue dog democrats like pomeroy were distancing themselves from president obama before the 2010 midterms, pomeroy even apologized for voting with his own party: \"i know i've disappointed you with a vote here or there, \" he said. \"but you can always count on the fact that i do what i do for the right reason. \" no dice: voters kicked him out of office. Bill clinton: surprisingly, politico didn't pick his apology for having an \" inappropriate \" relationship with monica lewinsky ( which is still up on youtube ).

The washington post reports on the pieces being put together. It seems as though vilma trujillo garcia, a 25-year-old woman, may have been suffering from a mental health crisis a couple weeks ago and possibly threatened people with a machete. Afterward, a pastor arrived at her house and took her to his church to conduct a healing. He allegedly kept her in the church for a week, and tells police: \" god has made me a revelation... That a group of brothers should take the sick woman and tie her up near the fire... So that the demon will leave the body of the sick and go into the fire. \" and so it went. Nicaraguan police say the mother was stripped naked, bound, and thrown into the fire. Nine hours later, her teen sister found her in a ravine, and she was taken to a hospital in the capital city of managua, where she died tuesday. Evangelical pastor juan gregorio rocha romero and four others have now been arrested, reports the ap.

        "summary": "How much will it cost and how many people will lose insurance? expect answers to those questions to dominate when the nonpartisan congressional budget office releases its official assessment of the gop plan to replace obamacare. It could come as early as monday. Related coverage: the new york times offers high and low estimates on five key numbers that will be in the report. The number of those expected to lose insurance, for example, ranges from 8 million to 20 million. See the graphic here. The take at axios: if the coverage estimates are bad, the gop may be able to soldier on, but if the cost estimates are bad, \" it could be over \" because \" conservatives won't vote for a bill they consider too expensive. \" republicans have been pushing back in advance, acknowledging, for example, that the number of people insured will be fewer because their plan does away with the individual mandate. \" we're not going to make an american do what they don't want to do, \" said paul ryan on sunday. He declined to provide his own estimate, saying, \" it's up to people. \" see cnn. The white house also has been preemptively questioning the cbo's credibility, accusing it of being way off when it scored obamacare, per the washington times. But politifact looks into the criticism and finds it lacking context and only \" half true. \" the gop plan faces a tough fight in the house but perhaps a tougher one in the senate, where another republican voiced skepticism over the weekend. This time it was dean heller of nevada, according to audio obtained by politico. Previous senate critics have included tom cotton and rand paul. Gop governors, meanwhile, are worried about losing expanded medicaid coverage, per the hill, which lays out the broad strokes of the plan's political prospects. One thing it says is vital for passage: president trump's use of the bully pulpit to pressure lawmakers. A forbes blogger complains that exaggerations from both sides are at \" stratospheric heights \" and punctures 10 of them. He tells democrats, for example, that obamacare problems can't be blamed solely on republicans. \" you rammed through a defective bill and administered it without the tough love needed to make it work. \" read it here.

        "summary": "Rick santorum's stunning sweep of colorado, minnesota, and missouri yesterday has thrown another plot twist into the republican nominating contest. Here's what you need to know: santorum may finally get the bounce that largely eluded him after iowa, helping him raise money and pique voter interest, the new york times predicts. His first order of business is staying ahead of newt gingrich. After nevada, he said gingrich had \" had his chance \" to beat romney. While the colorado and minnesota caucuses were non-binding, if delegates do honor them santorum picks up 28 convention votes, vaulting him into second place with 45 delegates by the ap's count. Gingrich has 32, while romney boasts 107. Missouri awarded no delegates, but wasn't meaningless after all, the washington post observes. With gingrich off the ballot, santorum proved he could beat romney in a head-to-head race. Of course, romney didn't exactly break a sweat in the state, but his 30-point loss looks really ugly. This is \" not a near-death experience for romney, \" who is still the most likely nominee, writes maggie haberman at politico. But it makes it really hard to argue that his problems with conservatives are being overhyped, and puts a serious dent in his aura of inevitability. William kristol of the weekly standard is convinced romney lost because of santorum's assault on romneycare. Another possible explanation: romney's super pac didn't blanket any of these states with ads. Gingrich emerges looking irrelevant, having won one state to santorum's four. He's low on cash, and sources tell politico that sheldon adelson isn't planning on another super pac deposit... Perhaps because adelson is weighing jumping ship. Voter turnout was down in all three states — a sign that republicans aren't terribly excited to vote for any of these candidates.

Divers have already brought more than 50 artifacts to the surface, including a bronze armrest, crystal glassware, luxury ceramics and a piece of an ancient board game. As the latest discoveries prove, the antikythera is the shipwreck that keeps on giving. The shipwreck was first discovered by sponge divers in 1990. The wreck was found off of point glyphadia on the greek island for which the wreck is named. Initial excavations surfaced 36 marble statues depicting characters and gods from greek mythology.

        "summary": "The first total solar eclipse in the continental us since 1979 is fast approaching and amazon sellers are ready. Many who typically sell fad items are hawking solar eclipse glasses — meant to block 99.99 % of sunlight, per the verge — in the lead-up to aug. 21, taking over a market previously dominated by nasa-approved manufacturers. There are \" literally thousands \" of glasses up for grabs on amazon, writes elijah wolfson at quartz. The problem is that they might not do their job. Wolfson and colleagues reviewed 140 of the top listings for \" eclipse glasses \" on amazon and found that few met nasa guidelines, which state that the glasses should be unblemished and less than three years old, and include the maker's information and an iso 12312-2 certification. Only 33 identified the maker's name, and only 16 claimed to use lenses manufactured by a nasa-approved company. Even those weren't necessarily safe, as wolfson discovered one such pair he bought was actually counterfeit. Most glasses claimed to be certified, though an official at the american astronomical society says he's reviewed plenty that didn't have complete iso paperwork. In a series of tests, experts found glasses that didn't meet nasa guidelines did block harmful rays, but that doesn't mean all will. Amazon updated its policy thursday so sellers must provide proof of iso certification, but quartz notes it's not clear if existing listings will be taken down. More from quartz here, while nasa's tips for buying authentic glasses are here.",

Archaeologists said it was built about 4,300 years ago and was abandoned roughly 300 years later during the xia dynasty, the first dynasty in china to be described in ancient historical chronicles."

        "summary": "As the budget debate continues, the house progressive caucus has released a plan of its own — and it's all about taxes. Their proposal would end the bush tax cuts, add new tax brackets for millionaires, and raise corporate taxes. It would also add a public option to health care and boost medicare's drug-price negotiating power — and it would allow for $ 1.4 trillion in new investments. The plan, house progressives say, would cut the deficit more than either president obama's or paul ryan's over the next decade. But would it work? some reactions: ezra klein, writing in the washington post, polled a few economists on the matter. The upshot: it's not perfect, but it's a welcome addition to the budget conversation. It's \"an enormous improvement over the bizarre ryan budget, \" says one expert. But, notes another, \"i wish they'd thought more about simplification and reforming the tax expenditures that they retain. \" meanwhile, paul krugman applauds the plan in the new york times, calling it \"the only major budget proposal out there offering a plausible path to balancing the budget. \" in the guardian, michael tomasky calls the plan \"somewhat out of balance, \" but \"maybe mainstream cred isn't their goal.

The reality is that effective federal tax rates at every level of income have fallen significantly over the past 30 years, especially at the top. And, over all, u.s. Taxes are much lower as a percentage of national income than taxes in most other wealthy nations. Photo the point is that we aren't that heavily taxed, either by historical standards or in comparison with other nations. So if you're truly horrified by the budget deficit, why not propose tax increases as part of the solution? wait, there's more. The core of the ryan proposal is a plan to privatize and defund medicare. Yet this would do nothing to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years, which is why all the near-term deficit reduction",

        "summary": "Anthony russell allegedly violated a no-contact order and was due to appear in court in indiana on a felony charge of stalking his estranged wife, laura. Laura, 44, had reported to police multiple instances of finding anthony, 51, waiting for her and following her, cbs reports. Prosecutors requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest, but on oct. 6 judge michael hensley declined to do so, choosing instead to simply issue a summons for anthony russell to appear in court days later, after a long holiday weekend. The day after that ruling, authorities found anthony russell dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound; when they went to the russell home to inform laura, they found her dead of multiple stab wounds. They believe anthony killed her and then himself. On monday, hensley issued a statement acknowledging that \" the most tragic result possible \" came of his ruling, and explained why he made it, the madison courier reports. \" my role is not to simply grant all warrants without review, \" hensley said. \" certain legal standards must be met before i can issue a warrant. The reason i did not issue a warrant in this case is that there was not sufficient probable cause. Without probable cause i do not have the power to issue a warrant. I made what i thought to be the correct legal decision. \" he added that he fully understands the risks involved in domestic abuse situations, but still found \" the fact that an elementary school teacher killed his wife and then himself \" difficult to believe. In the future, he says, he will issue an order for a hearing on the same day as the warrant request if he can't find probable cause to grant the warrant request. \" i am hopeful the new procedure prevents a similar tragedy in the future, \" he writes. \" i feel horrible about her death and realize the regret i express and information i provide in this statement do not bring her back. \"",

The loss of ai's second appeal in a higher court means that the world-renowned artist could risk arrest if he does not pay a remaining fine of around 6.6 million yuan ( $ 1.05 million ), in a case that has further tarnished china's poor human rights reputation.

            "Beijing a chinese court upheld a $ 2.4 million tax evasion fine against china's most famous dissident ai weiwei on thursday, ending his long legal battle with the authorities but paving the way for him to be jailed if he does not pay. The loss of ai's second appeal in a higher court means that the world-renowned artist could risk arrest if he does not pay a remaining fine of around 6.6 million yuan ( $ 1.05 million ), in a case that has further tarnished china's poor human rights reputation. He has paid a bond of 8.45 million yuan already lodged with the tax authorities to contest the tax charge. Ai, whose 81-day detention last year sparked an international outcry, told reuters he will not pay the remaining fine as that would be tacit acknowledgement of the case's legality, which he has always maintained is trumped up. Ai said he is uncertain whether he faces arrest if he doesn't do so. \" if i need to go to jail, there's nothing i can do about it, \" ai said. \" this country has no fairness and justice, even if i've paid the 6 million yuan, i still could possibly go to jail. They don't need an excuse to arrest me - they can always find another excuse"

The son of maulana sami ul-haq says his father, believed to be in his early 80s, was stabbed to death while at home friday. Other reports suggested he may have been shot, too. The cleric's bodyguard had left him alone for about 15 minutes, and \" when he returned, he found maulana sami ul-haq dead in his bed and his body covered in blood, \" the son tells geo. No group immediately claimed responsibility. Dawn notes that the assassination comes at a volatile time in pakistan, following the acquittal of a christian woman on blasphemy charges. In fact, the cleric had attempt to join protests against the acquittal friday, but he returned home because of blocked roads, says his son. It wasn't clear if the protests were connected to his slaying. Haq had twice served as a senator in pakistan and had close ties to taliban leader mullah omar, reports the daily pakistan. He apparently earned his nickname \" father of the taliban \" by serving as leader of a seminary through which many prominent members of the group emerged. Last month, he had been asked by a delegation from afghanistan to use his taliban contacts to help broker an end to the afghan conflict, per dawn.

Logan melgar, the 34-year-old victim, discovered that the navy seals were keeping some of the money that was supposed to go to informants, according to the story. When melgar found the cash, the seals reportedly offered him a share of the take, but he turned them down. This eventually led to a confrontation in the early morning hours of june 4, during which melgar lost consciousness and stopped breathing, per the daily beast. The seals and another green beret drove melgar to a clinic, but he was dead upon arrival, us africa command officials tell the daily beast. At that point, the seals ' official account of what happened began to unravel. They reported that logan had been drunk that night, but no alcohol was found in his system during an autopsy, and it's believed that logan didn't drink, period. Perhaps worse, he had written to his wife about the problems he was having with the seals, and she has given those emails to investigators.

The problem with that idea? it might be illegal. As propublica explains, the trump organization recently ordered the manufacture of tee markers emblazoned with the seal for use at trump golf courses — these would be the markers used to show golfers where to tee off. This became known when a metalworking and sign company known as eagle sign and design posted a since-deleted photo to facebook of the design destined for \" trump international golf course. \" ( there's four such courses, and the caption didn't specify which one. ) the order form seen by propublica and wnyc identifies the customer as trump international. The issue is that the seal cannot be used for commercial purposes. In fact, it's a criminal offense that carries a possible punishment of six months in prison. The \"law is an expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose, \" a law professor at washington university tells propublica. It's not clear whether the revelation will put an end to the tee-marker plans. Nobody from the white house, the trump organization, or the justice department is commenting. The owner of eagle sign and design confirms his company made the design but not his client's identity. \" apparently when you do something that is related to trump it means you ' ll get a lot of questions, \" he tells the louisville courier-journal. \" we just did what our customer wanted. \"",

        "summary": "Although it's the mass shootings in the us that we see most in the news, they're not what's causing the majority of gun deaths among our youngest citizens. Instead, it's what nbc news calls the \" steady drumbeat of deaths in ones and twos \" from suicides, homicides, and accidents that has led to a sobering figure: at least 554 kids under the age of 12 who've died from gun violence since the sandy hook school shooting three years ago — or about one death every other day. Using government data culled from the cdc and fbi, nbc found that the death rate for kids hasn't gone down since sandy hook ( the risk may have even slightly risen ), and it's been a tough fight for those lobbying for stricter gun safety laws at the federal level. Congress has balked at bills that would have bolstered nationwide gun safety laws, so gun safety advocates have taken it to the states instead: per a 2014 johns hopkins center for gun policy and research report, 15 states plus dc strengthened their gun laws in 2013. And there are shared initiatives, with both gun control and gun rights groups in support of promoting gun safety for kids through educational programs, though both sides accuse the other's gun safety measures of containing hidden agendas. \" [ the nra's ] eddie eagle [ program ] is akin to joe camel, a way to get into schools and talk about guns, \" shannon watts, the founder of a facebook page that eventually morphed into the moms demand action for gun sense group, tells nbc. But an nra blog says watts and her group are \" more concerned with teaching grown-ups to badger other parents about whether they store guns in their house \" than safety issues. Despite seemingly discouraging stats, watts intends to keep forging ahead for gun safety. \" i wouldn't wake up and spend 12 hours a day working on this if i didn't think we were winning [ but ] … i ' m just so saddened by the lives we're going to lose in the meantime, \" she tells nbc.

Researchers at usc calculated this \" biological age gap \" by analyzing the physical exams and lifestyle surveys of 7,644 americans aged 30 and older, 11 % of whom were black and the rest white. The study considered 10 age-related biomarkers ( including total cholesterol, c-reactive protein, and systolic blood pressure ) as well as education level, smoking history, and body-mass index, pacific standard reports. In the end, researchers calculated an average biological age of 53.16 years for blacks and 49.84 years for whites. The age gap grew closer — to 52.72 for blacks and 49.89 for whites — when socioeconomic position and health behaviors were considered, but that's still a 3-year difference. So why the gap? researchers pointed to higher obesity rates among blacks, and a recent study concluded that blacks who internalize the idea of racial inferiority and \" anti-black bias \" have shorter leukocyte telomeres ( another \" biological age \" marker ). The latest study didn't exactly measure racism, but noted that \" everyday stressors associated with being black may negatively impact physiological functioning. \" what's more, \" the most disadvantaged blacks may be accumulating poorer and poorer health as they age \" before dying at an earlier age than whites in similar situations.

        "summary": "Apparently chris christie has a problem with bridges. Federal prosecutors ' investigation into the george washington bridge scandal has now widened to include several other bridge closings, the new york times reports. So far they're focused primarily on repairs to the pulaski skyway, and while the allegations aren't nearly as sensational as the allegedly politically-motivated george washington bridge closing, they still could lead to felony charges. Christie's administration is accused of pressuring the port authority into paying for the skyway's repairs, even announcing that it would do so before an agreement had been reached. That's a problem because the skyway is operated by new jersey, and hence outside the port authority's mandate. But it leads, indirectly, to the lincoln tunnel, so the port authority listed the repairs in bond documents as \" lincoln tunnel access infrastructure improvements. \" if prosecutors can prove that was intentionally misleading to bond holders, they can file felony charges under new york's martin act. Prosecutors are also in the early stages of investigating the closures of other bridges, including the goethals and bayonne bridges, though the details in those cases remain murky. But it's not all bad news for christie today; a new iowa poll shows that he's made up 5 points in a hypothetical matchup against hillary clinton, though he still trails the democrat 44-36, politico reports.",
