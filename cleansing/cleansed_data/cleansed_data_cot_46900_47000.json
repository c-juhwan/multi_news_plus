The house bill introduced by utah rep. Jason chaffetz called for the immediate sale of 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 states, outdoor life reports. \" the long overdue disposal of excess federal lands will free up resources for the federal government \" and boost economic development, chaffetz initially said in a statement. But, following massive uproar, chaffetz announced wednesday night he would withdraw the bill. A rule change introduced in january means the federal government is no longer required to make money when it sells off public lands. The bill chaffetz introduced stated that the land had \" no purpose for taxpayers, \" though hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts strongly disagreed, calling the move a \" land grab \" that will deprive them of access to large areas of wilderness. \" last i checked, hunters and fishermen were taxpayers, \" backcountry hunters and anglers spokesperson jason amaro told the guardian. He represents a chapter that includes new mexico, where a chunk of land the size of rhode island would have been sold off under the bill. \" that word'disposal ' is scary, \" amaro said.

            "The land grabs started more quickly than anticipated. On january 3, 2017, the first day of the 115th united states congress, the house of representatives passed a resolution that changed the manner in which the government accounts for america's vast publicly-owned estate. The provision, championed by utah republican representative rob bishop, was part of a larger rules package that didn't require senate approval; it stated that \"authorizing a conveyance of federal land to a state, local government, or tribal entity shall not be considered as providing new budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory spending, or increasing outlays. \" though written in the kind of legislative jargon that seems designed to cure insomnia, the provision was significant. According to house rules, any bill that adds to the federal deficit must include a financial offset. Bishop's language exempted public-land legislation from such ledger balancing. In essence, it rendered 640 million acres of forests and refuges and parks worthless. Imagine the cleveland cavaliers declaring that, should they elect to trade lebron james, they'd want nothing in return. When the rule was enacted, i happened to be in washington, d.c. Until that moment there had been much speculation about what might happen to america's wild places under a trump administration and a gop-held congress, but little tangible information",

The framework of the deal, which also extends jobless benefits, had been ironed out last night. It sailed through today on a vote of 89-10. The house will take it up next week, and senate aides tell the hill that john boehner will likely back the measure, but he won't do so publicly until he briefs members. As expected, the legislation also includes a republican provision to step up pressure on president obama over the proposed keystone oil pipeline. It calls for a quick decision from the white house, even though obama had hoped to put off that call until after the 2012 elections. Democratic aides tell the new york times that the short deadline actually gives obama a handy excuse to reject the pipeline proposal because the state department won't have time to conduct the necessary review. ( later, the senate passed a $ 1 trillion budget bill as expected, notes ap; it had already cleared the house. )",

Police are saying very little about the letter's contents, but they hope the author will reach out again and perhaps end the mystery of what happened to bernard \" bunny \" ross, reports the bangor daily news. Police say ross, then 18, vanished on may 12, 1977, after taking the family car to his aunt's house in presque isle, then stealing another car near her home. It was found about 20 miles away, and ross has been a missing person since. His parents — bernard sr., 80, and carol, 78 — say he'd been going through \" ups and downs \" at the time, but nothing out of the ordinary. The unsigned letter arrived after a local newspaper story about missing persons a few months ago mentioned their son, reports the portland press herald. The letter writer claimed to have information about the disappearance, but police aren't divulging details. \"i've never had anything like this happen in my career, \" says maine state police lt. Troy gardner. \"basically, all we're doing is extending an olive branch, saying we want to make contact with this person. \" gardner adds that police can't even be sure at this point that the letter isn't a hoax. The rosses are going public in the hope that the letter writer, who suggested that another newspaper story be written, is legit. It's been the lack of resolution that's been so hard to deal with all these years, says carol ross. \"it's not like there was a death. It was the unknown, \" she says. \" there was always the hope that he'd walk through the door one day. \" ( a diligent mom helped crack a 10-year-old cold case about her daughter's killing. )",

Members of the ring allegedly removed unwanted babies by c-section from mothers who had waited too long to get an abortion. The ring then sold babies for up to $ 570 each to adoptive parents, who could give each child their family name — a practice normally forbidden by islamic law when children are adopted, reports the bbc. Among the suspects are a doctor and two nurses who allegedly aided the baby-trafficking ring at a cairo hospital for three years. Police are also seeking the hospital's manager, who evaded arrest. An interesting aside in the story: abortion is only permitted in egypt when the mother's health is at stake.",

And one of those helpers just happened to be a miami herald photographer who captured some amazing images. The drama began about 2: 30pm when pamela rauseo realized that her 5-month-old nephew, sebastian de la cruz, had stopped breathing. She pulled her suv over on the dolphin expressway, carried the baby from the car, and began screaming for help. Herald photographer al diaz happened to be right behind her. \" a woman pops out of her car holding a baby screaming, ' help me! help me! my baby is not breathing, ' \" he recounts to wsvn. Rauseo began performing cpr and another woman jumped from her car to help. Diaz found a police officer stuck in traffic, and the officer took over the chest compressions. Two other miami-dade fire and rescue officials, also stuck in traffic, joined them, and they all managed to get sebastian breathing again before paramedics arrived. He is in stable condition today. \" i was just thinking about my sister, like, ' i can't, i can't let this happen, i can't, i can't, ' \" says rauseo. \"'she trusted me with her baby, and i can't let this baby die on me.

A company spokesman says the evacuees were taken to other oil fields as a precaution, and that 85 people remained on platforms in the valhall field thursday morning. He says a tugboat is trying to gain control of the barge, which broke from its anchor and started drifting amid strong winds and high waves late wednesday. Cnn reports that the 360-foot barge has begun drifting north, forcing conocophillips to evacuate 145 workers from an oil field. Earlier, norway's statoil said one worker was killed and two were injured when a big wave slammed into a drilling rig wednesday in the troll field, also in the north sea. A spokesman for norway's coast guard tells the bbc that the wave that hit the workers ' accommodation block on the rig must have been around 60 feet high. Two other workers were injured. The rig is now making its way back to norway with more than 50 workers aboard. Another 50 were evacuated after the accident, and a petroleum safety authority norway spokeswoman tells reuters that they had to be lifted off the platform because winds were too strong for a helicopter to land.",

        "summary": "President trump talked tough on north korea in an interview with the financial times, his language setting the stage for friday's meeting with chinese leader xi jinping. The voice of america reports that one line of thought is that trump may be willing to offer beijing incentives on a range of trade and security issues in exchange for help with the north. Meanwhile, a flurry of north korean developments were making headlines: the highest-ranking north korean defector in recent decades has a stark warning about kim jong un: \" once he sees that there is any kind of sign of a tank or an imminent threat from america, then he would use his nuclear weapons, \" thae young ho, who bolted in 2016, tells nbc news. A story in the new york times suggests that it might be too late to prevent pyongyang from joining the ranks of advanced nuclear powers. It points to the discovery of a classified ad, traced to north korea, offering the sale of 22 pounds of lithium 6 per month; lithium 6 is needed to make a hydrogen bomb, and the ad suggests the north has excess supplies. A blogger at forbes thinks the times might be overstating the importance of that classified ad. It is far from proof of nuclear strength in the north, he writes. In his financial times interview, trump said the us is prepared to act alone against the north if china is unwilling to help. What might that mean? cnn takes a look. In addition to sanctions and military action, there's the provocative idea of engagement — talking directly to kim, which trump as a candidate floated as an idea during the campaign. An analysis by the ap digs into the context of trump's answers. Any solo solution would have to be \" pretty clever, \" given the possibility of antagonizing not just the north and china, but russia as well. There's lots of chatter about heightened activity at a nuclear site in the north, suggesting that another test is imminent, but the 38 north blog assesses satellite photos and throws some cold water on the theory. The world will be able to challenge north korea in a different way next year: south korea is hosting the winter olympics and says the north is welcome, reports sky news. ( the welcome was necessary because the two nations technically remain in a state of war. )",

It is the latest in a spate of liberal rulings on civil rights issues, including a law that decriminalizes abortion in rape cases and gives the terminally ill the right to die. The measure, which was first introduced in 2007 by silvia augsburger, a deputy in argentina's lower chamber, defines gender identity as \"the inner and individual gender experience as each person feels it. \" president cristina fernández de kirchner is expected to sign it into law this month. Leaders of argentina's transgender community consider the identity law an important step toward self-determination. \"i couldn't use public services because the name on the documents, the name my parents gave me, wasn't me, and a person who doesn't have an identity doesn't have rights, \" said marcela romero, the president of attta, an activist group that promotes the rights of people who are transgender, transsexual or transvestites in argentina.

            "Some had borrowed from girlfriends, others from sisters. A few had gone the extra mile and shaved their legs. When the isca academy in devon opened on thursday morning, an estimated 30 boys arrived for lessons, heads held high, in fetching tartan-patterned skirts. The hottest june days since 1976 had led to a bare-legged revolution at the secondary school in exeter. As the temperature soared past 30c earlier this week, the teenage boys had asked their teachers if they could swap their long trousers for shorts. They were told no – shorts weren't permitted under the school's uniform policy. At least 120 schools adopt gender-neutral uniforms, charity says read more when they protested that the girls were allowed bare legs, the school – no doubt joking – said the boys were free to wear skirts too if they chose. So on wednesday, a handful braved the giggles"

In her last major speech on the job tuesday, samantha power urged politicians to prevent the kremlin from \" tearing down \" a \" rules-based \" world order and keep trump from excusing russia's crimes, including the annexation of crimea, the hacking of the us election, and its role in a syrian bombing campaign, per quartz. She even went as far as to accuse vladimir putin of killing his opponents. \" having defeated the forces of fascism and communism, we now confront the forces of authoritarianism and nihilism, \" she said at the atlantic council. Reversing sanctions against russia \" will only embolden russia \" and encourage north korea and iran, \" which are constantly testing how far they can move the line without triggering a response, \" power continued, per politico. Her sentiments were echoed by joe biden at the world economic forum on wednesday. Biden referred to russia's escalating efforts to \" undermine the us-led liberal democratic order, \" promising the kremlin will interfere in upcoming elections in europe, reports the huffington post. He also noted a general \" willingness to revert to … the same nationalist, protectionist, and isolationist agendas that led the world to consume itself in war, \" adding a \" hands off \" approach to foreign policy \" could be very ugly, \" per usa today.",

            "Not a very p.c. Thing to say how the language police are perverting liberalism. Photographs by bobby doherty around 2 a.m. On december 12, four students approached the apartment of omar mahmood, a muslim student at the university of michigan, who had recently published a column in a school newspaper about his perspective as a minority on campus. The students, who were recorded on a building surveillance camera wearing baggy hooded sweatshirts to hide their identity, littered mahmood's doorway with copies of his column, scrawled with messages like \"you scum embarrass us, \" \"shut the fuck up, \" and \"do you even go here?! leave!! \" they posted a picture of a demon and splattered eggs. This might appear to be the sort of episode that would stoke the moral conscience of students on a progressive campus like ann arbor, and it was quickly agreed that an act of biased intimidation had taken place. But mahmood was widely seen as the perpetrator rather than the victim. His column, published in the school's conservative newspaper, had spoofed the culture of taking offense that pervades the campus. Mahmood satirically pretended to denounce \"a white cis-gendered hetero upper-class man \" who offered to help him up when he slipped, leading him to denounce \"our barbaric attitude toward people of left-handydnyss. \" the gentle tone of his mockery was closer to charlie brown than to charlie hebdo. The michigan daily, where mahmood also worked as a columnist and film critic, objected to the placement of his column in the conservative paper but hardly wanted his satirical column in its own pages. Mahmood later said that he was told by the editor that his column had created a \"hostile environment, \" in which at least one daily staffer felt threatened, and that he must write a letter of apology to the staff. When he refused, the daily fired him, and the subsequent vandalism of his apartment served to confirm his status as thought-criminal. The episode would not have shocked anybody familiar with the campus scene from two decades earlier. In 1992, an episode along somewhat analogous lines took place, also in ann arbor. In this case, the offending party was the feminist videographer carol jacobsen, who had produced an exhibition documenting the lives of sex workers.",

Czech researchers randomly assigned 54 diabetics ages 30 to 70 to a 12-week diet of either two or six meals a day. Both groups ate the same number of daily calories. Then the groups switched diets for another 12 weeks. The study appears online in diabetologia. The differences were not dramatic, but compared with those eating six meals a day, those who ate just breakfast and lunch reduced their weight and waist circumference. Those eating fewer meals also had improved fasting glucose levels, lower liver fat content and better insulin sensitivity. \"not only our study, but others too, show that it may be more beneficial to eat a larger breakfast and lunch with a small dinner, \" said the lead author, dr. Hana kahleova, a researcher at the institute for clinical and experimental medicine in prague. \"we confirmed the ancient proverb, \" she added, \"eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. \""

        "summary": "Hoping to erase all memory of its recent troubles, uber has unveiled a host of new policies aimed at better treatment of its drivers — though forgetful riders might not be so thrilled. Among the recent policy changes making headlines is a new rule requiring riders to pay $ 15 to have an uber driver return an item accidentally left behind, reports the verge. The delivery was previously free to the ire of drivers, who will now enjoy other perks. Us drivers, for example, are eligible to receive tips, begin getting paid after two minutes of waiting for a rider, and will have bad ratings as a result of unavoidable issues like app glitches erased. Drivers can adjust fares without uber's say-so, too, reports cnn. A driver will also no longer be automatically deactivated after three complaints. Instead, a complex formula will take into account ratings, driving history, and other factors, reports npr. But one of the biggest changes is the creation of a 24/7 support line for drivers, who previously communicated with uber via text message. \" we need to move away from the facelessness of what the company has inadvertently become, \" a company rep explains. That and other changes as part of uber's \" 180 days of change \" answer many drivers ' concerns. Some drivers, however, were hoping they'd also see a change in title from independent contractors to uber employees, which would give them access to benefits like overtime and health insurance.",

        "summary": "Members of the sunken south korean ferry's crew have been likened to \" murderers, \" and two more were detained today, the bbc reports. But some of them, the ap notes, were actually heroes, survivors say. Four gave up their life jackets for passengers amid a shortage; others broke windows to drag would-be victims out of the ship. One refused to leave until she got students to safety and was later found dead. Says the wife of another, who's still missing: \" his last words were, ' i ' m on my way to save the kids. ' \" meanwhile, the number of victims continues to rise and now stands at 108, the bbc notes. Families have agreed that after two more days of searching the rescue operation can become a salvage effort; authorities today set up an underwater robot to help haul up the ship. Relatives are acknowledging that it's unlikely any more will be rescued. \" it's been too long already. The bodies must be decayed, \" an uncle of one of the students tells the ap. In other news: one theory as to how the ship sank: it took a turn too sharply. Only two of 46 lifeboats were accessible because the ship tilted so much, the bbc and nbc news report. The ship's initial distress call came from a frightened boy who called the emergency number 119. \" save us! we're on a ship and i think it's sinking, \" he reportedly said. Afterward, about 20 more children called 119. Many child survivors may need therapy following the disaster. \" we're considering sending about 20 % of the patients to a psychiatric clinic with consent from themselves and their parents in the judgment that they require constant intervention, \" says a hospital chief, via yonhap. Classes at their school are set to resume this week.",

But 75 % of those victims are ages 35 to 64, most are men, and most are white. \" what i think very interesting in this is that these people have probably been doing this for a long time, so why are they now dying of it? \" asks the director of the addiction institute of new york. He figures most victims are probably weekend drinkers who wouldn't think they had a problem. \" this is showing the dangers, the real dangers, of binge drinking, which we tend to associate with younger people. \" the report also finds that 38 million americans binge-drink four times a month, with an average for eight drinks per sitting, reports time.

So say researchers in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences after looking at more than 2,000 fossils of prehistoric cats and dogs in north america. It turns out that when cats arrived on the continent 20 million years ago, which was about 20 million years after prehistoric canines started to call it home, cats were more successful hunters and helped cause the extinction of 40 species of canines vying for the same foods, reports the telegraph. \" we usually expect climate changes to play an overwhelming role in the evolution of biodiversity. Instead, competition among different carnivore species proved to be even more important for canids, \" writes the lead researcher. \" these results imply that competition among entire clades, generally considered a rare process, can play a more substantial role than climate change and body size evolution in determining the sequential rise and decline of clades, \" the researchers write. In fact, the canine species that survived that competition are the early ancestors of those alive today, including wolves, foxes, jackals, and of course dogs, reports mashable. What's more, unlike the calamitous effect cats had on dogs, prehistoric canines had little discernible impact on the course of cat species.

            "Extinction is a ubiquitous feature of biodiversity history, and although many lineages increase in diversity through time, most of them eventually decline and get replaced. Dinosaurs and mammals represent an extreme and iconic example of such replacement. Here we investigate the causes of the sequential wax and wane of three subfamilies in the dog family canidae. Contrary to current expectation, we find that competition from phylogenetically distant, but ecologically similar, clades played a more substantial role in canid diversification than climate change and body size evolution. Our results provide novel quantitative evidence indicating that competition from multiple clades can actively drive the displacement and extinction of entire lineages. Abstract the history of biodiversity is characterized by a continual replacement of branches in the tree of life. The rise and demise of these branches ( clades ) are ultimately determined by changes in speciation and extinction rates, often interpreted as a response to varying abiotic and biotic factors. However, understanding the relative importance of these factors remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here we analyze the rich north american fossil record of the dog family canidae and of other carnivores to tease apart the roles of competition, body size evolution, and climate change on the sequential replacement of three canid subfamilies ( two of which"

The us imports more beer from its neighbor to the south than all other importers put together, and corona is the country's fifth best-selling beer, the wall street journal reported in 2015. But the mayor of the municipality of zaragoza just south of the us border says a brewery there — which produces corona among other beers and was bought by us firm constellation brands in 2013 — is sucking so much water from the region's already dry wells that it has left the area bone dry. \" we have no water for human consumption, \" he writes in a single-sentence letter to the coahuila state governor, and tells the guardian there's \" barely a drop of water when you open the tap. \" the beer produced by the brewery is exported to the us, and constellation brands in june 2015 announced a $ 2 billion investment to expand the facility, reuters reported. Its aim: to produce and fill 20 million bottles of beer a day by 2017. In comments to the guardian, a rep for the brewery dismissed the mayor's comments, saying the local aquifer is replenished at rate greater than that at which the brewery removes beer from it. He also asserted that zaragoza would have water problems even without the presence of the brewery. Indeed, a public administration professor notes arid conditions are typical of the region, though he blames business interests for making the problem worse. \" we're still giving concessions to private entities on the premise of bringing jobs. \" constellation brands had previously said the expanded brewery would mean another 2,500 jobs.",

Harteau is leaving the police department less than a week after justine damond was shot and killed by officer mohamed noor. \" i've lost confidence in the chief's ability to lead us further — and from the many conversations i've had with people around our city, especially this week, it is clear that she has lost the confidence of the people of minneapolis as well, \" hodges said in a statement. According to the new york times, authorities have yet to offer any explanation for the shooting of damond. The 40-year-old australian woman had called 911 saturday night to report a possible sexual assault near her home. Harteau had been widely criticized for not returning to minneapolis from vacation quickly enough following the shooting. She said she was \" backpacking in the mountains \" at the time, so it was difficult to get back, abc news reports. Minneapolis city council members had also expressed a desire for harteau to resign friday. \" last saturday's tragedy, as well as some other recent incidents, have caused me to engage in deep reflection, \" harteau said in a statement announcing her resignation. Harteau had been with the minneapolis police department for 30 years. Mayor hodges is facing re-election in november and has been criticized for her handling of police issues. The shooting of damond was ruled a homicide and is under investigation.",

More: the soccer chiefs are being held pending possible extradition to the us on federal corruption charges that go back more than 20 years and include alleged bribery involving world cup bids, sources tell the new york times. The times'sources say us prosecutors targeted members of fifa's powerful and secretive executive committee, and the bbc reports that those arrested include jeffrey webb, head of the confederation for north and central america and the caribbean. The officials arrested in zurich do not include fifa president sepp blatter — who is up for re-election friday — but sources tell the guardian that nearly a dozen other soccer officials worldwide may have been arrested overnight. The bribery allegations are believed to center on bidding for the 2018 and 2022 world cups, and the swiss have now opened their own investigation into the bidding, reports the bbc. The charges follow a long fbi investigation, reports cnn, which notes that although most or all of the alleged bribery is believed to have occurred outside the us, american prosecutors may be able to claim jurisdiction because of the long reach of us banking regulations, and because the us is the biggest world cup television market.

        "summary": "The shooting that upended a 60-year-old tradition in louisville on thanksgiving may have been sparked by a spat over a motorcycle. Police reportedly believe that during thursday's juice bowl football games, a man in his 60s knocked into the motorcycle of a man in his 20s, who pulled out a gun, reports the louisville courier-journal. After initial shots were fired, police believe bystanders also pulled out guns, a source says. Police say some 20 shots were fired in total. Two men were pronounced dead \" at separate scenes in the park, \" per wdrb. Wlky notes they were found about 150 yards apart. Four others were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. No arrests have been made. Authorities say the initial shooting occurred around 1: 30pm about 200 yards away from where hundreds, including mayor greg fischer, had packed shawnee park to watch football games. \" a guy fell, and i went over to see if i could assist him. And once i got there, i saw his brains were blown out, \" says a witness. Police have yet to determine if the victims who died fired shots or were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But given the number of people and shots fired, \" there could have been more victims, \" says a police rep. One local official says he hopes \" national shame and attention \" will now help \" stop the bloodletting \" in the city. The deaths brought louisville's murder total for the year to a record 112.",

Comey has said he kept a detailed record of his conversations with the president because he worried trump would end up lying about them some day. Some highlights from the 15 pages of documents, which were obtained by the ap: \" we need to go after the reporters. \" comey said trump discussed jailing reporters in a feb. 2017 conversation about preventing leaks. Comey said he told trump: \" i was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message. I said something about it being difficult and he replied that we need to go after the reporters, and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know, and it worked. \" \" beautiful hookers. \" comey said trump, fixated on lewd allegations in a russia dossier, told him putin had bragged about the beauty of russian prostitutes. The president \" said'the hookers thing ' is nonsense, but that putin had told him ' we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world, ' \" he wrote. Comey wrote that the president said it \" really bothered him \" if his wife had any doubt about the \" golden showers thing. \" flynn's \" serious judgment issues. \" comey said that at a jan. 2017 dinner, trump complained that national security adviser michael flynn had some \" serious judgment issues. \" \" i did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgment of any fbi interest in or contact with general flynn, \" comey wrote. Question about a flynn warrant. Comey said days before flynn's firing on feb. 13, 2017, then-white house chief of staff reince priebus asked him if the adviser's communications were being monitored under the foreign intelligence surveillance act. Comey's response is redacted in the unclassified version of the memos. Trump claimed to be vindicated after the documents were released, the washington post reports. \" james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction, \" he tweeted. \" also, he leaked classified information. Wow! will the witch hunt continue? \" comey told cnn that he had no problem with memos being turned over to congress and said they were consistent with what he wrote in his memoir. \" i think what folks will see if they get to see the memos is i",

Rain provided the voice for the hal 9000 computer, which eventually turns against the human astronauts when it realizes they intend to disconnect him. \" i ' m sorry, dave, i ' m afraid i can't do that, \" rain informs astronaut dave bowman when bowman famously asks him to open the pod bay doors ( see the movie clip here ). Rain has died at age 90, reports the bbc. The news was announced by the stratford festival, of which rain was a founding member. Earlier this year, the new york times wrote a story about rain's role in the movie, noting that he wasn't kubrick's first choice. Kubrick picked martin balsam, but he then decided the actor sounded \" too colloquially american. \" he turned instead to rain after hearing his voice in a 1960 documentary called universe. \" i think he's perfect, \" kubrick wrote at the time. \" the voice is neither patronizing, nor is it intimidating, nor is it pompous, overly dramatic, or actorish. \" the article makes the case that rain's calm cadence has influenced how devices such as amazon's alexa and google home are heard today — and anthony hopkins used it as a model for his hannibal lecter. Rain wasn't primarily a voice actor, though: he had a distinguished career on the stage. ( see where the movie ranks on a list of sci-fi classics. )",

Activists in del norte and tehama counties want to break away from the golden state, linking parts of northern california and southern oregon together as the state of jefferson. Other nearby counties have already backed the separation effort, the ap notes, though actually seceding would require state and federal approval. And that approval seems unlikely, an expert tells reuters. \" there is no incentive \" for federal officials to pass the measure, he says. \"if you're one of 100 senators, you don't want to become one of 102. \" pro-separation activists in the sparsely populated area are tired of having little representation in state government. \" we have 11 counties up here that share one state senator, \" says movement leader aaron funk. Some in the conservative region feel disconnected from the state's urban areas. Up to 16 california counties could choose to join the movement, backers say, covering a quarter of the state's land but far less of its population, the ap notes.

Their primary goal is maintaining the body's look and feel rather than its original material, scientific american notes: \" they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials, so in terms of the original biological matter, the body is less and less of what it used to be, \" says an expert. That sets the work apart from processes like mummification, he notes, \" where the focus was on preserving the original matter while the form of the body changes. \" now, in addition to the skin replacements, lenin has false eyelashes, and instead of skin fat, researchers have molded a combination of chemicals to keep his skin looking the same. The body is re-embalmed using a bath of chemicals in alternate years. Lenin has kept scientists busy: during the period between the 1950s and 1980s, as many as 200 experts had jobs maintaining the body, scientific american notes.

Two statues were demolished at universities in the government-controlled city of kharkiv late friday, shown in videos posted on youtube, a week after kiev's parliament approved a law banning soviet symbols in ukraine. In the video, a group of men hook a noose around the neck of the first statue and tug it to the ground where it shatters. Then they cut the lock on the gate to a second location and use a van to tug another statue down. The bill, which also bans nazi symbols, has yet to be signed into law by president petro poroshenko, but numerous ukrainians have already begun destroying communist-era monuments. On friday the pro-kiev governor's office in lugansk, an eastern region partly split between the government and separatists, said another lenin statue had been daubed in yellow and blue, ukraine's national colours, and later toppled in the village of stanytsya luganska. \" staff from the district administration came to work in the morning and found lenin in a horizontal position, \" governor gennady moskal said in a statement on friday. \" clearly the leader of the world proletariat could not"

Researchers say that as the arctic warms, greenland's jakobshavn glacier has become the fastest-moving glacier in the world, hitting speeds of 150 feet per day in summer 2012 and pushing more and more ice into the sea, the christian science monitor reports. The glacier — essentially a river of ice inside the greenland ice sheet — is moving around four times as fast as it was in the ' 90s, when it was already one of the world's fastest-moving glaciers. This glacier alone has contributed an extra millimeter to sea levels over the last decade, making the acceleration alarming news. \" as the glaciers flow faster, they discharge more icebergs to the ocean, and as you pour more ice into the ocean, sea level goes up and the ice sheet goes down, \" the lead researcher tells npr. \" so the fact that this glacier is flowing so much faster means it's actually making a much bigger contribution to sea level. \" scientists tracking the melting ice have employed an unusual tool — rubber ducks.",

        "summary": "When a skiing accident left her trapped in an icy mountain stream, anna bågenholm's core body temperature dropped to an astonishing 56.7 degrees fahrenheit — and that may just have saved her life. The atlantic this week printed an excerpt from kevin fong's book extreme medicine that recounts bågenholm's incredible 1999 rescue in norway. By the time a helicopter got bågenholm to tromso university hospital, her heart hadn't beaten in two hours. But the team decided to try to resuscitate her anyway, on the theory that the extreme cold might have preserved her brain. To raise her body the required 42 degrees quickly and safely, doctors extracted her blood with a heart-lung bypass machine and heated it before recirculating it. Miraculously, her heart resumed beating, and 12 days later bågenholm awoke. At first she was paralyzed, and she cursed doctors for not letting her die. But she'd suffered no spinal damage, only nerve damage, and slowly that recovered. Six years later she was able to ski again, and she's now a doctor at tromso. \" doctors exploited anna bågenholm's profound hypothermia to successfully resuscitate her. \" fong concludes. She is \" living proof that extremes can cure as well as kill. \" bågenholm's case was extensively covered at the time as well; in 2000 she told cbs that \" as a medical person, i think it's amazing that i ' m alive. \"",

The national labor relations board changed a three-decade-old definition about which companies should be called \" joint employers, \" reports bloomberg. The term now covers companies that use subcontractors or other middlemen operations to supply employees, meaning unions can now negotiate with the parent company as well as the subcontractor that hired them, explains the new york times. The old rule is \" increasingly out of step with changing economic circumstances, particularly the recent dramatic growth in contingent employment relationships, \" declared the nlrb, which split 3-2 along party lines. The ruling stems from a recycling company that used a temporary staffing agency, but it will be applied to pending cases involving mcdonald's. In fact, it \" could upend the traditional arms-length relationship that has prevailed between corporate titans such as mcdonald's and its neighborhood fast-food franchises, \" says the post.

Not only would she show up late for filming, but the two butted heads over her personal life. Cosby opposed her doing a nude sex scene in the movie angel heart and appearing topless in a magazine. Her pregnancy and engagement to lenny kravitz was also an issue. Cosby eventually fired bonet over \" creative differences. \" the legendary comedian is now facing a retrial on some of the allegations against him.

Below are 10 ways in which technology is transforming the way we think about — or have — sex. Lab-grown vaginas are helping women born with a rare genetic condition called vaginal aplasia have normal sex lives, and scientists are closing in on lab-grown penises. No partner? no problem. You can 3d-print your own sex toys ( at ups, apparently ). If you're worried about your sexual prowess, italian researchers have created a gadget that tracks your movements in bed. The wearable humove device monitors how many thrusts you take before you orgasm — and could help doctors help those with sexual dysfunction. Setting up a video camera was so 1999.
