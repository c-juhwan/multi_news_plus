        "summary": "People all around the world reported hearing radio distress calls from amelia earhart in july 1937, and many of them were dismissed as hoaxes. But a research group has just published a comprehensive study of all distress calls in the days after earhart disappeared and concludes that 57 of them are legit in regard to the famous aviator, reports usa today. The international group for historic aircraft recovery, or tighar, says the calls prove its theory that earhart and navigator fred noonan survived for at least a week or so after crashing on a remote pacific island. Based on the timing of the calls, the researchers say that earhart returned to the disabled plane only at low tide to send her pleas for help, as those were the only times she could run the engine without the risk of flooding it. \" waters high, \" \" water's knee deep, \" and \" help us quick \" were among the snippets heard by a teen in florida, per the washington post. \" plane down on uncharted island, \" heard a woman in texas. Tighar says the calls disprove the navy's long-held conclusion that earhart's plane crashed in the ocean and sank immediately. So how did people so far away hear messages from earhart's radio? tighar chalks it up to \" harmonic frequencies \" that \"'skip ' off the ionosphere and can carry great distances, \" per the post. Perhaps the most harrowing of the calls deemed legit is the final one: \" can you read me? this is amelia earhart.... Please come in, \" a woman in canada reported hearing on july 7, five days after earhart's plane disappeared. \" we have taken in water, my navigator is badly hurt.... We can't hold on much longer. \" ( catch up on all the various earhart theories here. )",

On tuesday — what would be earhart's 121st birthday — gillespie is hoping to put an end to the question of what happened to the famed aviator by releasing a 30-page report that he believes verifies, and connects, these radio signals to her disappearance. Gillespie originally compiled his catalog in 2011 with his senior researcher bob brandenburg, aiming to debunk the claim by government officials who at the time dismissed the radio signals as hoaxes after searchers failed to find any trace of earhart or her plane. But, gillespie said, it was still too complex. And year after year, theories continued to surface describing in detail the disappearance of earhart, whose death 81 years ago has captivated a nation enthralled in a mystery that may never find true resolve. Gillespie says he hopes his report on tuesday will help put an end to the theories. In the analysis of the more than 100 calls sent the week following earhart's disappearance — 57 of which were determined credible by gillespie — the distress signals paint an intimate portrait of life, and later death, for earhart and noonan while stranded in the pacific. \"these signals give us a glimpse into those last days before",

        "summary": "A horrifying story out of arizona, where 17 dogs died at a pet boarding facility after one dog apparently chewed through a wire and disabled the air conditioning in the room where 28 dogs were sleeping. Authorities say employees at green acre in gilbert, arizona, checked on the dogs at 11pm thursday, then again at 5: 30am friday — and discovered that many were dead and others were \" overheated and unresponsive. \" they took them outside and sprayed them down with water, but were unable to save them, the arizona republic reports. Some of the dog owners say the owners of the green acre initially called them saturday and told them their dogs got loose and ran away. ( one dog owner provided a voicemail from the facility owners to fox 10, in which the caller claims to be out searching for the missing dogs. ) some owners went to the facility or sent friends to search, and only then discovered their dogs were actually dead, kpho reports. One dog did actually get loose, and owners are still searching for him. The dogs ' bodies were piled in a shed, a sheriff's spokesperson says. An animal care and control spokesperson acknowledges the deaths may \" seem a little odd \" and \" suspicious, \" and some of the owners agree, pointing out to wptv that it was just 80 degrees thursday night; one owner is convinced her dogs died earlier than thursday and is getting necropsies done. But factors such as room size and ventilation could have played a role, says the acc spokesperson. The business owners say the dogs sleep in a room attached to the house that is usually kept at 72 degrees, and that they each have their own space. No charges have been filed, though the dog owners are keeping pressure on investigators. The green acre owners, who were out of town when the incident occurred, say this was \" truly an accident \" that also took the life of one of their own dogs, and that the initial, false explanation came from simply not \" thinking straight. \" says one owner: \" the wire was sparking. My whole house could have burned down. \"",

The release of some 33 million users'data from the dating affair website has led to two unconfirmed suicides, police say, and may have caused a police captain in san antonio, texas, to take his own life, the toronto star reports. \" the victimization is around the world, \" says evans. \" we're talking about families, we're talking about their children, we're talking about wives, about their male partners. \" the texas police captain, 25-year veteran michael gorhum, killed himself last week after his name appeared in the leak, the new york daily news reports. San antonio police haven't commented, but the san antonio express-news reports that three city employees — including a police captain and a detective — were on the list of leaked names. In recapping events, toronto police say the hacker group impact team contacted ashley madison parent company avid life last month, demanding that the website be shut down; the message came with the ac/dc song, \" thunderstruck. \" avid life refused to shut it down, and now offers a $ 500,000 reward in the case. Meanwhile, police are warning people to avoid fake websites that claim to list the victims but actually take your money or spread malware. The san francisco chronicle offers a tool to check email addresses on the list, but warns that \" it's uncertain whether the person associated with that account was using ashley madison. \"",

        "summary": "She's said it before and she's saying it again: ruth bader ginsburg isn't going anywhere. In an interview with elle, the 81-year-old supreme court justice, who reacted furiously to the hobby lobby ruling, says women's rights will take a more progressive turn \" when we have a more functioning congress. \" until then, she ' ll be sitting on the bench. \" anybody who thinks that if i step down, obama could appoint someone like me, they're misguided, \" she says. But as admirable as her intentions are and as important as she is on the court, her refusal to retire is the wrong choice, writes erwin chemerinsky at politico. And it may already be too late to right it. Had she retired this summer, president obama could have chosen \" virtually anyone \" as her replacement, including \" someone of similar ideology, \" chemerinsky argues. However, a republican majority could take over the senate in november and there's zero chance a republican senate will allow \" even someone slightly progressive \" to replace her. If a republican president follows in 2016, ginsburg's next shot at a progressive replacement will be when she is almost 88 years old. Now, ginsburg must \" give serious thought to timing her resignation \" or else \" everything she cares most about in the law will be in serious jeopardy. \" plus, \" the results in terms of all of our rights \" may be \" truly chilling, \" chemerinsky says.

But one ghost in the machine has become chillingly audible: alexa is laughing at you. People are reporting that amazon's echo devices have mysteriously started cackling at random, and the company has confirmed it's working on the problem. As first reported by buzzfeed, users on twitter and reddit have recently posted about the voice-activated devices laughing without being prompted. One user claimed that alexa didn't make the chime sound ( indicating that the device had heard the wake word ) before it broke out into laughter. \"i was trying to turn off some lights and they kept turning back on, \" a user wrote on reddit. \"after the third request, alexa stopped responding and instead did an evil laugh. The laugh wasn't in the alexa voice. It sounded like a real person. \" advertisement asked for comment about the complaints of echo devices spontaneously laughing, amazon told gizmodo, \"we're aware of this and working to fix it. \" it remains to be seen what the cause of the laughter is. It seems likely that this is a technical issue. I ' m hard-pressed to come up with one good reason why turning the machines maniacal is a way to sell an already pretty invasive device. Advertisement update 03/08/2018: an amazon spokesperson responded with the following statement: \"in rare circumstances, alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase 'alexa, laugh. ' we are changing that phrase to be 'alexa, can you laugh? ' which is less likely to have false positives, and we are disabling the short utterance 'alexa, laugh. ' we are also changing alexa's response from simply laughter to 'sure, i can laugh ' followed by laughter. \" a warning, if you will.",

I always say, ' hey google, how long is this podcast?'twice because she never gets it right. And as i ' m explaining it, fucking google home says, ' if you need help with a second request, i can help you. I can hear you, you know.

        "summary": "The number of us kids and teens who die from gunshot wounds in hospital has risen almost 60 % in a decade, according to a new report. The study by two doctors looked at data from 1997 to 2009, and found the number of those hospitalized with gunshot wounds rose from 4,270 to 7,730, while the number of those that then died from them climbed from 317 to 503, nbc news reports. Eight out of 10 of the wounds came from handguns, says study author arin l. Madenci. \" furthermore, states with higher percentages of household firearm ownership also tended to have higher proportions of childhood gunshot wounds, especially those occurring in the home, \" he says. As a result of the findings, the authors say, perhaps the national conversation about gun control should move from larger semi-automatic weapons to limiting the number of smaller firearms in homes. \" while public health resources and policies have largely focused on military-style semi-automatic assault weapons, it may be more crucial to intervene on handguns, \" says madenci, per medical daily. The director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research tells discovery that research and data like this has been sorely lacking in the field since congress stopped funding it in the 1990s. \" i see this as a huge step forward, \" he says.",

In the meantime, how is the trial's outcome sitting? a sampling: talk about an unsatisfying ending, writes chris cillizza for the washington post. When this trial began, the public was essentially out for blood, hoping to \" subject edwards to a final, public shaming. \" the mistrial squashed their \" chance to pass unquestioned judgment \" on him. And as for those who were just praying for the whole thing to end, bad news: \" the lack of clarity in the decision almost certainly will keep the sordid details of edwards ' attempts to cover up his extramarital affair in the news for a while longer. \" in a piece entitled \" a bad idea from before the start, \" andrew cohen explains why the trial was just that. Writing for the atlantic, he explains that the justice department was \" just asking for trouble \" by pushing such a case in \" the age of citizens united, \" and it ended up with yet another embarrassing swing and a miss. \" if you aren't going to fight the big ones \" ( ie, wall street fraud, writes cohen ), \" you have to land the little ones. \" sure, just charging edwards was \" stretching the law, \" but writing for slate, emily bazelon finds herself somewhat bummed by the outcome, and points to citizens united as well. \" in this election season in which politics is awash in money as never before, it was a small relief to imagine that someone, somewhere, could still get smacked for crossing the legal line. \" but writing for npr, frank james sees a little glimmer of hope. He talks to a number of experts who think it's not a \" total loss for the notion of campaign-finance law. \" sure, prosecutors lost, but at least they demonstrated that \" they can make life miserable for any politician they target. \" and if that keeps \" many politicians anxiously looking over their shoulders, \" that's a small success.",

Death-row inmates in oklahoma say the state's three-drug protocol amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, as evidenced by the botched execution of clayton lockett last year. Specifically, the inmates object to the use of midazolam, a sedative and the first of the drugs administered, reports ap. They say it doesn't work effectively, thus making the next two drugs especially painful. One unusual part of the case: the appeal was originally brought by four death-row inmates, but one of them was executed last week. A second is due to be executed next week, and the justices made no move to put the executions on hold before they consider the case. It takes the votes of only four justices to accept a case, notes usa today, making it a safe bet that it was the same four — ruth bader ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor, and elena kagan — who tried unsuccessfully to stop last week's execution.

The court's only republican changed his vote to an abstention, but the other commissioners left their votes the way they were. \" i am leaving my vote the way it is, \" said county judge clay jenkins. \" this is the body's expression of support for unity towards people, a recognition of juneteenth. \" he added: \" i want to encourage staff to make sure that all of the commissioners have the opportunity to actually read what they are voting on before that vote in the future. \" the resolution was non-binding, meaning nobody will actually pay anything, the houston chronicle notes.",

The issue arose in a resolution written by john wiley price, the county's only black commissioner. Described only as a \"juneteenth resolution, \" it was approved unanimously. Other commissioners admitted after their meeting tuesday that they hadn't read the document before voting for it. Commissioner mike cantrell, the court's lone republican, later changed his vote to an abstention. \"the reason why i didn't abstain this morning is that i had not received a copy of the resolution, \" he said. None of the other commissioners changed their votes, meaning the resolution remains the county's official position. It is, however, a nonbinding resolution, and no tax money will change hands as a result of its passage. The agenda for tuesday's meeting gave no sign that reparations would be a topic. The \"juneteenth resolution, \" commemorating the day slaves in texas learned of their freedom, seemed from its description to be just another routine proclamation. Others approved on tuesday expressed support for men's health month — it's june — the american kidney fund, and an employee in the tax office who's been on the job for 25 years. But price's resolution went beyond taking note of juneteenth; it included a long list of injustices endured by blacks, from slavery to jim crow to predatory lending practices. Then, in its final paragraph, it declared that the suffering of african-americans should be \"satisfied with monetary and substantial reparations. \" price read the entire document aloud at the meeting. But that happens with every resolution, and the commissioners didn't seem to be listening with a critical ear. With no discussion, price's resolution was approved by voice vote. Then, about an hour later, the other commissioners complained that they hadn't been"

After extensive talks in munich, world powers have agreed upon what they refer to as a \" cessation of hostilities \" between the regime and rebels that could lead to a lasting ceasefire, reports the bbc. The deal is set to take effect next week in what appears to be a compromise between russia, which is backing a major syrian regime offensive and wanted to wait until march 1 for a ceasefire, and the us, which wanted the fighting to stop immediately. The deal announced friday morning by john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov would mark the first real halt in fighting since the anti-government uprising began, reports the new york times. But while a major rebel coalition has welcomed the agreement and humanitarian aid may reach besieged areas in the days to come, diplomats warn that the deal is fragile and may not be worth the paper it's written on, the bbc notes. The only certainty is that the fighting is not going to stop entirely: the deal does not include isis or the nusra front, which have been designated terrorist organizations, meaning that russia and the us can continue airstrikes against the groups, per the los angeles times. The guardian reports that on thursday night, saudi officials repeated that they are willing to send ground troops to syria to fight isis, despite the opposition of the regime, russia, and iran. ( the war has killed or injured more than 10 % of syria's population, according to a new report. )",

Oceanographer and \" sea architect \" jacques rougerie is spearheading the creation of a sea exploration vehicle that makes any imagined before look modest.

The wind- and solar-powered vessel is designed to roam the water 24/7, searching for new life forms, lost civilizations, and more, news.com.au reports. The vessel will be 190 feet tall, with roughly 102 of those feet under water. It will have space for 22 permanent residents, including pressurized quarters for deep-sea divers ( or \" aquanauts \" ), so they can come and go without worrying about decompression. Sub-aquatic bees will swarm around the ship gathering data, while remote-operated vehicles plumb the ocean's deepest depths. There's even a pressurized space simulator for astronaut training. Construction will begin in the spring, core77 reports, and its initial explorations will be in the mediterranean.

The american chefs wowed the judges with their take on a lyonnaise classic, poulet bresse aux ecrevisses ( chicken and crayfish ), beating 23 other teams on wednesday to take top honors in the 30-year-old contest. Norway followed and iceland took the bronze, while the home team was relegated to fifth. A decade ago, team usa president thomas keller promised paul bocuse, the legendary french chef and contest namesake, that the us would one day \" make it to the top of the podium. \" he tells the new york times, \" we made it in nine. \" the challenge this year in a packed lyon hall was to whip up a meat and a vegan dish in five hours 35 minutes, undistracted by blaring horns and a thousand shouting, flag-waving fans. Imagine a higher-octane iron chef, \" like watching six soccer matches happening at once in the same room, \" per eater. Not surprisingly the chefs are typically young climbers who don't mind screaming techno music and mariachi bands. Like the best athletes, lead chef matthew peters, 33, and helper harrison turone, 21, took a year off from keller's new york restaurant per se, to train for the showdown. They came up with a headliner of chicken with morel mushroom sausage topped with lobster sauce. The vegan dish paired california asparagus with cremini mushrooms and a meyer lemon confit. Presentation counts for a lot, and this year's trend was complicated diorama-like spreads, per eater. ( see a photo of the winner here. )",

Nine years after viewers left lorelai ( lauren graham ) and rory ( alexis bledel ) to go their separate ways, the gilmore girls are enjoying a netflix rival with a year in the life — four 90-minute episodes, each following the characters through a different season in a single year. Here's what critics are saying: some not familiar with the show will \" think it too schmaltzy, \" but fans should consider this \" a beautifully wrapped gift, \" writes abigail radnor at the guardian. While time has changed the characters a bit — rory now swears and drinks scotch — \" for me, watching the specials feels like coming home, \" writes radnor, who describes the four episodes as \" a love letter \" from the series ' creators. It's \" a perfectly timed, if imperfect, slice of holiday escapism, \" writes meredith blake at the los angeles times, noting the show's \" seemingly contradictory blend of old-fashioned and modern, of wholesome and worldly, makes gilmore girls seem essential at this particular moment. \" the bad news: the episodes can \" drag \" thanks to \" superfluous subplots. \" she adds viewers might not be as charmed with this older rory as they were with her younger self. For daniel d ' addario, the show \" falls flat ' and suddenly feels \" fustily out-of-time. \" \" watching it i felt less nostalgia than confusion as to whether or not my apartment had become a time machine, \" he writes at time. He also wasn't pleased with rory's plotline, adding \" endless wisecracks, some dated but some not, just wither on the vine in scene after endless scene. \" though fans won't be deterred by his complaints, they \" do deserve better, \" he says.

Consider that the no. 2 best-seller for the company in 2012 was gone girl, which sold 2 million copies in various formats. The guardian notes that half of fifty shades sales were in the ebook format, perhaps because readers could carry it around without risk of nosy people knowing the title. The numbers, incidentally, are still nowhere near harry potter's. That seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies around the world, a figure that does not include ebooks. Still, fifty shades helped random house's operating profit surge 75 % in a struggling industry.",

The bill could allow people to sue if they think a law places a significant burden on their religious freedoms, and opponents are concerned it could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. ( one religious activist responded to the bill's passage by saying it could protect \" a wedding vendor whose orthodox christian faith will not allow her to affirm same-sex ' marriage. ' \" ) the legislation was recently toned down — some language that civil rights groups had a problem with was removed — but the aclu says it still opposes the bill. Republican gov. Phil bryant had promised to sign an earlier version of the bill. As for what the bill says, exactly, it's rather \" cryptic, \" writes mark joseph stern at slate — and that's precisely why it's dangerous. The bill \" cleverly couches its animus in seemingly neutral language, \" and has the intended effect of ending up as \" a bill so broad and opaque that no court could possibly quibble with the constitutionality of the text alone, \" stern writes. That will make it more difficult for a court to potentially strike it down. Stern goes on to explain why the bill is disturbing: it has the potential to keep the government from being able to protect lgbt people from discrimination. \" a landlord need only insist that renting to gay people ' burden[ s ] [ his ] exercise of religion, ' and a city ordinance banning anti-gay housing discrimination would be suddenly unenforceable. \" an aclu rep points out to msnbc that the bill \" exposes virtually every branch, office, and agency of the government to litigation, which will require taxpayer funds to defend. \"",

        "summary": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is often characterized as restless days followed by restless nights. In fact, the association between poor sleep quality and the disorder is so strong that scientists are now questioning whether lack of sleep is contributing to the rise in adhd. The good news, researchers report in the journal of clinical child &amp; adolescent psychology, is that whichever comes first, most kids with adhd outgrow it by adulthood. Specifically they found that among 2,232 twins they studied in england and wales from ages 5 to 18 — 12 % of whom had adhd as children — a whopping 78 % of those with adhd didn't have it at age 18. Study author alice m. Gregory of the university of london reports in the conversation that when it comes to which comes first, the sleep problems or attention and hyperactivity issues, \" the story can be complex. \" more so because, as they were able to glean by comparing identical twins who have identical dna with fraternal twins who don't, nature and nurture contribute almost equally: \" our analysis showed that the magnitude of genetic ( 55 % ) and environmental ( 45 % ) influences on the association were roughly the same. \" meanwhile, the cdc estimated in 2011 that more than one in 10 children in the us has an adhd diagnosis, reports us news &amp; world report. ( august babies, who tend to be the youngest in their class, are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with adhd than september babies. )",

One of the antiquated models on display at the university of reading's museum of english rural life ended up trapping a rodent and killing it, despite it having no bait and being somewhere around 155 years old, the bbc reports. Per a university of reading blog post, museum staff got an email last week that read: \" there appears to be a dead mouse in this mousetrap … which is not described as being there on the database. \" it turns out the rodent managed to get past university staff and into the trap, a feat that activated the device's seesaw mechanism and trapped the critter inside. ( you can see more on the design here. ) \" as we don't expect these traps to be working as mousetraps, we don't tend to check them regularly, hence the fact that the mouse sadly perished, \" the museum notes. The staff has decided to preserve the mouse — it was \" giving off quite a stink … and so was fumigated by our conservator \" — and will be put out for display in the museum's new galleries now under construction. And to combat any cynicism bred by jimmy kimmel pranks and other pr stunts, the museum had this to say: \" we can categorically deny that we planted the mouse in the trap in order to gain this publicity. Not only does it go against every rule in conservation and museum ethics, we don't think any of our staff are machiavellian enough to have pulled it off. \" meanwhile, one of the museum's archivists gives a shoutout to the well-constructed implements of yesteryear, noting to the cbc: \" let's pay tribute to the victorians, and how wonderfully they managed to make things. \" ( perhaps this man and wife who live like victorians are onto something after all. )",

Yes, that turmeric, the yellow indian spice usually found in curries. Haldi doodh has long been a staple in india for its purported health benefits — proponents say it's good for everything from depression to cancer — but the drink is now taking hold in the west. It's typically made with juiced turmeric root, almond, cashew, or soymilk, and dubbed a turmeric latte or \" golden milk. \" one telltale sign of the rising popularity: google searches for turmeric jumped 56 % from november to january, while searches since 2011 have climbed 300 %, quartz reports via the 2016 food trends report. Gwyneth paltrow's goop even offers up a recipe including ginger and turmeric, both of which \" have incredible anti-inflammatory properties. \" there are claims that turmeric also whitens teeth and fights acne, among many other things, notes a post on the \" hipster trend \" at india.com, which also recalls the chore of drinking the stuff as kids. Indeed, turmeric and milk might sound odd, but the modern version \" is creamy, with the comforting quality of a warm, yet slightly sweet, soup, \" writes imtiaz.

National transportation safety board probers have discovered that rivet holes on one layer of the 15-year-old aircraft's skin did not line up properly with the layer below, reports the wall street journal. Fatigue cracks were found emanating from at least 42 of the 58 rivet holes along the tear, which caused a sudden cabin depressurization and forced pilots to make an emergency landing.

            "Washington ( cnn ) -- investigators have zeroed in on several clues as to why the fuselage of a southwest airlines b-737 ruptured on april 1. In a report released monday, the national transportation safety board avoided answering the big question: is it a systemic problem that could affect scores of other boeing 737s, or was it a one-off manufacturing issue that just impacted the 15-year-old incident aircraft. Regardless of that answer, federal officials and the plane's manufacturers hastily ordered inspections of all similar aircraft in the days following the event. Of the 136 inspected, four airplanes were found to have crack indications at a single rivet and one airplane was found to have crack indications at two rivets. The incident scared passengers on southwest flight 812 when a large hole appeared, causing the rapid depressurization of the plane, as it flew at 34,000 feet. The flight crew conducted an emergency descent, landing at yuma international airport in arizona. No one was seriously hurt. From the beginning, investigators focused on the likelihood that metal fatigue played a role. The frequent cycle of pressurization and depressurization, along with the heating and cooling of an aircraft's skin, contributes to fatigue, investigators and the plane's manufacturer said. But the manufacturer said problems were not expected so early in the plane's life span. The skin tear occurred at a \" lap joint, \" where two sections of skin overlap and are joined together with three rows of closely spaced rivets. In its monday statement, the ntsb said the plane's aluminum skin was of the specified thickness and material, but it pointed to several factors deemed significant: -- the exterior surface was painted blue, but evidence of blue paint also was found between the upper and lower layers of skin, suggesting it had room to seep between the layers. The report does not say when the plane was painted or repainted, information that could indicate when a problem first appeared. -- microscope examination of the ruptured skin revealed fatigue cracks emanating from at least 42 of the 58 rivet holes connected by the fracture. There were also cracks discovered at nine rivet holes forward of the rupture. -- an inspection revealed gaps between the shanks of several rivets and the corresponding rivet holes for many rivets. Upon removing selected rivets, the holes in the upper and lower skin were found to be slightly offset relative to each other and many of the holes on the lower skin",

Police were unable to solve her disappearance even after the case appeared on america's most wanted, but new evidence suggests the man responsible may not have kept quiet. Investigators say a now-deceased suspect made \" partial confessions \" to several relatives over the years. \" they weren't sure what they knew, \" sgt. Scott grosser tells the houston chronicle. \" no one person had the full story. \" but when the man died in july, relatives concluded he may have been responsible for rosemary's disappearance and pointed authorities to a 60-acre family property where he used to hunt, about two miles from where diaz was last seen, per the chronicle. Authorities say remains were recovered from a shallow grave there on tuesday, exactly 25 years after rosemary disappeared. The remains haven't been officially identified yet, but family members say an amethyst ring was also recovered and was worn by rosemary on the night she disappeared. Authorities say the suspect was in his early 20s when he was believed to have abducted and killed the teen; they believe he had no connection to his alleged victim. \" exactly how did the abduction happen, there's no way to know, \" grosser says, per khou. \" the main thing is closure for the diaz family, \" he adds, per the ap. \" that's a family that has kept the memory of rosemary alive for 25 years. \" a member of the recovery team says officials \" made a goal two weeks ago \" to \" bring her home by christmas.

        "summary": "Suicide bombing is nothing new in terrorism circles, but for islamic state extremists, the tactic is getting a revamp. The sunday times reports on a new study released monday out of the international centre for counter-terrorism in the hague that shows a definite shift in how jihadi are using the method in recent months, leaning more toward how japanese kamikaze pilots functioned in wwii ( carrying out suicide attacks on military targets ) than how terrorist groups such as al-qaeda used suicide missions in the more recent past ( going after civilian marks for shock value ). In other words, isis has \" industrialized the concept of martyrdom, \" says study author charlie winter, per the guardian. Winter's \" war by suicide \" report examines how isis used suicide attacks over the course of a year ( from december 2015 to the end of november 2016 ), looking at 923 attacks carried out during that period and reported on in isis propaganda. Winter found that 84 % of the attacks had military goals; nearly two-thirds of the suicide attacks took place in iraq, and 70 % were carried out using a vehicle. He notes the resulting \" strategic implications... Will change the insurgent and terrorist landscape for years to come. \" in a thread on his twitter page friday, winter made another disturbing prediction: that more and more kids will be recruited to carry out suicide attacks. \" [ isis ' ] martyrdom industry isn't necessarily unsustainable, \" he writes.

Now, that man, a pakistani national, has been released over a lack of evidence, reports the ap. Prosecutors say no physical evidence places him in the truck, and no witnesses have come forward. \" the investigation up until now did not yield any urgent suspicion against the accused, \" says the prosecutor's office, per reuters. Police urged residents to remain vigilant in the wake of the attack that killed 12 and set up a hotline for tips. \" we may still have a dangerous criminal out there, \" said the berlin police chief. After the man's release, news broke that the islamic state extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The islamic state group's amaq news agency said in a statement tuesday that \" the person who carried out the truck run over attack in berlin is a soldier of the islamic state and carried out the attack in response to calls for targeting citizens of the crusader coalition. \" the ap reports germany is not involved in anti-is combat operations. But it does have tornado jets and a refueling plane stationed in turkey in support of the coalition fighting militants in syria, as well as a frigate protecting a french aircraft carrier in the mediterranean.",

On thursday, paypal cofounder peter thiel admitted to secretly funding hogan's lawsuit to the tune of $ 10 million. Reuters reports he's cheesed off about a 2007 gawker article titled \"peter thiel is totally gay, people. \" now comes news that ebay cofounder pierre omidyar has agreed to back the other side, both financially and legally. Omidyar's first look media is encouraging other media companies to file legal briefs in support of gawker, which, according to the new york post, would turn an invasion-of-privacy case into a trial about first amendment rights. \"to be clear, this is about press freedom principles upon which our company was founded, and about which we care deeply, \" forbes quotes a statement from first look media as saying. While omidyar, whose ebay acquired theil's paypal for $ 1.5 billion in 2002, denies any \" bad blood \" between them, the post notes the two are diametrically opposed, with omidyar a \"crusading liberal and philanthropist \" and thiel a \"free-market libertarian who backs donald trump. \" a jury awarded hogan $ 140 million after gawker published a snippet of a sex tape featuring him. Gawker tried and failed to get that verdict thrown out this week. Gawker ceo nick denton says it will bankrupt his company. \" the jury's verdict raises serious concerns about press freedom, \" reuters quotes a statement from first look media as saying.",

He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with improper handling of classified information.

Trump and romney are said to be meeting this weekend to discuss the position. During the campaign, romney called trump a \" phony \" and \" fraud \" whose election could lead to \" trickle-down racism, \" according to cnn. He was involved in the hunt for a third-party candidate to run against trump and clinton. For his part, trump called romney a loser who \" choked like a dog \" against obama in 2012.

We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel. \" capehart writes that the comments referenced \" a narrow band of young people, \" and he thinks that critics now accusing clinton of suggesting that most or all black youth fell into that category are being unfair. He also notes that bernie sanders voted to pass that crime bill, which was signed into law by bill clinton. Adds candidate clinton: \" i was talking about the impact violent crime and vicious drug cartels were having on communities across the country and the particular danger they posed to children and families. \"",

        "summary": "A woman who fired a handgun aimed at her boyfriend, whose only protection was a thick book, will serve just 180 days in jail following his june death. A minnesota judge approved a deal in which 20-year-old mother of two monalisa perez pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in exchange for 180 days, to be served in 10-day increments, reports the west central tribune. She'd faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, per usa today. But prosecutors emphasized it was pedro ruiz's idea to attempt the stunt in the hope of entertaining perez's youtube subscribers. Though he apparently believed he'd survive, 22-year-old ruiz was killed when the.50-caliber bullet went through the hardcover encyclopedia and into his chest at the couple's home in halstad. \" this foolish stunt was dreamed up, planned, and executed by pedro ruiz, and the defendant wrongfully and tragically relied on his assurances that the stunt was safe, \" norman county prosecutor james brue said, per the minneapolis star tribune, which notes the desert eagle pistol was a foot from ruiz when fired. The judge decided perez's sentence — which also bars her from owning a firearm and profiting from the incident or resulting video, which hasn't been uploaded — can be served in south dakota, where she now lives with her two kids fathered by ruiz. Two of ruiz's aunts say perez's sentence is too short. \" you took him away from us, \" one told perez in court, per the west central tribune. \" this comes from the heart, where you shot him. \"",

Australia's 60 minutes on sunday ran an episode that tries to get at what happened to the doomed plane and presents senior boeing 777 pilot and instructor simon hardy's \" discovery \" — one he first aired in 2015 but one that's now getting fresh attention. He pored over the plane's flight path and believes that captain zaharie amad shah was on an intentional suicide mission and skirted back and forth over the border between thailand and malaysia — eight times, he previously told the bbc — as a means of avoiding detection by either country's military. \" it's going in and out of those two countries... So both of the controllers aren't bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it's, ' oh, it's gone. It's not in our space anymore, ' \" he says. But there was another point that he pondered for a long time, reports news.com.au: why the plane veered off course and \" dipped the wing \" over penang, malaysia. \" and after two months, three months of thinking about it, i finally got the answer — somebody was looking out the window. \" hardy explains penang was zaharie's hometown, and he believes the pilot wanted to see it one last time before his death. A separate piece at news.com.au isn't satisfied with what the episode had to offer, saying too many holes remain. A big one: zaharie's alleged motive has never been established. Meanwhile, the ap in early may reported that a new scan of the indian ocean that began in january has covered 31,000 square miles but turned up nothing.

The management board of uluru-kata tjuta national park — made up of eight indigenous members and four government officials, per the bbc — voted unanimously wednesday to ban people from climbing the huge red rock beginning in 2019. The anangu people have discouraged climbs at uluru, which they consider sacred, since they took ownership of the site in 1985. Signs were later posted asking that people refrain from climbing in respect to indigenous peoples. Still, the anangu have long \" felt a sense of intimidation \" to keep the climb open to 250,000 annual visitors, board chairman sammy wilson tells abc australia. In what appears to have been a compromise, the board unveiled a plan in 2010 that stated climbing would be banned if fewer than 20 % of visitors were found to make the trek up uluru in australia's northern territory, and if alternative draws were created. The board says data now shows 16 % of visitors climbed between 2011 and 2015, down from 38 % in 2010. The route will therefore be closed permanently on oct. 26, 2019, the board says. Wilson calls the move \" a cause for celebration, \" noting, \" we are not stopping tourism, just this activity, \" per the ap. The australian notes the climbing path is already closed for 80 % of the year because of \" safety issues. \" at least 35 people have died climbing uluru since the 1950s, per the bbc.

The fed missed this mistake, too, which probably means that it \" did not review bank of america's capital calculations in any detail. Which is — really weird? \" it definitely inspires loads of confidence in the fed's stress tests, that's for sure! \" the lesson here is the usual one.

            "Last month, citigroup failed the fed's stress test because, even though it would meet minimum capital requirements in a severely adverse scenario, the fed wasn't comfortable with citi's capital planning process. Meanwhile, bank of america passed the stress test and was authorized to increase its capital return by about $ 6.5 billion, because the fed concluded that ( 1 ) bank of america would meet minimum capital requirements in a severely adverse scenario, even after returning the extra $ 6.5 billion, and ( 2 ) its capital planning process was, you know, adequate. Wrong and wrong! bank of america delightfully announced today that it's suspending its capital plan for mathematical ineptitude, and the fed, um, concurred. Bofa can resubmit its plan within 30 days, and will do so; it \" expects the requested capital actions to be contained in the revised ccar submission will be less than the company's previously announced 2014 capital actions. \" the press release is a little unclear so let's just do some arithmetic to spell it out. First up: how much capital went missing? the 8-k gives you a variety of choices: so that's about $ 2.7 billion of capital that's missing under current transition regulatory capital rules, or $ 4 billion under fully phased-in basel 3.

            "Last month, citigroup failed the fed's stress test because, even though it would meet minimum capital requirements in a severely adverse scenario, the fed wasn't comfortable with citi's capital planning process. Meanwhile, bank of america passed the stress test and was authorized to increase its capital return by about $ 6.5 billion, because the fed concluded that ( 1 ) bank of america would meet minimum capital requirements in a severely adverse scenario, even after returning the extra $ 6.5 billion, and ( 2 ) its capital planning process was, you know, adequate. Wrong and wrong! bank of america delightfully announced today that it's suspending its capital plan for mathematical ineptitude, and the fed, um, concurred. Bofa can resubmit its plan within 30 days, and will do so; it \" expects the requested capital actions to be contained in the revised ccar submission will be less than the company's previously announced 2014 capital actions. \" the press release is a little unclear so let's just do some arithmetic to spell it out. First up: how much capital went missing? the 8-k gives you a variety of choices: so that's about $ 2.7 billion of capital that's missing under current transition regulatory capital rules, or $ 4 billion under fully phased-in basel 3.

Experts have long believed there wasn't enough literacy for the majority of biblical texts to be inscribed before 586bc when judah's capital of jerusalem was destroyed and elites were exiled to babylon. In other words, these texts show parts of the old testament — including the books of isaiah, amos, and hosea, and parts of genesis and deuteronomy — could have been written earlier than previously thought. \" several ( biblical ) texts refer to events which best fit the reality in the years just before the fall of the kingdom of judah, \" finkelstein says, per discovery news, adding that some kind of educational system was likely in place.

        "summary": "A deadly lung disease is killing dentists in virginia at a notably high rate, and the cdc wants to know why, cnn reports. Friday's morbidity and mortality weekly report reveals eight dentists and a dental technician were treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at a virginia care center between 2000 and 2015. They make up about 1 % of the 894 ipf cases handled by the facility between 1996 and 2017, according to medscape. But newsweek notes dentists and dental technicians make up only about 0.038 % of the us population. The study published friday is the first to show a link between ipf and dentistry. The study's lead author, dr. Randall nett, tells cnn the number of ipf cases at the virginia care center involving dentists and dental technicians \" was about 23 times higher than expected. \" only two of the nine patients — all men with an average age of 64 — are still alive. The cause of ipf is unknown, but the study found occupational hazards faced by dentists could play a role. \" dentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work, \" nett says. \" these exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards. \" the chief policy officer of the american academy of pediatric dentistry says the report is \" not surprising, \" especially because the ipf patients were older and may not have been using modern practices and protections. One of the surviving patients told the cdc he worked as a dentist for 40 years and only wore a surgical mask during the last 20; he said he never wore a certified respirator. The cdc is planning to follow up the study with further research.",

With help from google glass founder babak parviz, whom amazon hired in 2014, the company is developing smart glasses equipped with the alexa voice assistant, reports the financial times. The glasses will reportedly look pretty normal, without a visible screen or camera draining the battery as with google glass. Amazon's glasses, however, will let users give alexa a command from anywhere at any time, rather than when in range of amazon's echo devices, without having to open the smartphone app, reports engadget. Users will hear from alexa through bone-conduction technology, so there will be no need for speakers or earphones. Like with other wearables, there could be privacy concerns if alexa is always listening, but at this stage, it isn't clear if alexa will be summoned by voice or touch, reports techcrunch. Ft calls the wearable an \" unexpected and riskier move \" than amazon's other tech devices, but it's only one new product the company has in store. Amazon is also working on a home security camera that will connect to echo devices. One or both new devices could be out by the end of the year, sources tell ft.

Police saw the whole thing, arrested three bolivian nationals on the ground, and grabbed the bag packed with us dollars. Interior minister carlos romero said the money would have funded a new cocaine production center or money-laundering business, reports the latin times. Those in the plane got away scot-free, but romero called the seizure a \" major blow \" to bolivian drug traffickers. The country remains one of the world's top three cocaine producers, behind only peru and colombia, as bolivia's drug gangs exploit a growing market in neighboring brazil. But the trafficking has drawn attention: just last week bolivian police shot down a plane and confiscated 690 pounds of cocaine being sent off to brazil, reports the latin american herald tribune.",

The 20-year-old rising star, whose real name is jahseh dwayne onfroy, was pronounced dead monday evening at a fort lauderdale-area hospital, the broward sheriff's office said. He was shot earlier monday outside a deerfield beach motorcycle dealership. Xxxtentacion had been at riva motorsports checking out inventory, the sheriff's office said. He was in his vehicle and preparing to leave when two armed suspects approached him. At least one of them fired, and then both suspects fled the scene in a dark-colored suv. Investigators don't have a motive, and no arrests have been made. Xxxtentacion notched a no. 1 album last month with his sophomore effort,?, and had a top 10 hit with \" sad! \" but was facing trial on charges that he beat up his pregnant girlfriend. Xxxtentacion racked up huge streaming numbers — on spotify, \" sad! \" had more than 270 million streams. He also has several songs that have been declared platinum, including \" changes, \" \" roll in peace \" with fellow rapper kodak black, and \" look at me! \" but much of his brief career has been mired in controversy. In 2016, he was arrested on charges including home invasion, and less than a month later was arrested on charges that he attacked his girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, and was jailed; he later faced more charges including witness tampering. He was released from jail on house arrest late last year and released from house arrest earlier this year to allow him to tour. Xxxtentacion was initially one of two artists spotify removed from its promoted playlists in may in accordance with its new policy on hateful music and conduct.

Does it pass muster? here's what critics are saying: the 3d screen is \"a wonder to behold, \" but it's also a \"sure-fire headache machine, \" writes adam b. Vary of ew. But the eye strain and upset stomach is worth it for the \"augmented reality \" feature, which overlays the graphics on objects around you. It \"feels entirely, addictively new. \" \"there's plenty to like, \" and this could even be \"a game-changer, \" writes mckinley noble of gamepro. But a lackluster battery life and the strain the technology puts on your eyes \"keep it from matching the hype. \" a lot of online features are missing, making the out-of-the-box experience \"somewhat half-baked, \" and putting a \"gaping hole in the handheld's allure, \" complains chris davies of slash gear. But \"the roadmap looks solid, \" and it should \"carve out a distinctively-nintendo niche. \" but the big question is simple: is the thing worth $ 250? \"that's a tough sell, \" says tim stevens of engadget, \"especially knowing that in roughly 18 months we ' ll probably be looking at a thinner, lighter, prettier 3ds. \" still, pretty soon this \"could be a genuinely hot property. \"",

Given the good news, public health officials are zeroing in on the 30 percent or so of people ages 50 to 75 who haven't been screened. That's about 23 million people. But many of those millions have good reasons why they haven't participated, so getting them in the door is going to be a big challenge, according to dr. Richard wender, chief cancer control"

There's apparently quite a demand for replicas of the iconic headgear worn by guy-manuel de homem-christo and thomas bangalter, particularly since the french electronic music duo released its first album in eight years today. Customers have been known to pay thousands for lookalike helmets sometimes featuring programmable light displays — then again, they're not exactly easy to put together. Harrison krix decided to give it a go four years ago, and it took him 17 months to complete a 749-step process involving blueprints, molds, circuit boards, and an auto shop that did the chrome plating. The final result was apparently more than acceptable to fans, because he was able to quit his day job and go into prop-making ( although now he sells only helmet-making kits, after an email from a \" concerned \" daft punk rep ). Other helmet makers also have scored thousands for their homemade contraptions, and a fan site founder has set up a special forum for would-be buyers and sellers. \" people are so desperate for these things that they are willing to wear everyday household buckets, \" he says.",
