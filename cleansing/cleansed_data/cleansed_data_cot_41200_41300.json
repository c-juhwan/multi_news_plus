Tatum, a janitor at the homeless shelter where missing girl relisha rudd lived with her family, is also believed to have murdered his wife before he disappeared. Relisha was last seen with tatum a month ago but police didn't get involved with the case until weeks afterward. Her mother has told police that she never reported her missing because she feared her other three children would be taken away, the washington post reports. Scores of police officers are continuing to search the park, where tatum was spotted on march 2 after buying supplies investigators believe were used to bury the girl's body. \" i ' m kind of mad he's dead because i want to know where my granddaughter is, \" relisha's grandfather told reporters.",

John montin, 52, is seeking roughly $ 33 million in damages and lost wages, saying doctors incorrectly diagnosed him as delusional and gave him needless treatments. He was released a year ago when a regional doctor reviewed his case and said montin had been misdiagnosed the whole time. \" it was an injustice, and he was right from the beginning, \" montin's lawyer said of him. It all started in 1992, when police said montin tried to take ownership of a house in rural nebraska, claiming it belonged to his ancestors. Police said there was an 11-hour standoff and a shootout, but no injuries; the story told at trial was quite different: that residents had greeted montin at the door with shotguns, that police may have heard just one shot, and that montin hid in a ditch overnight, the journal star reports. Either way, prosecutors dropped most charges against him, jurors acquitted him of attempted murder and a weapons charge, and found him not responsible by reason of insanity for false imprisonment and use of a weapon. Montin was then committed, and doctors presumed him delusional based on police reports rather than the court record. Then last year, a regional doctor said montin had been delusional only before being committed due to a back medication he was taking, one he went off of before entering lincoln regional center. How did montin finally get released? \" we were just banging the drums, and they finally had to start listening, \" said his lawyer.

            "A man who spent nearly 20 years locked in a state psychiatric ward in lincoln is suing doctors for malpractice, saying he was never mentally ill during his time there. John maxwell montin, 52, filed the lawsuit friday in federal court, naming 21 former or current lincoln regional center doctors, a program manager and two nurses, the lincoln journal star reported ( http://bit.ly/1mvkx89 ). Montin is seeking more than $ 22 million in damages for incorrectly labeling him mentally ill, unnecessarily holding him and subjecting him to treatments he didn't need. He's also seeking $ 760,000 in lost wages and $ 10 million in punitive damages. Montin was released nearly a year ago after a regional center doctor acknowledged montin had been misdiagnosed from the beginning. Doctors at the center had based his diagnosis of delusional disorder on police reports of a 1993 incident in which he was accused of walking up to rural house, declaring it had belonged to his ancestors and that he was taking it back. But at his 1993 trial, witnesses refuted much of what montin was accused of doing. A hayes county jury found him not responsible by reason of insanity of two charges: false imprisonment and use of a weapon. He was acquitted of more serious charges of attempted murder and another weapons charge. He was sent to the lincoln regional center that year. For the next 20 years, regional center doctors and others involved in montin's treatment relied on information from initial police reports that said montin was delusional, rather than court records that showed otherwise. But last year, a regional center psychiatrist found that it was medicine montin had taken for his injured back that had led to a medication-induced psychosis. When montin stopped taking the medication, which was long before he was committed to the regional center, the psychosis was gone. Doctors at the center simply didn't believe him â€” for 20 years â€” when he insisted he was not delusional. \" it was an injustice, and he was right from the beginning, \" said jon braaten, montin's attorney. Braaten said montin has returned to florida, where he has a business cleaning the bottom of boats. The lawsuit says montin missed the opportunity to marry and have a family, as well as his mother's funeral, because of the lincoln regional center's malpractice.

Burdick notes that the chainsaw was turned off almost as soon as it was turned on and tossed back in the truck, and while one of the men in the sedan suffered a knife wound in his abdomen, it was \" superficial. \" all seven suspects have been identified and four cited for disorderly conduct, reports ap, though more serious charges may follow.

Monday night changed all that with the cbs premiere of supergirl, starring melissa benoist in the title role, and even kryptonite couldn't stop its momentum. The show set a record for this fall's new-series premieres, pulling in 12.9 million viewers and achieving a 3.2 rating in nielsen's preliminary national estimates with adults ages 18 to 49, deadline and variety report. It helped that the show was preceded by the big bang theory, which drew its own 15.9 million viewers and a 4.2 rating, and cbs is hoping the buzz won't die down as it often does for other serialized shows as the weeks pass, entertainment weekly notes. If the series ' immediate reception is a sign, viewers will stay riveted. Writing for the los angeles times, mary mcnamara dubs the show \" super-charming \" and notes it fits neatly into the \" army of super-females ( albeit still in an exclusively caucasian palette ) \" the network has been promoting via shows like the good wife and madam secretary. And in the washington post, hank stuever compiles a short list for \" everything it gets right, \" including the writing and editing, the casting ( \" benoist is one of those rare out-of-nowhere casting miracles \" ), the show's \" easy-breezy feminism, \" and its \" millennial wish-fulfillment. \" calling the show a \" world... Light-years apart from, say, hbo's girls, \" he notes it's \" one of the few shows on tv that seem to effortlessly embrace both the inhibitions and independence of someone who is proudly young, without a single scene that involves texting etiquette, swiping, or whining â€¦ about how hard her life is compared with everyone else's. \"",

        "summary": "Partiers at dance clubs and raves around the world are snorting a new drug to get their high: the chocolate ingredient cacao. You read that right. Raw cacao's rise as the hot new party drug started in berlin â€” which ifl science calls the \" hipster capital of the world. \" there, ozy reports, an alcohol-free dance party called lucid has been serving it as a drink. The organizer of lucid calls it a \" smooth, sensual hug in a cup. \" but drinking it wasn't enough: a major rave organizer started offering cacao in pill form, and a belgian chocolatier crafted a $ 50 device that allows partiers to snort cacao powder like it's cocaine chocolate. You can see video of it here. According to maxim, the device was invented as a birthday gift for members of the rolling stones. Ifl science explains that cacao was used by the aztecs and mayans \" during rituals and ceremonies in order to elevate participants to a state of ecstasy. \" it contains endorphins; an amino acid that plays a role in the production of dopamine; blood-flow boosting antioxidants; and magnesium, which ozy describes as having \" de-tensing \" characteristics. A number of studies have shown cacao improves cognitive function, the independent adds. But a chocolate scientist tells ozy there's not enough of any of those compounds in cacao to actually alter people's moods, meaning the trendy millennials rolling on cacao at the club are probably enjoying a placebo effect. Plus, just because it's safe to eat, doesn't mean it's safe to stick up your nose, notes ifl science. ( during wwii, nazis turned chocolate bars into secret weapons. )",

Among the details from today's testimony: sybrina fulton told the court that martin had a pair of tattoos bearing the names of his great-grandmother, grandmother, and herself. O ' mara asked sybrina if anyone had \" prepared \" her before she heard the recording; she said no. He also noted that \" the only alternative \" to martin screaming was zimmerman screaming, which would suggest the teen was responsible for his own death, he said; he asked whether she hoped her son wasn't at fault. \" i would hope for this to never have happened, \" she said. Jahvaris acknowledged having initially told the media he wasn't certain who was screaming. \" i didn't want to believe it was him, \" he said, per the san jose mercury news.

        "summary": "After holding steady from 2000 through 2005, the us infant mortality rate dropped 12 % from 2005 through 2011, according to a new cdc report. In 2011, the rate was 6.05 deaths of babies less than a year old for every 1,000 births, down from 6.87 in 2000. Premature births also have been dropping since 2006, and many hospitals and other organizations have been working to prevent mothers from scheduling deliveries before 39 weeks without a valid medical reason. Researchers say both those factors likely contributed to the drop in the infant mortality rate, the new york times reports. Southern states, which have some of the highest infant mortality rates in the country, saw some of the biggest improvements. In georgia, louisiana, north carolina, and south carolina, the rate declined by more than 20 %. Black women, who have also typically seen higher infant mortality rates than white women, experienced a decline of 16 %. One report author calls it \" encouraging, \" but says the gap is still too large. The biggest drop was in the district of columbia, which went from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 by 2010. It has been improving services to moms, babies, and poor pregnant women. The highest infant mortality rates are in mississippi and alabama.",

Infant mortality rate declined 12 % from 2005 through 2011. Declines for neonatal and postneonatal mortality were similar. From 2005 through 2011, infant mortality declined 16 % for non-hispanic black women and 12 % for non-hispanic white women. Infant mortality declined for four of the five leading causes of death during the 2005 â€“ 2011 period. Infant mortality rates declined most rapidly among some, but not all, southern states from 2005 through 2010. Despite these declines, states in the south still had among the highest rates in 2010. Rates were also high in 2010 in some states in the midwest. Infant mortality is an important indicator of the health of a nation ( 1,2 ). This report describes the recent decline in the u.s. Infant mortality rate from 2005 through 2011. Changes in infant mortality rates over time are examined by age at death, maternal race and ethnicity, cause of death, and state. The linked birth/infant death data set ( linked file ) is generally the preferred source for infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity ( 3,4 ). This is particularly important for racial and ethnic groups other than non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black",
            "The states with the steepest declines in infant deaths â€” georgia, louisiana, north carolina and south carolina â€” have long been plagued with some of the nation's highest infant mortality rates, dr. Macdorman added. In all four states the rate dropped by more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which state data are available. The district of columbia, which has expanded a home-visit program for poor pregnant women and stepped up other efforts to keep mothers and their babies healthy, saw the biggest drop: from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 in 2010. The states with the highest infant mortality rates are mississippi and alabama, according to the report. But even mississippi saw its rate drop by 15 percent from 2005 to 2010. Dr. Macdorman said the nation's rate of premature births â€” babies born before 37 weeks of gestation â€” peaked at 12.8 percent in 2006 and had dropped every year since then. That is a likely factor in the decline of the infant mortality rate, she said. In 2009, the latest year for which c.d.c. Data is available, two-thirds of all infant deaths in the united states were among preterm babies. Another possible factor is a recent emphasis on preventing planned early deliveries.

            "The states with the steepest declines in infant deaths â€” georgia, louisiana, north carolina and south carolina â€” have long been plagued with some of the nation's highest infant mortality rates, dr. Macdorman added. In all four states the rate dropped by more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which state data are available. The district of columbia, which has expanded a home-visit program for poor pregnant women and stepped up other efforts to keep mothers and their babies healthy, saw the biggest drop: from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 in 2010. The states with the highest infant mortality rates are mississippi and alabama, according to the report. But even mississippi saw its rate drop by 15 percent from 2005 to 2010. Dr. Macdorman said the nation's rate of premature births â€” babies born before 37 weeks of gestation â€” peaked at 12.8 percent in 2006 and had dropped every year since then. That is a likely factor in the decline of the infant mortality rate, she said. In 2009, the latest year for which c.d.c. Data is available, two-thirds of all infant deaths in the united states were among preterm babies. Another possible factor is a recent emphasis on preventing planned early deliveries. A growing number of hospitals are not allowing mothers to schedule births before 39"

        "summary": "Andy and patty groves were dying to see their daughter again. Distraught over her grandfather's death, catherine groves joined a cult-like church in the tiny town of wells, texas. So her parents drove to wells, where catherine, now a docile believer, would only meet them in a shotgun shack at midnight with a church \" elder \" present. Thus began andy and patty's battle with the church of wells â€” a congregation led by three twenty-something men who preach a kind of calvinism ( man is a \" loathsome insect \" saved only by \" the mere pleasure of god \" ) and urge its 90 members to break away from their families, texas monthly reports. With the sheriff's office unwilling to help, what were andy and patty to do? like other parents trying to reclaim their adult children, they sought help from local clergy. \" every family that's called has the exact same story, \" says pastor josh luellen. \" it's identical. \" frustrated, luellen led a hundred townspeople outside the church of wells, singing \" oh, how i love jesus \" as an elder shouted back, \" you are false christians! \" since then, the townspeople have boycotted church-owned businesses and the church headquarters has been sold off, ktre reports. What's more, the local da is investigating the death of a church baby who received prayer instead of medicine, and an elder has been arrested in new york state for aggravated harassment, reports ketk. But the church lives on, and even posted a video of catherine's baptism. So it's a stalemate. \" it would be easy for us to say they should leave town, but i wouldn't wish them on anybody else, \" says luellen. \" i want them to come to the lord truthfully. \" click for the full article.",

        "summary": "Ford may have found a successful strategy for dealing with donald trump: letting him take credit for stuff it was going to do anyway. The company's announcement tuesday that it's canceling a $ 1.6 billion plant in mexico was seen as a big victory for the president-elect, but a closer look at the company's plans suggests trump didn't change anything, nbc news reports. Ford is still shifting small-car production to mexico, now to an existing plant in hermosillo, and the $ 700 million investment in a flat rock, mich., plant announced tuesday appears to have already been in the pipeline, with the plant building two models that were not expected to be built in mexico. Ford ceo mark fields described the move as a \" vote of confidence \" in trump's policies, though he said the same move would have been made if trump hadn't been elected, reuters reports. Joe hinrichs, ford's president of the americas, tells nbc that falling demand for smaller cars was the main reason for the shift. He says revised sales figures no longer justified building a new plant in mexico, and that meant money was available to invest in the michigan plant. The detroit news reports that ford is working with michigan officials to receive possible tax breaks for the michigan investment. The move is expected to create around 700 new jobs at the plant, most of them starting in 2020. Around 200 jobs will be added in hermosillo.

In the skripal files, urban writes that after waking from a five-week coma, skripal was at first reluctant to believe the russian government tried to kill him. The guardian has much more on urban's book, which incorporates a series of meetings he had with skripal in the summer of 2017, well before skripal was poisoned with novichok. Urban found skripal parroted \" the kremlin line in many matters, \" including those related to crimea and the ukraine, but reportedly expressed a reluctance to be quoted, saying, \" we are afraid of putin. \" ( an investigative group says it has unmasked the identity of one of the suspects in skripal's poisoning. )",

In the latest case, the woman says franken groped her behind while they posed together for a photo at the minnesota state fair. The development has only heightened the speculation on whether franken will be able to survive a scandal that began when leeann tweeden shared a photo of franken mugging for the camera with his hands hovering over her breasts. Tweeden also accused him of a forcible kiss. Details and developments: big distinction: this incident occurred in 2010, when franken was already a senator, notes ed kilgore at new york. That means the senate ethics panel has direct jurisdiction over this one, unlike the earlier incident, which occurred during franken's pre-senate days. \" it also quite obviously makes the tweeden incident look like part of a pattern rather than an isolated mistake. \" more serious: at the washington post, amber phillips writes that it seemed plausible franken would weather the first storm, because he could pass off the lurid photo as a tasteless joke. But now she's not so sure. The new incident raises the question: is franken \" a serial groper? \" franken himself has previously said accusers should get the benefit of the doubt. \" if we are to take franken at his word then, ( lindsay ) menz's allegations become a lot more credible. \" resignation call: the calls for the end of franken's senate career aren't coming only from the right. Credo mobile, described by politico as a \" cell phone company that maintains a liberal activism arm, \" called for franken's resignation monday. It wants minnesota's democratic governor to replace him with a progressive woman. Not yet? rich lowry of the national review finds the latest accusation credible and bad news indeed for franken, but perhaps survivable. \" this pushes franken closer to the brink, although i ' m guessing it will take something else â€” and perhaps something more lurid â€” to push him over the edge. \"",

But a wireless industry trade group is now suing the city, saying that the warning violates sellers ' first amendment rights by forcing them to distribute a message they don't believe, the los angeles times reports.

The group adds that the warning, set to go into effect june 25, gives off an erroneous message that will \" stoke fear in consumers about the dangers of cellphones. \" the warning doesn't explicitly say cellphone radiation will cause harm, the site notes. Instead, it takes the \" just sayin ' \" approach, mentioning that the government sets federal guidelines for radio frequency exposure and then adding that if a consumer puts a cellphone too close to his or her body ( say, in a pocket or inside a bra ) while the phone is on and connected to wireless networks, those exposure limits could be surpassed; it also notes \" this potential risk is greater for children. \" a berkeley councilman tells the san francisco chronicle the language in the notice was picked up right from the warnings in product manuals put out by cellphone manufacturers. Meanwhile, a law professor from harvard has offered to give the city legal advice and defend the ordinance pro bono because he thinks companies are wielding the first amendment as \" a bullying tool, \" as the contra costa times puts it.

La county sheriff lee baca estimates the damage to the la habra heights mansion, which was vacant but fully furnished and had been put on the market by its out-of-the-country owner, is at least $ 1 million, reports the san gabriel valley tribune. He calls the destruction and \" frenzy of looting \" one of the worst youth crimes he has ever seen. Organizers charged admission to the nov. 23 party, which cnn reports went on for 17 hours; more than 100 young people attended, the la times adds. A sheriff's department rep says the party originally started outdoors, by the pool, but \" at some point during the party, somebody forced entry into the house, which caused kind of a frenzy. \" partygoers also made off with versace suits, scuba gear, and medieval armor. The teen who snatched the leopard told police he grabbed it because \" all the good stuff was gone. \" thirteen of the teenage suspects are juveniles, and police say they were easy to track down because they posted selfies online of themselves with the stolen goods, much of which has been recovered.

The quake initially triggered tsunami warnings, but those have all now been lifted, allowing thousands of people to return to their homes, though evacuation orders remain in place for some coastal areas. But chileans are all too aware that bachelet, who recently returned to power, prematurely called off a tsunami warning the last time she was president, in the wake of a far more deadly 2010 quake. This time the pacific tsunami warning center backs the decision, however. It also said that california and the west coast were safe, though it warned that swimmers and surfers in hawaii might experience higher waves today.",

He handed over his wallet, but was shot dead after apparently insisting on getting his daughter out of the car before giving the robbers his keys, fox news reports. Police say he was shot twice in the face at point-blank range in front of his daughter, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Maurice roberts, 21, and his 16-year-old brother, marvin, were arrested saturday. Police sources tell the inquirer that the teenager was the one who shot grandzol for not moving fast enough. Both brothers have criminal records and police say they lived \" unsettled lives. \" police say family members assisted the investigation. Grandzol was a popular community activist whose second daughter was born just six weeks ago. \" those two gunshots just destroyed my life and my two daughters don't have a father now, \" widow kristin grandzol told kyw.

In kathmandu, a french rescue team helped pull a survivor from the ruins of a building yesterday after he had spent more than 80 hours surrounded by dead bodies, reuters reports. Rishi khanal, 27, was on the second floor of the seven-story building when it collapsed. He \" survived by sheer willpower, \" a doctor says. \" i had some hope but by yesterday i'd given up, \" khanal tells the ap. \" my nails went all white and my lips cracked. \" though he thought he would die, he continued to bang on rubble and drank his urine to survive. The united nations says international teams have pulled 14 survivors from the rubble so far, the bbc reports. But for many of the 8 million people the un says were affected by the quake, food and water is growing scarce. In a hard-to-reach district near the epicenter of the magnitude-7.8 earthquake, aid arrived for the first time today, the ap reports. A villager in paslang, which has been almost completely destroyed, tells the ap that his pregnant wife's final act was to push their 5-year-old daughter to safety. \" when i got home, there was nothing, \" soldier bhoj kumar thapa says. \" everything was broken. My wife â€” she was dead. \" ( experts warn that aftershocks could continue for months. )",

The washington post puts it in even more relatable terms: in the time it just took to to inhale and exhale, two people were displaced. The \" main driver \" of the trend is conflict, the post notes, adding that prolonged conflicts result in people being displaced for years at a time. \" the willingness of nations to work together not just for refugees but for the collective human interest is what's being tested today, and it's this spirit of unity that badly needs to prevail, \" says un high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi.

Of the 65.3 million displaced worldwide, 40.8 million are \" internally displaced persons, \" meaning they are still in their countries of origin. The majority of the 21.3 million refugees identified by the un are from syria, afghanistan, and somalia. Most of those have found refuge in poor, developing countries also at risk of conflict. 3.2 million people are seeking asylum in \" industrialized countries. \" in 2015, just 201,400 refugees returned to their own countries.

        "summary": "In august, archaeologists in greece announced they were about ready to enter what they say is the biggest ancient tomb ever unearthed in the country â€” which would mean passing by the two headless carved sphinxes that flank its entrance. Now those archaeologists say one of the missing sphinx heads has been found inside, along with fragments of the sphinx's wings. The 2-foot head, whose nose and lips are lightly damaged, was unearthed in the third chamber of the fourth-century tomb at the ancient site of amphipolis in the macedonia region. A press release notes that the clean break at the bottom of the neck is a perfect match with the eastern sphinx's body; when united, the head's wavy hair would flow over the left shoulder. The 1.5-ton sphinxes have red coloring on their feet; traces of similar coloring appear in the head's hair. It's the latest in a series of wonders given up by the tomb â€” among them, two carved caryatids ( statues of females that stand in for pillars ) and a mosaic that recounts hades ' abduction of persephone. Discovery notes that all these elements are represented in a marble throne believed to have belonged to alexander the great's grandmother. As for who's buried there, afp notes one theory: alexander's mother, olympias. As for why the sphinxes were decapitated, one researcher tells discover that after alexander's death, eventual successor cassander â€” who had alexander's widow and son murdered â€” could have destroyed the tomb to \" prevent olympias'supporters getting access to her remains. This would also suggest that olympias'remains are still inside. \" ( a sphinx was recently uncovered in... California. )",

Many weinstein company board members, including bob weinstein, have said they did not previously know about allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against harvey weinstein. In seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed, his lawyers argued in a motion that it was far too broad and \" would include all women who ever met with weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm as a result of that meeting. \" they quoted lawrence as saying in a",

Weinstein acknowledges the valuable input both meryl streep and jennifer lawrence have contributed to this conversation and apologizes, \" said reps for the much accused and disgraced producer today after the oscar winners both ripped him a new one. \"moving forward, mr.

Both streep and lawrence quickly responded in a scathing fashion to the use of their names in an ill-conceived and clumsy attempt at making them a shield for the also much sued ex-the weinstein company boss. The blowback clearly rankled the always media sensitive weinstein, who is distinctly persona non grata in hollywood and political circles ever since the new york times printed its october 5 investigation of his decades of alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault behavior. \"mr.

Both were white men who were in their late teens or very early 20s and died in the 1972 to 1978 time period, and both had a somewhat distinguishing characteristic. John doe no. 10 had suffered a left clavicle injury that had healed before his death. John doe no. 13 had an upper tooth that was displaced behind another tooth. \" it is possible that this characteristic would have been noticeable to others that knew him well, \" per the national center for missing &amp; exploited children, whose forensic artist created the drawings. Six of gacy's 33 victims remain unidentified. ( read about one victim identified in 2017. )",

        "summary": "Voters in turkey go to the polls sunday, but this is no ordinary election. Technically, it's about whether to shift from a parliamentary to a presidential system, reports cnbc. But the bigger issue is that it would result in sweeping new powers for president recep tayyip erdogan. Supporters say that's necessary to stabilize a nation in crisis, but critics fear what they say would be one-man rule devoid of checks on his power. More on what it means: the wall street journal lists some of the powers erdogan would get, including the ability to appoint vice presidents and cabinet ministers without parliament's approval, and the authority to dissolve parliament on any grounds and issue decrees. He'd also appoint most top judges, and the prime minister's post would disappear. The changes would mean that erdogan could theoretically remain president through 2029, reports us news &amp; world report. The vote is expected to be close. Reuters estimates the \" yes \" camp has a slight edge at 51 %. Usa today sees \" major ripple effects \" of a yes vote for europe, the middle east, nato, and the us. It notes that the us has a strategic military base in turkey. The nationalist movement party is on the \" yes \" side. Trt world lists its arguments in favor of a presidential republic, including that it's more in keeping with turkish tradition and will benefit national security. But the economist argues that a new constitution could push turkey \" into russia's arms \" while making erdogan \" an elected dictator. \" given that erdogan has shown \" how cruelly power can be abused \" since a failed coup, that does not bode well, the piece states. \" economist, mind your own business, \" responds fahrettin altun at daily sabah. He argues that the economist and western media in general are trying \" to interfere in turkey's politics \" to resurrect an ideal of a \" dream-like ' liberal europe. ' \" the new york times explores the question of whether erdogan is using a refugee crisis and struggling economy \" to shroud a power grab that would sound the death knell for turkish democracy. \" whatever the result, the short-term implications won't be huge because erdogan is already acting with increased authority amid the chaos. What it means for the longer term is a different story. Yusef kanli argues the referendum won't solve turkey's problems, no matter the outcome. \" a campaign might be over but the war still not, \" he writes at the hurriyet daily news.",

Llorens is alleged to have kidnapped sabrina from her estranged husband during a weekend visit, notes kvue; allen says llorens had mental health issues and had warned him previously she was going to take sabrina. Llorens reportedly went to great lengths to escape detection and changed the girl's hair color, according to my fox 7. She's being held on aggravated kidnapping charges, with bond set at $ 300,000, kvue reports. Local police and the fbi are set to hold a news conference later today.

Jamie's whaling station, owner of the leviathan ii, tells the columbia valley pioneer that it has already surpassed the recommendations, though.

        "summary": "Visiting honolulu? better get out of the habit of texting while walking, or at least while walking across a street. In a new law that took effect wednesday, the hawaiian city has banned looking at your phone ( or any mobile electronic device ) while crossing a street or highway. Anyone who does so in honolulu or the surrounding county can be fined up to $ 35 for the first offense, the new york times reports. Subsequent offenses will cost up to $ 75, and then up to $ 99. The exceptions: if you're communicating with 911 at the time, or if you're an emergency responder performing your official duties, techcrunch reports. ( pedestrians can also still talk on phones or listen to music while crossing streets. ) khon notes the fines aren't just tickets to pay; offenders must appear in court. Honolulu is the first major us city to pass such a law, npr reports. Similar legislation has been considered, but not passed, in multiple states and is pending in two states. Municipal laws aren't officially tracked, but rexburg, idaho, banned the practice in 2011 after five pedestrian deaths were recorded in a short period of time in the small town. There have been no more pedestrian deaths since. Honolulu officials cite safety as the reason for their city's ban; experts say people who text while walking are almost four times as likely to engage in a dangerous behavior like jaywalking or not looking both ways before crossing a street, and they also take 18 % more time to cross streets than those who aren't distracted by a device.",

Giacomi says before the attack, she was a \" productive, independent woman taking care of myself and my animals, \" but she has since had to move to florida to live with her son, people reports.

            "Well, that was painfully dull. The emmys, hosted by jimmy kimmel, proved to be an extremely good night for \"homeland, \" \"modern family, \" \"game change \" -- and no one watching at home. Those three programs swept the drama, comedy and miniseries awards, respectively, winning almost every single category they were nominated in and turning the emmys into a long, boring, predictable coronation. \"homeland \" kept \"mad men \" from winning its fifth straight best drama award in a row, but by the time this award â€” the second to last of the night â€” was announced, \"homeland \" not winning something, anything, would have been the surprise. As jon stewart put it, after beating out \"the colbert report \" yet again, in the future aliens \"will find a box [ of his emmys ], and find out just how fucking predictable they are.",
            "( check out thewrap's complete emmys 2012 coverage ) \" something has clearly gone wrong, \" jon cryer said as he accepted his award for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series. He was modestly referring to the debatable decision to choose him over comic geniuses like larry david and louis c.k. But he could easily have been talking about the entire emmys telecast. Also read: the complete list of winners it was hideous. Television had a very good year, and this was not the show it deserved. But hey: if the television academy truly thinks cryer is funnier on \" two and a half men \" than any of his competitors ( who included don cheadle, alec baldwin and jim parsons ), then this was exactly the kind of show they deserved. The show did have plenty of drama, in the form of a few wins that strained believability."

A perfectly preserved, 100-million-year-old amber fossil found in myanmar â€” the oldest grass fossil ever found â€” had a parasitic fungus clinging to its tip that's similar to ergot, the hallucinogen linked to the salem witch trials, disease epidemics, and most recently, the development of lsd. Researchers at oregon state university report in the latest issue of the journal palaeodiversity that it's the oldest evidence to date that some of the planet's first grasses, as well as the dinosaurs and parasites that fed on them, coexisted. The dark fungus clinging to the grass floret is called palaeoclaviceps parasiticus and is a relative of ergot. The sample dates back to a time when dinosaurs and conifers dominated the landscape, and grasses and small mammals were just beginning to evolve, reports redorbit. One theory is that fungi like ergot developed alongside grass as a defense mechanism, resulting in a foul taste that might ward off happily grazing herbivores. Whether this particular fungus would have had a hallucinogenic effect on dinosaurs remains unclear â€” after all, dose matters, and some of these creatures were huge â€” but the researchers say this much is now evident: ergot-like fungus has been around as long as grass itself.

But don't feel too bad for her; she still has more money than most of us will ever see. It was long assumed christy walton was worth approximately $ 32 billion after receiving the bulk of her husband john walton's substantial estate when the walmart heir ( one of the four children of walmart founder sam walton ) died in a plane crash 10 years ago, bloomberg reports. But the news outlet did some sleuthing â€” requesting access to records sealed at the request of the family following john's death â€” and uncovered what it calls a \" closely guarded family secret. \" that secret? the actual distribution of john walton's estate. Bloomberg reports john actually gave half of his estate to charitable trusts and another third of it to his son lukas walton. That leaves christy with only about one-sixth of her husband's estate â€” or approximately $ 5 billion, fortune reports. That $ 27 billion drop moves her far out of competition for the richest woman in america, a title currently held by her sister-in-law alice walton, another one of sam walton's four kids, who is worth an estimated $ 28.3 billion. However, the revelation does bump christy walton's son up to the 103rd richest person in the world with approximately $ 11 billion. The 29-year-old lukas keeps a low profile and little is known about him, bloomberg reports. \"lukas walton is an entrepreneur involved in a variety of investment and philanthropic activities, \" a walton family spokesperson says.",

( also on politico: clinton's 2012 track record ) clinton, in a ritual that would be familiar to anyone who has worked for him during the past 20 years, protested that his words were being wrested from context and blamed a manipulative news media for stirring up trouble to satisfy its own lust for chaos and conflict. But his own team, and eventually clinton himself, agreed there was no choice but to issue embarrassing what-the-former-president-meant-to-say clarifications, which were crafted in close consultation with senior obama aides at the white house and"

        "summary": "The death knell has sounded once more in 2016, this time to mark the passing of a beloved decades-old practice: labatt brewery retirees'days of getting free beer for life, a perk the new york times reports started in the 1970s, are winding to their end. The canadian company, now owned by beer goliath anheuser-busch inbev, confirmed monday that to cut costs, the retiree beer perk will be halved in 2018, with the freebie ceasing altogether by jan. 1, 2019. In corporate-speak, per an oct. 28 memo to employees: \" a recent comprehensive review of all the cost management options has led us to conclude that discontinuing free beer is the best course. \" that review showed \" our overall package of pension and retirement benefits are competitive and none of the companies we surveyed offered free product to retirees, \" per an emailed statement to postmedia news from a rep for labatt breweries canada. The company, which employs 3,000, didn't say how much the move will save. While the rep says the specifics of the allocation aren't consistent across all provinces, the cbc explains how the practice has worked up until now at the edmonton facility: active employees receive a gift card whose value is equal to 52 cases of 12 beers; nothing changes upon retirement, and upon the worker's death, the card transferred to the spouse. It's not the first time labatt workers have been walloped: the starting wage of $ 34 an hour was dropped to $ 24 for new hires in 2010. \" it's certainly not the way it was in the past, when there was fanatical devotion to the brand and the company, \" the president of the local union chapter tells the times. \" today it's just a job. \"",

        "summary": "Two mentally disabled half-brothers in north carolina have spent the last 30 years locked up for a murder they didn't commit, dna evidence has revealed. Leon brown and henry mccollum were 15 and 19 years old, respectively, in 1983 when they were arrested for the rape and murder of 11-year-old sabrina buie in the small town of red springs. Both were sentenced to death on the basis of confessions they later said were coerced, though the younger teen's sentence was later reduced to life. They were exonerated yesterday based on dna evidence that clears them of any link to the crime scene â€” and implicates a known sex offender who lived just a block from where the girl's body was found, the new york times reports. A judge declared the men, now 46 and 50, innocent and ordered them released. \" it's terrifying that our justice system allowed two intellectually disabled children to go to prison for a crime they had nothing to do with, and then to suffer there for 30 years. Henry watched dozens of people be hauled away for execution, \" mccollum's lawyer says. \" he would become so distraught he had to be put in isolation. It's impossible to put into words what these men have been through and how much they have lost. \" police in red springs are accused not only of framing the pair, but of hiding boxes of crucial evidence until just last month, the guardian notes. Roscoe artis, the 74-year-old man whose dna was found in a cigarette butt at the crime scene, is already in prison, serving a life sentence for raping and murdering an 18-year-old girl less than a month after buie's killing, reports the bbc.",

Shinichi kubo, a professor of forensics at fukuoka university, is announcing that it appears to be the country's first documented case of fatal daily caffeine consumption, reports japan times. \" we had never heard of fatal caffeine intoxication, \" the health, labor and welfare ministry said. The man, who worked midnight to dawn at a 24-hour gasoline station, had vomited on multiple counts in the year leading up to his death; japan times reports such vomiting can signal caffeine intoxication. The actual quantity of caffeine he consumed on the day of his death and in general is unknown. He was found to have trace amounts of alcohol and a high concentration of caffeine in his stomach ( in a granular form that suggested he might have taken tablets ), blood, and urine, as well as the remnants of a pill that may have also contained caffeine. Fukuoka university determined the drinks â€” reportedly mostly soft drinks â€” were most likely what killed him, though the school wasn't legally permitted to run extensive tests on the pill. Some experts put the lethal amount of caffeine ingestion in a day at 140 8-ounce cups of coffee ( containing 14,000mg ), reports the wall street journal, though the fda tells americans that 600mg ( so roughly 6 cups ) is too much. There have been reports of fatal caffeine overdoses in the us; this high school prom king died of a caffeine overdose just before graduating in 2014.",

Which laura whitney and michael korte would gladly do, except for one thing: they could also be fined $ 500 if they water their lawn too much; they're currently only watering twice a week. With more than 80 % of california in an extreme drought, according to the los angeles times, the state water board voted this week to implement emergency conservation plans and gave the ok to fine water wasters up to $ 500 a day. As the board's chairwoman noted, \" a brown lawn should be a badge of honor because it shows you care about your community. \" someone tell that to the city of glendora: \"despite the water conservation efforts, we wish to remind you that limited watering is still required to keep landscaping looking healthy and green, \" reads the letter it sent to whitney and korte, who were also told they have 60 days to remedy the eyesore. Gov. Jerry brown pushed an executive order through in april that says homeowners associations can't penalize people for not watering lawns during conservation periods, but, as ap notes, it doesn't keep local governments from doing so. In the meantime, residents are stuck trying to interpret the right thing to do. \"it's almost crazy because one agency is telling you one thing and another is forcing you to do the opposite, \" says an anaheim resident who also got violation notices for not keeping her yard green.",

As president trump's legal team reportedly tries to halt the adult-film actress's 60 minutes interview â€” tentatively scheduled to air march 25, per the washington post â€” a new revelation from her lawyer adds another layer to the drama. Usa today reports that michael avenatti made the morning show rounds friday on cnn and msnbc, and an exchange between avenatti and morning joe co-host mika brzezinski has started quite the buzz. When brzezinski asked avenatti if daniels ( real name stephanie clifford ) had been threatened to keep quiet about the affair she says she had with trump, and whether those threats had included \" physical harm, \" avenatti replied in the affirmative to both. The attorney doubled down when asked about it by cnn's chris cuomo. \" the fact is that my client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about donald trump, \" avenatti said. He wouldn't say who made the threat, what type of physical harm was broached, or when the threat took place, but he promised \" very specific details \" from daniels herself when her 60 minutes interview airs. \" i am confident that the american people after this interview are going to come away to have little or no doubt that this woman is credible, \" he said, adding that she wants to be \" unrestrained \" to tell the story of both the affair and the attempts to \" muzzle her. \" avenatti also told cnn that six more women have approached him ( some with ndas ) alleging sexual relationships with trump, though he says his team is still \" vetting \" their allegations, per cnn.",

        "summary": "Is it white and gold â€” or blue and black? a picture of a dress uploaded to tumblr has created what gawker calls \" an internet schism that may never be healed, \" with the opposing sides unable to fathom each other's view of the dress. At buzzfeed, the white and gold side is leading heavily in a poll â€” and its story on the dress \" drew more visitors to [ the ] site at one time than ever before \" ( at one point, more than 300,000 were reading the dress post; it's up to 23 million views ). More: assorted experts have weighed in to discuss the effects of the poor lighting in the photo and the peculiarities of color vision. \" it is yellow and gold in this lighting, \" an ophthalmologist tells mashable, explaining that \" scientifically it has to do with the lighting and reflectivity of the material. \" a neuroscientist also in the white and gold camp tells wired, \" our visual system is supposed to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance. But i've studied individual differences in color vision for 30 years, and this is one of the biggest individual differences i've ever seen. \" scottish musician caitlin mcneill, 21, started it all by posting the image on tumblr. She explains the back story to business insider: \" two of my close friends were actually getting married and the mother of the bride took a photo of the dress to send to her daughter. When my friend showed the dress to her fiancee, they disagreed on the color. \" and in an example of how odd the internet can be, the tumblr mcneill posted it to is a fan page she has on talent manager sarah weichel, who bi says represents a number of youtubers. Says weichel, \" the crazy thing is, i actually have nothing to do with the post. It's literally just a fan account of me, so my name and my photos are all over the account. \"",
