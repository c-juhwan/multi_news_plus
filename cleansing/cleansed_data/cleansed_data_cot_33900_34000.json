        "summary": "A group of researchers has finally found evidence to confirm what many have long suspected: narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease. The hypothesis has been swirling since 2009, when at least 900 children developed the chronic drowsiness disorder after being given a swine flu vaccine from glaxosmithkline, scientific american and reuters explain. That suggested that the narcolepsy was caused by the body's immune response to the h1n1 protein in the vaccine. Now, a team of stanford researchers thinks it knows what happened. Narcolepsy is largely caused by the loss of the neurons that produce the wakefulness hormone hypocretin. What the researchers found was a type of t-cell ( the cells produced by immune responses ) that specifically targeted hypocretin — and only existed in narcoleptics. \" i think these cells are a smoking gun, \" one of the lead researchers says. An unaffiliated neurologist agrees. \" it's one of the biggest things to happen in the field of narcolepsy for some time. \"",

            "London scientists have found that the sleep disorder narcolepsy can sometimes be triggered by a scientific phenomenon known as \" molecular mimicry \", offering a possible explanation for its link to a glaxosmithkline h1n1 pandemic flu vaccine. Results from u.s. Researchers showed the debilitating disorder, characterized by sudden sleepiness and muscle weakness, can be set off by an immune response to a portion of a protein from the h1n1 virus that is very similar to a region of a protein called hypocretin, which is key to narcolepsy. This can happen in genetically susceptible people, the researchers said, adding that around 20 percent of the european population have the genetic profile making them vulnerable. Previous studies in countries where gsk's pandemrix vaccine was used in the 2009/2010 flu pandemic have found its use was linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children. Studies in britain, finland, sweden and ireland found such a link, and gsk says at least 900 narcolepsy cases associated with the vaccine have so far been reported in europe. Narcolepsy is thought to be brought about by loss of function in \" wakefulness \" cells called hypocretin cells in one of the brain's sleep centres. Cross-reactivity emmanuel mignot, a narcolepsy researcher and director of the stanford center for sleep sciences and medicine who has been funded by gsk to look deeper into the link,",
            "The new results also partly explain why the 2009 swine flu virus and a vaccine against it led to spikes in the sleep disorder as the h1n1 swine flu pandemic swept the world in 2009, china saw a spike in cases of narcolepsy — a mysterious disorder that involves sudden, uncontrollable sleepiness. Meanwhile, in europe, around 1 in 15,000 children who were given pandemrix — a now-defunct flu vaccine that contained fragments of the pandemic virus — also developed narcolepsy, a chronic disease. Immunologist elizabeth mellins and narcolepsy researcher emmanuel mignot at stanford university school of medicine in california and their collaborators have now partly solved the mystery behind these events, while also confirming a longstanding hypothesis that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks healthy cells. Narcolepsy is mostly caused by the gradual loss of neurons that produce hypocretin, a hormone that keeps us awake. Many scientists had suspected that the immune system was responsible, but the stanford team has found the first direct evidence: a special group of cd4+ t cells ( a type of immune cell ) that targets hypocretin and is found only in people with narcolepsy. \"up till now, the idea that narcolepsy was an autoimmune disorder was a very compelling hypothesis, but this is the first direct evidence of auto-immunity, \" says mellins. \"i think these cells are a smoking gun."

He is taking some steps \" normal \" candidates take, such as readying offices in other states, prepping ballot-access drives, and working not only on a tax plan, but also initiatives dealing with veterans ' issues, health care, and trade, per the journal. But he still doesn't place too much stock in those, noting to the paper, \" people don't care about seeing plans. They have confidence in me. \" as for those picking his eccentric strategy apart, trump welcomes the challenge. \" i hope they attack me, because everybody who attacks me is doomed, \" he tells the paper.",

        "summary": "Mother earth has reached a milestone, but not the kind anyone will want to celebrate: the plastic floating in the oceans has been estimated to the tune of 5 trillion pieces in a new study. That's 250,000 tons, or some 700 pieces per person, the washington post reports. The 5 gyres institute arrived at this number by combining visual surveys and plastics hauled in by net from 24 ocean expeditions in 1,571 spots from iceland to the bay of bengal, livescience notes. Researchers then simulated how the ocean may transport this plastic worldwide. Still, lots of plastic is unaccounted for — like 99.9 % of the 288 million tons that plasticseurope claims is made every year. It may just be too small to see, because sun and ocean currents break down plastics into tiny pieces, the new york times explains. These pieces — many of them found in subpolar regions, adds livescience — may be ending up in the bellies of marine animals. \" plastics are like a cocktail of contaminants floating around in the aquatic habitat, \" a marine ecologist tells the times; these pollutants crawl up the food chain — and then back to us. And the tiniest pieces may also be hiding on the seafloor or shoreline, in the water column, or deep in the ocean. While researchers say their estimate is \" highly conservative, \" at least one ecologist says the count is overblown, blaming unreliable visual surveys and a computer model that overestimated projections. Still, one researcher says recycling and green choices are needed right away: \" the status quo is no longer acceptable. \"",

In one of the videos shared on twitter, guests can be heard bursting out into applause as the goofy mascot makes his way to give the groom and the bride, heather and karl schwemlein, big hugs. He then follows those hugs up with some impressive moves with the bride. \"the bride, heather grossmuller and her father, ray, are big flyers fans, \" explains her cousin, stephanie, who was front row at the bridesmaids'table when gritty made his appearance. \"once gritty came onto, you know everywhere, heather was instantly really into him. They were always joking it would be cool if he would come to the wedding. \" surprisingly, heather's father managed to organize the surprise, which has gone viral on social media.

        "summary": "Another remarkable find for paul allen: the billionaire microsoft co-founder funding the search for missing warships has discovered the uss juneau resting 2.5 miles below the surface of the pacific ocean off the coast of the solomon islands, reports the guardian. Japanese torpedoes sank the ship in november 1942 during the battle of guadalcanal, killing 687 men, including the five sullivan brothers ( george, francis, joseph, madison, and albert ) from waterloo, iowa, who would later have two warships named in their honor. One torpedo is believed to have struck the ship's weapons magazine, leading to a massive explosion that ripped the juneau in two, reports the navy times. The brothers were posted together after refusing to serve in separate navy units. \" we certainly didn't plan to find the juneau on st. Patrick's day, \" says the director of allen's oceanic searches. Allen's website explains that an autonomous underwater vehicle first spotted the wreck, before a remotely operated underwater vehicle confirmed its identity. A video notes \" juneau \" is seen on the ship's stern. After the juneau went down 76 years ago, the sullivans became war heroes. The first ship to be named in their honor is now a museum in buffalo, ny. The second, uss the sullivans, remains in operation. A commander of that ship celebrated the discovery, saying \" the story of the uss juneau crew and sullivan brothers epitomize the service and sacrifice of our nation's greatest generation. \" ( allen has also found the uss lexington and uss indianapolis. )",

The famous politician, activist, and liberal icon had a permit for a.22 caliber smith &amp; wesson pistol, the poughkeepsie journal reports. The permit went on display in june at the franklin d. Roosevelt presidential library and museum in hyde park, new york, where the first lady once lived. \" she made an off-handed comment that she sometimes did carry a gun when she traveled and she knew how to use it, \" says bob clark, acting director at the library and museum. \" she also made the comment, ' i hate guns. ' \" following an assassination attempt against her husband, president franklin d. Roosevelt, in february 1933, eleanor's bodyguard taught her how to shoot a pistol, clark says. That's when she got her first license; the surviving one, issued in 1957, coincides with her travels in the south to push for civil rights, which earned her death threats. Naturally, her gun ownership is prompting political remarks: eleanor's \" true understanding of what your second amendment rights are, as an american, is just incredibly enlightening, \" says a local republican chairman. A democratic chairwoman sees it differently, saying that \" she needed protection because of her liberal, civil rights circumstances. She needed protection. \" meanwhile, the sun-sentinel reports that portrait photographer charlotte kapp, who snapped a shot of eleanor in 1959, wants to see it on the $ 10 bill — which will bear a woman's face by 2020. \" it would be a wonderful tribute to a wonderful woman, \" kapp says.",

He lost that battle on friday, dying at the age of 17 — well past the 13 years that children with the disease are expected to live, and the day before he was to serve as honorary captain at a new england patriots game. The massachusetts teen became the face of the rare condition, which causes super-speed aging and is thought to currently afflict just 250 children around the globe, after appearing in hbo's life according to sam; he also gave a ted talk last month in which he shared his philosophy for a happy life. Npr's eyder peralta writes that the 2013 documentary \" revealed a funny, sober boy. \" it followed him and his parents for a period of three years; his parents, both doctors, formed the progeria research foundation in 1999 following his diagnosis at 22 months. In september, npr reported on the first drug, lonafarnib, that had been found to help treat children with progeria; it bolstered their heart and bone health and allowed them to gain some weight. Those with the disease can weigh as little as one-third their normal weight, and in his ted talk, sam revealed he weighed just 50 pounds. That created an issue for him: his dream before high school was to play snare drum in the marching band, and regular snare drums and harnesses weigh 45 pounds. But \" nothing was going to stop me. \" so he worked with an engineer to design a version that weighed just six pounds. Said sam, \" i have a very happy life. \" ( click to read the story of a woman with a sort of opposite disease: syndrome x. )",

First, the good news: microscopic particles of silver kill off bacteria, which is why they're used in 383 consumer products, reports the cbc. But studies of silver nanotechnology are uncovering possible health risks too, like cellular damage, particles crossing the blood-brain barrier or getting past our outer layer of skin. \" there's evidence that the particles penetrate into plasma membranes, and they can disrupt cell function, \" said an expert. That said, scientists are even more worried about environmental threats when products are washed and silver flows into our water supply; a study of low-level silver contamination of a natural environment showed damage to plants and aquatic creatures. Some experts also question the point of silver nanoparticles, saying bacteria may adapt to the nanotechnology, or people may be too fearful of bacteria in the first place, the chicago tribune reports. On the other hand, the silver industry says concerns are exaggerated and silver has been used in drinking-water purification and swimming pools since the 1970s. \" it's the most sustainable and by now the most researched and safest biocide technology on the market, \" said the ceo of a nanosilver company.

The lawsuit claims surveillance footage and a search of the restaurant and employee's car also found no evidence of drugs or any tampering with the officer's drink. But that didn't stop police from going ahead with the story.

But klein didn't back down, and amid a firestorm of social-media criticism returned to sahara deli market on friday to watch security footage of the alleged groping. People jammed the store's doorway and aimed their cell cameras at klein as footage played on a ceiling-mounted tv: it showed the boy brushing klein's behind with his backpack as she leaned over the counter. Klein later apologized in a media interview, saying, \" young man, i don't know your name but i ' m sorry. \" but she denied being racist and still grumbled about the boy's mother getting aggressive with her. Meanwhile, twitter feeds have dubbed her #cornerstorecaroline, a reference to other recent, dubious accusations by white people about black behavior ( another accuser was called #bbqbecky ). And then there's the little boy: \" he's going to be traumatized for the rest of his life, \" says the flatbush resident who posted the video. \" this is something that will stick with him. \"",

Her post has already received more than 15,000 likes and been shared more than 5,600 times, with commenters calling vasquez \" badass, \" \" awesome, \" and \" mother of the year. \" this one caught the attention of today.com: \" think about what he will be able to share with his kids later and what seed has been planted as he grows up and becomes a man.

In exchange, he allegedly gave his navy pals cash and prostitutes. Two commanders and a naval criminal investigative service agent were arrested before the admirals.

In english, the name of the tiny spanish village is \" castrillo jew killer \" or \" castrillo kill the jews, \" depending on the translation. It was so named because jews were massacred there twice, in 1035 and 1109. Now the mayor of the village, population 60, is suggesting it be renamed, and residents will vote on the matter this week, the jerusalem post reports. The proposed new name is actually an old one: castrillo mota de judíos, or \" castrillo jews ' hill, \" which is believed to have been the village's name originally. The name was changed during the spanish inquisition, a time of religious persecution in spain, the local reports. The term matar judíos, or \" killing jews, \" is also used in parts of spain to describe drinking spiked lemonade, now a traditional part of festivals held around easter; in medieval times, jews would sometimes be put to death in public during the holiday. Matarjudíos is also still a spanish surname, the guardian notes. As for the town, \" the majority decision will be respected, even if it is only by one vote, \" says the mayor.

In a report out today, amnesty international says the administrative maximum facility at florence, colo., is violating international law with such practices. Also known as adx or alcatraz of the rockies, america's only federal supermax prison houses prisoners including the unabomber, the atlanta olympics bomber, and one of the terrorists convicted in the 1993 world trade center bombing. Amnesty says its solitary confinement practices are cruel and \" inhuman, \" nbc news reports. Most inmates are kept isolated for 22 to 24 hours per day — for years. In fact, prisoners must spend 12 months in solitary before a reduction in their restrictions will even be considered. According to the report, most are kept in small cells with almost no view of the outside other than a small slit window ( which, in some cases, only offers a view of a brick wall ), and even exercise sometimes takes place in cages \" with no view of the natural world. \" the report includes accounts of inmates who have been driven to depression, paranoia, and psychosis, though they had no previous history of mental illness. One adx prisoner bit off his own finger and cut off his earlobes; another hanged himself in his cell. Amnesty international wants federal and state governments to be more transparent about their use of solitary confinement — and to only use the punishment as a last resort. The group notes it last visited adx in 2001, with requests to do so since then having been turned down; the report was sourced in part using court documents.",

Powerball tickets doubled in price in january to $ 2, and while the number of tickets sold initially dropped, sales revenue has increased by about 35 percent over 2011. Sales for powerball reached a record $ 3.96 billion in fiscal 2012 and are expected to reach $ 5 billion this year, said chuck strutt, executive director of the des moines, iowa-based multi-state lottery association, the group that runs the powerball game. There has been no powerball winner since oct. 6, and the jackpot already has reached a record level for the game. It was first posted at $ 425 million but revised upward to $ 500 million when brisk sales increased the payout.

Lapd capt. Andy neiman said the knife was allegedly found by a construction worker, maybe during the home's 1998 demolition, and turned over to an off-duty cop moonlighting at a nearby movie shoot who kept it as a souvenir, the new york times reports. That officer retired in the late 1990s, per abc news. Neiman said the department first got wind of the knife within the last month, but he cautions that \" maybe the story is bogus from the get-go. \" the knife \" has been submitted to our lab [ and ] they are going to study it and examine it for all forensics, including serology and dna and hair samples. \" the weapon used in the 1994 killings has eluded police for more than 20 years, though this knife isn't the first one to be presented as possible evidence. Prosecutors initially thought a 15-inch knife simpson had purchased may have been the murder weapon, but forensics tests proved that knife to have zero scratches or bloodstains on it, the los angeles times reports. Then, later in 1994, a woman turned in a kitchen knife with red stains on it that she says she found less than a block from simpson's home ( it appears that knife was also ruled out ). Regarding the newly emerged knife, one of the lawyers on oj's original legal \" dream team \" told the lat on friday that the story is \" ridiculous. \" \" it's amazing how the world cannot move on from this case, \" carl douglas says. As for simpson himself, he's in a nevada prison for a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.",

But the study takes things a step further. It turns out that happy partners don't just rub off on their spouse's mood, but on their physical health: those whose partners are happy were found to be 34 % more likely to be healthy themselves. People with unhappy partners are more likely to report worse overall health, less exercise, and more physical impairments than those with happy partners, reports the new york times. \" this speaks to the power of our close relationships, \" the lead author says. The team proposes three central causes, reports time: a happy spouse is more likely to have the energy to be a more proactive caregiver and partner; a happy spouse is more likely to engage in and thus reinforce healthy patterns such as regular exercise and sleep; and a happy spouse is less likely to cause their partner the stress and exhaustion of trying to cheer up or avoid upsetting them.

What's more, he says, the gunman did it for love. The story goes back to the 1940s, when la mobsters began buying up property in las vegas. History tells us that siegel pioneered the vegas power-grab with the help of business partner and childhood friend moe sedway. But it's sedway's wife, bee — a small, powerful woman with a hot temper — who claimed to know who gunned down siegel in a hail of.30-caliber bullets in 1947. And her son, realtor robbie sedway, decided to reveal what she'd written in a book proposal that was never marketed. Why now? \" i ' m at the point where my health is not good, \" robbie says. \" everyone's been wondering for 67 years. I mean, why not? \" the long-held assumption is that mob boss meyer lansky had siegel executed for over-spending, if not skimming, on the vegas move. But bee's book proposal says the real problem was siegel wanted sedway killed for reporting all the finances to lansky. Enraged by the threat, bee had her lover, mathew \" moose \" pandza — a massive, soft-spoken crane operator — protect sedway. Eventually, moose would murder siegel ( with lansky's approval ) for threatening sedway's life. Need a road map for all this? the key is that moose, who lived with the sedways in a love triangle, got involved because bee wanted her husband to be safe. Moose later married bee after sedway died of multiple heart attacks in 1952. \" it's a love story, \" says robbie. At least that's bee's version of events, which los angeles magazine can't confirm but police aren't denying. \" we're not releasing any information \" on moose's possible involvement \" because it's still an open case, \" a beverly hills police rep tells people. \" it's never been closed. \" ( read about a century-old mafia killing that's apparently been solved. )",

Caroll spinney, the 84-year-old puppeteer who's portrayed big bird and oscar the grouch on sesame street since the show's premiere in 1969, announced his retirement wednesday, telling the new york times that the physical requirements have become too much for him. Still, \" i ' ll be 100 years old, doing muppet stuff, \" says spinney, who plans to become a sesame workshop ambassador. It seems an appropriate post: \" i think it's fair to say that caroll's view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organization, \" says ceo jeffrey dunn. It was spinney, winner of a lifetime achievement emmy award, who made the decision to play big bird as \" a child, a surrogate, \" rather than \" a funny, dumb country yokel. \" the character \" came to embody the tender, nurturing soul of the show, \" reports the times. But big bird also \" nurtured my soul, \" spinney says in a statement, per cnn. Fans of the show feel the same way. \" spinney created a character i could trust and, as an autistic child, connect with, \" reads one of several \" emotional \" tweets published by mashable. Matt vogel, aka kermit the frog, will take over as big bird, while eric jacobson of grover and bert will assume the role of oscar the grouch. Yet spinney, an author and visual artist, won't be far removed from his characters. Apart from a half-century of experience with them, he also has a rocking chair fitted with a massive pair of big bird's pink and orange legs, per the times.

The trump campaign began june with just $ 1.29 million in cash, compared to $ 42 million for hillary clinton's well-heeled campaign, reports reuters. He did manage to raise $ 3.1 million in may, a hefty sum by trump campaign standards, but that total was dwarfed by the $ 26 million clinton raised during the same month. Trump loaned his campaign around $ 2.2 million, bringing that total to around $ 46 million. The filings reveal that around a fifth of what trump's campaign spent in may went to trump-owned companies or to his children, the guardian reports. When super pacs are included in the total, clinton's side has a war chest of $ 94 million compared to under $ 2 million for trump, though some trump-allied pacs have yet to file, the los angeles times reports. The lousy fundraising figures for may are \" totally inexplicable \" in light of the fact that he was the presumptive gop nominee for almost the entire month, had momentum, and was \" running against the democrat [ republicans ] most love to hate, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post. He warns that if trump has another month where the funding gap between the two campaigns is so overwhelming, \" the general election may be over before it ever really started. \" ( on monday, the trump campaign parted ways with corey lewandowski, the campaign manager who oversaw fundraising operations. )",

        "summary": "In just two weeks, nyc's guggenheim museum is set to open an ambitious three-month exhibit on experimental works from chinese artists, many of which the new york times deems \" deliberately shocking. \" none more so, though, than a piece by a pair known as \" the bad couple of china's art \": peng yu and her husband, sun yuan, whose \" dogs that cannot touch each other \" video is facing calls to be removed before the exhibit opens oct. 6. The seven-minute reel depicts four pairs of face-to-face pit bulls charging each other on nonmotorized treadmills but kept from making contact. The times notes the original version of the piece, which the duo debuted in beijing in 2003, took place live; the guggenheim says it's using video only. Either way, art and animal lovers aren't happy with the installation, with more than 20,000 already signing a petition to \" promote cruelty-free exhibitions \" at the museum. Per the petition, by setting the dogs up to fight but then not letting them, it creates a \" stressful and frustrating experience. \" it adds that video taken during the 2003 live viewing showed the animals ' \" frantic, foaming faces. \" peng dismissed abuse allegations in a 2016 interview, noting the filmed dogs were just being \" naturally pugnacious. \" she even compared them to olympic athletes. \" human nature and animal nature are the same, \" she said \" [ the olympics ] is the conversion of actual fighting into regulated competition. \" in a statement, the museum concedes \" the work may be upsetting, \" but also calls it \" an intentionally challenging and provocative artwork that seeks to examine and critique systems of power and control. \" ( blasting odors at visitors may have been better. )",

But where a story like this may have once been a freakish anomaly, the washington post notes, it's now becoming increasingly and disturbingly commonplace. A post analysis of news reports finds 23 shootings by 1-, 2-, and 3-year-olds in the us since jan. 1 ( last year at this time there were 18 ) and seven just since april 20. Eighteen of the toddlers ended up shooting themselves, with nine of them succumbing to their injuries. The state with the highest number of toddlers pulling the trigger since january 2015 is georgia ( eight such incidents ), followed by texas and missouri with seven each. Snopes even fleshed out a meme in december, sourced mainly from an october 2015 post article, that claimed more americans were killed by toddlers than by terrorists in 2015 ( the site ultimately found this assertion to be true ). Correlating these shootings to factors such as population or gun-storage laws isn't so simple, the post notes. The people-dense states of new york and california, for instance, only saw a combined three toddler shootings since january 2015, while chicago's high gun-violence rate didn't translate into any reported incidents. The paper speculates that \" cultural factors \" may cause some areas to have higher numbers of incidents, but it concedes that at this point, figuring out what areas are more prone is still a \" guessing game, \" hampered by congress'stymieing of gun research.

Almost half of them are for-profit colleges; another third are public community colleges. Last summer, a senate investigation found that for-profit colleges ( like itt, which has a 34.1 % default rate across all its schools ) tend to have worse graduation and default rates than nonprofit ones; leaders of these schools say this has more to do with their needy, struggling students than with the schools themselves. The analysis arrives as the 3.4 % interest rate on federally subsidized stafford loans expired yesterday.

            "The interest rate on a key federal student loan doubled monday, as expected, but it is unclear whether congress will allow the increase to stand before the new school year gets under way. Federal law has set the rate for new subsidized stafford loans at 6.8 percent, up from 3.4 percent. The subsidy means that these loans, for undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, do not accrue interest while the students are in school. It is estimated that the rate hike would add about $ 1,000 in interest over the life of a loan for many borrowers. Subsidized loans taken out before monday are not affected. Nor are other federal loans to undergraduates, graduate students and parents. More than 7 million students are projected to take out subsidized loans for the coming school year. Lawmakers and president obama sought to prevent the rate hike but were unable to reach an accord before congress left washington for its july 4 recess. The republican-led house passed a bill in may to tie loan rates to the government's cost of borrowing, but the administration criticized some of the provisions and threatened a veto. The democratic-led senate stalemated. Like congressional republicans and some democrats, obama has proposed tying loan rates to annual market benchmarks instead of the current practice, in which congress fixes rates.

            "The interest rate on a key federal student loan doubled monday, as expected, but it is unclear whether congress will allow the increase to stand before the new school year gets under way. Federal law has set the rate for new subsidized stafford loans at 6.8 percent, up from 3.4 percent. The subsidy means that these loans, for undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, do not accrue interest while the students are in school. It is estimated that the rate hike would add about $ 1,000 in interest over the life of a loan for many borrowers. Subsidized loans taken out before monday are not affected. Nor are other federal loans to undergraduates, graduate students and parents. More than 7 million students are projected to take out subsidized loans for the coming school year. Lawmakers and president obama sought to prevent the rate hike but were unable to reach an accord before congress left washington for its july 4 recess. The republican-led house passed a bill in may to tie loan rates to the government's cost of borrowing, but the administration criticized some of the provisions and threatened a veto. The democratic-led senate stalemated. Like congressional republicans and some democrats, obama has proposed tying loan rates to annual market benchmarks instead of the current practice, in which congress fixes rates. But lawmakers have been unable to agree on the",

        "summary": "High-intensity interval training is all the rage, with research suggesting that just a few minutes of all-out sweating could reap the same health benefits as a 45-minute moderate workout, and that's true even for the elderly. The draw is clear — interval training takes less time, after all — but so is the drawback, as the new york times reports: pushing ourselves with such intensity even in short bursts can be grueling. But new research out of mcmaster university in ontario suggests that while it's hard, hiit might not be all that unpleasant, and that when people listen to music while pushing hard, they rather like it. \" this research tells us that they can actually enjoy it, and they may be more likely to participate in hiit again if they try it with music, \" says one researcher, per psych central. Reporting in the journal of sports sciences, researchers say they studied 20 young, healthy, and physically active men and women performing hiit for the first time in two scenarios — one without music, and one with — and that each session was followed an hour later by questionnaires. The volunteers rode stationary bikes, starting with an easy two-minute warmup before four 30-second bursts of all-out pedaling. Turns out that on a scale of 1 to 7, where 7 is \" i loved it, \" most ranked the exercise a 5, but their ratings climbed to 6 after they did the training to music. The tunes also made them more likely to continue with the training. Whether these findings would translate to a larger group of people who are more sedentary remains unclear.

Officials want a suspect's device unlocked has discovered a way around apple's security features. The contractor is an israeli firm called cellebrite, which the report suggests successfully circumvented security on an iphone x late last year during a michigan arms trafficking investigation. Forbes reports the company \" developed undisclosed techniques \" that allow it access to ios 11. However, the firm has not made any public statements about the reported development so it's not clear what that development might be. Apple has thus far not responded to the report. If true, the news marks a major victory for police forces worldwide who've struggled to keep up with the increased security that comes with each new iphone release. As cnet notes, apple and the department of justice first famously butted heads following a terrorist shooting in san bernardino when the tech giant refused to assist federal authorities in their attempts to get into the suspects ' locked phones. While it took a court order before apple would comply, they never had to follow through with it. By the time the company agreed, federal officials announced that a contractor had already helped them unlock the phones.",

Although many states offer vaccination exemptions, that wouldn't necessarily preempt a lawsuit, she adds. \" the fact that behavior is legal does not mean you're not negligent to engage in it — and if you're negligent and someone is hurt, in our system you usually have to pay, \" reiss tells noah berlatsky, writing for the atlantic. \" it's legal to have a stack of hay in your yard, but if it's a fire hazard and you start a fire, you may be liable. \" one issue with reiss'suggestion, berlatsky points out, is that it can be difficult to prove one person directly infected another. An indiana health policy professor adds that lawsuits will \" undermine trust in the public-health system, probably won't increase the number of people taking up vaccination, and create a dangerous precedent \" — anti-vaxxers may simply dig in their heels and stand their ground.

        "summary": "One of the great mysteries of autism is predicting which children will develop the condition, gizmodo reports. But scientists at unc chapel hill have now used brain scans to predict with near pinpoint accuracy whether babies as young as 6 months would develop autism by age 2. Two is the age when telltale repetitive behavior and other signs of autism usually emerge; diagnosis often doesn't happen before age 4. But the new findings raise the possibility that doctors may one day be able to use a tool to identify babies likely to develop autism. That would allow treatment to begin far earlier, when brains are most malleable, scientific american reports. \" this is a game-changer for the field, \" autism expert kevin pelphrey tells the mag. Reporting in science translational medicine, researchers used a special mri to analyze how the regions of the brains interact in 59 babies at age 6 months. They repeated the scans at 24 months, and developed an algorithm that spotted patterns in the brain connectivity of autistic toddlers, per gizmodo. From there, using artificial intelligence, the team devised a model that correctly predicted 9 out of the 11 infants who developed autism. Although researchers caution the findings will need to be replicated, outside autism experts were optimistic there may be hope for earlier treatment of condition that afflicts one out of 68 us kids. \" this is a really, really important advance, \" one yale professor tells scientific american. ( an earlier study by the same team noted excessive brain growth as a sign of autism. )",

Nissan says this method provides precise recognition of the vehicle's surroundings and, perhaps more importantly, works even when communication to the satellite network is interrupted -- as is often the case in underground parking structures. Through a smartphone app, the car can be told to park itself. The ev will then seek out a vacant parking spot and pull itself in. While parked, a security camera system monitors the vehicle's surrounding environment. If any suspicious activity is detected, a report is automatically sent to the driver's smartphone. Just as easily as it parked itself, the nsc-2015 can return to pick you up when called. Nissan says the overall goal of the project was to reduce the chance of human error, which it says is the cause of 90 percent of all accidents, to as close to zero as possible.

Nissan says this method provides precise recognition of the vehicle's surroundings and, perhaps more importantly, works even when communication to the satellite network is interrupted -- as is often the case in underground parking structures. Through a smartphone app, the car can be told to park itself. The ev will then seek out a vacant parking spot and pull itself in. While parked, a security camera system monitors the vehicle's surrounding environment. If any suspicious activity is detected, a report is automatically sent to the driver's smartphone. Just as easily as it parked itself, the nsc-2015 can return to pick you up when called. Nissan says the overall goal of the project was to reduce the chance of human error, which it says is the cause of 90 percent of all accidents, to as close to zero as possible. Another objective, however, was to reduce the time spent looking for parking. As the car"

The animal made it to within a few floors of the top of the building, where live traps had been set, before slowly beginning to climb back down. Onlookers — including some on the building's 23rd floor — provided updates as the raccoon's climb gained national attention, with many worried about its safety, reports the ap. James gunn — director of guardians of the galaxy, which featured rocket raccoon — offered $ 1,000 to the chosen charity of anybody who saved the raccoon. \" i just can't handle this, \" he tweeted. \" poor dude. \" an account in the raccoon's name also tweeted, saying, \" i made a big mistake. \" a city spokeswoman says they plan to leave the animal alone to avoid scaring it, which is the approach recommended by wildlife research scientist john erb. \" it sounds like it found itself in an awkward spot, \" he tells the star tribune. \" something could've spooked it and it started to climb...

To celebrate the last player standing, apple is boosting the ipod touch's capacity, upping the 16gb version that sells for $ 199 to 32gb, and the $ 299 64gb model to 128gb; the 16gb and 64gb models will no longer be for sale, ars technica reports.

Trump was reacting to obama's speech on tuesday announcing new executive actions on guns, including narrowing the so-called \" gun-show loophole \" on background checks. The republican front-runner said what the president gets wrong is \" the concept \" behind his efforts, not his emotion. Read more",

            "During tuesday's speech on gun control, president obama choked up and started to cry when talking about the deaths of first graders at sandy hook elementary at the hands of a crazed gunman. It was a moving and relatable moment. As inured as most of us have sadly become to the loss of life from mass shooting, the idea of some monster littering the bodies of helpless children with bullets still has power. That invoking this horror would cause tears was completely understandable. Or at least to most people, that is. For right wingers, such a reaction from a grown man was preposterous. Real men don't get upset at the bullet-ridden corpses of 6-year-olds, it was quickly determined. He's either faking it or he's not a real man. The assumption that he"

The news comes ahead of tomorrow's planned talks between iran and six world powers, though cbs news — which flavors its report with a heavy dose of skepticism — reports that the deal won't likely affect the negotiators coming to the table, as the iaea deal and talks are separate. But it could affect iran's negotiators, who could argue that it compromised, and it's time for the west to do so, too. Western diplomats have expressed doubts about the deal, noting that nuke chief yukiya amano should have come back with a complete and signed deal, but may have fallen short due to the mounting pressure to arrive at an agreement. Amano himself acknowledged that \" there remain some differences \" in his discussions with iran's top nuclear negotiator, but claims they won't be an obstacle to getting the agreement signed, which will happen \" quite soon, but i cannot say how soon it will be. \"",

        "summary": "As usual, the truth took a bit of a beating in last night's presidential debate. At least one fact was checked during the debate — obama's assertion that he did, indeed, use the term \" act of terror \" to describe the attack on the us consulate in libya the day after it occurred. A look at the post-debate fact-checking by the ap, abc, the washington post, and politico: obama: \" let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild america, roads, bridges, schools. \" actually, most of the money spent on the iraq and afghanistan wars is borrowed. And if we used that money for schools, it would mean yet more borrowing. Romney: \" when the president took office, the price of gasoline here in nassau county was about $ 1.86 a gallon. Now, it's $ 4 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down. \" not necessarily, because in truth presidents have nearly zero effect on energy prices, since global financial exchanges set most of them. Additionally, other energy costs, like the price of natural gas, have fallen since obama took office. Obama: \" he called the arizona law a model for the nation. \" no, what romney was referring to was a federal electronic system used to verify the immigration status of new employees — not, as obama said, the controversial arizona immigration law. Romney: \" he said … he would cut the deficit in half; instead he has doubled it. \" false, say numerous fact-checking outlets. But, while obama has not doubled the deficit, neither has he cut it in half — more like 8 %. Obama: \" what i've also said is, for [ those earning ] above $ 250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when bill clinton was president. \" yes, obama would put the top rate back at 39.6 %, as it was during clinton's presidency. But since obamacare includes a new 0.9 % medicare surcharge and a 3.8 % tax on investment income for those same households, tax rates would actually be higher for them than they were during the clinton era.",

According to the ap, wise bases his argument on chimps ' position as humans ' closest relatives, their ability to use simple tools, their capacity to learn simple sign language, and more. But the court ruled that, similarities to people or not, chimps lack the \" capacity or ability... To bear legal duties, or to be held legally accountable for their actions, \" reuters reports.

He earlier tried and failed to get two chimps held by a new york university released. In addition to concluding tommy and kiko lack the wherewithal to face justice in a habeas corpus case, the court also concluded that wise isn't actually seeking their freedom but rather to transfer them from one form of detention — private ownership — to another — a primate sanctuary. The court concluded that while wise's cause is \" laudable, \" it's more of a legislative issue. The nonhuman rights project plans to appeal to the state supreme court.",

And the restaurant is misleading customers about its nutritional information: the onion rings, according to long john silver's website, have 7 grams of trans fat, but the cspi finds 19.5 grams. Most of the trans fat comes from the restaurant's use of partially hydrogenated oil, the cspi notes. Then there are 19 grams of saturated fat and 3,700 mg of sodium in the meal. In other words, it's a \" heart attack on a hook, \" says the cspi's executive director.

A little more than 1 % of them will develop a penis at age 12, making them what locals call \" guevedoces \" — literally, a \" penis at 12, \" the telegraph reports. \" i remember i used to wear a little red dress, \" says 24-year-old johnny, one of about 6,000 villagers in the isolated town of salinas. \" they didn't know what sex i was. I went to school and i used to wear my skirt... When they bought me girls'toys i never bothered playing with them. All i wanted to do was play with the boys. \" turned out that johnny suffered from an unusual genetic disorder caused by a missing enzyme, called 5-α-reductase, which stops a powerful male sex hormone from surging into wombs that carry the male y chromosome. That surge of dihydro-testosterone normally occurs at about eight weeks, and turns the tubercle — a little bump between the legs of babies in the womb — into a penis. Well, y-chromosome babies born without that hormone blast are born looking female with what resembles a vagina. But at puberty, when the next testosterone surge comes along, the male sex organ finally appears and their voices grow deeper. At that point the \" guevedoces \" may be teased in school, one tells the telegraph, but they are generally celebrated by dominicans ( unlike sambian villagers in papua new guinea, who shun people with the disorder ). And despite less facial hair and smaller prostate glands, \" guevedoces \" can generally live as normal males, though the bbc reports that some get an operation in order to stay female. Experts believe that the villagers ' isolation has caused the condition to persist. ( a set of south carolina parents recently sued after doctors decided their child was female. )",

The state's fish and wildlife commission yesterday banned the hunting of the giant pacific octopus at seven popular diving sites. The move comes after a gruesome scene last fall when a diving instructor arrived at a seattle beach and came across a recreational diver beating an octopus to death, reports ap. After photos of the scene made the rounds, the diving community asked the wildlife commission to put some protections in place, both for the octopuses and their own interests: the octopuses help attract tourist divers. The wildlife panel agreed. \" washington is an important dive location, and protection of the octopus is important both to the dive community and to the economy of the state, \" says its commissioner.

        "summary": "The shape of today's violin wasn't the result of some genius's design specifications; instead, it developed over time, likely improving by chance, researchers say. As the christian science monitor reports, an instrument's sound depends heavily on the way air flows through it: the more air that exits its sound holes, the louder the instrument will be. But it's not about bigger sound holes, the mit team explains. In fact, what matters is the hole's perimeter, where the most air flows. \" more perimeter and less interior area \" — as seen in a violin's f-shaped holes — \" is better, \" says professor nicholas makris. Indeed, \" on a windy day … it tends to be far windier at the perimeter of ( a ) building rather than some distance from the building, because all the air flow obstructed by the building escapes in a concentrated region at the edges. \" early versions of the instrument had circular sound holes, the economist reports. But \" the circle has the smallest perimeter for the same area, and so is the least power-efficient, \" makris says. Here's where \" evolution \" comes in: the shift from circles to f-holes was gradual, the economist explains, as buyers likely favored the more efficient instruments. These instruments might actually have differed by accident, the telegraph reports. \" whether ( makers ) understood, ' oh, we need to make the sound hole more slender, ' we cannot say. But they definitely knew what was a better instrument to replicate, \" says makris. The makers of these successful instruments taught their apprentices the tricks of the trade, and so the design shifted between the 1560s and the early 1700s. ( though the violin may not have changed much in recent centuries, research finds new ones beat stradivarii. )",

Meadowlark lemon died sunday in scottsdale, ariz., his wife, cynthia, confirmed, per the new york times. Referred to as the \" clown prince of basketball, \" lemon played for the famous exhibition team for more than 26 seasons, clocking a staggering 16,000-plus career games and becoming renowned for his famous hook shot. But the revered showman wasn't all for show: he was also a highly respected player, inducted into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame in 2003 and noted for being a major part of basketball right as the nba started its ascent, per the times. Before he died in 1999, ex-teammate wilt chamberlain said in a tv interview that \" meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player i've ever seen. \" not bad for a kid who, per the chicago tribune, was \" a skinny boy with a funny name ' not at the top of anyone's priority list, ' \" as he himself once put it. His first basketball: an empty evaporated-milk carton; his first basket: an onion sack attached to a wire hanger nailed to a tree. Everything changed when lemon saw a globetrotters newsreel in the 1940s, he once wrote, per the tribune, noting they were all \" the same color as me. \" his life wasn't trouble-free — his first wife was arrested for stabbing him in 1978, per the tribune — but his popularity endured.

        "summary": "Sorry, ladies, but your roommate, sister, or female partner doesn't have an \" alpha uterus \" that's causing your menstrual cycle to align with hers. That's per a new study by period-tracking app clue, which joined with university of oxford scientists to determine if there was any truth to women's periods syncing up if they spend a lot of time together, including living together, live science reports. The researchers tapped 360 pairs of women who knew each other well, lived in the same city, and used clue; about 120 of those pairs actually lived together. After following three consecutive menstrual cycles for all of the women, the scientists found that the sync-up story didn't pan out: of the 360 pairs, 273 pairs actually saw a bigger gap between the start date of their cycles at the study's end compared to the beginning. Only 79 pairs saw their cycle start dates come closer together. And the cycles of the pairs who lived together didn't fall into line more than those who lived apart: of pairs with diverging cycles, 37 % lived together, while of those whose start dates converged, only 24 % lived together. The idea of this syncing seems to have first been studied in 1971 ( although that study was later slammed for its methodology ), but multiple studies since haven't been able to prove it. So why do so many women in close proximity insist that it happens? clue data scientist marija vlajic tells the guardian this belief may simply be a result of \" information bias, \" with \" our brains looking for patterns. \" vlajic adds that it's also \" powerful \" to think you're sharing this monthly happening with other women. \" it feeds into a feeling of connection, support, and sisterhood, \" she notes.
