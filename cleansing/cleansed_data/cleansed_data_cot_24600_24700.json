In youtube's most recent update of its \" most disliked videos \" list, the ghostbusters trailer took the 23rd slot, making it the most disliked trailer to ever appear on youtube. The trailer boasts 586,743 dislikes as of this writing. Of course, that's more than a few likes behind the most derided film, justin bieber's \" baby, \" at no. 1, with 5.99 million dislikes, notes the hollywood reporter. ( bieber actually occupies six of the 22 slots ahead of ghostbusters. ) as for why it's so unloved, mike sampson at screen crush writes that \" it was a poorly put together trailer that did little to inspire confidence in [ paul feig's ] finished product, \" but there's something more going on. He points to the 5,803 dislikes that the ridiculous six trailer has amassed — and that's a movie with a 0 % rotten tomatoes rating. \" a certain subset of people on the internet have an unhealthy fixation with hating on the ghostbusters remake and are teaming up to downvote it into oblivion, \" he writes. As kyle buchanan at vulture puts it, \" before paul feig's rebooted ghostbusters squad can save new york city from a spectral threat this summer, they ' ll be forced to battle a shadowy cabal that's even more terrifying: straight men on the internet. \" filmmaker kevin smith was pretty vocal about hating the trailer upon its release. His take: \" whoever cut this trailer needs to be sat down, and i ' m not going to call for their job to be taken away from them but they need to be scolded. \"",

Bell, who allegedly forced the boys to perform sex acts on him and recorded the abuse on video, was investigated and removed from his job late last year after a parent found inappropriate messages from him on her son's phone. The indictment includes 22 counts of sexual abuse of a minor, 19 counts of second-degree sex offenses, seven counts of third-degree sex offenses, 97 counts of child pornography, and other offenses.

But the veteran senator said he looked into it and will now argue that even if the cuts go through on march 1, the pentagon will still see its budget go up. Cornyn's preview of what he hopes will be a senate gop argument is significant since defense cuts are usually something republicans adamantly oppose. He will surely run up against some in his party who strongly disagree. To be sure, cornyn called himself a defense \" hawk \" and did say the role of the federal government should be first and foremost to protect american citizens.

        "summary": "Couples who manage to evenly divide child care duties tend to have higher-quality relationships, as well as sex lives. This is the takeaway from a new study being presented to the american sociological association in chicago this week. Researchers interviewed nearly 500 heterosexual couples with kids and found that when both the man and the woman each did roughly 50 % of the duties, such as diaper changing, bedtime reading, carpool planning, and playing in the park, \" couples fought less; they had higher quality relationships; they were more satisfied with their sex lives; and they were more satisfied with the amount of sex they were having, \" one sociologist tells the washington post. \" one of the most important findings is that the only childcare arrangement that appears really problematic for the quality of both a couple's relationship and sex life is when the woman does most or all of the childcare, \" says the lead researcher in a press release. When men take on the bulk, couples have just as much sex and are just as satisfied with how much sex they're having, although in another interesting twist, these men report having the lowest-quality sex lives, while their partners report having the highest. One psychologist tells the bbc that the findings may say more about the types of people who decide to parent in a more egalitarian manner: \" if you have a ' new ' man who is happy to share childcare, he probably invests more in the relationship anyway. \" the research is limited in that it didn't analyze same-sex couples and only followed a narrow group of child care activities.

When the texts emerged, ukip essentially gave bolton an ultimatum, reports the bbc: quit the party or quit the girl, and he made his choice. \" the romantic element of the relationship is over, i ' m afraid, as of last night, \" said bolton, calling marney's comments \" indefensible. \" he also insisted that he would not resign as party leader, despite growing calls for that as well. Bolton is married with two kids, but he says he and his wife have been estranged and living separately since july. He'd been in a relationship with marney for about a month, and the texts were sent before they became a couple. Marney, for her part, says they've been taken out of context.

        "summary": "Why did the superintendent and athletic director of a philadelphia-area school district suddenly resign at the end of august? it might be because they'd been caught sending incredibly offensive text messages to each other. Late last week, the daily local news in west chester published a leaked transcript of messages sent between former coatesville area superintendent richard como and athletics director jim donato. Here's a rundown: in one exchange, they joke that black people \" should just have whatever first names they want... Then last name is n ---- r! leroy n ---- r, preacher n ---- r, night train n ---- r … could have whole homerooms of n ---- r! \" in another exchange, after hearing that someone is having sex with a red-haired \" campus jew, \" one of the men writes, \" no way! please tell me no f -- king way that ape banged that white piece?... Me no understand! \" \" f -- king camel jockey gets me a white girly phone that doesn't work??! gaza strip has better connections during suicide bombers! \" the texts were allegedly sent to and from school-issued phones in june. A district employee discovered them while transferring data from one to the other, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Perhaps most damningly, daily news sources say the school board learned about the messages quickly, but decided to let the pair keep their jobs — until the police got involved. A criminal investigation is now under way, police have confirmed. The board is expected to formally accept both men's resignations tomorrow. Parents and teachers in the racially diverse district are shocked. \" it's 2013. Who talks like that? \" one parent asked fox 29.",

Already, 8 inches of snow has fallen in colorado and kansas, and more than a foot could be coming today to some areas in iowa, nebraska, missouri, kansas, oklahoma, and arkansas — not to mention possible hail and tornadoes in texas, louisiana, and mississippi. More than 176 flights have been canceled at kansas city international airport alone, with scores more from dallas to minneapolis. Even the world golf championship match play tournament near tucson was suspended because of the snow. But it's not all bad news — the heavy snows today, along with a second storm expected to hit monday, are going to bring the equivalent of an inch of rain to some drought-hit parts of the country. Granted, an inch will only \" dent \" the drought, not end it, but \" the economic value of the rain and snow from the two storms is in the billions of dollars, \" writes jeff masters at the weather underground.

        "summary": "Congressional republicans say they will release their big tax plan thursday, but they're still reportedly working on fundamental details regarding the numbers. Abc news, meanwhile, reports that another odd but important detail remains up in the air: what to call the thing. The report says paul ryan reached out to president trump to take advantage of his branding skills, and trump came up with the \" cut, cut, cut act. \" he's now said to be pushing hard to keep the name, while ryan and the house's top tax writer, kevin brady, are resisting. We should know in a matter of hours, because brady, chair of the house ways and means panel, said the bill \" definitely \" will be released thursday, reports politico. Meanwhile, three key issues: the corporate tax cut, the elimination of state and local tax deductions, and possible caps on 401( k ) contributions remain under negotiation. One possibility to expect: that the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 %, something trump calls a deal-breaker, will be phased in over several years rather than put into place immediately. That will help the number-crunchers pay for some of the $ 1.5 trillion in envisioned cuts, particularly because lawmakers in \" high-tax \" states are pushing back hard on the proposed elimination of local tax deductions. The new york times reports that some big cuts may be initially presented as phase-ins, or even temporary, as part of a \" place holder \" strategy to buy more time for negotiations. However, they would revert to immediate cuts before the final vote is taken. The plan also may include repeal of the johnson amendment, which prohibits churches and other tax-exempt organizations from dabbling in politics, per the times. Churches see it as a restriction of free speech.",

Suspecting that the pup may have been stolen by a shady local dognapper -- who has been reportedly driving around town in a beatup old van looking to snatch bernese mountain dogs -- the couple filed a police report, sent out more than 3,000 flyers offering a $ 500 reward and set up a facebook page. But on tuesday, after a week of no word, they decided to step up their offer. \" it's been a week, and we miss her dearly, \" sara cannon told the ottawa sun. \" we're nine months pregnant, and we're due in three weeks, so we have said that there's a possibility that the person who safely returns her will have their name in our child's birth certificate. \" \" she's basically our furry daughter, \" dan cannon added. The search has caused a stir among the bernese mountain dog loving community in canada, and friends, family and strangers have rallied behind the effort. More than 230 people have joined the facebook group to find molly, and posters from as far away as newfoundland and norway have said they are keeping an eye out for molly jane. In status updates posted to the page, cannon has been pounding the pavement every day -- despite a few early contractions -- knocking on doors and handing out flyers to mailmen.

Wheat and related cereals contain proteins called gluten that hold breads and cakes together, and certain forms of gluten cause an immune reaction in some people, leaving them unable to eat wheat, barley, and rye, per ifl science. But scientists are working on strains of wheat that don't produce the forms of gluten that are dangerous for people with celiac disease, a group called gliadins, new scientist reports. Francisco barro and a team at the institute for sustainable agriculture in cordoba, spain, have set about removing gliadins, first by using a genetic modification technique and then, more successfully, by using crispr gene editing. Via that process, the team is working to eliminate all 45 copies of the problematic genes; so far, they've disabled 35 of them. Since there are still some forms of gluten in the wheat, just not the forms that cause trouble for those with celiac, the grain can still be used to make bread — baguettes and rolls at this point, not larger sliced loaves. And that bread is \" pretty good, certainly better than anything on the gluten-free shelves \" currently, says one of the people working to market products made with the new wheat. ( in layman's terms, gluten is \" what makes bread delicious, \" gizmodo explains, which is why gluten-free products using replacements such as rice flour are often \" terrible. \" ) small trials of the genetically modified wheat are already taking place in mexico and spain with \" very encouraging \" results, she adds; per a new study on the low-gluten bread, immunoreactivity was reduced in subjects by 85 %.

Authorities say army veteran marinna rollins and her soldier boyfriend jarren heng took rollins'dog, named cam, to a wooded area, tied it to a tree, shot it at close range, then buried it in a shallow grave, per wtvd. In an april 17 facebook post, however, rollins had said she'd found a new home for cam, originally adopted by her estranged husband, because caring for him was too expensive. \" sad he has to go, but he will be much happier where he is heading off to, \" wrote rollins, 23, who had cam certified as a support dog for ptsd after her husband was deployed to south korea; she medically retired from the army at the beginning of the year. \" he's going to have such a great new life, \" heng, 25, added in a comment. But according to police, rollins shot the dog five times as heng recorded the incident, then filmed heng firing several more shots. Both rollins and heng, now charged with cruelty to animals and conspiracy, are heard on video \" laughing and giggling \" as the dog dies, says the cumberland county da. As for how the crime surfaced, wncn reports someone who knows rollins posted video of the shooting to facebook with the intention of police catching wind of it.

But if outdoors-oriented company patagonia and google have anything to do with it, they're going to get the word out that public lands are worthy of being saved from environmental devastation, thanks to a new virtual-reality film series, per mashable. \" this is bears ears national monument \" is that interactive online effort, a collaboration between the two entities that continues patagonia's long-standing mission to conserve and preserve public lands like the beehive state's national monument. The multimedia website, which features 10 short vr films, offers info about the history of the region's native american tribes, a chance to scan local rock carvings, and a focus on outdoor athletes like mountain climber kitty calhoun and bikepacker andrew burr. Patagonia's stance wasn't a recent reaction to trump administration rumblings: the company has been battling since 2013 to keep bears ears protected, per a press release. In january, founder yvon chouinard wrote an open letter to utah gov. Gary herbert, blasting him \" and his buddies \" for ruining public lands by serving them up to the fossil fuel industry. Patagonia tapped into google's 360-degree technology to create its film series, which it calls a \" total immersion \" into the bears ears experience. Users can view the site on their smartphones, tablets, or google cardboard vr headset. Patagonia has also created its first-ever tv spots for pbs in support of this project: one with a cultural bent, the other with a sports angle. ( the fight for bears ears has been a fierce one. )",

He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the syrian people, \" diane foley writes in a post at the free james foley facebook group. \" we implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages, \" she writes. \" like jim, they are innocents. They have no control over american government policy in iraq, syria, or anywhere in the world. \" american officials have confirmed that a video released by the militants shows the execution of foley, who was kidnapped in syria in november 2012, wcvb reports. Meanwhile, media outlets are offering some details on his background: the 40-year-old native of rochester, nh, worked for afp and globalpost; the latter says it mounted a huge investigation and \" amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public \" after his disappearance. His early career was as a teacher all over the us, the bbc reports. His brother was an air force officer in iraq, where foley \" embedded himself \" with troops, the bbc notes. Afterward, he headed to libya in 2011. \" the idea with the libyan revolution is, it's journalists embedding with rebels, and that's essentially what we did, \" he said. There, he was detained after an ambush by moammar gadhafi's fighters. A colleague was killed, but foley was released after six weeks. \" feeling like you've survived something — it's a strange sort of force that you are drawn back to, \" he said — and indeed, despite the libyan incident, he next traveled to syria, where he wanted \" to expose untold stories, \" the bbc reports. There, he was stopped by militants while driving through a contested area, the ap notes. He had been working with another journalist in idlib, a province in northern syria. In the isis video, another person, believed to be missing american journalist steven james sotloff, is shown, and the militant who beheaded foley warns that his life depends on president obama's next decision, reports reuters. Twitter has since taken down the images, notes cnn, and foley's friends and family have started a campaign urging people not to view or share the video.",

Buried at a monument for the nation's civil-war dead near madrid, franco remains a magnet for fascist sympathizers who spread flowers on his grave — but many see him as an insult to the roughly 200,000 spaniards who died opposing his regime. Now the socialist party led by prime minister pedro sanchez is having the fascist leader exhumed against the wishes of franco's family. \" the government has taken this opportunistic, cowardly and vengeful decision, \" says franco's grandson, francisco franco martínez bordiú. \" this is just a trick to win votes for the left. \" clearly, there's a history here — a history of unhealed wounds. To ease spain's transition to democracy when franco died in 1975, the country agreed on a \" pact of silence \" that left civil-war crimes unpunished. But that meant some spaniards lived alongside neighbors they knew had killed their family members or taken their property. Under the last socialist government, symbols of franco's era were removed and streets renamed, but a plan to have his body taken from the valley of the fallen mausoleum went unheeded when the people's party took over in 2011, per bloomberg. Now the exhumation will take place, reburial location unknown. \" it's about time they did this, \" says a 37-year-old woman in madrid. \" it can remain as a monument but it shouldn't be a place of pilgrimage for fascists. \"",

            "Spain has taken another step towards dealing with the legacy of the civil war after the government approved the exhumation of the remains of francisco franco, which have lain in the valley of the fallen mausoleum near madrid since his death in 1975. The council of ministers voted in favour of the move, which was opposed by the rightwing people's and citizens parties. However, the decree only needed a simple majority to pass.

Nearby, a priest sprinkled holy water on three men. Now prime minister pedro sanchez is seeking to put a stop to the tributes.

Some people had already begun making their way back early, and others never left to begin with, the ap notes. Though water submerged parts of a manhattan promenade and a marina in front of the new york mercantile exchange, and some floodwater reached the streets of manhattan and queens, some cabbies continued offering taxi service and the city escaped the widespread damage it had feared. The evacuation orders for atlantic city and other parts of the new jersey shore, delaware, and parts of virginia and maryland were also being lifted today. The worst of the storm has passed in most areas, though transit and electricity are still affected in many areas, and irene is expected to reach eastern canada by tonight. In north carolina, where it first made landfall yesterday, damage was also surprisingly light in many areas, though two piers were destroyed. In virginia, a meteorologist says \" it certainly could have turned out worse \" for his area. In dc, the new mlk memorial took on some water but was not damaged, and the washington monument suffered no additional damage. Economic damages are also less than expected: about $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion in insured damage and $ 7 billion in total losses, according to one estimate. But flooding is still a possibility due to runoff over the next few days, and at least 16 deaths have been reported; the ap has details on 15 of them as well as state-by-state details of damages.",

The 52-year-old kentucky senator, who will announce his outsider candidacy for the gop nomination this week in louisville, is a lifelong noninterventionist, but even he couldn't abide putin's invasion of ukraine's crimean peninsula, and he joined the gop chorus calling for retribution. \"putin must be punished, \" rand paul wrote in a blistering march 2014 op-ed in time — marking the start of his center-ward shuffle toward the gop mainstream. One problem: his 79-year-old father, ron, didn't agree and didn't feel like silencing himself. The three-time presidential candidate, and original source of his son's credibility among libertarians, has been a frequent guest on putin-controlled russian state television, where he has railed against almost every u.s.

Manning, who recently ended a hunger strike, is serving time in a military prison for passing more than 750,000 pages of classified information to wikileaks. Assange is still being investigated in the us for alleged espionage, and his lawyer says he has asked us authorities to release information on the probe, cnn reports. There has been no comment yet from the justice department or the white house, which has the power to commute manning's 35-year sentence, the daily dot reports. Engadget notes that even if assange does leave the embassy where he has been holed up since 2012, sweden, which wants to question him on sex crime allegations, will still have first dibs. \" julian assange, edward snowden, and i have one thing in common: the same us prosecutor, \" tweeted kim dotcom after assange made his offer.

The new site is a shelter made from a converted wine cellar that lies under mussolini's elaborate gardens, roughly 400 feet from his villa's living quarters ( the family would have had to run above ground to reach it ). Ap describes it as being hastily constructed in 1940, and notes its iron-rung ladder ( for \" emergency exits \" ) and a rusting machine meant to purify the air in the event of a gas attack. The bunker and its anti-gas doors will serve as a stark reminder of \" one of the darkest pages of our history, \" according to rome's department for culture, per reuters. After refashioning the wine cellar, mussolini went on to build at least two more bunkers, one of which was reinforced with up to 13 feet of concrete. Mussolini was arrested before it had been completed, but had it been finished, it would have been italy's most resistant air raid shelter devoted to just one family.

Why there were so many people in the vicinity of the tanker: they were siphoning fuel off of it after the truck careened off the road, a common occurrence in this part of east africa, which suffers from poorly maintained truck routes that pass through impoverished communities, reuters notes. The cause of the blast appears to have been someone lighting a cigarette near the full tanker, which had reportedly started to leak as locals tried to steal fuel, the ap reports. The injured aren't out of the woods, either, per the country's information minister, who tells reuters, \" we don't have medical equipment, and these people may not survive because we do not have the facilities to treat the highly burnt people. \" although the country has been embroiled in a civil war for nearly two years, a presidential spokesman says this incident was simply an \" accident. \" ( the country's conflict is taking an especially violent toll on women and girls. )",

A similar strategy was previously used in mosul, iraq — where 2,500 isis fighters reportedly remain — with local forces doing much of the fighting with support from us forces in bases outside the city.

About to share their findings with the american chemical society, researchers at the us department of agriculture, the university of guelph, and the university of mississippi report in a press release that sweetgrass contains two chemicals, phytol and coumarin, that appear to be responsible. \" traditional or folk remedies have been a good source of leads for natural things that may be effective in repelling insects, \" says charles cantrell, who works at the usda's natural products utilization research unit; he's also studied breadfruit, beautyberry, and jatropha, reports the smithsonian. Unfortunately, many essential oil repellents only work for 20 or so minutes, he says, and \" what we're ideally looking for is something natural and nontoxic that's just as effective as deet, that will work as an effective repellent for 10 or 12 hours like deet. \" sweetgrass is a meadow grass native to northern climates, reports discovery. Cantrell's team needs to study the chemicals phytol and coumarin further to see if they will be effective for as long as deet is, and while sweetgrass didn't turn out to have any previously unknown repelling chemicals ( coumarin is already in some commercial repellents while phytol has already been reported on in other studies ), at least \" now we understand that there's a real scientific basis to this folklore, \" cantrell says.

The percentage increased to 41 % among millennials, defined as those aged 18 to 34. Some 41 % of americans and 66 % of millennials had no idea about auschwitz, the death camp in nazi-occupied poland where an estimated 1.1 million were killed, per wfts. The executive vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany, which seeks restitution for holocaust victims and their heirs and commissioned the february survey of 1,350 respondents, says the gaps in understanding are \" troubling \" given that some 400,000 holocaust survivors are still living. \" imagine when there are no longer survivors here to tell their stories, \" he says, stressing the importance of holocaust education. He's backed by survey respondents, 93 % of whom said it was important to teach about the holocaust in schools.

It's called the breakthrough starshot, and the idea backed by stephen hawking, russian billionaire yuri milner, and mark zuckerberg is to explore our nearest star system, reports the new york times. The alpha centauri system is about 25 trillion miles away, and cnet puts that distance of 4.3 light-years in perspective: it would take 30,000 years for our fastest spacecraft to get there. The starshot team aims to get there in 20 years — though any launch would require about 20 years of research and development first. And then factor in another four years for any information gleaned from the project to return to earth. \" earth is a wonderful place, but it might not last forever, \" says hawking in an email about the project. \" sooner or later, we must look to the stars. Breakthrough starshot is a very exciting first step on that journey. \" they'd pull it off by \" thinking very small, \" explains npr. The project calls for a fleet of \" nanocraft \" — chips that could fit in the palm of your hand — to be propelled into space by lasers and sails, much \" like a flock of migrating butterflies across the universe, \" says the times. Each chip would have cameras and sensors to collect data and send it home. As for the cost, figure between $ 5 billion and $ 10 billion, with an initial layout of $ 100 million from milner for r&d.

The fda's derived intervention level for iodine-131 in milk is 4700 picocuries per liter. The epa's mcl for iodine-131 is 3 picocuries per liter. \"there are a few reasons that epa's mcl for i-131 drinking water is different than fda's dil for i-131 in any given food, \" said fda spokesman siobhan delancy by email. \"one of them is that epa assumes a 70 year time period for exposure, so the mcls are basically for continual, ongoing intake.

Nothing much has changed since — except now the turing pharmaceuticals ceo is explaining why daraprim is still boasting exorbitant prices. \" i said that it would take a long amount of time to figure out how and when to lower the price, \" shkreli tells business insider, ostensibly referencing what he told abc news last month about lowering the price ( though he didn't appear to mention any timeframe ). What's holding things up, per shkreli: the assessment process to find a pricing/demand sweet spot to bring the price per pill down from the current $ 750. \" until we figure out demand, we won't lower the price, \" he tells bi. \" we have to find a safe price to lower it to. \" shkreli does add, however, that the new price won't be close to the original $ 13.50 per pill. He also takes umbrage at getting flak for doing what other companies, such as pfizer and merck, do. \" there have been hundreds of companies that have raised [ their drug prices ] higher, and they're not rolling back their prices, so why should we? \" shkreli points out. Meanwhile, new york's ag has started an inquiry into turing, also involving whether the company violated antitrust laws by restricting daraprim distribution to thwart generic competitors, the new york times reports. By significantly cutting where competitors can pick up daraprim, turing can ensure they have a hard time testing those samples to produce an alternative drug, the paper explains. A letter from the ag's office, seen by the times and sent to turing on monday, tells the company to get in touch and to \" retain all documents that are potentially relevant to this inquiry. \" ( some think we should thank shkreli. )",

        "summary": "When bombs began raining from the sky at pearl harbor, john anderson — in a turret aboard the uss arizona — thought immediately of his twin brother, jake, on deck. It appears jake never left his mind. Forced into a rescue boat, anderson reached shore only to grab a spare boat and return to the arizona to search for his brother, to no avail. Anderson did pick up three survivors, but then his boat was blown apart and \" i was the only one left alive, \" he later said, per the washington post. Anderson was told jake was killed by gunfire, but his body was never recovered from the arizona, which sank. Yet on the 75th anniversary of the attack, john anderson will be reunited with his brother at last as his ashes are to be interred on the wreck of the ship following his death last year. More coverage: former navy fireman edward waszkiewicz, 95, recalls seeing the arizona get hit, per the ventura county star. \" i thought the end of the world was coming. Pieces of the ship fell everywhere, \" he says. \" then all hell broke loose. \" with a book excerpt, time dives into the \" downright spooky \" mystery of an ad published in the new yorker two weeks before the attack that might have been a warning. At the post, historians describe how pearl harbor \" absolutely shattered americans ' image of themselves, \" yet also crafted a world power of the 21st century. In a separate piece, the post probes what might have happened if the japanese hadn't attacked pearl harbor, concluding \" it's quite likely that the two sides would have still clashed. \" nbc news notes some 4,000 people are expected to attend a commemoration ceremony at pearl harbor on wednesday. Prime minister shinzo abe will become the first japanese leader to visit the site later this month. Meanwhile, the chicago tribune notes this anniversary is different for one illinois woman: the remains of her uncle, who was 22 when he died at pearl harbor, have finally been identified.

        "summary": "\" the situation is being analyzed. \" such is the pronouncement from the kremlin following a pair of embarrassing space-related mishaps. On wednesday, russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin revealed that human error was responsible for the loss of a $ 45 million weather satellite called meteor-m; the rocket carrying that satellite and 18 smaller payloads was launched nov. 28 from the vostochny cosmodrome, but reuters reports the coordinates it was programmed with were for a launch from the baikonur cosmodrome. The ap describes the latter as russia's main launch pad, which it leases in kazakhstan. Russia's space agency has lost contact with meteor-m as a result. And the bad news for the country comes in twos. On thursday came the admission that communication has also been lost with angola's first national telecoms satellite, dubbed angosat-1, which reuters reports was launched from baikonur on tuesday and intended to serve a 15-year communications-boosting mission. Leading russian spacecraft manufacturer energia produced the angosat-1, and it confirmed it established communication with the satellite after it reached orbit, but \" after a while it had stopped sending telemetry \" data. No reason for the severed contact was given, though one space expert speculates the many delays in launching and the resulting extended storage time could have damaged the satellite. The afp notes the $ 280 million project included the training of roughly 50 angolan aerospace engineers assigned to work with the satellite.

        "summary": "He went in search of gold and jewels and, like others that came before him, died in pursuit. Authorities have confirmed 31-year-old coloradan eric ashby is at least the third person to die in search of forrest fenn's $ 2 million treasure, which the art collector claims is hidden somewhere in the rocky mountains, per people. Ashby was searching for the treasure with at least three friends when the raft they were using flipped on the arkansas river in colorado's royal gorge on june 28. While his friends made it to safety, ashby was entangled in ropes and slipped beneath the water's surface, his father tells the denver channel. On friday, dna provided by paul ashby was used to positively identify a body found downstream a month later as his son's, reports the albuquerque journal. Fenn — who gives clues to the treasure's location in his 2010 memoir the thrill of the chase — previously faced calls to end the hunt after the deaths of two searchers in new mexico, including one whose body was found days before ashby vanished, though he then said most people seemed to want the hunt to continue, per the journal and fox news. Ashby's father is focused on a different goal: he wants to see \" eric's law \" passed in colorado. Inspired by the friends who failed to contact police as ashby presumably drowned — they reportedly fled the scene, even after one saw ashby clinging to a rock — it would require witnesses to report life-threatening situations to police, he tells the denver channel. \" that takes away the injustice because all of a sudden eric's life can save a life, \" paul ashby says.",

I ' m going to die. \" that was reportedly one of matsuri takahashi's tweets not long before she killed herself last year by leaping from a dorm at dentsu, the ad company where the 24-year-old worked, per the new york times. This week, dentsu's head quit, taking responsibility for takahashi's suicide and his firm's culture of overwork. That culture is prevalent throughout japan, and even has its own term, \" karoshi, \" or \" death from overwork. \" tadashi ishii offered his \" heartfelt apology \" wednesday and said he'd offer his resignation to dentsu's board in january; he apologized to takahashi's family in person on sunday, per the japan times. A labor department probe found takahashi had been putting in more than 100 hours of overtime a month leading up to her death, and she'd noted on twitter and to family that her bosses had harassed her and made sexist remarks. Per the ap, an october survey in the country's first white paper on karoshi found 93 suicides or attempted suicides in 2015 tied to overwork ( the guardian says that number is more like 2,000 suicides a year ), with 96 deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other maladies linked to karoshi. Business insider reports japan \" has been trying desperately \" to tamp down this deeply ingrained work ethic, including a \" work style reform \" panel led by pm shinzo abe. Some firms have started encouraging more work-life balance, including dentsu, which has a reputation as being particularly hard-core ( a slogan dating to the ' 50s implored workers to do their job \" even if it kills you \" ). Now dentsu flicks the lights off at 10pm and makes workers take a minimum of five days off every six months. \" [ i want to ] change the consciousness of every working person in japan, \" takahashi's mom says, per the guardian.

He's the kind of writer who talks about wanting to \" change the game \" and \" move the paradigm. \" yet he's also the head of full fathom five, a young-adult novel factory that pays writers nearly nothing to churn out highly commercial books for frey — who hopes to eventually stumble upon the next twilight or harry potter. Suzanne mozes, who briefly aspired to join the program after hearing frey pitch it during one of her columbia graduate writing seminars, discloses the controversial inner workings in a lengthy new york article. Frey trolls mfa programs and the like to find writers who are willing to write books for a mere $ 250 to $ 500 in exchange for a coveted entry into the publishing world. The contract promises them 30 % to 40 % of all revenue, but there's no audit provision, meaning the writer can't verify the revenue. As mozes discovers upon meeting with frey, writers must also submit to all the changes he wishes to make to their concept — and when she asks for amendments to the contract, her offer is rescinded entirely. Meanwhile, frey recently settled a legal battle with the author of his company's first success story, i am number four.

Far from cyberbullying, the tbh app — short for \" to be honest \" — is all about \" improving the mental health of millions of teens, \" co-founder nikita bier tells tech crunch. Only a month after its release, tbh zoomed to no. 1 free app in apple's app store. ( an android version is coming soon. ) it works by letting users send anonymous compliments like \" has the best smile \" to their friends and contacts. Unlike other anonymous apps, tbh only allows positive messages. A ninth-grader named claire tells new york magazine how it works: \" you sign in with your first and last name. You select your school, gender, and grade. \" the app then asks questions such as \" who's always nice to talk to? \" four friends ' names are given, and you tap on the one that best fits. As such, there is no typing, and tbh sends the messages, preventing trolls from infiltrating. A notification alerts recipients when they get some love. The app saves messages so users can reread them when they need a boost. \" we worked backwards from the content we wanted to see, which was nice comments about ourselves, \" a tbh rep tells tech crunch. Maker midnight labs did a test run of tbh last month at a georgia high school, where it was a hit. The company then launched in nine states and nyc, per new york, and within weeks had 2 million daily users. \" i thought the tbh app was gonna be lame, \" one fan tweeted, \" but it's honestly so sweet … and that's pretty cool. \" and, potentially, addictive: users can only answer up to 12 questions per hour.

Police nabbed two males, ages 19 and 17, who are suspected of trying to set two brush fires in escondido, reports the los angeles times. A witness who saw them start one fire off a main boulevard extinguished it and called police, reports the san diego union-tribune. Soon after, another witness did the same at a local park. Officers then caught the suspects outside a mall. Police haven't connected the pair to the wildfires that have scorched the region and forced thousands of evacuations. The ap reports that some of those evacuations were lifted this morning, as firefighters hoped cooler temperatures would help their cause. Meanwhile, the first potential fatality has been reported: authorities found a burned body at a transient camp in carlsbad.",

        "summary": "Want to sound more authoritative or hit those low notes in your signature song? just have a baby. It worked for adele and kristen bell, who have both noted that during and after pregnancy, their voices were lower. Researchers at the university of sussex in britain may have an explanation, reports the guardian. The investigators studied archive interview recordings of 20 mothers, including actresses, journalists, and singers, and compared them to a control group. Working from more than 600 voice recordings, they were able to analyze voice pitch in the five years before and after pregnancy and found that on average, a woman's voice after giving birth dropped by 5 %, which amounts to 44 hertz, or two musical notes. It's a noticeable difference, especially if you're shooting to hit the low notes in an oscar-winning theme song like skyfall. \"when it comes to human voices, we can perceive pitch differences around 5 hertz in regular speech, so 44 hertz is a very salient difference, \" lead author dr. Kasia pisanski tells the washington post. The experimental psychologist also notes that while singers have noticed their voices getting lower while pregnant, \"the big drop actually happens after they give birth, \" per the guardian. The new range typically lasts for about a year. The researchers don't know why this happens, but hormone changes may be partly responsible. It could also be partly behavioral. Studies show that people with low-pitched voices are generally viewed as more competent and dominant. So it's possible that a woman might instinctively lower her voice to sound more authoritative when \"faced with the new challenges of parenting, \" says pisanski.",

For 69 years, 11 months, and 17 days, the mlb team has labored under \" the billy goat curse, \" which the superstitious believe has kept the cubs from winning a title in wrigley field — and that a group of competitive eaters hoped to break last night by devouring a 40-pound goat, nbc chicago reports. The curse was supposedly cast during the 1945 world series, when billy sianis, the owner of billy goat tavern, is said to have shown up at the ballpark with his pet goat, murphy. The goat wasn't allowed entry by cubs owner pk wrigley himself because it reeked, the washington post notes, and sianis reportedly screamed in a rage outside the park: \" the cubs ain't gonna win no more! \" the cubs not only lost that world series, but they haven't been back to the championships since, earning them the nickname the \" lovable losers. \" past attempts to lift the curse have proven futile, the tavern's website notes. Per the post, hot dog-eating champ takeru kobayashi joined four other competitive eaters at a chicago restaurant last night to break the spell, and their alchemy involved chowing down on a cooked 40-pound goat in a chowdown one observer said transpired in \" about twelve minutes, \" adding, \" that was … disgusting. \" and if the cubs don't make the playoffs? as the post puts it, the goat gorging will just have been \" much ado about mutton. \" if they win the world series, however, you could have a shot at an $ 85,000 delorean.
