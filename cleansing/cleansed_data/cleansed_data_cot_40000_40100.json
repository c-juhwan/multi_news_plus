Just this month, burnbook posts have triggered at least 12 police investigations involving high school students, including alleged gun threats, bomb threats, posted nude photos, and bullying that led to a suicide attempt. \" i didn't even know about burnbook until this came around, \" an oregon police sergeant told the oregonian after a teenager was arrested. The \" burnbook \" concept dates back to the film mean girls, which featured a pink gossip book by that name, and \" digital burnbooks \" like facebook pages and apps including yik yak, whisper, and secret, mashable reports. Burnbook founder and ceo jonathan lucas says the app was conceived as \" a bastion of free speech, \" but tells kusi that \" we've changed out objectionable content \" and even contacted police: \" anonymity is a privilege, not a right, \" he says. \" if that privilege is abused, there are consequences. \" he also set the app's age requirement at 18, or 17 with permission of a guardian or parent, even though elementary schools are listed as burnbook \" communities. \" meanwhile, parents and students are fighting back by posting positive burnbook messages, and a \" family safety evangelist \" is advising parents to talk to their kids about it. And some people are just plain upset: \" what kind of person creates an app like burnbook? \" reads one tweet. \" if you feel the need to be anonymous, you probably shouldn't be saying anything at all. \" ( see how a woman called \" the world's ugliest \" online is showing her true beauty. )",

Since then, yahoo has revealed itself to have been the victim of the two biggest data breaches ever, resulting in information from more than a billion users being stolen. According to the washington post, experts expected verizon to demand yahoo knock billions off the purchase price or to simply call off the deal entirely. But on tuesday, the companies announced the deal was going through — at a comparatively minor 7 % discount. Verizon will now purchase yahoo for $ 4.48 billion, the wall street journal reports. What's left of yahoo after the sale — an entity to be known as altaba — will split liability with verizon for any future lawsuits that result from the yahoo data breaches. Altaba alone will be responsible for whatever happens with an ongoing sec investigation into the hacks. Sources say verizon went through with the deal at a minor discount for multiple reasons. One, verizon has a ton of money and a few billion dollars weren't going to make a difference to it. Two, verizon says the number of yahoo users who left following the hacks was \" minimal. \" verizon is basically buying yahoo in order to advertise to users on its news and sports sites, tumblr, and flickr; if a bunch of yahoo users fled the service, verizon would have fewer people to advertise to.

        "summary": "Scientists say there's a 6 % chance earth will having flying cars in the future. Specifically one flying car: the tesla roadster elon musk launched into space earlier this month. Researchers analyzing the car's orbit say there's a 6 % chance it will crash into earth at some point over 1 million years, science reports. That chance goes up to 10 % after 3 million years. The tesla, which is being driven by a mannequin in a spacesuit, will have its first close call with earth in 2091, when it could come closer than the moon, according to cbs news. Regardless, hanno rein at the university of toronto says falling electric vehicles are nothing to worry about. \"it will either burn up or maybe one component will reach the surface, \" he tells science. \"there is no risk to health and safety whatsoever. \" rein and his fellow researchers found the roadster's orbit will have it repeatedly crossing the paths of mars, earth, and venus until it's destroyed. They say the car has a 50 % chance of orbiting the solar system for tens of millions of years before that happens. It will cross mars ' orbit in july before reaching its farthest distance from the sun — 154.7 million miles — in november. However rein warns these are all just educated guesses due to the tesla's chaotic orbit. Meanwhile, a hubble fellow at the university of north carolina tweeted that measuring the brightness of the roadster shows it's rotating every 4.8 minutes or so. And space.com put together a cool 80-second video showing the roadster from its launch to the moment it becomes just a tiny dot traveling across the sky 500,000 miles from earth.",

Though it's unclear whether ghonim played a role in organizing the protests, he has long stirred opposition to mubarak's government online.

Rene hoover's 14-year-old son, alex, has a terminal heart condition that has narrowed his mitral valve. The ap reports that has hampered his blood flow, a situation exacerbated by his growth. Alex was hospitalized multiple times over the summer, and whnt reported last month that the family's doctors feel the best choice for alex from a quality-of-life perspective would be to let him die naturally. The teen has hospice care twice a week, according to decaturdaily.com, and his family obtained a legal advance directive stating alex is not to be revived if he goes into cardiac arrest. There's only one problem: east limestone high school refuses to honor the advance directive and has said it will do everything it can to save the teen if something happens while he's at school. Alex hasn't gone back to school since his hospitalizations, though he is physically up for attending class four hours a week. Waff reports hoover isn't permitted to stay with alex while he's at school ( which would allow her to make medical choices for him ) due to policies regarding how much time parents can spend on campus. \" his entire life would be medications, surgeries, \" she says of resuscitating him. \" this is about doing the right thing for him and letting him enjoy what time he has left. \" one bioethics expert isn't so sure, telling the ap he isn't convinced alex, who has autism, had the capacity to issue the advance directive. There are also concerns that his death could traumatize other students. The state's education department doesn't have a policy on advance directives. Hoover is currently working with a state legislator to change that. In the meantime, alex remains at home. ( this school is involved in a controversy over prayer. )",

The post, however, tells mashable it has featured the buttons for half a decade, though on the side of an article, not in the text.

There was no murder or [ life ] that was in danger if shots were not fired and the automobile continued on to leave hardees. There was no amber alert. There was no",

The only difference with this scenario is that the young man was not black, but white. Nineteen-year-old zachary hammond was on a date july 26 when he was fatally shot by a police officer while in parking lot at a hardee's fast-food restaurant in seneca, south carolina, according to eric bland, the attorney representing the teen's family. The seneca police department said the officer was conducting a drug investigation and shot hammond in self-defense. \" he was a uniformed officer, he was in a marked vehicle, was out of his vehicle on foot approaching the suspect vehicle -- weapon drawn given it was a narcotics-type violation, \" seneca police chief john covington said to cnn affiliate whns in greenville.",
            "Zachary hammond, 19, was shot and killed by police outside a hardee's on july 26 in his hometown of seneca. Angie and paul hammond have lived in rural oconee county for most of their lives, but they say they've felt like strangers in their tight-knit community since their teenage son was shot dead by seneca police last month. Shooting into cars about a quarter of police shootings in south carolina since 2009 have involved officers firing into fleeing cars, as in the zachary hammond case in seneca. The post and courier's \"shots fired \" series revealed that officers in some of the cases said they fired because vehicles were moving toward them when other evidence showed vehicles heading away.

New research out of france furthers this notion in its finding that even the personality traits we consider to be our most entrenched and unchanging are in fact probably socially contagious. Reporting in the journal plos computational biology, they find that a person's levels of laziness, impatience, and prudence ( a preference for avoiding risk ) shift rather easily after merely observing how others react to situations. The study leans on a very small sample size of 56 healthy people and analyzes their behaviors outside of real-life settings and situations, but the ease with which people drifted from their established baseline traits suggests that there is imitation at play, reports live science. Whether these so-called fixed traits are actually ever-shifting behaviors requires further study. Researchers next plan to look at how the results play out among people with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. For now, they tell time health that they're not trying to dissuade people from spending time with certain types of friends, but they do encourage spending time with those whose dispositions you admire.

Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5 % less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: if 1,000 women went to the er with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the er, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the guardian. So what's going on? \" since heart disease is often cast as a ' male ' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do, \" says lead author brad greenwood. While more research is needed, \" the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients, \" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10 % of the study cases, per reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. ( breastfeeding may help the heart. )",

The startup intends to do what its name suggests: provide shareable umbrellas — like a rain-themed version of citi bike — in china. Except not even three months after launch, it has a big problem in the 11 cities it has a presence in: most of the 300,000 umbrellas it started out with have now been lost. The guardian suggests the fault lies with the company's founders: while a would-be umbrella user must pay a roughly $ 2.80 deposit and about $ 0.07 per half-hour of use, the paper reports no additional penalty is levied for failing to return an umbrella. The verge suggests another problem, that \" the startup apparently didn't provide enough information on how customers can return the umbrellas when they're done. \" it gets even more confusing from there, with the south china morning post noting the original report on sharing e umbrella's woes didn't specify the return policy but quoted ceo zhao shuping as saying, \" bikes can be parked anywhere, but with an umbrella you need railings or a fence to hang it on \" — and so taking the umbrella home for safekeeping is likely the \" best \" route. But zhao sounds undaunted, saying his company intends to spread 30 million umbrellas throughout the country by the end of the year. Sixth tone notes there are roughly 15 chinese umbrella startups, and the deposits they charge get as high as $ 14.50 — raising the possibility this is just a clever way to sell, not rent, umbrellas. As for whether we ' ll see this stateside, the verge points out the idea was called the \" worst... Ever heard \" when it was pitched on shark tank.

He entered the home and proceeded to the backyard, where he discovered 158 plants, nye county sheriff's officials said. Fleiss arrived at the home from her guesthouse a short time later. She told officers she was growing the plants to sell to a cooperative in las vegas. She did not have a license to grow marijuana, but she claimed she was going to get one, police said. Police then searched her residence and the guesthouse where they uncovered 234 additional marijuana plants, two grow lights and several bottles of chemicals used to grow marijuana. Fleiss said she planned to destroy the smaller plants in the guesthouse because she felt she was growing too many plants, police said. Fleiss faces one count of marijuana with intent to sell, marijuana over one ounce, possession of drug paraphernalia, maintaining a residence where drugs are sold and conspiracy to violate the controlled substance act. Fleiss, who was nicknamed the hollywood madam for running a high-end brothel, was not arrested because she owns $ 200,000 in exotic birds and she cooperated with the investigation, police",

For just under 30 of those years, it's been in the possession of the metropolitan museum of art — and for the last week or so, it's been stored in the evidence room of the manhattan da's office. At issue is the provenance of the item, known as a bell krater and attributed to the greek artist python: the museum acquired it in a sotheby's auction for $ 90,000 in 1989, but investigators believe it was looted from an italian grave in the 1970s, reports the new york times. The suspicions most loudly surfaced in 2014, when forensic archaeologist christos tsirogiannis made a case in the journal of art crime based on evidence that involves a man who's a known headache to the met: giacomo medici. The 79-year-old italian art dealer served four years after being convicted of conspiracy to traffic in antiquities and was tied to the euphronios krater, a stunning piece of pottery signed by euphronios himself that the museum paid a record-breaking $ 1 million for in 1972. The museum was ultimately forced to send it back to italy after it was confirmed to have been raided from a tomb. In this case, tsirogiannis alleges photos found in medici's warehouses show the python vase with \" soil/salt encrustations, \" per the association for research into crimes against art, making it \" abundantly clear \" to him \" that this rare object had been stolen, \" per the times. In his own comments to the times, medici denies that the vase ever crossed his hands. The met says it did try to follow up on tsirogiannis ' claims with italy and was awaiting a reply when it was served a search warrant from the manhattan da last week.",

        "summary": "A fresh round of unrest has hit chinese-operated mines in zambia. Rioting coal miners killed a chinese manager on saturday by pushing a mine trolley at him as he tried to flee, reports the bbc. Another chinese manager and several zambians were injured during the incident at the mine, which has a history of unrest between workers and management. Chinese managers at the mine shot and injured at least 13 zambian miners during a wage protest in 2010. The miners, who earn around $ 150 a month, were protesting delays in implementing a new minimum wage law that would see them make a minimum of an additional $ 80 per month. Zambian president michael sata was elected last year after campaigning on a promise to crack down on chinese-owned mines paying \" slave wages \" and to deport investors who thumb their noses at the country's labor laws, but he has quieted his anti-china rhetoric since taking office, the wall street journal notes.",

        "summary": "Colorado and utah are taking a page from michael bloomberg's book: both states have moved to raise the smoking age to 21, following a similar bill passed in new york city last fall. The proposals were given the initial go-ahead yesterday, and though more votes are needed, this is the furthest any state has gone to rein in teen access to cigarettes, the ap notes. Utah — with the nation's lowest smoking rate at 12 % as of 2011 — is already one of only four states that require tobacco purchasers to be 19. The smoking rate is low in colorado, too, at about 18 %, but health advocates only want to see it fall. \" what i ' m hoping to do is make it harder for kids to obtain cigarettes, \" says colorado rep. Cheri gerou, while a utah woman adds, \" by raising the age limit, it puts them in a situation where they're not going to pick it up until a much later age. \" a study last year found 90 % of daily smokers have their first cigarette by 18, and 90 % of those who buy cigarettes for minors are between 18 and 20. Still, the salt lake tribune notes it was an \" emotional debate \" in utah, with opponents arguing adults should be free to make their own choices — even if they're bad ones — and noting a \" slippery slope \" could lead to bans on high-calorie foods...

        "summary": "When it comes to sugar, americans need to be a lot more careful, a study finds. Even two cans of soda a day can significantly boost the risk of death from heart disease. If a quarter of your daily caloric intake comes from added sugar — in processed foods, for instance — your risk of death from heart disease could be triple the risk faced by someone who gets less than 10 % of her calories from sugar. What could get you to the 25 % level? the ap give this example: a breakfast cinnamon roll, a super-sized soda at lunch, and ice cream after dinner. About 10 % of adults hit that level; between 2005 and 2010, americans got an average 15 % of their calories from added sugar, bloomberg notes. Researchers led by a cdc expert found that the dangers from sugar weren't just due to obesity: the threat exists for people of normal weight. The study reviewed national health surveys between 1988 and 2010; the researchers investigated data on some 30,000 people. Soda and other sugary drinks are the main problem, accounting for some 37 % of the added sugar in an american diet. Desserts and fruit drinks make up much of the rest. ( sugars found naturally in fruits and vegetables weren't classified as \" added sugar. \" ) says an expert who write an editorial accompanying the study in jama internal medicine, \" too much sugar does not just make us fat; it can also make us sick. \"",

            "High sugar consumption may double the chance of dying from heart disease, according to a study that adds to evidence that high levels of the sweetener in processed foods and drink is bad for a person's health. People whose sugar intake is about a quarter or more of their total daily calories had twice the risk of dying from heart disease than those who whose intake was 7 percent, according to the research today in jama internal medicine. For those whose intake of added sugar was about 19 percent, their risk of dying from heart disease was about 38 percent higher. Today's study is the first to link on a national level the amount of sugar american adults eat to their risk of dying from heart disease after taking into account weight, age, health, exercise and diet, said lead study author quanhe yang, an epidemiologist at the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention.

People whose sugar intake is about a quarter or more of their total daily calories had twice the risk of dying from heart disease than those who whose intake was 7 percent, according to the research today in jama internal medicine. For those whose intake of added sugar was about 19 percent, their risk of dying from heart disease was about 38 percent higher.

        "summary": "A 16-year-old from nevada who apparently really likes wendy's chicken nuggets is closing in on the record for the most retweets ever thanks to a random idea he decided to act upon, reports the guardian. Last wednesday night, carter wilkerson took to twitter to ask: \" yo @wendys how many retweets for a year of free chicken nuggets? \" wendy's responded that 18 million would do the trick. Wilkerson accepted the challenge with this tweet, which had been retweeted about 2.5 million times as of tuesday morning. For some perspective, the largest retweet ever came after ellen degeneres took to twitter during the 2014 oscars, with hers clocking in at just under 3.3 million retweets. Wilkerson now appears to have the second most popular tweet ever, having edged ahead of one by louis tomlinson of one direction. Still, 18 million is a tall order, and the challenge has turned the teen into \" a global hero with a mission \" via #nuggsforcarter, notes a post at twitter itself. The teen spoke to the reno gazette-journal when the tweet first took off, explaining that he sent his original query as a joke. The reaction has been \" pretty cool, \" he says, with his father adding that he hopes they can work out some kind of charitable giveaway with wendy's when the retweeting subsides. Eater points out that wilkerson could retweet himself, but he'd have to do so once a second nonstop for about seven months in order to reach the mark that way. Meanwhile, the guardian predicts that he's sure to show up on degeneres'show at some point.",

The virtual currency has gained interest from ibm, jpmorgan chase, and microsoft \" as a sort of bitcoin 2.0, \" reports the new york times. Created around 2014 by a 21-year-old college dropout, russian-canadian vitalik buterin, ethereum is much like its rival, though the times adds this caveat: \" the system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain english. \" transactions are recorded publicly on a blockchain, which stores data without the need for a central repository. For the uninitiated, a blockchain is essentially \" an indestructible, public, immutable ledger, \" explains a post at inverse. \" an unmodifiable record of what's happened. \" ethereum also supports \" decentralized applications \" and \" smart contracts \" that don't charge fees, buterin tells coindesk. The idea is to eliminate middlemen. The times uses this example of how it works: two people betting on a sports game could program their bet into the blockchain so that the money — or ether units — would be automatically sent to the winner when the game is over. Inverse, meanwhile, thinks it's more than a digital currency in that it \" takes the conceptual basis for ( bitcoin ) and makes it applicable to just about anything. \" investors seem enthused: the value of an ether has jumped 1,000 % to a peak of $ 12, bringing the value of all existing ether to about $ 1 billion — second only to bitcoin's $ 6 billion in the world of virtual currency. But ethereum is very much in the early stages, and it remains to be seen how the complex software will stand up to security challenges and attacks that have hit bitcoin and others.

        "summary": "Worried about how modern life affects human sperm, both in quantity and quality? you're not alone: ideas have been circulating that things like underwear, laptops, cycling, and weight kill off or weaken sperm. So five thirty-eight starts off by tackling the tight-underwear issue: a 2012 study looked at five french fathers, ages 25 to 35, who wore tight undies that facilitated a natural heating of their testicles. After four months, their sperm quality was way down and sperm count was nearly zero. On the bright side, however, they recovered in just a few months with looser underwear. Yet that basic find — that heated testicles are temporarily bad for sperm — seems to hold true across the board: a dozen men who flip-flopped between boxers and boxer briefs for a year saw their sperm count drop by half during the \" tighter \" periods, according to a 1996 study in the medical journal lancet. Serious cyclists who put foot to pedal 12 to 16 hours a week saw their sperm counts fall, according to another study — \" likely for the same heat-related reason, \" says five thirty-eight. But casual cyclists probably don't have to worry. Heat from electric blankets, saunas, hot baths, sleeping positions, and weather could also affect sperm if exposure is ongoing. Laptops too, possibly, if they're perched often enough on just the right spot. The link between sperm and weight isn't clear-cut: one study out last year found a correlation between overweight men and low sperm count; this 2012 study found a high-fat diet was tied to lower sperm production and concentration. But then there's this 2012 study, which found being overweight didn't affect sperm quality — and neither did smoking, heavy drinking, and doing drugs. Among the latest sperm news: a university of otago review of 90 studies from more than 30 countries confirms there are \" consistent age-related declines \" in the quantity of semen and the health of sperm.

They recount the august day when wilson, while mowing his lawn, learned that his address had leaked online. He had killed michael brown 10 days before. And so wilson abandoned the lawn mid-mow; he hasn't been back to his home since. He first went to the home of a relative ( one with a different last name ), then stayed with one of his lawyers, greg kloeppel, for a week. He ultimately landed in what his lawyers term a \" quote-unquote permanent location \"; they won't say more than that. They also decided early on that wilson shouldn't say anything at all. As one of his lawyers, james towey, puts it, george zimmerman was \" an idiot, darren was not. Any criminal defense lawyer that has half a brain says,'shut up, don't say a word. ' \" wilson didn't go out in public very often, but when he did he employed what one lawyer describes as \" certain [ disguise ] tricks \" that he was aware of as a cop in order to be \" unnoticeable. \" one repeat destination: movie theaters, which provided a comforting darkness. As for whether he ' ll return to his career as a cop, towey says no way. \" i think i expressed to him,'do you realize your first call [ back on the job ] will be to a blind alley where you're executed? ' he took a pause for a minute, thought about it and said, ' oh.'that is the reality. \" ( the post also looked at wilson's actions in the aftermath of the shooting, which one former police chief described as \" very, very bad. \" )",

( associated press ) anchorage, alaska ( ap ) — a 10-year-old girl has been found dead friday, authorities said, more than a week after she was reported missing in a remote inupiat eskimo town on alaska's northwestern coast. Ashley johnson-barr's remains were found",
            "After almost a week of constant searching, community members in kotzebue paused to pray wednesday evening. Courtesy scotty barr dozens of people stood with bowed heads in rainbow park, the spot officials say was the last place anyone saw 10-year-old ashley johnson-barr before she went missing last thursday. Placards adorned the steel wire fence, praying for her return and sending messages of love as crowds shielded children in the middle off a prayer circle. One sign read ' one child missing is too many. ' family and friends hugged each other, tears were shed, and laughter was shared. The sun peaked out from the clouds of a mostly grey day, bathing the makeshift congregation in golden light as they stood holding hands. \" i had no knowledge before it happened at all, \" walter \" scotty \" barr, ashley's father, said of the prayer gathering. \" it goes to show the love of the community and everyone who has helped. \" barr says his daughter, a fifth grade elementary student, loves basketball, picking berries with her mother and has been an honor student since the second day. He says she often uses her allowance to buy candy and toys for other kids and enjoys playing and looking after her niece. During the day, teams of volunteers again poured in and out of the northwest arctic"

Though romenesko always displayed his sources, journalism school director julie moos explained yesterday that he too often included verbatim quotes without enclosing them in quotation marks, the ap reports. Romenesko had been set to start a blog and go part-time at poynter in seven weeks, moos added in a later statement. \"the abrupt conclusion of jim's tenure with poynter should not overshadow his unmatched contributions; he changed poynter, he changed journalism, and he changed newsrooms, \" she wrote. On the awl, choire sicha has an interesting take on the evolution of romenesko's blog — which was, originally, entirely \"about giving credit, in ways that virtually no other blog has been \" but has grown increasingly \"intolerable \" under moos. In a defense of romenesko, sicha calls him \" charitable with links and naming bylines, and producing even more links when grubby reporters would come emailing with ' but i posted that memo just now tooooo!

Musk touched on all manner of things in the interview, but he's drawing the most attention for taking a puff of a marijuana-tobacco joint handed to him by rogan. Related coverage, including the departure of two high-ranking tesla execs: the pot: \" i mean it's legal, right? \" asked musk in accepting the joint. ( the interview was done in california, where recreational pot is, in fact, legal. See the pot-smoking here. ) musk, though, says he almost never indulges in the stuff. \" i don't find that it's very good for productivity, \" he said. \" it is sort of like a cup of coffee in reverse. \" musk also had some whiskey during the interview.

Government experts say the mediterranean fish have been migrating to the north sea in rising numbers since the 1990s for a simple reason: summer sea temperatures are rising to mediterranean levels. The shifting fish have been worrying policymakers for years. In 2012, a study by marine scientists found that north sea fishermen were targeting squid rather than traditional catches like cod, which had moved further north in search of cold water, the guardian reported at the time. The study found that even mild warming was set to devastate mussel farming and salmon production and warned that conflict between british and foreign fishing fleets is bound to rise. \" the truth is that climate change is having a big impact on distribution of fish stocks, and this is going to present some significant challenges for policymakers, fisheries managers, and for the fishing industry itself, \" a uk government minister said.

        "summary": "\" i have to say who i am, \" krzysztof charamsa told a polish newspaper saturday. \" i am a happy and proud gay priest. \" reuters reports that admission, also made to an italian newspaper, cost the 43-year-old monsignor his position at the vatican's congregation of the doctrine of faith, where he had worked since 2003. According to the ap, charamsa was motivated to come out after getting hate mail for publicly criticizing an anti-gay polish priest. \" this is a very personal, difficult, and tough decision in the catholic church's homophobic world, \" he says. Immediately following his announcement — he held a press conference at a rome restaurant — charamsa was fired by the vatican. The vatican claims it didn't fire charamsa for being gay — which in itself isn't a sin — but for making his announcement immediately before international bishops were set to meet as part of a synod to discuss outreach to gay catholics, reuters reports. \" the decision to make such a pointed statement on the eve of the opening of the synod appears very serious and irresponsible, since it aims to subject the synod assembly to undue media pressure, \" a vatican spokesperson says. Charamsa — who also announced he had a boyfriend, which would be a sin — is still a priest, though that could change, according to the ap. \" it's time for the church to open its eyes about gay catholics and to understand that the solution it proposes to them — total abstinence from a life of love — is inhuman, \" reuters quotes charamsa as saying.",

The study, in fact, also shows that rats love to be tickled and that they burst out in the equivalent of rat laughter during the tickling. That laughing part was previously known, but the new study sheds light on what's going on in the brain. In the research, neuroscientists from germany's humboldt university tickled young male rats in various ways and outlined their findings in science, reports the los angeles times. Among the revelations: a stressed-out rat has no interest in being tickled, but the same rat essentially giggles when tickled under better circumstances. ( it's too high-pitched for humans to hear. ) \" they were so excited, \" animal psychologist shimpei ishiyama tells smithsonian. \" they were jumping around and they chased my hand. Pretty much like human kids, giggling and chasing around. \" for the record, the belly seems to be the sweet spot. The point of all this? tickling is actually kind of a puzzle to scientists, and they're trying to unravel its mysteries. Researchers tracked brain activity and found that certain cells fired during the actual tickling and even while the rodents were merely chasing the tickler's hand. The latter part was a surprise, but a bigger one was that if researchers stimulated those same brain cells with an electrical current, sans tickling, the rats behaved as if they were being tickled, reports science. \" maybe ticklishness is a trick of the brain to make animals or humans play or interact in a fun way, \" speculates co-researcher michael brecht.

Each part of the routine lasted for about 10 seconds, followed by a 15-second break.",
            "For the ticklish among us, just the approach of wiggling fingers is enough to elicit squeals, if not screams. And it turns out we're not the only ones. Now, a study in rats pinpoints the \"tickle center \" of the mammalian brain, showing for the first time that stimulating neurons in that region can elicit a paroxysm of ultrasonic squeaks, the rat version of human laughter. Scientists have puzzled over the mysteries of tickling for millennia, with aristotle famously asking why most people can't tickle themselves. There are important neurological and psychological reasons to study tickling: one telltale symptom of schizophrenia, for example, is that people can tickle themselves. Tickling is also linked to our ability to laugh, play, and feel good, notes shimpei ishiyama, a neuroscientist at the humboldt university of berlin. \"neuroscientists are so obsessed with deficits such as depression and anxiety, it's rare to find papers about positive emotions, \" he says. Previous studies of tickling in people reveal a mosaic of brain regions that orchestrate the tickle response. One of these regions, the somatosensory cortex, was thought to merely process the sensation of being tickled, but not trigger the laughter that follows. The new work, published today in science, \"shows for the first time that laughter can be elicited by stimulation \" in that region, rather than through traditional emotional circuitry, says elise wattendorf, a neuroscientist at the university of fribourg in germany who was not involved in the research. Rats weren't always thought to be the chortling sort, but now a large body of literature backs up that they serve as a good model for tickling in people. \"although it was a very bold idea in the beginning, experiments show that rats are enjoying it, \" ishiyama says.

On thursday, the highest-ranking elected republican in the land stunned the trump campaign by saying he is \" just not ready \" to support him, politico reports. \" i ' m not there right now, \" house speaker paul ryan told cnn's jake tapper, adding that he wants trump to unite \" all wings of the republican party and the conservative movement \" and run a campaign americans will be \" proud to support and proud to be a part of. \" the rebuke from ryan — who had previously pledged to support whomever the party's nominee was — surprised even some of his allies, the washington post reports. The diss was the \" starkest evidence yet \" of how much damage top congressional republicans fear trump could do to their majorities — and a reminder that ryan is still believed to have future white house ambitions of his own, which could be wrecked by getting too close to trump, the new york times notes. Ryan's comments were cheered by some house and senate republicans and denounced by others, reports the hill, which calls the deepening divide a \" gop civil war. \" trump responded to the remarks by saying he \" isn't ready \" for ryan and his agenda. \" perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people, \" he said in a statement.

However, the report by michael horowitz may disappoint supporters of president trump by concluding that the former fbi chief wasn't motivated by political bias. Horowitz will give the report to congress on thursday, and it's likely to have a big fallout. As vox explains, the report has nothing to do with robert mueller's russia investigation, but trump has been using the comey-clinton allegations — how he handled the investigation into her use of a private email server — to generally discredit the fbi and accuse it of an anti-trump bias. The report focused in part on comey's announcement in july 2016 that clinton acted improperly but did nothing illegal. \"while we did not find that these decisions were the result of political bias on comey's part, we nevertheless concluded that by departing so clearly and dramatically from fbi and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the fbi and the department as fair administrators of justice, \" writes horowitz in the conclusions part of the report, which was obtained in advance by bloomberg. As the hill notes, the specific ways in which comey violated fbi procedural norms aren't yet clear, though that will likely change in the coming days. Comey, however, managed to infuriate democrats and republicans with his actions — the former by announcing in the final weeks of the campaign that the fbi was looking into new information related to the email server, and the latter for subsequently concluding that she didn't break the law.",

The first step came yesterday when the justice department filed a legal brief urging the court to declare the defense of marriage act unconstitutional, reports cnn. Doma defines a marriage as a union between a man and a woman and denies federal benefits to gay spouses, even if states grant them. \" moral opposition to homosexuality, though it may reflect deeply held personal views, is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people, \" said the brief, which concludes that the act violates the constitution's \" fundamental guarantee of equal protection, \" reports the huffington post. Arguments in the case, involving a new york woman suing the irs over estate taxes, will be heard next month. ( house republicans have hired a lawyer to defend the government's position because the white house no longer supports doma. ) politico notes that the language in the legal brief is so strong and \" sweeping \" that it suggests the white house is going to weigh in on a second case before the court next month, that one on the legality of california's prop 8, which banned same-sex marriage.

State attorney general mike dewine says he didn't believe a public announcement was necessary, given that 26 states already use similar systems, he tells the paper. The technology, which has been used some 2,600 times since june, can identify people by matching uploaded photos — from security cameras, for instance — to driver's licenses or mug shots. It then presents up to a dozen of the closest matches from a database of 21 million photos. Dewine wasn't informed when the system went live in early june, \" but i wasn't concerned, \" he notes. \" if we find something ( wrong ), we would change it, and if we find something alarming, we would shut it down. \" now, officials are reviewing and updating policies surrounding the system; the aclu wants it shut down in the meantime, the raw story reports. The ag held a press conference yesterday to address the issue. \" you're going to save lives, \" he said, per the toledo blade. \" for us not to do this would be a dereliction of our duty to the people of the state of ohio to protect them. \"",

        "summary": "Venezuela is a mess, and a vote scheduled for sunday is poised to make things worse. President nicolas maduro aims to create a new lawmaking body called the constituent assembly that would essentially replace the current national assembly ( controlled by opponents ) and rewrite venezuela's constitution. Maduro says the vote is the only hope for peace, but critics, including the us, are pressuring him to call it off. They say it would effectively end the latin american nation's status as a democracy, turning maduro into a dictator and making next year's presidential election meaningless. Here's a look at what's happening: us sanctions: the us slapped sanctions on 13 venezuelans with ties to maduro on wednesday and threatened more against anyone elected to the new assembly, reports the miami herald. The white house is holding out hope maduro will cancel the vote. How rude: one of those hit by the sanctions, iris verala, tweeted a photo of herself offering a middle-finger salute to america with a message that translates in part to say, \" go to hell, you s ----- yankees. \" for his part, maduro asked, \" who do these imperialists in the united states think they are? the government of the world? \" per the bbc. A way out: an analysis at the economist suggests the international community should negotiate with maduro: let him finish his term that expires next year, provided he respect the constitution and free political prisoners. This might require immunity for him and his cronies, which is \" distasteful, \" but, combined with the new sanctions, might just be the only peaceful path out of this mess. A primer: cnn provides the broad strokes of the political chaos in an oil-rich nation where poverty is widespread. One example: when the opposition won a majority of seats in the national assembly in 2015, maduro became vulnerable to impeachment. Solution: he stacked the supreme court with supporters to block it. Nearly 100 dead: thursday is the second day of a 48-hour strike called by the opposition to protest sunday's vote. One person was killed in protests wednesday, bringing the total over the last four months to 98, reports the ap. Gas prices: bloomberg points out that venezuela is the third-largest source for foreign oil to the us, behind canada and saudi arabia, meaning tougher us penalties on the nation's oil industry could ultimately end up raising the price of gasoline. Despacito: maduro used an altered version of the no. 1 song at a political rally, and its creators are none too pleased. The new york times has",

Frankenberg says the study shows only \" a single snapshot in time, \" but the new mexico oil and gas association describes it as limited.

In an interview with the bbc broadcast on tuesday, assad said there was no direct cooperation with the united states, whose air force has been bombing islamic state in syria since september as part of a strategy aimed at rolling back the group. Islamic state has seized wide areas of syria and iraq, declaring them part of a cross-border \" caliphate \". But the united states has said assad cannot be a partner in the campaign against the group, describing him as part of the problem. The syrian government is waging its own, separate campaign against islamic state, including air strikes in areas that have also been struck by the u.s.-led alliance. It has been widely assumed the syrian and u.s. Armies have conveyed information about the movements of jets using the same air space.

The reality tv star can be seen in the video below getting out of a vehicle and into a scrum of fans with kanye west and her mother, kris jenner, ahead of the balmain show at paris fashion week on thursday ( 25 september ). Sediuk appears to grab her legs, pulling her to the floor, before a number of security guards are forced to intervene. \" i hope kim is ok and won't be mad at me as i didn't mean any harm, \" vitalii told the mailonline after the incident. \" kanye is one lucky man as kim is a goddess! \" on his decision to target kardashian west specifically, he said it was his protest at the united states for banning him from entering the country. Sediuk was sentenced to three years ' probation, a year of psychological counselling and 20 days of community service after he assaulted brad pitt on the red carpet at the los angeles premiere of angelina jolie's film maleficent in may. Pitt also obtained a restraining order against sediuk to prevent any such incidents occurring to him or his wife jolie in the future. Giving his version of the events which unfolded, pitt told people: \" i was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye i saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. \" i took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so i cracked him twice in the back of the head — not too hard — but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses. \" video: vitalii sediuk gets slapped by will smith",

Once there, he wrapped his arms around an unsuspecting bradley cooper and nestled his face in the silver linings playbook star's crotch. Cooper, 39, initially appeared to laugh off the gag as his american hustle costar michael peña and actor mandy patinkin look on in disbelief. They then helped cooper pry sediuk from the actor's legs. Given his past antics, sediuk's sag awards stunt was relatively tame."

            "Kim kardashian west has become the unfortunate latest victim of vitalii sediuk – the ukrainian former tv presenter famed for assaulting various stars, including brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio, on the red carpet. The reality tv star can be seen in the video below getting out of a vehicle and into a scrum of fans with kanye west and her mother, kris jenner, ahead of the balmain show at paris fashion week on thursday ( 25 september ). Sediuk appears to grab her legs, pulling her to the floor, before a number of security guards are forced to intervene. \" i hope kim is ok and won't be mad at me as i didn't mean any harm, \" vitalii told the mailonline after the incident. \" kanye is one lucky man as kim is a goddess! \" on his decision to target kardashian west specifically, he said it was his protest at the united states for banning him from entering the country. Sediuk was sentenced to three years ' probation, a year of psychological counselling and 20 days of community service after he assaulted brad pitt on the red carpet at the los angeles premiere of angelina jolie's film maleficent in may. Pitt also obtained a restraining order against sediuk to prevent any such incidents occurring to him or his wife jolie in the future. Giving his version of the events which unfolded, pitt told people: \" i was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye i saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. \" i took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so i cracked him twice in the back of the head — not too hard — but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses. \" video: vitalii sediuk gets slapped by will smith",
            "Vitalii sediuk strikes again. The 25-year-old ukrainian journalist somehow made his way onto the red carpet at the 20th annual screen actors guild awards in l.a. On saturday, jan. 18. Once there, he wrapped his arms around an unsuspecting bradley cooper and nestled his face in the silver linings playbook star's crotch. Cooper, 39, initially appeared to laugh off the gag as his american hustle costar michael peña and actor mandy patinkin look on in disbelief. They then helped cooper pry sediuk from the actor's legs. Given his past antics, sediuk's sag awards stunt was relatively tame."

        "summary": "The housing market in flint, michigan, wasn't great before the city's tainted water started poisoning residents. Now, the median home price in flint is an unbelievable $ 14,000, cnn reports. Flint was hit especially hard by the 2008 housing crash, losing about 75 % of its real estate value. Seven years later, before the water crisis started making national headlines, flint's real estate market was still ranked the least healthy in the country, according to the christian science monitor. Then in december, reports of dangerous levels of lead in the water dropped home prices another 8 % — the steepest decline in the country. That's how you end up with a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom home on the market for $ 12,500. The part that really stings is flint's housing market was actually starting to finally recover from 2008 prior to the water crisis, which one real estate agent says was a \" momentum killer. \" now, flint has more than 11,600 vacant homes — about one in 14. That's nearly five times the national average. But that doesn't mean there are a lot of homes to buy, even if interested buyers were plentiful. One real estate agent says many of the homes have become so dilapidated that no one would ever buy them. Still, even with the city under a state of emergency, the real estate market in flint hasn't completely stopped: 116 homes sold in january and february. The cheapest went for a buck. \" it's a good time to buy, \" a real estate agent tells cnn. \" the payment is less than if you were to rent a house. \"",

Researchers tracked sauna use over 20 years for about 2,300 finnish men ( ages 42 to 60 ) and found that, even after accounting for other factors, heart attack deaths and other cardiovascular-related fatalities were almost twice as common in men who used saunas once a week, compared to those who used them at least four times weekly, the ap notes. For death from any cause, risk fell from 49 % for the least-frequent users to 31 % for those who went the most, as per reuters. On average, the saunas hovered at 174 degrees fahrenheit ( slightly lower for those who didn't use them as often ). Time spent in the sauna also affected results: heart-related deaths weren't as prevalent in men who hung out in the sauna for more than 19 minutes compared to shorter sessions of less than 11 minutes. So what's the secret? the study's lead researcher points to the high heat and humidity as possibly causing positive cardiovascular effects, while a cardiologist tells the ap that the relaxation brought on by a sauna visit may help. \" the camaraderie they offer may also benefit health, \" dr. Rita redberg says. \" clearly, time spent in the sauna is time well spent. \" researchers note, however, that the study was based on observational info only, doesn't apply to lower-temperature saunas, and only studied middle-aged men.

        "summary": "A very narrow win for turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has been declared in sunday's referendum — so narrow that some analysts believe the vote to expand his powers and allow him to stay in office until 2029 could end up weakening him. The wall street journal notes that after a long drive to stifle dissent, erdogan's team had been predicting a yes vote of more than 60 %, but the result certified by election authorities late sunday was only just over 51 %. This could end up being a \" pyrrhic victory \" that will harden opposition to erdogan in the months and years to come as he transforms turkey from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential republic, warns henri barkey at the woodrow wilson center. In other coverage: european leaders are calling for erdogan to respect the narrow result, which opposition groups have vowed to challenge, by trying to build consensus, the bbc reports. \" the tight referendum result shows how deeply divided turkish society is and that means a big responsibility for the turkish leadership and for president erdogan personally, \" german chancellor angela merkel said in a statement. Amid widespread allegations of fraud, the main opposition party, the republican people's party, says it will challenge 37 % of the ballot, with the chief kurdish party promising to challenge even more, the guardian reports. In a signal that he is once and for all ending turkey's attempts to join the european union, a victorious erdogan declared sunday that he plans to hold a referendum to reinstate the death penalty, reuters reports. He also plans to chair a cabinet meeting monday, which is something traditionally done by the prime minister, whose post is being abolished. Analysts tell the washington post that there are worrying signs for erdogan in the strength of the opposition vote, with kurds in the east voting the same way as secular turks in the west of the country, and erdogan losing istanbul for the first time since 1994. In an op-ed at the guardian, journalist yavuz baydar predicts the result will bring about the \" end of turkey as we know it. \" \" journalists — such as me, abroad, or at home — will find themselves challenged even more after the referendum, \" he writes. \" coverage of corruption will be a daredevil act, severe measures against critical journalism will continue, and the remaining resistance of media proprietors will vanish. \"",

        "summary": "As the syrian civil war enters its fourth year, millions of children are at risk amid harrowing conditions caused by the collapse of the country's health care system, a report from the save the children charity warns. More than 10,000 children have died in the violence, but \" it is not just the bullets and the shells that are killing and maiming children, \" the report warns. Save the children's research revealed almost medieval health conditions in cities such as aleppo, where there were 2,500 doctors before the war but fewer than 40 now, reports the new york times. The group found that thousands of children are dying from diseases that could either have been treated or easily prevented under normal conditions. Some 200,000 syrians are believed to have died from chronic illnesses since the start of the conflict because of a lack of treatment, compared to an estimated 140,000 killed by violence, reuters finds. Vaccination coverage has fallen sharply and diseases such as measles and meningitis are spreading along with polio, which has now infected an estimated 80,000 syrian children. The nightmarish consequences of the health system's collapse include newborns dying in incubators amid power cuts, children having limbs amputated due to a lack of equipment for proper treatment, and patients being knocked out with metal bars because of a shortage of anesthetic, the report found. Amnesty international, meanwhile, accuses the syrian regime of using \" starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, \" the bbc reports. Around 20,000 refugees are trapped in a besieged camp in damascus and at least 60 % are suffering from malnutrition, the group warns. In some rare good news to emerge from syria, a group of greek orthodox nuns kidnapped by rebels in december have been released, according to another bbc report. The 13 nuns, who worked in a convent orphanage, say they were mostly well treated by their captors.",

One of the most-hyped products of 2013 fell flat, becoming a footnote in the history of wearable tech, reports wired. But don't count it out yet. After two years of testing, google has released a new version, the glass enterprise edition, with a faster processor, faster wifi, longer battery life, an improved camera, and — to soothe critics — a light that tells onlookers when video is being recorded. All this to help boost productivity in factories and warehouses. Details: major companies such as ge, boeing, dhl, and volkswagen have tried out the glass ee and seen \" huge gains in productivity and noticeable improvements in quality, \" per wired, which looks at how the device is used in a factory that produces farm equipment. In a blog post, jay kothari of x explains how ee delivers real-time instructions, keeping workers focused, and their hands busy, on a given task. This video shows how it can affect productivity. Techcrunch explains a key improvement is that the module can be attached to any kind of eyewear, including prescription glasses and safety goggles. Motherboard talks to early adopters who have varying opinions on the device. Some, at least, are intrigued. At cnet, scott stein notes google glass as a business-specific device is \" a lot less off-putting \" than the previous version and suddenly \" seems incredibly, boringly normal. \" it's likely to become even more so. A forrester research report out last year predicted there will be more than 14 million us workers wearing smart glasses by 2025. That doesn't mean google glass won't have other uses. Teller says google is \" open-minded about where it's going to go, \" adding that \" none of us have given up on the idea that over time glass will become less and less intrusive, and that more and more people will use it. \" want to try it for yourself? glass ee is only available through x's 12 partner companies.",

The deal reflects a 39 % premium over the pet supply retailer's closing price on july 2, the day before activist investor jana partners began urging petsmart to seek a sale. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2015. Citigroup ( c ), nomura ( nmr ), jefferies ( hef ), barclays ( bcs ) and deutsche bank ( db ) are financing the acquisition with debt. Excluding petsmart's debt, the buyout has an equity value of approximately $ 8.25 billion. Petsmart shares rose 4.7 % to $ 81.32 in recent trading. The stock is up 11.8 % since the start of 2014. On july 3, jana partners disclosed a 9.9 % stake in phoenix-based petsmart. Longview then sent a letter to petsmart's board urging the company to consider strategic options such as a sale. Petsmart agreed in august to explore a potential sale. Bc partners beat rival private equity firms in the race to acquire petsmart. For one, apollo global management ( apo ) was rumored to be involved in discussions. The $ 8.7 billion takeover of petsmart tops blackstone group's ( bx ) buyout of auto parts maker gates global, a $ 5.4 billion deal that closed in july. The calls for petsmart to seek out a buyer came amid growing competition from larger retailers like wal-mart stores ( wmt ) and target ( tgt ). E-commerce leader amazon.com ( amzn ) has also increased its share of the pet supply market. Petsmart has about 1,387 stores and 54,000 employees.

            "New york ( ap ) — petsmart is being sold to a group of investors led by buyout firm bc partners for $ 8.7 billion. The phoenix-based pet store retailer says the investors have agreed to pay $ 83 per share in cash to the company. That's a 39 percent increase from its closing price july 2 before the company announced it was looking to sell. The price is also a 7 percent increase from petsmart's closing price friday. In addition to bc partners, the buyers include stepstone and canadian pension manager la caisse. The sale requires approval from petsmart shareholders. Longview asset management says it will vote in favor of the deal. That fund owns 9 percent of petsmart and had been pressuring the company to sell since the summer."

According to a study published wednesday in nature, scientists successfully edited genes in dozens of human embryos to remove a mutation that causes a potentially fatal heart condition. If those embryos were allowed to grow into babies, the individuals would not have the condition — which affects an estimated one in 500 people — and would not pass it along to their children. A professor of genetics says this process \" could certainly help families who have been blighted by a horrible genetic disease. \" study co-author juan carlos izpisua belmonte tells cnn this is the first study in the world to show gene editing can be both safe and accurate in fixing disease-causing mutations. An important breakthrough: scientists were able to edit the mutation that causes the heart condition without causing mutations in other cells. And while a lot more testing will be required before the process is ready for clinical use, it will certainly bring up a host of ethical questions regarding the potential for designer babies before then. For example, national geographic quotes the director of the center for health law, ethics &amp; human rights at boston university as saying: \"the scientists are out of control.
