The up in the air author profiles the iron man 2 superstar in rolling stone's new issue, on sale at newsstands today — and available for all access readers right now. During an introspective day on the beach where kirn and downey play word association ( and coin the term \" vaginal parfait \" ), the actor opens up about his opposition to drug legalization, his interest in science and conspiracy and his current state of mind, which he describes as \" the continual process of transcending fear-based rituals. \" during the pair's second afternoon together, downey gets gritty, speaking out about the downward spiral that led to his ultimate fall: his incarceration from 1999-2000. Downey recounts how he'd partied with \" the son of a local phenom, \" smoking black-tar heroin on a two-day bender, just before getting busted for driving with drugs and guns in his possession. He returned home from jail and started searching for \" that great coke \" he knew he'd stashed somewhere in the house. \" and here i was needing to anesthetize like never before.

Real archaeologists have been a bit more skeptical. But angela micol says new discoveries help prove her findings, reports discovery news. Another amateur archaeologist recently did a ground study at one of the two sites she spotted, and claims what he saw there — pottery, shells, and signs of cavities and tunnels below the the surface — support micol's claims. \" those mounds are definitely hiding an ancient site below them, \" he says. Additionally, an egyptian couple who are leading collectors of old maps and rare documents say they have 34 maps and 12 documents in their collection that indicate the areas of micol's findings are pyramid sites. The couple says their documents suggest two unknown pyramids at one of the sites, fayum, were intentionally buried. \" they would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind, \" says the couple. \" we would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the pyramids of giza. \" but real archaeologists remain uninterested in micol's research, so she has set up a crowd-funding campaign to raise $ 50,000 to explore the site further with a ground penetrating radar and infrared satellite imagery. \" it's very obvious what the sites may contain, \" says micol, \" but field research is needed to verify they are, in fact, pyramids. \" ( click for another fascinating archaeological discovery, this one in scotland. )",

The seventh-grader's attorney, joseph gutheinz, tells the houston chronicle his client is being charged with aggravated sexual assault after having sex with his 12-year-old girlfriend, who was in sixth grade at the time. Texas, where the age of consent is 17, has a \" romeo and juliet \" law, in which a legal defense is available for minors younger than 17 who have consensual sex — as long as the two parties are within three years of age of each other. However, the law doesn't hold if one of the kids is younger than 14, even if the sex was consensual and even if, as the teen's mom says, \" he loved her. \" \" they want to … put him on the [ sex offender ] registry with pedophiles and child molesters — really sick and dangerous people, \" she says. And that's the last thing we should be doing to kids caught in similar situations, wisconsin rep. Joel kleefisch says, per wsau. His state is trying to pass a bill that would deem consensual sex between kids ages 15 to 18 a misdemeanor and not require them to register as sex offenders. But even that law wouldn't help the texas teen, and gutheinz says \" it just blows my mind \" that his client could have sex with a 13-year-old just a few days younger and be in deep trouble, or be considered the victim if he had sex with an 18-year-old. \" you would think the law would be more sympathetic as you go younger, because both parties are immature, \" he notes. Still, a harris county public defender's office lawyer says most judges look carefully at the facts of such cases and \" very rarely \" make teens register as sex offenders.

The penguins were being kept in a holding area this week while their habitat at the canadian zoo was under renovation, the guardian reports. According to the new york daily news, it's unclear what happened to the penguins, who were between 7 and 8 months old and free of infections. \"it's a very odd situation, very odd circumstances, and nothing we've ever encountered before, \" dorgan tells the guardian. A biology professor says penguins drowning is \" a pretty rare event, \" but the zoo believes the animals — 22 in all — may have been spooked by something during the night, panicked, and tried to jump into the pool at once, causing seven to drown. The remaining 15 appear to be fine, though they are being kept away from the pools at night as a precaution. The calgary zoo has had its share of animal mishaps. In february, an otter drowned after getting tangled in a pair of pants given to it as a present by a zookeeper. Over the past eight years, a capybara was crushed by a hydraulic door, a gorilla got a hold of a knife, 41 stingrays died, and a group of gorillas raided a kitchen. \"we have humans looking after animals and just like humans doing anything, mistakes are going to happen, \" dorgan says.",

            "The feet of children going through a canadian zoo's penguin plunge are less happy today. Seven humboldt penguins at the calgary zoo were found mysteriously dead in their back holding area thursday morning, zoo officials said. Animal care director jamie dorgan told the daily news that the petite birds were found in a pool three feet deep, and that preliminary results show they drowned. He said that the penguins, 8-months to 7-years-old and currently being held in a holding room during construction, did not have any known infections and that foul play is not expected at this point. A luxury cruise to the galápagos islands pairs adventure, comfort one current hypothesis is that something may have riled the humboldts up overnight, and that some of them drowned when many of them jumped into the pool. However, dorgan said that his zoo has experience with penguins and that he has never seen anything",

Or, as the independent puts it: b.o.b is raising money \" to send satellites where satellites have definitely been before, to see nothing new and witness what everyone already knows. \" b.o.b first shared his flat-earth beliefs on twitter last year. In one tweet, for example, he wondered why two cities 16 miles apart appear to be on a straight line and not a curve on the horizon. He claims the world has been \" tremendously deceived \" and people need to \" grow up \" and realize the world is just a flat disc. This led to a brief rap-based feud with neil degrasse tyson. In a diss track aimed at the astrophysicist, b.o.b rapped: \" globalists see me as a threat, free thinking got the world at my neck. \" he also claimed degrasse tyson was being paid to promote round-earth ideas.

The country's state media officially announced today that kim yo jong has been named a departmental vice director within the workers ' party's central committee, which some say could be a show of her increasing influence on her brother's administration, the ap reports. Rumored to be about 27, kim yo jong had been referenced before as being involved with the party, but this announcement elevates her to a more senior level and positions her as the only relative of kim jong un to hold an official governmental title, reuters notes. The news agency adds that her appointment makes this the third generation that's involved somehow in the running of north korea: the ap notes that her late father, kim jong il, often confided in his own sister, kim kyong hui, who used to be a vital part of the current regime, along with her husband ( we all know how that turned out ). Kim yo jong is said to have attended a swiss boarding school with kim jong un and another older brother, who doesn't have any role in government that's been officially acknowledged, reuters notes. Her addition to the employment roster indicates kim jong un trusts her just enough to help him keep the north korean people in awe of their family's dynasty — a mission he's also apparently trying to accomplish by making secondary-school students study his life and times for three years in order to graduate, the bbc reports.",

            "Image copyright afp students in north korea will have to complete a three-year course on the country's leader, kim jong-un, as part of their secondary school studies, it's been reported. The new course was introduced to the curriculum this year, according to south korea's state-owned kbs world radio website. The radio station says it has obtained a copy of the north korean education committee's \" compulsory education outline \", which establishes \" the history of kim jong-un as an official school subject \". Schoolchildren will have to complete 81 hours of study over three years, the report says. There aren't yet any textbooks that could help them understand the leader's life, so classes are instead taught using materials from the ruling workers ' party of korea. \" the classes are also said to be teaching kim's quotes, theses and orders he gave to the ruling party and military, \" the website says. While there has been relatively little trace of a personality cult surrounding kim jong-un since he took power in december 2011, some observers say the new classes could signal the start of one. Children in the north's schools are already required to take courses on several key political personalities, including 160 hours of study on the country's founder, kim il-sung."

Major outlets are reporting that the agency was taken to task by the chief judge on the foreign intelligence surveillance court in 2011 for time and again misleading the court — and violating the constitution, reports the wall street journal. In the secret ruling made public yesterday thanks to a foia lawsuit brought a year ago, judge john d. Bates described the court as \" troubled that the... Nsa's acquisition of internet transactions mark the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program, \" per the new york times. Nsa officials had apparently realized that in their scanning of foreign-related emails they had also swooped up \" wholly domestic \" messages — over the course of some three years. ( the washington post puts the number at roughly 56,000 emails each year. ) officials speaking with the post emphasized that the nsa made the court aware of the issue by way of its regular reports in may 2011; bates noted, however, this revelation came years after the nsa was in 2008 given the authority to process international internet data running through fiber-optic cables in the us ( this represents about 9 % of what it collects each year ). The ruling says the nsa's so-called \" upstream collection \" was \" in some respects, deficient on statutory and constitutional grounds. \" the nsa worked with the court to fix the problem.",

Wayne simmons, 62, was arrested yesterday and accused of lying about serving as an \" outside paramilitary special operations officer \" from 1973 to 2000, reuters reports. He faces charges including major fraud against the us because he not only fooled fox, he used his lies about cia service to obtain security clearances and an assignment as an adviser to senior military personnel overseas, reports cnnmoney. On his website, simmons claims to have \" spearheaded deep cover intel ops \" against drug cartels and to have been a fox terrorism analyst since 2002. Simmons appeared on fox dozens of times, though a spokeswoman tells cnn that simmons was \" never a contributor for fox news, \" just an unpaid guest. Simmons ' claims of cia service have raised eyebrows in the past, officials tell cnn, but he was able to fake a top-secret background because intelligence agencies don't tend to comment on former operatives. The cia says it's working closely with the justice department on the case. Simmons is also accused of swindling somebody out of $ 125,000 in a real estate scam and faces up to 35 years in prison if found guilty on all charges, according to the indictment.",

The figures have been cruising downward for four quarters, the firm says. Research rival gartner saw a slightly smaller drop of 11.2 % — still the biggest it has seen since 2001, the wall street journal reports. \" the interesting question is how much of this is a structural shift toward slower replacement cycles and more tablets versus how much is people disliking windows 8, \" writes matthew yglesias at slate. \" the reaction to windows 8 is real, \" says an analyst with idc, which actually assigns some of the slowdown blame to the os, whose features it describes as confusing to consumers familiar with the traditional pc experience. Further, businesses aren't scrambling to upgrade, he notes. A gartner analyst, however, believes windows 8 is \" the right direction, \" and just needs time. Outside the windows world, analysts had contradictory numbers: apple's domestic shipments sank 7.5 %, according to idc; gartner says they climbed 7.4 %.

            "If your cultural memory goes back to the 1970s, here's what you already know, or think you know, about the subject of james marsh's film \" project nim \": an infant chimpanzee called nim -- or nim chimpsky, in joking homage to linguist noam chomsky -- was raised entirely by humans and taught elements of american sign language, as part of an experiment that aimed to determine whether an ape could acquire language the same way we do. ( if one could, that might disprove chomsky's contention that humans are uniquely hard-wired for language. ) the results of the experiment were controversial at the time and remain so today. Herbert terrace, the columbia university psychologist who designed the project, ultimately decided that nim hadn't gotten anywhere near a syntactical understanding of human language and used his vocabulary of 125 or so signs merely as a primitive code to achieve short-term goals, such as a piece of fruit or a play session. As he did in his oscar-winning \" man on wire, \" marsh takes a much-mythologized, media-friendly event of yesteryear and gradually fills in the background and context via a meticulous blend of archival footage, talking-head interviews and artful reconstructions. ( this film is based on elizabeth hess ' 2008 book \" nim chimpsky: the chimp who would be human. \" ) as with philippe petit's 1974 wire-walk between the twin towers, the nim experiment looks a whole lot different in retrospect. \" project nim \" is a darkly hilarious social portrait of the bizarre alternate universe of 1970s academia and an extraordinary biography of a non-human individual, on whom all sorts of human desires and ideologies were projected. Marsh is far too scrupulous, or too canny, to take sides in the dispute between terrace and his many detractors, but he doesn't have to. Basically, the more the guy opens his mouth, the more he looks like a massive sleazebag, and the more you learn about his so-called experiment, the more it looks like a misbegotten and sloppily executed disaster that says more about human arrogance than it does about chimps and language. \" project nim \" also belongs on the ever-lengthening list of movies",

She thought that was a beautiful word to hear about her boy, \" lovely. \" like presidents before him, trump has made personal",
            "For the past seven years, gen. John f. Kelly has gone out of his way to keep the death of his son free from politics. He did not talk about him when — just four days after his death in southern afghanistan — kelly found himself commemorating two other marines killed in combat, in a moving speech in st. Louis. In fact, according to a washington post report, he specifically asked the officer introducing him not to mention his boy, 1st lt. Robert m. Kelly, who was killed instantly when he stepped on a land mine while on patrol in 2010. Just last month, kelly slipped away from the white house to attend a marine corps scholarship golf tournament in his son's memory, with little fanfare or attention. But on tuesday, kelly's boss, president trump, thrust his son into the public and political glare, invoking the younger kelly as part of a continuing attack on former president barack obama. In an interview with fox news radio, trump singled out kelly, his chief of staff, as he attempted to bolster his false claim a day earlier that obama never called families of fallen u.s. Service members. President trump's response to the deaths of four soldiers in niger is causing an uproar after rep. Frederica s. Wilson ( d-fla ) said he told sgt. La"

        "summary": "It's phoenix-from-the-ashes time for president obama: the senate will today hold a key procedural vote that would grant the president \" fast track \" authority to negotiate a trade deal with 11 pacific rim nations. For the measure to clear a procedural hurdle, at least 60 senators need to support it — a move that, as the ap puts it — would \" complete a near-miraculous resurrection of the white house priority. \" in a late may vote, 62 senators backed fast track. They didn't expect it to return to their chamber, though, but the house revived the fast-track legislation last week. By the ap's count, obama's backers now are counting on the 14 senate democrats and 48 republicans who supported fast track in may to do so again. The hill's numbers: it reports that obama \" can afford no more than three democratic defections, \" putting the number of democratic votes he needs at 11. It reports that he hadn't secured those votes publicly as of last night, and names five democratic senators who have announced they're in. The wall street journal flags two \" wrinkles \": first, this time around the vote precedes votes on three other trade-related measures, meaning democrats in favor of the legislation need to trust that mitch mcconnell and john boehner can push that trio through later. Second, two democratic senators have expressed an unwillingness to back the fast-track bill without an assurance that the export-import bank's charter, which expires in a week, will be renewed. If the vote passes, obama will be able to submit his trade pact to congress for a simple yes-or-no vote free of amendments.",

Many officials who have been involved with the pilkingtons along the way are distraught.

No other details were provided about that nugget. Other developments: fireworks: the wall street journal reports that tamerlan bought two heavy-duty pyrotechnic devices from a new hampshire fireworks store in february. An exec with phantom fireworks says he doubts they would have provided enough powder for the boston blasts, though the purchase suggests planning for the marathon attack began months in advance. Tamerlan bought something called a \" lock and load, \" which has a launch tube and shells, reports the new york times. The company also sold fireworks to the failed times square bomber in 2010, notes the times. Terrorist ties: were the brothers in contact with al-qaeda or other overseas terrorist groups? the current line of thinking suggests otherwise, reports ap. The theory is that the brothers — tamerlan especially — became \" self-radicalized \" through the internet.

Maximum sustained winds reached 75 mph, classifying humberto as a category 1 hurricane during the early morning hours wednesday. During the following 24 hours, humberto strengthened with maximum sustained winds reaching 85 mph thursday. During friday, humberto weakened to a tropical storm. There was a chance this hurricane season might set a new record for having the latest first atlantic hurricane since the satellite era began in the early 1960s. The challenge went down to the wire with a difference of approximately three hours. The latest the first hurricane of the season formed was 2002's gustav on sept. 11. Gustav was upgraded from a tropical storm to a minimal hurricane that wednesday midday, shortly after 8: 00 a.m. Edt. As of tuesday evening, sept. 10, there had been no hurricanes thus far during the 2013 season in the atlantic.

Three hours ahead of that mark, the national hurricane center in miami dubbed it a legitimate storm with sustained winds of a 75 mph, the threshold for a hurricane. But it's not likely to cause much of a fuss. Early wednesday, it was about 310 miles west-northwest of the cape verde islands, off africa's coast.

            "Humberto weakens after becoming atlantic's first hurricane by by alex sosnowski, expert senior meteorologist. September 13, 2013, 8: 03: 02 am edt very early wednesday morning, humberto strengthened to become the first hurricane of the 2013 atlantic hurricane season. Maximum sustained winds reached 75 mph, classifying humberto as a category 1 hurricane during the early morning hours wednesday. During the following 24 hours, humberto strengthened with maximum sustained winds reaching 85 mph thursday. During friday, humberto weakened to a tropical storm. There was a chance this hurricane season might set a new record for having the latest first atlantic hurricane since the satellite era began in the early 1960s. The challenge went down to the wire with a difference of approximately three hours. The latest the first hurricane of the season formed was 2002's gustav on sept. 11. Gustav was upgraded from a tropical storm to a minimal hurricane that wednesday midday, shortly after 8: 00 a.m. Edt. As of tuesday evening, sept. 10, there had been no hurricanes thus far during the 2013 season in the atlantic. However, humberto brought an end to this by strengthening into a category 1 hurricane near the cape verde islands early wednesday morning. Since humberto was upgraded to a hurricane prior to the time gustav became a hurricane on the 11th, the late-forming hurricane",

Normally, three hurricanes would have formed in the area by this time in hurricane season. All that it had to do was wait until after 8 a.m. Et, but alas, no. Three hours ahead of that mark, the national hurricane center in miami dubbed it a legitimate storm with sustained winds of a 75 mph, the threshold for a hurricane. But it's not likely to cause much of a fuss. Early wednesday, it was about 310 miles west-northwest of the cape verde islands, off africa's coast. It's expected to fizzle into a tropical storm over the weekend. Back in may, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center said higher-than-average water temperatures were expected to help yield a few more atlantic hurricanes than usual. Noaa predicts above-normal atlantic hurricane season between 13 and 20 named storms and seven to 11 hurricanes were predicted. Humberto is"

The couple had been married the previous night, and guests reported that an argument between them at the reception continued at a get-together at their house afterward.

The impact of light pollution has long been obvious, but scientists are now exploring the role of constant exposure to light on health, and a study in the journal current biology adds both good and bad news. Researchers in holland say the absence of natural light-and-dark rhythms can lead \" to severe disruption of a wide variety of health parameters \" — including a loss of bone density. The conditions were extreme: they were studying mice subjected to constant artificial light for six months, which is a torture technique, notes the independent. The good news, as delivered by researcher johanna meijer at eureka alert: \" these negative effects on health are reversible when the... Light-dark cycle is restored. \" to study the impact of so much light, the team implanted electrodes in the parts of the brain that control circadian rhythms and observed neuron activity in the mice. Though they could make nests and move freely, they were unable to totally avoid the light while they slept, reports nature. Certain cells began to pulse irregularly, they adopted a 25.5-hour day, and they lost both bone density and muscle strength, becoming more frail. After researchers gave them dark periods again, though, all systems normalized. How much of this can be applied to humans remains unclear, but meijer says it should serve as a warning to people such as shift workers who have irregular hours.

When the mice were examined, they were found to be suffering from muscle loss and the early signs of osteoporosis, while their immune system appeared as if it was reacting to an infection. The bottom line, the academics said, was that the natural cycle of day followed by night matters to animals. Professor johanna meijer, of leiden university medical centre in the netherlands, who led the research, said: \"we used to think of light and darkness as harmless or neutral stimuli with respect to health. \"we now realize this is not the case based on accumulating studies from laboratories all over the world, all pointing in the same direction",

        "summary": "Thirty-two states have religious exemptions to some crimes against children; six of those allow a religious exemption in cases including manslaughter, negligent homicide, or capital murder. But idaho has earned a disturbing distinction: in the past two decades, it's the only one of those six states where kids have died due to parents ' adherence to healing by faith alone. The past three years have seen at least 12 children's deaths in faith-healing cases, vocativ reports. All the deaths were of members of a religious group called followers of christ. In a followers cemetery near boise, almost 35 % of the graves belong to children, says a former member of the group who's now fighting for change. Among the deaths since 2011 are infants who died of sepsis and teens who died of pneumonia; one 15-year-old died after an \" easily treatable case of food poisoning. \" according to idaho's 1972 religious-exemption laws, prayer is a form of treatment. No criminal charges have been filed in such cases since the laws came into existence. Activists say such laws contradict a 1944 supreme court decision that notes that while \" parents may be free to become martyrs themselves … it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children. \" the vocativ report comes after parents in oregon were convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter in their daughter's death last year. A followers of christ member who lost a son defends the group's practices: \" i would like to remind you this country was founded on religious freedom, \" he told katu last year, as raw story notes. \" it's not like you take ' a ' freedom away. It's that you chip at the entire thing. \"",

Under the agreement — which both the syrian government and opposition groups have tentatively agreed to — calls for an end to hostilities starting at sundown on monday.

The indiscriminate bombing of civilian neighborhoods, \" kerry says. According to the ap, kerry calls the ceasefire a possible \" turning point \" in the war that has killed more than 500,000 people. The announcement came after \" intensive \" talks in geneva, the bbc reports. Russian foreign minister sergey lavrov gave journalists waiting for the end of 13 hours of negotiations pizza \" from the us delegation \" and vodka \" from the russian delegation. \" the ceasefire will allow the un to deliver humanitarian aid to hard-hit areas, including aleppo, where nearly 700 civilians — 160 of them children — have been killed in the past 40 days. If the ceasefire lasts a week, the us and russia will start planning joint military operations against al qaeda and isis fighters in syria. But such ceasefire agreements have failed in the past. \" we think [ the arrangement ] has the capability of sticking, but it's dependent on people's choices, \" kerry says. \" it is an opportunity and not more than that. \"",

            "Stockholm ( ap ) — the european union on friday formally submitted its planned contribution to a united nations climate pact, pledging to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030. The cuts are relative to 1990 levels. The eu's emissions since then are already down by almost 20 percent. The eu is the second party to submit a climate target to the u.n., after switzerland. Only a handful of other countries are expected to meet an end-of-march deadline to submit targets. Others, including india and china are likely going to need more time. All countries are supposed to present targets for a new global climate agreement that governments plan to adopt in paris in december. The deal would be the first time that all countries take joint action to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists say are a key driver of global warming. Some climate activists said the eu's emissions target wasn't ambitious enough and criticized the bloc for not including any financial commitments to help developing countries cope with climate change. Financing is a crucial issue in the u.n. Climate talks. Developed countries have pledged to collectively come up with $ 100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020, but they are reluctant to specify",

        "summary": "Germany votes on sunday, with the latest polls suggesting that angela merkel will earn a fourth term as chancellor. A year ago, that outcome seemed in doubt, notes an analysis at vox, thanks to merkel's welcoming policy on refugees from syria and elsewhere. So why is merkel and her christian democratic union party seemingly poised for another win? the short version is that \" the world is a scary place, \" writes sarah wildman. And merkel, who is sometimes called \" mutti, \" or mommy, \" is a comforting hand on the tiller. \" far-right milestone: maybe the most notable facet of the election is the surge in popularity of the far-right alternative for germany party. Known for its anti-immigrant, anti-islam, and anti-eu positions, the afd is poised to become the first far-right party in germany's parliament since the end of world war ii. ( it's polling at about 11 %, good for a third-place finish, reports cnbc. ) as politico explains, it has virtually no chance of joining any governing coalition, but it has a very good chance of turning into a \" fixture of german politics. \" real winner? amplifying the above, the washington post thinks the \" real winner \" of sunday's vote won't be merkel but the afd, destined to pick up a decent number of seats. \" the party panders to a grab-bag of conservative impulses, giving a political home to climate-deniers, euroskeptics, xenophobes, and chauvinists tired of germany having to atone for the holocaust, \" writes ishaan tharoor. But merkel's open-door policy for refugees is most responsible for its newfound popularity. Think ikea: merkel already has outlasted three us presidents, four british, four french, and six italian leaders, reports the guardian. Its analysis suggests that the key to her political longevity might be her sort of \" ikea principle \" when it comes to governing. As a former adviser to merkel puts it, there's \" something for everybody. She is a store no one would be ashamed to be seen shopping in. \" where's russia? the new york times notes that there is virtually no sign of interference from russian hackers and bogus news stories. The story explores why that might be, including the possibility that the kremlin is rethinking its cyber-strategy. 2 votes: every german voter actually casts two ballots, one for a local representative in the bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the other for a party, explains npr.

The complex battle involves the ambassador bridge, which links detroit to windsor and is the only private road bridge between the us and canada. Billionaire manuel moroun, who owns the bridge, has fought canadian officials for years to keep them from constructing a competing bridge. He has also snapped up houses in the sandwich neighborhood of windsor, where he plans to build his own second bridge alongside the ambassador. But he's let the houses fall into such disrepair that the once-thriving neighborhood is now boarded-up, burnt-out, and crumbling. \" i can't figure them out and why they decided to be a bad corporate citizen, \" says windsor's mayor, drew dilkens. The president of a maroun-owned company says most of the buildings were already falling apart and slated for destruction, the windsor star reports, but either way, the company wants to demolish 114 run-down houses to build its second span — a plan the city opposes. Now the fight has gone to the supreme court of canada, which is expected to decide whether international law grants maroun the right to ignore windsor's wishes and bring down the houses. For their part, canadian officials plan to build another bridge in an industrial area about three miles away.

Usa today lays out tipton's \" untold story \" in full, starting in 2005, when a co-worker at the multi-state lottery association, where tipton was a software programmer and head of it security, uttered the sentence that changed everything. \" hey, did you put your secret numbers in there?, \" accountant gene schaller asked, tipping tipton off that since he wrote the code for the lottery's numbers-generating software, there was nothing stopping him from placing code in there to get the numbers to go the way he wanted. And that's exactly what tipton did, finagling the system so that he and his brother, tommy, could win big time. The tiptons were arrested in 2015 for fraud, per time, and pleaded guilty to felony charges; tommy got 75 days behind bars, while eddie, now 54, is still serving up to 25 years in prison, with a chance for parole in three years or so, per his lawyers. But it's the story of what happened in between that first conversation with schaller and his sentencing that's most intriguing, including how he was hired by the lottery system with a criminal background ( he'd been involved with a warehouse theft and also in stealing software from sears as a teen ), how he'd actually tried to clue his employers in to the vulnerability of their software, and how the tiptons ' first big win was helped along by … a search for bigfoot. As for schaller, the guy who first planted the seed in tipton's head? he still works for the msla. More in usa today, which also details the mistake that was tipton's undoing.",

On that list: 10 of the 11 samples of ben &amp; jerry's ice cream that were tested, the new york times reports. The paper notes that the levels were \" far below \" the epa's limits, but ronnie cummins, the oca's international director, notes: \" would you want to be eating this stuff at all? \" business insider reports social media backlash soon followed, with some consumers calling for a brand boycott. In a press release, the oca calls for ben &amp; jerry's to go completely organic, labeling its current claims of being \" all-natural \" and \" sustainable \" as \" fraudulent \" marketing. It calls for consumers to sign a petition or stage a protest for a boycott until the brand goes 100 % organic. Cummins and rob michalak, a company global director, tell the times the glyphosate in its ice cream likely comes from \" add-ins \" like peanut butter or cookie dough; ingredients such as wheat, oats, and peanuts are often dried out by being sprayed with herbicide. Michalak notes while ben &amp; jerry's plant-based ingredients are non-gmo, the company is still working to use only dairy from farms with non-gmo feed, as well as ridding gmos from its supply chain. ( fox business explains vermont's gmo labeling law allows dairy and egg suppliers to use gmo grains in their feed. ) \" we need to better understand where the glyphosate they're finding is coming from, \" michalak says.

        "summary": "If embarrassing your teenage son was an olympic sport, utah dad dale price would win the gold medal. After learning that his 16-year-old son rain's school bus route would pass the family home, price decided to come out and wave at the bus every day — wearing a different costume each time. The 170 home-made costumes price donned over the school year, documented at wave at the bus, included star wars characters, a chicken, michael jackson, and even a wedding dress complete with bouquet. Price says he got the idea for the costumes after his son asked him and his mother not to wave at the school bus. \" i hope this lives with him for the rest of his life, \" he tells the deseret news. \" he can use it against his kids and tell them, ' if you think you are embarrassed by me, you should have seen your grandfather. ' \" rain, meanwhile, is probably relieved that his dad isn't planning to wave at the bus next year, although according to his father, the teen has already threatened to do the same thing to his own children.",

As always, some were captured to be sold to aquariums, others slaughtered for their meat, and the rest released; a member of the local fishermen's union says fewer than 100 fell into those first two categories. But sea shepherd, which has tweeted and streamed video through the whole hunt, claims that \" many will die at sea from the last 4 days. \" it claims that 52 were sold into captivity, 41 were killed, and the remaining 130 to 140 were released.

Fishermen waiting in the shallow waters by the shore, some in wet suits with snorkeling masks on their faces, wrestled the dolphins into submission and tied their tails with ropes to stop them from escaping. Before the killing began, fishermen pulled a tarpaulin in front of the cove"

Mccann, 28, acknowledged what prosecutors called a \" sustained and systematic \" attack in the wee hours of jan. 13 in a guilty plea thursday. Police suspect he initially stalked another woman but lost sight of her and homed in on another target, per the bbc. A prosecutor described how he played \" mind games \" with his 24-year-old victim, asking her what she thought he would do next, as he beat and raped her. He then snapped photos of her, told her she was lucky he didn't record the rape, stole her phone, and took off, prosecutors said. Hours later he married his pregnant partner. \" this was a terrifying, violent, and prolonged attack... Committed by a man intent on inflicting fear and psychological suffering, \" a prosecutor said. Yet a judge had predicted it. In 2006, mccann was sentenced to life ( with a recommended minimum of 9 years ) for the rape of another woman in a park. The judge described the attack as a \" clinical enactment of a catalogue of sexual desires \" that amounted to \" torture \" and said there was a \" very substantial risk \" mccann would re-offend, report the sun and telegraph. Mccann was eventually released from prison in 2015 and some are now calling for a public inquiry into his case. He is due to be sentenced in the latest case on april 28.

But in nepal, not one was poached in the yearlong span that ended in february — nor were any tigers or elephants, the world wildlife fund reports. The country celebrated its second poach-free year march 3 — world wildlife day, national geographic reports. The year 2011 also saw no incidents, while 2012 had just one. The world wildlife fund applauds the efforts of rangers, police, and the army, as well as \" community-based anti-poaching units. \" tigers and rhinos are clearly reaping the benefits. As of last year, there were 198 tigers in national parks, up from 121 in 2009. The rhino population was 534 in 2011, compared to 425 three years earlier. Poachers haven't fared nearly as well as the animals. Some 700 were arrested last year; many were considered \" kingpins, \" national geographic notes. \" there is very much a zero-tolerance attitude to wildlife crime, whereby justice is often swift and harsh, \" says a consultant.",

The 21-year-old is accused of being the getaway driver for the broken arrow break-in on monday, which resulted in the deaths of 19-year-old maxwell cook, 17-year-old jacob redfearn ( spelled redfern in some reports ), and 16-year-old jaykob woodruff.

He has not been charged, and authorities say his actions may fall under the state's \" stand your ground \" law. Heavy.com has audio of the 911 call peters made after he turned his gun on the suspects. \" i shot two of them and now i ' m barricaded in my bedroom, \" he says. \" you need to get here now. \" rodriguez, who fled the scene but later turned herself in, says that she was the one who picked which house to burglarize and that she gets why peters had to use his weapon. \" i don't blame him....

Many had hoped the syrian national council could serve as an opposition government, but hillary clinton deemed the group a failure last month. It certainly hasn't kept hold of syria's rebels, who have been swiftly losing public support thanks to their increasingly violent tactics, the times reports.

If the plan works, supporters say, it will help push back against the chaos in which jihadi organizations thrive and persuade foreign governments — particularly a second obama administration — to get invested more directly in the opposition's success. \"we have to find a way out of the cul-de-sac that we are in, \" said ayman abdel nour, a former confidant of president bashar al-assad's turned opposition activist. \"we need to find a"

        "summary": "\" it happened again \" is what erin piche-pitts told authorities when her second infant died of apparent suffocation, even though she'd been repeatedly warned about the dangers of co-sleeping, the new york times reports. The son of the woman from winter haven, fla., died in october, this time resulting in a felony aggravated manslaughter charge against her. Per the orlando sentinel, the story begins dec. 4, 2009, not even two weeks after baby angelina was born. Piche-pitts brought the infant into bed to breastfeed and dozed off, waking to find the baby \" cold and stiff to the touch, \" per an affidavit; angelina's death was ruled accidental. On oct. 6 of this year, her 18-day-old son, javier, became unresponsive after she fell asleep in bed with him during a bottle feeding, the affidavit notes. His death was also ruled accidental, though his autopsy hasn't been finalized. What leads these two incidents into negligence territory is that piche-pitts had been warned both during her pregnancies and after the births about co-sleeping dangers — via training and counseling, and from hospital staff and family — and especially so after angelina died, per the polk county sheriff's office ( which also gave wtsp a rap sheet on piche-pitts that includes burglary, domestic violence, and possession of meth ). The times notes the case highlights the ongoing controversy on co-sleeping, with some ( especially in non-western parts of the world ) insisting it can be a safe way to get infants back to sleep if practiced correctly, while others continue to note its dangers. \" these are very, very difficult cases, \" a polk county prosecutor says. \" we are not charging parents with crimes because accidents happen.

According to the washington post, 32-year-old priscilla villarreal — who goes by lagordiloca, or the fat crazy lady — is a popular figure in laredo, where she livestreams from crime scenes on her facebook page, which has 84,000 followers. But she says local police are fed up with her. And on dec. 13 villarreal was arrested and charged with two counts of misuse of official information. She says it's a \" personal vendetta. \" the charges stem from the suicide earlier this year of a us customs and border protection employee. Villarreal had the employee's name before police made it public. Texas law says people can be charged with misuse of official information if they receive it \" with intent to obtain a benefit \" from it, texas monthly reports. Police say in villarreal's case, that benefit was facebook popularity. Her lawyer says that should scare all news outlets, where whoever gets the scoop \" gets the most readers, or 'likes, ' or whatever. \" legal experts believe the case against villarreal won't succeed. The name of a government employee who killed themselves is public record, and as one expert notes, it's not villarreal's \" duty to keep that information secret. \" meanwhile, the laredo police department has gone after who it believes is villarreal's source: officer barbara goodman.

Per the bbc, ka design's shirts featuring a swastika next to words like \"zen \" and \"peace \" have been pulled from its online shop after an uproar. In an interview with dazed, ka design says that the design's juxtaposition of swastikas emblazoned over rainbows evoking peace flags and the lgbtq movement is meant to reclaim the controversial symbol: \"we really like the symbol in its shape and aesthetics, and we would love to share the beauty of this symbol detached from the hatred associated with it. \" the swastika, which means well-being in sanskrit, had been used for at least 4,000 years across many cultures before it was co-opted in the 1930s by adolf hitler and used on the nazi flag. But few are sharing the company's zeal for bringing back the symbol. Ka design told dazed that it couldn't disclose information on sales, but that since people don't normally see swastikas in a fashion context, they may not feel comfortable wearing one on a shirt. User feedback on the company's facebook page suggests, however, people are irate that the shirts were made in the first place. A video released by ka design in july championing its effort has more than 2 million views, but seems to be going viral for all the wrong reasons. Comments ranged from disbelief to outrage, with one user summing it up thusly: \"this absurd new design company has 2 million views on their facebook, and about 11,000 angry comments. \" the company posted a message about the backlash monday, saying that hatred and \" nazism \" had won: \"we brought out the worst in people.

            "Image copyright teespring.com image caption the t-shirt design was part of a campaign to rebrand the swastika a us clothing company has come under fire after t-shirts appeared online featuring swastikas in a move aimed at reclaiming the symbol as one of \" love \". The attempt to rebrand the nazi emblem as a symbol of \" peace \" was criticised on social media as the public refused to support the campaign. Days after the design appeared, it was replaced with an \" anti-swastika \" print. The swastika is an ancient symbol said to have represented good fortune in almost every culture in the world. It was adopted by adolf hitler, thousands of years after it was first used, transforming it into a symbol of hate associated with the third reich.

The attempt to rebrand the nazi emblem as a symbol of \" peace \" was criticised on social media as the public refused to support the campaign. Days after the design appeared, it was replaced with an \" anti-swastika \" print. The swastika is an ancient symbol said to have represented good fortune in almost every culture in the world. It was adopted by adolf hitler, thousands of years after it was first used, transforming it into a symbol of hate associated with the third reich.

Reports on the acquisition are focusing on how the buy will go a long way toward helping yahoo beef up its desired mobile-first image. But they're also sharing the kinds of quirky details you'd expect in a story like this. Some highlights from the new york times and the telegraph: d ' aloisio's 1996 birth date comes two years after yahoo's 1994 founding. He released his first app when he was 12, a finger-exercise app called finger mill; over subsequent school vacations he made apps like songstumblr and facemood ( which assigns a happiness/sadness rating to your friends ' facebook posts ). He's the youngest person in history to receive venture capital funding: $ 300,000, which he was wired on his 16th birthday. He used that, plus another $ 1.2 million, to make summly. He's not moving to the us, but he will abide by yahoo's much decried new work policy: he ' ll commute to the company's london office. The courtship was a quick one: summly officially launched in november; yahoo ( and others ) began a conversation with d ' aloisio the next month. Among d ' aloisio's big-name investors: stephen fry, ashton kutcher, yoko ono. What he's doing with his windfall: \" it's going to be put into a trust fund and my parents will help manage it. \" meanwhile, over at gizmodo, you can read all about the time casey chan made 15-year-old nick cry. Summly does technically what newser does by hand: summarize long-form news into briefs. If you're mourning the loss of summly, grab one of our apps here.",
