        "summary": "A 42-year-old white female police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in oklahoma on friday has a clean record with the tulsa police department, a police official tells the tulsa world. Officer tyler turnbough was ided by tulsa police chief chuck jordan as the cop who initially used a stun gun on 40-year-old terence crutcher, who reportedly had been having car trouble on the side of the road friday evening, nbc news reports. But jordan says betty jo shelby, a member of the tulsa force since 2011, pulled the trigger of her real gun after she told a dispatcher that \" she's not having cooperation from crutcher. \" shelby is on paid administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated, including by the justice department and oklahoma authorities, per cnn. Public outcry has been fierce — including a local activist group calling for shelby's immediate arrest, per the world — since the tulsa pd released the 911 audio, dashcam video, and footage from a chopper, with even jordan conceding the footage is \" very disturbing. \" in audio from the chopper, an officer is heard describing crutcher as a \" bad dude \" as four cops, including shelby, follow him to his car. A tulsa pd rep says once crutcher reached the suv, the officers thought he was reaching into the driver's-side window. An attorney for shelby, who started her career with the tulsa county sheriff's office, says his client told crutcher — who can be seen in the police footage walking toward his car with his hands in the air — to stop walking and he didn't comply, and that she also feared he may have had a weapon in his pants pockets.",

Love is all about action, it is a verb, we love by doing and the feelings then come. I live with the resultant feelings of a wonderful marriage filled with many climbing ascents until majestic views and feelings were ours to enjoy.

The lawsuit claims novak's boyfriend, brandon simpson, sent it to five fraternity brothers and showed it to more at a house meeting and notes novak discovered the sharing during spring break in march. It alleges she was with simpson as he received a text that referenced the video from a frat brother and that simpson admitted his actions to her. Novak's lawsuit, seeking $ 75,000 in damages, names simpson, four other frat brothers, and the fraternity itself.

Though analysts generally agree that what we got is better than no deal, the plan we got is full of holes. Here's a rundown of what the deal does and does not do: tax increases: top earners get hit hardest, but the tax policy center estimates that a full 77.1 % of us households will see some sort of increase in their annual tax bill. Taxes among 80 % of households making between $ 50,000 and $ 200,000 will spike an average of $ 1,635 per year, reports bloomberg. Top earners: the top 1 % of taxpayers, those making more than $ 506,210, will pay an average of $ 73,633 more every year. For those making more than $ 2.7 million, that jumps to $ 443,910. Unemployment: one-sixth of the 12 million people who are out of jobs will have their unemployment benefits extended for a year. But \" the failure to extend the payroll tax cut until the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 % or interest rates rise is a big negative, \" one analyst tells the washington post. Deficit: the big goal of the budget deal was to help decrease the soaring deficit, but it falls short there, too. The tax changes will bring in $ 620 billion of revenue over a decade, but that's a drop in the deficit bucket, says the atlantic wire. Spending: how will the budget deal help rein in government spending? it won't. There are no spending cuts built into the deal, which is part of the reason why almost no one is thrilled about it. New showdowns: some of the provisions of the bill expire at various points this year, and the controversial defense spending cuts were delayed for only two months. Meanwhile, the wall street journal points out, obama has promised to target more tax increases — this time around he has deductions and loopholes in his sights.",

        "summary": "If you're already scared of spiders, you're not going to like this next part. A new study published thursday in current biology found that spiders — specifically a species of jumping spider — can hear sounds from further than 10 feet away. Previously, scientists believed spiders, which lack eardrums, could only sense vibrations in the air from a few centimeters away, phys.org reports. Researchers at cornell university accidentally discovered this heretofore unknown ability thanks a squeaky lab chair. They were doing neural recordings of a spider's brain to study its sense of sight when they noticed neurons firing in response to the chair. The same neurons would fire in response to clapping from up to 16 feet away. The researchers have since gone on to find similar abilities in at least five other species of spider, and they believe many others have similar capabilities, the washington post reports. That means spiders can hear people \" talking and walking, \" researcher gil menda tells new scientist. Researchers believe the spiders are using sensory hairs on their front legs to sense vibrations moving through the air. These hairs are attuned to different frequencies in each spider. In the original jumping spider, they triggered a response in reaction to frequencies that matched the beating of a predatory wasp's wings. \" in the movies, spider-man has this strange, additional'spidey sense'that helps him sense danger — it turns out the real-life spidey sense of spiders might actually be hearing, \" menda tells phys.org.

            "The greatest closer of all time is almost ready to hang up his cleats. According to buster olney of espn, new york yankees closer mariano rivera will announce that he is planning on retiring after the 2013 season. It's an open secret that mariano rivera intends to retire, and that announcement figures to be very soon, perhaps saturday. — buster olney ( @buster_espn ) march 7, 2013 some felt rivera's last season was going to be in 2012, but after suffering a torn acl injury back in may on the outfield grass of kauffman stadium, the yankee closer didn't want his career to end like that. Rivera swore to everyone that he would return for one final season, and he stuck to his word when he signed a one-year deal for $ 10 million this winter. The 43-year-old is the all-time saves leader in mlb with 608, and holds a 2.21 era and sub-1.00 whip over his 18-year career. While those figures are extremely impressive, what has really set rivera apart are his postseason numbers, which are off the charts. Chris mcgrath/getty images in 96 postseason contests, rivera has gone 8-1 with a 0.70 era while recording 42 saves. He's also been a part of all five yankees championships since 1996 — tossing the series-clinching pitch in four of them. When rivera",

And if you adjust for future inflation, the total bill hits nearly $ 302,000. The biggest cost involved: housing, at 30 %. Next up, for lower-income families, is food, while it's child care in richer homes. Thanks in particular to housing and health care costs, the total figure has risen 23 % since 1960, usa today reports, which is when the yearly study began. And it doesn't include college. There is, however, a big difference in spending between wealthy and lower-income families: total spending on a kid born in 2012, counting inflation, will range from $ 217,000 — for families making less than $ 60,640 — to some $ 501,000 for families making more than $ 105,000.

        "summary": "The most common word in reports and headlines out of yemen today is \" chaos. \" the nation once seen as a vital ally in the fight against al-qaeda is now on the brink of civil war, with saudi arabia launching a military operation and the ap reporting that president abed rabbo mansour hadi has fled the country by boat. Advancing rebels known as the houthis had previously forced him to decamp from the capital, sanaa, to the port city of aden. The reports of his departure are unconfirmed, but the new york times observes that if he hasn't already left, it's just a matter of time. Here's a sample of some of the complex dynamics at stake: saudis vs. Iran: the houthis are shiite and backed by iran, and the prospect of them taking over the country doesn't sit well with the sunni government of saudi arabia. Hence, the ap sees the very real possibility of \" a deeply destabilizing proxy war between saudi arabia and iran. \" this evening, saudi arabia and its allies in the persian gulf launched airstrikes in the country, with the stated goal to \" prevent yemen from falling into the hands of the houthis, \" reports the washington post. Houthis vs. Al-qaeda and isis: the houthis seem to have ousted a us-backed president, but they are also sworn enemies of al-qaeda and the islamic state, which \" makes them potential allies \" in a us-led coalition against the groups, reports the voice of america. Old president returns? hadi replaced ali abdullah saleh as president after the arab spring revolts, but yemen's deterioration raises the possibility that saleh will return, allied with the houthis, reports al-jazeera america. Yemen is the fourth country, along with libya, syria, and iraq, to suffer a meltdown after those 2012 revolts, notes the voa. Bottom line: \" the country is now sliding toward a civil war as dangerous as any in the region, with elements of a sectarian feud, a regional proxy conflict, the attempted return of an ousted authoritarian and the expansion of anti-western extremist groups like al qaeda and the islamic state eager to capitalize on the chaos, \" writes david kirkpatrick in the new york times.",

When dykes reached up to open the door, which put him in an awkward position, agents dropped in stun grenades and barged in. Dykes reportedly fired and missed, and agents returned fire, killing him. Authorities found crude homemade bombs in the bunker, say the network's sources. At least one was in the plastic pipe used by police to communicate with dykes, reports ap.

Computer simulations have created an \" exact agreement \" with the bare mounds in namibia, and the two-pronged ecological explanation may help solve similar mysteries elsewhere, reports gizmodo, including the mima mounds in north america and australia's version of fairy circles. Namibia's fairy circles are hexagon-shaped areas of soil whose perimeter is ringed by clumps of grasses. The patches range from as few as six to as many as 115 feet wide, and in africa's namib desert, they cover hundreds of square miles. Previous theories blamed the underground termites or the desert plants, but the study in nature makes the case that the circles \" cannot be explained by either mechanism in isolation. \" instead, it's a combination of those two factors, though mostly the termites, notes ap. \" one of the most striking things about nature is that despite the complexity of all of its interactions... You find these amazing regularities, \" princeton researcher corina tarnita tells the guardian. ( another weird quirk of the circles: they resemble skin cells. )",

The study in cell metabolism followed 53 non-obese men and women over the course of two years, some of whom reduced the amount of calories they ate by 15 %, reports live science. At that point, researchers put the participants through a series of tests. Yes, those who cut calories lost more weight than the control group, though that wasn't the goal, explains npr. The more interesting discovery is that the calorie cutters showed a marked improvement in their metabolism. In short, it became more efficient. \" restricting calories can slow your basal metabolism, and if by-products of metabolism accelerate aging processes, calorie restriction sustained over several years may help to decrease risk for chronic disease and prolong life, \" says lead author leanne redman of the pennington biomedical research in baton rouge. The researchers acknowledge that the study is fairly small and fairly short, but it backs up similar findings in creatures such as rats and monkeys. As for the weight loss, the calories cutters dropped an average of 25 pounds. A scientist not involved with the study points out a potential drawback: those who severely restrict calories often end up gaining back more weight in the long run, which could end up shortening longevity.

Both a slower metabolism and reduced oxidative stress have been linked with a lower risk of age-related diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, according to the study, published today ( march 22 ) in the journal cell metabolism.

He served as executive director of that group from october 2014 until he was selected as jeff sessions ' chief of staff in september 2017. Fact is described by the new york times as a group \" active in conservative politics that does not reveal its donors. \" the forms also show he was paid $ 103,000 from the law firm where he was partner and $ 15,000 for appearing as a legal analyst on cnn. The revelations have spurred some questions and observations. Usa today reports the disclosure forms were revised five times prior to their release. That has the advocacy group american oversight calling on congress to request the earlier versions to see what was added or removed. Cnn reports the watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington has filed a freedom of information act request in hopes of getting all those versions. The times zeroes in on fact's anonymous donor pool, writing, \" the disclosure raised questions about who mr.

Disturbing video shows him pacing around his concrete enclosure while swaying his head and baring his teeth, possible signs that he's going insane, experts say. Others note that arturo lost his longtime companion, a bear named paula, two years ago, and is living in temperatures that climb to 104 degrees fahrenheit when he's suited to life on frosty sea ice. Worse, his only cool water lies in a \" tiny pool \" that's 20 inches deep, the mirror reports. A change.org petition to have him moved to a canadian zoo has generated nearly 30,000 signatures as of this writing, but an earlier discussion about moving him there fizzled when mendoza zoo lacked three years of health records on arturo, which is required by canadian law, the winnipeg sun reports. Another barrier to moving him arose in february when experts deemed arturo too old and fragile to be relocated. One activist tells fox news latino that it was \" a halfway fake evaluation that doesn't convince us at all, \" but the zoo's director said that everything depends on arturo's health and his ability to withstand a long trip: \" we must avoid a big mistake, \" he said.",

That changed this week, however, after conway penned another op-ed with attorney neal katyal, this one appearing in the new york times and blasting trump's appointment of new acting attorney general matthew whitaker as \" unconstitutional. \" reporters asked trump friday what he thought of george conway's latest piece, and trump didn't hold back this time. After first retorting, \" who?, \" trump said, per the hill: \" you mean mr. Kellyanne conway? he's just trying to get publicity for himself. \" he then tried to redirect the line of questioning, per cnn, noting, \" why don't you do this, why don't you ask kellyanne that question, all right? she might know him better than me. I really don't know the guy. \" trump seemed especially cranky at another question thrown at him by cnn's abby phillip, who asked him if he wanted whitaker to reign in mueller. The president's response: \" what a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But i watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions. \" he walked away without answering her question.

The petition worries that without guns convention-goers will be \" utterly helpless against evil-doers, criminals, or others who wish to threaten the american way of life. \" for example, they would be \" sitting ducks \" in an isis terrorist attack on the arena.

The petition has a number of demands, including the q suspending its no-weapons policy for the convention, the party finding an alternate venue incase the q won't allow weapons inside, and the candidates — all three of whom have spoken out against gun-free zones — demanding guns be allowed inside the convention. Probably unnecessarily, gq points out this whole thing is likely a prank. \" this is proooooobably someone trolling the nra and reince preibus, but there's also maybe a 12 % chance it's true, \" the magazine states. \" either way, it's unlikely to happen. \" the republican national convention starts july 18.",

The new york times reports that on thursday, trump also laid into canada, saying our northern neighbor exploits us workers, specifically in the dairy industry, and that \" what they've done... Is a disgrace. \" the wall street journal notes that to make his point on steel ( and on other products \" important to defense, \" a source says ), trump has called for a probe relying on the little-referenced 1962 trade expansion act, which allows for trade sanctions for \" national security \" reasons. The argument, briefly: if the us doesn't create enough steel, it won't have enough for the military. While some may point to all of this trade talk as an example of trump keeping one of his campaign promises, the times notes a more interesting angle: that of a \" comeback \" for steve bannon, trump's chief strategist who was deemed a \" marked man \" just last week. Trump is \" manically focused on these trade issues, \" bannon tells the paper, which notes that bannon's nationalist belief on putting up trade barriers stands in stark contrast to the \" globalist \" philosophies of other white house bigwigs like jared kushner ( trump's son-in-law ) and ex-goldman sachs banker gary cohn, who now heads up the national economic council.

For the second antarctic winter in a row, the halley vi research station will be closed as two giant cracks continue to spread across the 500-foot-thick brunt ice shelf. In a press release, bas calls it a \" complex and unpredictable glaciological situation. \" the first crack started moving north in 2012 after 30 years of dormancy and has sped up in the last half a year, the guardian reports. The second, the \" halloween crack, \" has been moving east since appearing in october 2016 and is now more than 30 miles long. The european spacey agency has a map of both cracks and the location of halley vi created from satellite images. Halley vi will be closed between march and november 2018. Francis says it would be difficult to rescue the station's 14 staffers should the ice shelf break apart during winter's permanent darkness and frozen seas. \" the safety of our staff is our priority in these circumstances, \" she says. In the meantime, staffers arriving for the summer season this week plan to install automated experiments that can run on a generator unsupervised during the winter. But that's easier said than done. \" for it to keep running at -50c with nobody around to chip the ice off it or keep the snow away from it will be a significant challenge, \" david vaughn at bas tells the bbc.

Perhaps you still do — though that's less likely, given, as reuters reports, the company had to get bailed out by banks last year after posting a $ 5.5 billion loss. So to address its flagging fortunes, sharp is planning to start selling a surprising new product: strawberries. Known for being extra sweet, strawberries grown in japan are a popular snack amongst the middle eastern elite, reports the asahi shimbun. But shipping the fruit there is a pain, because it's a long way to travel and the strawberries spoil easily. So sharp is building an indoors facility in dubai where it can cultivate strawberries from japanese seeds, utilizing a high-tech set-up to regulate light, temperature, and air quality. The factories will be unmanned, with sharp controlling the operation remotely from japan. The company is now trialing the idea in a test facility, with the aim of growing 3,000 strawberries a month, reports the bbc.

The story is only slightly less surprising because that man was dr. Bendor grosvenor of the bbc program britain's lost masterpieces. Grosvenor noticed the painting of george villiers, first duke of buckingham, during a visit to the historic pollok house in glasgow, according to the bbc. \" there was this painting further up by the fireplace and it sounds rather silly to say it, but it was a bit of a eureka moment and i thought: 'my god, that looks like a rubens, ' \" the guardian quotes grosvenor as saying. The portrait was painted by flemish artist peter paul rubens around 1625 but was believed to have been lost. In reality, later artists painting over the background of the portrait — not to mention hundreds of years of dirt and grime — had obscured the work's identity as an original rubens. It was confirmed as such through x-rays, cleaning, and scientific analysis of the wood it was painted on. The portrait is believed to have been bought by an art collector who owned the pollok house in the late-1800s, the telegraph reports. The man who authenticated it calls it a \" rare addition to ruben's portrait oeuvre. \" villiers was a minor noble elevated to duke by james i. Experts believe he was the king's lover, and a secret passageway connected the two men's bedrooms in one of james'residences.

            "Image caption the portrait of the duke of buckingham dates from around 1625 a \" lost \" portrait by flemish artist peter paul rubens has been rediscovered after almost 400 years. The 17th century flemish artist's \" head study \" of the duke of buckingham was identified by dr bendor grosvenor from bbc four's britain's lost masterpieces. It was in glasgow museums ' collection and on public display at the city's pollok house stately home. But overpainting and centuries of dirt meant it was thought to be a later copy by another artist. The restored portrait of george villiers, the 1st duke of buckingham, was authenticated as a rubens by ben van beneden, director of the rubenshuis in antwerp. He said it was a \" rare addition to rubens's portrait oeuvre, showing how he approached the genre \". Dr grosvenor said: \" the chance to discover a portrait of such a pivotal figure in british history by one of the greatest artists who ever lived has been thrillingly exciting. \" media playback",

Jazmine headley was arrested in brooklyn friday after a security guard at a city social services office asked her to move and she allegedly refused; the woman who recorded the incident ( in a video that went viral, bringing attention to the case ) said headley and her son had been sitting on the floor because all the seats were taken. Police were called and a struggle ensued in which headley's toddler son was taken from her. She was charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration, and trespassing, but the brooklyn da dismissed all those charges tuesday. Headley initially remained jailed at new york city's rikers island on an unrelated new jersey warrant, but later tuesday a judge ordered her released, the ap reports. According to the new york times, the executive director of brooklyn defender services explained the new jersey case tuesday, saying headley was in a car with four people when it was pulled over; police allegedly found stolen credit cards inside the car. Though headley was quickly released and had only been charged with a misdemeanor, she couldn't get back to new jersey for a court date and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was at the government office friday in an attempt to get childcare benefits reinstated for her son, who was with her at the time because his daycare had just informed her the city had stopped paying his fee. The 23-year-old initially remained jailed on the question of whether she would be extradited to new jersey; instead, she was expected to be released tuesday but must appear in court wednesday for the credit card case.

The small-scale study — based on the responses of 350 low-income parents in philadelphia — identified \" almost universal exposure, early adoption, and use of mobile media devices among young children, \" the lead author tells the cbc. About 70 % of parents said their children used devices unsupervised, including while parents did chores. About 65 % said a device was used to appease a child in public, while 25 % of parents said they'd left a child with a device at bedtime, though screens generally keep sleep at bay, per the new york times. Some 44 % of kids under 1 and 77 % of 2-year-olds used a mobile device daily; a third of 3- and 4-year-olds used more than one device at a time. A researcher at philadelphia's einstein medical center says, \" we see every parent pulling out the iphone and giving it to their baby, \" so the study \" was sort of validation ( in ) real life, \" per usa today.

The blade didn't look precisely like a real sword, as it was missing a pointy head and a handle.

That figure comes out of a microsoft research study that found the most avid pokemon go players took an average 26 % more steps than they did before they got hooked on the game, with the biggest gains seen among previous couch potatoes. And since more physical activity — specifically increased number of steps — has been linked to longer lives, that could be good news for everyone who spends their days on the hunt for that elusive, perhaps nonexistent mewtwo. The researchers looked at data culled from the microsoft band fitness device worn by nearly 32,000 users and found despite a user's age, gender, weight, or lifestyle habits, people who played pokemon go took an average 194 steps more daily than they did before they started playing. The study also compared pokemon go players to control groups of people who used four other health apps — and while those control subjects were found to be significantly more active than the pokemon go group before the experiment, the pokemon go users racked up larger activity increases once game play started. Scientists estimate that players who manage 1,000 steps a day could perhaps gain almost 42 extra days of life — but only if the app sustains \" large-scale engagement \" and keeps people on the move, lead researcher tim althoff tells polygon.

Some legendaries are encountered during the course of of a game's storyline, while others have esoteric requirements that need to be fulfilled before a player can encounter them. Sometimes, a legendary can only be caught during special events thrown by the pokémon company, and these are often tied to specific locales, like a game store.

        "summary": "A dog's nose may be wetter than yours, but don't count yourself out when it comes to tracking a scent just as well as your canine companion. A new mega-study in the journal science refutes the longtime belief that dogs ' noses are vastly superior to our own, reporting that people's olfactory skills rank right up there with other mammals, including rodents and, yes, dogs. Led by neuroscientist john mcgann, researchers out of rutgers university-new brunswick pored over upward of 1,000 scientific papers on humans'sense of smell and found that genuflection to animals'sniffing skills stretches back to the 1870s, when anatomist paul broca concluded the human olfactory bulb was tiny and not as powerful as those in other mammals, the cbc reports. Turns out, that's not the case. Mcgann explains in a release that the animals-can-sniff-better myth has persisted due to the number of olfactory receptors humans have ( about 400 ), while mice and rats boast around 1,000. But people typically have more glomeruli, or smell decoders, which means we may be able to recognize up to 1 trillion odors — similar to what mice and dogs can pick up. Mcgann says smelling comparisons between pups and people is also muddled by the fact that each boasts a different sniffing process, per live science: while humans rely on odors hitching a ride on those receptors, which then send messages to the olfactory bulb, then to the brain, dogs have a \" pump \" that's better able to pick up chemicals in liquid form. Plus, dogs and humans are just primed to parse out different odors: dogs may be better at smelling urine on a hydrant, while humans are better able to figure out there's a glass of fine wine nearby.

A majority of the hamlet's 56 registered voters sided with the name-change campaign backed by mayor lorenzo rodriguez, who threatened to step down if villagers decided against change, reuters reports. He argued that although jews were massacred in the area, \" this is a village descended from a jewish community \" that was forced to convert to catholicism and changed its name during the spanish inquisition to convince authorities of its loyalty. Before the name change in 1627 — more than a century after jews were ordered to either convert to christianity or leave spain — the village was called castrillo motajudios, or \" hill of the jews, \" and some researchers believe the change may have been the result of a slip of a pen, the ap notes. No final decision has been made on a new name, but the village will probably revert to \" hill of the jews \" after a town meeting next month. Some 29 of the village's residents voted for change, while 19 voted to keep \" kill the jews \" and the remainder either didn't vote or turned in blank forms.",

Schumer said further negotiations were needed and spurned mcconnell's request, pushing a vote until monday, when hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed. \" talks will continue, but we have yet to reach an agreement on a path forward that would be acceptable for both sides, \" schumer said.

The 3-2 vote was along party lines, and legal challenges from telecom and cable companies will come next, reports the wall street journal. \"the internet is simply too important to allow broadband providers to be the ones making the rules, \" said fcc chief tom wheeler at the commission meeting. From ars technica: \" the most controversial part of the fcc's decision reclassifies fixed and mobile broadband as a telecommunications service, with providers to be regulated as common carriers under title ii of the communications act. \" wheeler says the reclassification is necessary to withstand the court challenges to follow, and cnet notes that the fcc made the move because it lost two previous legal fights on net neutrality.

The rapper also tweeted he was \" happy i ' m up top, \" as he believed many of those who fell ill were on the first level of the aircraft. He later told wpbf the \" chaos \" started as soon as the plane landed, and that even though the pilot had warned everyone about a sick passenger, he was thrown by the scene that waited for them on the ground. \" at that point, i was like, ' ok, now i ' m getting nervous ' and it started getting serious, \" he noted, adding that staffers didn't offer any further information but merely told passengers to stay seated and off their phones. He adds that everyone was \" panicking \" as they were stuck there for more than three hours. Meanwhile, oxiris barbot, nyc's acting health commissioner, told reporters that what sickened at least three passengers and seven crew members was \" probably influenza, \" cnn reports.

Sgt. Jim parker, however, told the daily news that he never thought watts was a prostitute and that she could have avoided all the hubbub by simply showing her id. He added that he thought watts ' racism charges were \" ironic, \" since he's gay and the other officers on the scene were a woman and a latino. The couple's arraignment is scheduled for nov. 13.

The crux of the nobel-prize deal is the crux of the show: \" middle-out \" compression, the tech breakthrough that main character richard hendricks comes up with. It was born out of dramatic necessity, head consultant jonathan dotan tells the new yorker: the first season's arc required that hendricks have a tech \" epiphany... So we had to invent a breakthrough — something that would be huge, but realistic. \" dotan turned to stanford engineer tsachy weissman, and after hours of discussion, dotan shared with judge and berg a powerpoint on the history of compression, in which files are made smaller. Very simply, this was first achieved top-down, and later bottom-up. Judge and berg's response: could a \" middle-out \" approach jack up the compression ability? dotan took the question to weissman, who ran with the idea. He and one of his grad students, vinith misra, have since published papers on the concept. Which leads to this key line from dotan: \" clearly, middle-out compression doesn't work as well as it does on the show. If it did, we'd all be trillionaires.

        "summary": "Prince's final days are coming into sharper focus, and it now appears the singer had developed an addiction to pain pills so serious that he was set to meet with an addiction specialist when he died. The new york times delves into the question of how prince — who had a reputation for clean living, reportedly not even allowing those who went on tour with him to drink or smoke pot — could have developed such a serious addiction problem in secret. Indeed, many of his closest friends apparently had no idea, and have been insisting in recent days that prince never took painkillers. It helped that prince was always an intensely private person, keeping to himself just how much his decades of performances had left his body in pain. \" he was that kind of old school, the-show-must-go-on guy, so the idea of him medicating himself in order to perform isn't strange to me, \" his former tour manager tells the times. But prince didn't let on that he was using painkillers — initially prescribed for general pain and, later, for hip surgery, sources say — to such an extent. And he often did things for himself ( drove himself around, made his own appointments ), making it easier to keep the pills a secret. Even after his medical emergency on a plane caused an emergency landing, he immediately \" shaped the narrative \" to make it appear everything was fine, the times says, planning a party at his home for the very next night and insisting to everyone that he was ok.

            "London canadian pop star justin bieber was filmed lunging and shouting abuse at a photographer on friday during an ill-fated stay in london which has gone from bad to worse after he collapsed on stage the day before. The altercation, caught on camera and featured on popular celebrity news websites including tmz, showed the 19-year-old get out of a van, try to move towards the unnamed member of the paparazzi and threaten him using several swear words. He was reacting to the man's foul-mouthed criticism of him and his security team after the singer appeared to have made contact with the photographer as they moved towards the vehicle.

But one doctor says that the illness may be a bit overhyped. \" hysterical, that's the way i describe it, \" dr. Paul checchia of texas children's hospital tells nbc. \" it is a significant respiratory pathogen, but it is not really different from a lot of other respiratory pathogens out there. \" there are plenty of other viruses that do major damage each year: the respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) sends up to 125,000 kids to the hospital annually and kills as many as 200 ( an estimate checchia thinks is conservative ); it's especially dangerous for newborns — and the elderly, 10,000 of whom die of it in america each year. Even the regular flu killed 105 children last year, according to nbc. Meanwhile, no deaths from ev-68 have been officially reported. And the kids who've suffered the most from ev-68 tend to have underlying respiratory or neurological problems, nbc notes. Another expert suggests that ev-68 is getting more attention than other dangerous illnesses because of the unusually wide outbreak; \" rsv is always there, \" he says, \" and people get used to it. \" one frightening potential symptom of ev-68, however, that could set the virus apart from other illnesses: paralysis. Health officials are trying to determine if 10 children in colorado who were recently hospitalized with muscle weakness in their limbs experienced this symptom because of ev-68 — evidence of the virus was found in the nasal passages of six of the children, cnn reports. However, a medical director at children's hospital colorado says that \" parents shouldn't panic — this is very, very uncommon. \" ( one study warns that experimenting with mutant viruses could cause a pandemic. )",

Shafqat hussain, convicted of kidnapping and murdering a 7-year-old boy in 2004, reportedly confessed to police, though his lawyer says he only did so under torture. Others argue hussain was 14 at the time of his arrest, which should have meant the death penalty was off the table, per the guardian. Though the country's top court previously reviewed hussain's case, \" pakistan authorities have never undertaken a proper, judicial investigation into either issue, \" rights group justice project pakistan says, noting police refused to release hussain's school record, which would've confirmed his age. Authorities maintain hussain was 23 at the time of the crime. Hussain's execution was delayed four times, including once last month, as controversy erupted, reports the new york times. Advocates had urged officials to review his case over the last several days. Prison officials say he was granted a final meeting with family members before becoming one of nearly 200 people put to death since a six-year moratorium on executions was lifted in pakistan in december. The european union says executions are now being performed at an \" alarming pace. \" \" the trial of shafqat hussain sums up the structural flaws in our criminal justice system, where police torture and confessions under duress are the norm, \" says a pakistani analyst. \" here is a case where a poor family was unable to pursue a criminal case that requires resources and access to influential people within the state. \"",

        "summary": "The fbi investigation into hillary clinton's private email use continues, but a report from the state department's independent watchdog has arrived. The 83-page review from inspector general steve linick — whom the clinton camp accuses of working with republicans to take down her campaign — focuses on record keeping and isn't shy in noting clinton did plenty wrong. Some highlights: clinton should have printed and saved all her emails from her time as secretary of state and handed over all work-related emails when she stepped down. \" because she did not do so, she did not comply with the department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the federal records act, \" the report finds, per politico. Clinton — who did not comply with an interview request — never sought state department approval for her private email server. If she had, the department would have returned a firm no due to the \" security risks, \" reports the ap. A clinton aide was warned in 2010 that the server might not preserve records in accordance with the law. The aide was unperturbed, noting the system had been reviewed by legal counsel, though the inspector general found no record of that, per the washington post. Also in 2010, aide huma abedin wrote to clinton about getting a state email so her messages to state employees wouldn't be received as spam. \" let's get separate address or device but i don't want any risk of the personal being accessible, \" clinton wrote, per politico. The agency as a whole suffers from \" longstanding, systemic weaknesses \" that \" go well beyond the tenure of any one secretary of state, \" reads the report. For example, colin powell didn't follow department policy rules regarding public-record laws, either. The department and its secretaries were \" slow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications. \"",

Winston told police that it was an honest mistake and that he simply forgot to pay. Police didn't arrest him but instead issued a civil citation that will require winston to do community service. The school, meanwhile, has suspended him from his other sport — he's a relief pitcher for the baseball team. Though a minor offense, the incident is dredging up reminders of winston's more serious brush with the law, when a woman accused him of sexual assault in 2013, notes ap. Prosecutors dropped charges citing a lack of evidence, though the school is still facing a federal inquiry into its handling of the woman's accusations. The miami herald calls winston \" one of the most-celebrated and most-scrutinized figures in college sports, \" but says fsu fans don't seem to be taking this latest case too seriously — think goofy photoshopped images online and jokes about \" free seafood university. \"",

        "summary": "Los angeles ' 96 million shade balls are bizarre to say the least — which is partly why the media pounced on the story of their role in conserving water, as officials had hoped, grist included. Now, the website does a careful walk-through of just why these balls aren't so hot. Based on an la weekly report, grist finds the city has been using the balls since 2008, before california's drought, because their main purpose is to prevent the formation of bromate, a carcinogen that develops when sunlight mixes with bromide and chlorine in water. Why do we care about the balls now? apparently, la mayor eric garcetti correctly thought tying the balls to the drought would help sell them to the public and emphasized they ' ll save 300 million gallons of water a year. However, that much water is worth $ 2 million or $ 20 million over a decade; la's shade balls cost $ 34.5 million, according to la weekly. In comparison, the washington post reported california could save 500 billion gallons if the agriculture industry cut its water use by 5 %. Grist notes that marine pollution researcher max liboiron has additional concerns. At discard studies, he argues \" most plastics leach endocrine disrupting chemicals that interfere with animal and human hormone systems. \" some of these disruptors break down in water in weeks or months and most water treatment systems don't remove them. Then there's the fact that plastics break down into microplastics and are consumed by humans and marine animals. The \" poison pills \" also soak up chemicals that then enter animal tissue and food chains, liboiron says. Apparently the risk is worth the reward for garcetti, who told the huffington post, \" it takes bold ingenuity to maximize my goals for water conservation. \"",

        "summary": "Donald trump's campaign is starting the week trying to move on from a bombshell report on his 1995 tax return — but it may not be easy changing the subject from what the guardian calls his campaign's \" biggest crisis yet. \" in what rudy giuliani calls a sign of \" genius, \" trump could have avoided federal income tax for up to 18 years after declaring a $ 916 million loss on his taxes in 1995. A round-up of coverage: cnn asks and answers six questions raised by the tax revelations, including: \" will this hurt trump in the rust belt? \" and \" will trump react by attacking clinton? \" the new york times, which broke the story after a mystery source mailed tax records to a reporter, takes a look at the tactics trump could have used to turn the tax code into a tax shelter, \" some of them considered highly aggressive and of dubious legitimacy. \" trump aides tell the washington post that they plan to \" shine the spotlight very brightly on how the clintons made their money. \" trump, who will appear at a rally in colorado on monday, will cast himself as somebody who employed thousands building his real-estate empire while bill and hillary clinton made their money giving speeches. The guardian has dug up plenty of trump tweets on taxation, including this one from 2012: \" half of americans don't pay income tax despite crippling govt debt... \" the wall street journal takes a close look at the section of the tax code trump appears to have used. It's been around since 1918 and congress hasn't made any serious moves toward getting rid of it. The washington post spoke to voters in toledo, ohio, and found that while die-hard trump supporters aren't too concerned by the news, voters closer to the middle ground are troubled by the implication that trump is far from the successful businessman he claims to be. With polls showing a shift toward clinton, trump's best chance for a reset will be the next debate, on sunday, oct. 9, and analysts say it can't come soon enough for him. \" donald trump is facing a cascade of bad news and self-inflicted controversies at the worst possible moment for his candidacy, \" gop strategist ryan williams tells politico. \" he has been gaining ground in both national and battleground state polls for several weeks, but now his momentum has been blunted and undecided voters are souring on his campaign. \"",

Richard besser puts it, it's easier to get help dead than alive. Case in point: locals crowded onto a monrovia street yesterday to watch a burial team recover the body of a man thought to have died from ebola alongside a sidewalk, with besser reporting live on the scene. He explained that locals had tried to get help for the 37-year-old the previous day. No one came. But following the news of his death, the burial team arrived on the scene within an hour. The team was in for quite a shock, however. After spraying the man's body down with bleach and moving him to a black plastic sheet for wrapping, the man suddenly moved. \" he's not dead. He's not dead, \" said besser, as abc's cameras captured the victim's arm moving slightly. The man was able to hitch a ride on a passing ambulance, but \" i don't know where they could take him, \" besser said. \" there are no hospitals to treat him \" in monrovia, where free beds are scarce. Afp took a look at the lack of beds earlier this week, noting that one clinic had its 120 beds full within 24 hours of opening; a belgian aid worker who functioned as a \" bouncer \" at a 160-bed doctors without borders clinic quit, unable to deal with the stress of turning away the sick and dying.

Nicholls has imagined the two mix tapes emma gives dexter ( one from 1989, the other from 2000 ) and created spotify and itunes playlists where they can be streamed or purchased. For a music-infused movie, the soundtrack to \" one day \" is tasteful but limited -- ' 90s trip-hop, late-era tears for fears, college-radio one-hit wonders, a new elvis costello song. It's easy enough to imagine emma ( anne hathaway ) and dexter ( jim sturgess ) two 1988 graduates of the university of edinburgh with a del amitri or james poster on their dorm-room wall. Book soundtracks like these have become increasingly popular among authors and readers, especially as the connection between writers and their audience has become more interactive, and as the fast popularity of music-streaming services like spotify have made it easy to share songs online. But while a song on a movie soundtrack might be there because of a licensing deal or to boost an artist on a label also owned by the studio, author playlists, when done well, can deepen a character and enhance a reader's connection. \" a big part of creating characters for me has always involved working out their tastes -- in clothes, fashion, music, \" said nicholls, in an email interview. \" i know what the leading characters like, what they wear, what they listen to, what they eat, and making playlists is, i suppose, a form of note-taking, a way of working without really working. \" perhaps the leading popularizer of the author playlist is david gutowski, who runs the music- and literature-obsessed blog largeheartedboy.com. Since 2005, in the site's recurring book notes column, authors including bret easton ellis, sloane crosley, karen russell, aimee bender and meghan o ' rourke have shared soundtracks. Hundreds are archived there; since last month, they've been streamable on spotify. \" hearing about the music a writer enjoys or envisioned for his characters or book humanizes the author, \" gutowski said. \" writers have often told me that thinking about their book in relation to music recontextualizes the work for them, gives them a fresh vantage into something they wrote years ago. \" sometimes, these playlists",

        "summary": "If ballot measures are a reliable indicator of what a country cares about, america has been thinking a lot about pot: various degrees of marijuana legalization are on the ballot in no fewer than nine states, in an election that features 162 ballot measures, 72 of which were citizen initiatives. Some of the major measures, including votes on death, guns, and taxes: in votes that the guardian notes could turn the west green instead of blue or red, california, arizona, and nevada will be voting on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as are massachusetts and maine. Florida, arkansas, montana, and north dakota will be voting on allowing medical marijuana. In california, ballot measures include prop 62, which would get rid of the death penalty, and the competing prop 66, which would speed up executions. Nbc san diego reports that many voters say they are confused by the choice. If both propositions pass, the one with the most votes will prevail. Nebraska, meanwhile, is voting on whether to restore the death penalty, which was abolished by state lawmakers last year. The wall street journal reports that gun control measures including expanding background checks are on the ballot in california, nevada, maine, and washington — and polls show the initiatives are set to succeed in all four states. Ln california, pharmaceutical companies have spent tens of millions trying to defeat prop 61, which seeks to limit prescription drug costs by tying state government spending to the prices negotiated by the va, the los angeles times reports. Tobacco companies have spent heavily to fight the state's prop 56, which would add a $ 2-per-pack cigarette tax. Arizona, colorado, maine, and washington are voting whether to raise the minimum wage to above $ 7.25, while south dakotans are deciding whether to drop it from $ 8.50 back to $ 7.25 for people under 18. Indiana and kansas are voting on whether to add the right to hunt and fish to their state constitutions. Wbaa notes that 18 other states have added similar amendments over the last 20 years, while vermont added its back in 1777. Yet another california ballot initiative is one of the nation's most unusual: npr reports that prop 60 would require the use of condoms in porn, and would require producers to pay for std testing.",

Yoo, former cheney chief of staff david addington, and two former gitmo commanders were among 18 people blacklisted by russia today as human-rights violators, reports ria novosti and ap. Moscow made the move one day after the us released a list of 18 russians accused of human-rights violations. The treasury department did so as stipulated by the new magnitsky act, named for the late russian lawyer sergei magnitsky, reports the guardian. After accusing russian officials of stealing $ 230 million in a tax-rebate scheme, magnitsky got sent to prison, where he was reportedly beaten and denied medical treatment. He died within a year. Most of the russians named by the us were relatively low-level figures that magnitsky had accused of stealing. The us list has disappointed many in the russian opposition, who expected it to include far more names and to reach in to vladimir putin's inner circle.
