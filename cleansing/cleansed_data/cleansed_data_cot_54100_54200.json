Which could be soon: the south african commissioner of correctional services says the paralympian will likely be freed on probation aug. 21 from the kgosi mampuru ii prison in pretoria, the bbc notes. Pistorius'release, recommended by a prison committee for good behavior, would come 10 months into his five-year sentence if the parole board approves, the ap reports; the bbc adds that under south african law, he's eligible for probation after serving one-sixth of his sentence ( which would be 10 months ) and would be kept under \" correctional supervision, \" or house arrest, during his probation period. Reeva steenkamp's family isn't pleased with the news. \" as her family, we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want mr. Pistorius to suffer; that will not bring her back to us, \" they said in a statement, per the mirror. \" however, a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions. … incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough.

        "summary": "Will the third time be the charm for amazon? its now-slightly-misnomered prime day ( it's actually 30 hours long, not 24, this year ) kicks off at 9pm edt monday. Its inaugural sale in 2015 didn't blow consumers over; in 2016 there were early-morning website issues for some customers. This year, amazon is ready, at least by usa today's account, which notes that two floors of conference rooms at hq have been \" outfitted as war rooms \" to support the onslaught of shoppers, all of whom must have a prime membership to get the deals. More: the figures: prime day 2016 saw an estimated $ 500 million to $ 600 million in sales ( amazon didn't release official numbers ). That's a fraction of the $ 3.34 billion spent on the black friday that followed months later, but amazon said the total was up 60 % over 2015, with 2017's prime day expected to be even bigger. What does bigger look like? beating 2016 prime day records like these perhaps, per techcrunch: more than 90,000 tvs, 1 million shoes, 23,000 irobot vacuums, and 200,000 headphones were sold. It's a win-win for amazon: there's a big upside involved in reeling in new prime shoppers ( the count has increased about 20 million year-over-year in the us, to 85 million ): their amazon spending is almost double that of a non-prime customer: $ 1,300 a year versus $ 700. What's on sale? some 100,000 items, per cnet, but those items don't all go on sale at once. It offers tips on how to be alerted to the best deals ( one smart one involves using your amazon wish list ). Fortune offers some other ways, including a convenient-sounding alexa tip. So are the deals deals? in some cases. Quartz points out that the wirecutter gadget-review site examined 8,000 deals last prime day and recommended fewer than 1 % of them: 64. One handy tool: camelcamelcamel.com, which prompts you to input a product url and then lets you know how that stacks up to what amazon has charged for the item in the past. There's reason to care:... And also reason to avoid the \" rabbit hole \" altogether. Rick broida makes both cases at cnet. One dose of reality: if you've enjoyed amazon's tax-free shopping in the past, it's, well, a thing of the past. Forbes points out that since april 1, amazon has been levying sales tax for shoppers in all states with a sales tax ( five don",

The brazilian senate voted 61-20 to impeach rousseff, reports the bbc, covering the two-thirds majority needed. Rousseff, who was suspended in may, was accused of illegally moving government funds between different budgets to hide brazil's growing economic woes and bolster popular social programs. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and defended herself in front of the senate monday, calling her ouster a coup. \" from the day after i was elected, several measures were taken to destabilize my government, \" she said. \" and you have been systematically making accusations against me. \" acting president michel temer is scheduled to be sworn in wednesday to finish rousseff's term, which lasts through 2018. His center-right pmdb party ends 13 years in power by the left-wing workers ' party. However, temer's approval rating is as bad as rousseff's, and the pmdb party is already beset by scandals. In fact, temer's anticorruption minister recently resigned. Rousseff is likely to appeal the impeachment vote in court, though npr reports she's unlikely to be successful. The senate voted 42-36 to allow her to run for office again, but rousseff has previously said she ' ll retire to her hometown if successfully impeached.",

        "summary": "For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity — art, tools, burials — found only after homo sapiens left africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in east africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per science news. Researchers previously believed the early stone age marked by large, primitive tools ( hand axes and cleavers ) made way for the middle stone age and its smaller tools ( spearpoints and blades ) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in kenya's olorgesailie basin show hominin groups — it's not clear which species is responsible — had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \" we see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes, \" researcher rick potts tells npr. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \" prepared and retouched \" they suggest the middle stone age likely started even earlier. What drove it? microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of homo sapiens in africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the conversation. ( these stone tools are also making waves. )",

Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, upi reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher paul cziko tells the christian science monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \" this shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that, \" he says. \" evolution is a stepwise process.

They discovered the antifreeze proteins ' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. \" we discovered what",
            "Scientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the antarctic region. Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. Notothenioids own the waters circling antarctica known as the southern ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for"

Looking past the hurricanes ' impact, the job market and economy generally look healthy, per the ap.

With the latest arrests, seven people have thus far been detained for having a possible link to the attack, the washington post reports, though bouhlel's ex-wife was released sunday. As authorities in france investigate the third major terror attack in that country in 18 months, additional details have emerged. French prime minister manuel valls tells a french newspaper, \" we now know that the killer was radicalized very quickly. \" the los angeles times reports bouhlel started frequenting a mosque just three months ago; prior to that, acquaintances say he did things that don't jibe with muslim codes, like smoke pot and wear shorts. Footage from security cameras in nice shows bouhlel driving along the promenade des anglais on the two days before the attack.

        "summary": "Help is finally beginning to reach hundreds of thousands of people struggling to survive in the aftermath of typhoon haiyan. The uss george washington and two us cruisers have arrived in the philippines and will distribute food, water, and medicine, as well as assist search and rescue operations in what the top us commander in the philippines tells the bbc will be an american aid effort on an unprecedented scale. Us planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the bbc. In other developments: supplies from the us and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \" the major challenge is logistics, \" a european commission spokesman tells the la times. \" with all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various philippine authorities — military, civilian structures, the philippine red cross — trying to distribute aid to so many communities... Obviously there are bottlenecks. \" lawlessness in the devastated city of tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the guardian finds. A red cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from california is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, nbc finds. The volunteer surgeons — working by flashlight in tanawan's ruined town hall — believe the region will need help for months. \" i don't know when or how we are going to be able to leave, \" one doctor says. \" this is just the beginning of a wave of misery. \" usa today has more on that front: the few doctors in manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients — and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration. And the new york times looks at a hospital in tacloban that has no power, where victims lay waiting for care. Food, water, and medical supplies are short; one patient interviewed by the times says he has not received painkillers, antibiotics,",

What's more, the discovery appears to further undermine the unraveling story of inventor peter madsen, who has been accused of killing her. Divers in koge bay found two bags, one with wall's remaining body parts — her torso had previously washed up — and another containing her clothes and a knife, per cnn. The bags had been weighted down with pieces of metal. The 30-year-old was last seen alive on aug. 10 when she boarded madsen's submarine. Madsen, whose story has changed, maintains that wall died accidentally when the sub's heavy metal hatch struck her in the head. However, authorities say an autopsy shows no such damage to wall's head, reports the bbc. Madsen, 46, remains imprisoned as the investigation continues. He has admitted to disposing of wall's body at sea, but says he did so in a panic because he blamed himself for losing his grip on the hatch. Prosecutors, however, paint a much darker picture. They point to disturbing videos found on madsen's computer showing the torture and decapitation of women and to a post-mortem examination that revealed knife wounds to wall's genitals and rib cage \" around or shortly after her death. \" authorities say they hope the new evidence will help them determine a cause of death.",

The suspect is 16-year-old alex hribal, and he has been charged as an adult with four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault. The motive remains unclear, but the ap says police are investigating reports of a threatening phone call between hribal and another student last night. It wasn't clear which of the two made the call. The accounts of exactly what happened at franklin regional high school in murrysville are still unfolding, but authorities say assistant principal sam king and a security guard at the school tackled and subdued the attacker in a hallway. Some other details emerging: the attack began in a classroom when hribal pulled out two 8-inch kitchen knives and began slashing students, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. He reportedly followed them as they fled into the hallway and stabbed others as he ran. During the assault, the attacker \" was very quiet, \" student mia meixner tells cnn. \" he just was kind of doing it. And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around just stabbing whoever was in his way. \" a doctor at a nearby hospital said a female student with \" an amazing amount of composure \" likely saved the life of one of the more seriously injured male students by applying pressure to his wounds. That appears to be junior gracie evans, who recounts to the pittsburgh newspaper: \" my friend was on his stomach, and the other kid who was severely injured was told to sit up. I knew that wasn't right. I said to a few students, we need pressure on this wound, and they gave me some paper towels, and i held pressure on that wound for about 10 minutes. \" authorities say 22 people were stabbed or slashed, all but one of them students, and two more students suffered other injuries in the chaos.",

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: mark joseph stern writes for slate that ginsburg's comments have been called \" explosive, unprecedented, and unethical, \" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \" dangerous \" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \" good name \" and \" sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about trump as she possibly can. \" ginsburg \" abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests, \" he writes. \" it is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a president trump. \" his entire take here. The new york times editorial board notes that ginsburg has done nothing illegal — but it's sort of siding with trump on this one. The paper points out that antonin scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \" baffling \" that ginsburg would stoop to his level and \" call her own commitment to impartiality into question, \" adding that dc already has enough partisan issues \" without the spectacle of a supreme court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit. \" the washington post adds that not only were ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the times that her \" off-the-cuff \" statements were \" inappropriate \" and probably best never spoken. \" politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts, \" the editorial board writes, citing the code of conduct for united states judges'section on refraining from political activity. \" [ her comments ] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system. \" donald trump himself addressed ginsburg",

        "summary": "What at first appeared to be a tragic accident is now labeled a \" coldhearted scheme. \" two children, ages 8 and 13, died on april 9, 2015, when the car their father was driving sped off a los angeles wharf and sank. Ali elmezayen, whose window was open, quickly emerged, followed by his domestic partner, rabab diab, but their severely autistic children, strapped in the back seat of the 1998 honda civic, were pronounced dead once divers freed them. Prosecutors now say it was a double murder planned by elmezayen, 44, for more than two years, per the washington post. In 2012 and 2013, elmezayen allegedly purchased several accidental death policies providing more than $ 6 million in coverage for his family, costing him 20 % of his annual salary, which was less than $ 30,000, per a doj release. Prosecutors say he even confirmed that claims wouldn't be investigated after two years. The crash allegedly came two years and 12 days after the last policy was bought, per the ap. \" the alleged conduct shocks the conscience, \" says us attorney nick hanna. The problem is that the evidence may not prove murder. Elmezayen, who initially speculated about an \" evil inside of me that pushed me to go, \" later said the car's brakes failed, and saltwater corrosion has made it difficult to determine their condition at the time of the crash, per the ap. Citing insufficient evidence of murder, the los angeles county district attorney's office has instead charged elmezayen with mail fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft, alleging he posed as diab in interactions with insurance companies. Held without bail, elmezayen faces up to 20 years in prison for each fraud count if convicted. ( cops say a mom's \" moment of frustration \" led to her toddler's death. )",

Reporting on their find in the journal of mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on mount dako, on indonesia's sulawesi island: it's a long-faced carnivorous creature with \" extremely large ears ( ~21 % of head and body length ) [ and ] very long urogenital hairs \" — the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author kevin rowe tells mashable australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though \" it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long... Hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs. \" among its other features: rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. \" it probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up. \" ( in line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew. ) knoe reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 ( here's another of the team's finds ), and recalls the moment the rat was found — twice. Rowe, of museum victoria, and lsu museum of natural science curator of mammals jake esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, \" came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well. \" the rodent was given the name hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the age translates from the greek as \" ' hyo ' meaning hog, ' rhino ' meaning nose and ' mys ' meaning rat. \" ( another unusual animal-related find: a mysterious, giant, jellylike \" thing. \" )",

        "summary": "Camille cosby refused to answer dozens of questions about her famous husband during two days of deposition back in february, usa today reports. According to abc news, a transcript of the deposition released friday shows camille cited \" spousal privilege \" in her refusal to answer questions more than a dozen times alone. Other times she refused without giving a reason or just left the room, nbc news reports. The deposition was part of a defamation suit against bill cosby brought by seven women who accused him of sexual assault and say they were branded liars in response. Bill has countersued them for defamation, as well. The cosbys ' legal team had tried to get camille out of the deposition, but a federal judge insisted. Among the questions camille refused to answer: what honesty means, if bill \" acted with a lack of integrity, \" if it is \" dishonest \" or \" deceitful \" to give quaaludes to someone in order to have sex with them, if bill used his status to \" manipulate young women, and if bill \" betrayed the sanctity of [ her ] marital home. \" she did say she had no idea bill allegedly gave drugs to women and had sex with them throughout their 52 years of marriage. Abc describes the eights hours total of deposition — during which camille was read parts of a 2005 deposition in which bill talked about having sex with one of his accusers in the 1970s — as \" combative. \"",

But judges said the 10-year statute of limitations for \" unlawful detention \" had expired, since madrigal became an adult in 1987 and only brought the complaint in 2012, per the guardian. \" i didn't know about any of that in 1987, \" says madrigal. \" but vela's lawyer brought up the statute of limitations again and again during the trial — right from the start. \" and madrigal isn't alone: thousands of similar cases have been reported, since general franco's fascist regime allowed doctors to take newborns from \" left-wing \" mothers and give them to pro-franco families, per the ap. Priests and nuns made lists of parents seeking children while doctors allegedly lied to mothers about what became of their kids. Even post-franco, spaniards often kept quiet in a society that respected the roman catholic church and embraced a so-called \" pact of forgetting \" during the 1970s transition to democracy. But with the european parliament pressing spain to take action, this drama appears far from over — except for vela, who ducked a prison sentence that prosecutors wanted to last for 11 years.",

In a case filed in 1999, croatia had claimed serbia committed genocide, including during a three-month occupation in vukovar, during the balkan wars from 1991 to 1995. Serbia countered in 2010, alleging that croatia expelled 200,000 serbs, the bbc reports. Judge peter tomka said both countries were guilty of many crimes, but ruled the intent to commit genocide was not proven in the serbian case, while the charge against croatia was \" dismissed in its entirety. \" tens of thousands of ethnic croats were displaced when the croatian town of vukovar was occupied by serbs in 1991. Some 260 men were detained and killed. The croatian military then bombarded ethnic serbs in krajina in 1995, displacing 200,000, the bbc notes. The decision \" will put an end to both sides ' fight to prove who the worst criminal is, \" serbia's foreign minister said ahead of the decision. Both sides said they would accept the verdict.

        "summary": "The 200-year-old buddhist monk found still seated in the lotus position is not dead, but is rather in a rare spiritual state known as tukdam, buddhism experts suggest. Dr. Barry kerzin, a famous fellow monk who is also a physician to the dalai lama, tells the siberian times that monks in this state go into \" very deep meditation \" and, if they can stay in such a state for more than three weeks, their bodies shrink until all that remains are \" hair, nails, and clothes, \" he says. \" usually in this case, people who live next to the monk see a rainbow that glows in the sky for several days. This means that he has found a ' rainbow body.'this is the highest state close to the state of buddha, \" and someone who remains in the state can even become a buddha, he says. He adds that over the past five decades, there have been 40 such cases in india. Ganhugiyn purevbata, founder and professor at the mongolian institute of buddhist art at ulaanbaatar buddhist university, agrees: the monk \" is sitting in the lotus position vajra, the left hand is opened, and the right hand symbolizes of the preaching sutra, \" he says. \" this is a sign that the lama is not dead, but is in a very deep meditation according to the ancient tradition of buddhist lamas. \" but scientists have a different take, theorizing that the cold weather in mongolia, where the monk was found, helped preserve him, the bbc reports. And the washington post notes that such \" accidental mummies \" have been discovered in freezing climates before, like a 9,000-year-old mummified bison in siberia. Meanwhile, there is drama of a less spiritual type unfolding: police say a man stole the monk from a cave in another part of the country and was planning to sell him on the black market, but police learned of the plot, recovered the monk, and arrested the man for smuggling.

Most people who saw the speech were thrilled ( or appalled ) that he called for universal health savings accounts beginning at birth. This is a fascinating idea that would merit some deeper analysis. Unfortunately, he doesn't mention it in his book, even though he devotes a chapter to health care. Instead, his writing offers up some off-the-cuff emotional reactions to problems he has experienced. They are not well thought through and i expect he would write something very different if he had an opportunity to dig a little deeper. Let me start that rethinking here.

        "summary": "It's the dawn of a new, uncomfortable day for dr. Walter palmer, the minnesota dentist who achieved infamy yesterday when it was revealed he was the hunter who felled the beloved lion cecil in zimbabwe. The new york times and washington post today have more on how palmer and his guides lured the 13-year-old lion out of his sanctuary in hwange national park: according to the chair of the non-governmental zimbabwe conservation task force, palmer's party sighted the lion at night using a spotlight, and affixed a dead animal to their car to lead cecil from the reserve into unprotected territory. It claims the men scented an area about three-tenths of a mile from the park. Cecil was first injured by a shot from palmer's crossbow, then killed nearly two days later by palmer, via gun. Chair johnny rodrigues alleges that \" the hunters then found that the dead lion was wearing a [ gps ] tracking collar, which they unsuccessfully tried to hide. \" cecil was skinned and beheaded, and his body \" left to rot in the sun, \" as the times puts it. Rodrigues yesterday said the head has been tracked down and impounded as evidence, reports the guardian. The bbc adds that it's thought cecil was killed july 1, though his corpse wasn't found until days later. Zimbabwe national parks and wildlife authority and the safari operators association say \" ongoing investigations to date suggest that the killing of the lion was illegal since the land owner was not allocated a lion on his hunting quota for 2015. Therefore, all persons implicated in this case are due to appear in court facing poaching charges. \" professional hunter theo bronkhorst and landowner honest ndlovu accompanied palmer and are making that court appearance today; the poaching charges carry up to 15 years. A parks and wildlife rep told the post professional hunters and landowners are usually the first to be charged in these instances. Palmer is reportedly being sought in connection with the case. Here's what palmer has to say.",

        "summary": "An operation in london has given 9-year-old kieran sorkin a pair of ears — made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \" i want people to stop asking me questions, \" he told the bbc. \" i'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones. \" so surgeons traced an outline of kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \" if you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life, \" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the guardian reports. Every year about 100 british newborns lack one or both ears ( it's called microtia ), and the hospital kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \" wow! \" and giggled — which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

Friends reported the vessel missing on june 14, and the fact that its emergency beacon was never activated gave rescuers hope. But the picture that's forming of the nina's last known movements sounds less promising. A woman aboard the 85-year-old vessel called a new zealand meteorologist via satellite phone on june 3, asking him, \" the weather's turned nasty, how do we get away from it? \" they spoke briefly, with bob mcdavitt advising the group to sail south. The following day he received the following text: \" any update 4 nina?... Evi. \" after that, the boat vanished, with two aerial searches turning up nothing.

        "summary": "Like earthquakes can unleash tsunamis, strong winds and the california wildfires apparently set loose another type of natural disaster: fire tornadoes. And the san francisco chronicle says the fire-filled tornadoes that hit santa rosa last week, driven by nearly 80mph winds, wreaked major havoc, tossing cars, pulling trees out of the ground, and ripping the roofs off of houses. \" i've been in this business 30 years and it's the worst i've seen, \" scott upton, a chief for the california department of forestry and fire protection, says of the tornadoes created during the tubbs fire. The chronicle explains the science behind the tornado formation: as powerful winds drive the fire's flames into neighborhoods, the heat rises and draws those gusts up with it, creating the tornado, or \" fire whirl, \" a vortex of hot and cool air capable of mass destruction. This type of event, also referred to as a \" fire devil, \" can be so strong it's capable of lifting an entire home in the air; the paper notes one such incident that took place in 1926. The location of the neighborhoods affected by the tubbs fire also exacerbated things: the wind sped up as it pushed the fire through a valley and toward residences, creating what ken pimlott, the head of calfire, calls \" a very different kind of fire. \" it was \" almost horizontal, \" he says. \" when it hit those homes, it was like a blowtorch. \" the press democrat details the tubbs fire's 12-mile \" deadly march \" from its point of origin in calistoga to santa rosa. Curious to know what one of these frightening flame-storms looks like without getting too close? mashable features a video, in which firefighters filmed a recent fire tornado raging through central portugal.

' ( photo: kerry brown ) la la land and diversity were major winners in tuesday's oscar nominations, but not everyone woke up to an avalanche of excited texts. Among the most surprising omissions from this year's crop: silence. Despite its muted box office ( $ 5.2 million since late december ) and shutout at the golden globes, we still figured martin scorsese's passion project might have a shot with the academy,",
            "The oscars certainly knows how to keep us on our toes. While movies like la la land and manchester by the sea are up for awards in several categories, as expected, this year's academy award nominations were full of many notable snubs and surprises. While actors taraji p. Henson, amy adams and hugh grant were overlooked, viggo mortensen managed to snag a spot in the best actor category. And at yet another awards show, finding dory couldn't make it despite its pledge to \"just keep swimming. \" keep reading for a breakdown of the biggest shocks from this morning's announcement leading up to the biggest night in films. Snub:",
            "Story highlights there was more diversity this year #oscarslesswhite became a popular hashtag ( cnn ) is it time for a new hashtag? this year's oscar nominations have thrust the conversation about diversity back into the limelight, but this time in a more positive context. Seven actors of color were nominated tuesday -- denzel washington and viola davis for \" fences, \" mahershala ali and naomie harris for \" moonlight, \" ruth negga for \" loving, \" dev patel for \" lion \" and octavia spencer for \" hidden figures. \" davis is now a three-time oscar nominee, a first for an african american woman.",
            "Nominations for the 89th academy awards were announced this morning in l.a., and if you are la la land, moonlight's mahershala ali or elle's isabelle huppert, you're probably feeling a mountain high — just like most of the hollywood film industry now attending the sundance film festival. However, for others including silence director martin scorsese, hidden figures star taraji p. Henson and arrival's amy adams, their oscars hopes just got buried. Here are some of the most significant people and projects snubbed this year for the oscars, which will be held february 26 on abc and hosted by jimmy kimmel. Tell us who you think we might have missed. Martin scorsese –"

Everything else is changing quickly. The coast guard spoke of a mile-long oil slick at the site but now says it can't find evidence of any oil in the water. Early reports said the platform wasn't producing any oil or gas, but louisiana governor bobby jindal now says it had seven active wells. The coast guard hasn't confirmed reports that crew members were able to shut them down before bailing. The platform, owned by houston's mariner energy, was producing 59,000 gallons of oil and 900,000 cubic feet of gas per day and could store 4,200 gallons of oil, reports the ap, citing federal figures. If there is a spill of some sort, the relatively shallow depth of 340 feet should make cleanup easier. More coverage in the times-picayune and usa today.",

Alexis did not mention the incident on the security questionnaire he filled out three years later, but the navy's office of personnel management learned about it after doing a fingerprint check. He was asked about it and claimed all he did was deflate a man's tires. In reality, he shot out the man's tires, according to the police report filed in seattle. Alexis said he did not disclose the incident because the charge was dismissed and his lawyer had told him it would be wiped from his record. Investigators did not interview anyone else about the incident, the washington post reports, and seattle police refused to provide the records related to the incident, according to the personnel office. So the navy cleared alexis in march 2008 based on what it knew. ( the lat notes the only red flag was his credit history. ) the full picture of the 2004 incident didn't emerge until after the navy yard shootings, says a senior navy official. Now, the secretary of the navy has recommended to defense secretary chuck hagel that security reviews in the future include all police reports — even those that did not result in charges, the new york times reports.",

The recommendation, disclosed monday, came as the navy completed a detailed review of the military career of aaron alexis, the gunman who was killed at the washington navy yard after last week's shooting rampage. The review, ordered by navy secretary ray mabus, included an assessment of whether events in mr. Alexis's military career should have raised alerts about his violent potential. In 2004, three years before enlisting as a navy reservist, mr. Alexis brandished a.45-caliber pistol and fired at the tires of a construction worker's car.

Alexis out of the navy with a less-than-honorable discharge because the police declined to pursue a case and it was not entered into his military file, navy officials said.

        "summary": "Certain heartburn drugs have already been linked to heath woes including heart disease and kidney disease. Now a study in jama neurology says those drugs — proton-pump inhibitors like prilosec, prevacid, and nexium — may also boost the chance of dementia, upi reports. Analyzing a german health insurer's data on nearly 74,000 customers aged 75 and up from 2004 to 2011, researchers found a 44 % higher dementia risk among \" ppi \" users. The finding also coincides with research showing that mice on ppis had higher amyloid plaque levels in their brains, which has been linked to dementia. So what to do, when roughly 15 million americans use prescription ppis and other patients take over-the-counter versions? for now, nothing. More clinical trials are needed to analyze the possible ppi-dementia link, senior study author britta haenisch tells cbs news. For one thing, the jama neurology study didn't account for lifestyle and diet, which can influence dementia risk. But, she adds, \" clinicians should follow guidelines for ppi prescription, to avoid overprescribing ppis and inappropriate use. \" up to 70 % of ppi prescriptions may be needless reactions to minor cases of acid reflux or heartburn, per a recent study. Big picture: ppis are being seen in a whole new light. \" the teaching for many years was that these drugs were quite safe, \" a gastroenterologist tells npr. \" but there is data that's emerging that suggests ppis may not be as safe as we think they are. \" ( turns out vegetable oils may cause dementia when heated. )",

Here are seven things you need to know: with trump criticizing the cia — rather than russia — in the wake of the report, the new york times reports he's opening an \" extraordinary breach \" between himself and the national security establishment he's bound to need during his presidency. While mostly at a loss, michael tomasky at the daily beast has a few pieces of advice for what democrats should do next: \" demand the release of the information. Demand a real investigation... The media needs to get the message that conservatives aren't the only people who get pissed off. \" in a \" no-win situation for the gop, \" some republicans in congress want to investigate russia's involvement in the election against trump's wishes. The washington post has four ways they could take on russia, with or without the president-elect. Harry reid is calling for the resignation of fbi director james comey, who he compares to j. Edgar hoover and accuses of covering up information about russia's activities to get trump elected, the guardian reports. Pamela kruger at fortune points out that trump did saturday what he normally does when faced with a major negative story: spend the morning tweeting about something completely unrelated; celebrity apprentice, in this case. Worried trump will ignore russian threats to us democracy when he takes office, quartz reports president obama is \" racing against the clock \" to get a full report on russia's involvement in us affairs before he steps down in six weeks. Meanwhile, john mccain says the close relationship between exxon ceo rex tillerson — trump's likely secretary of state — and vladimir putin \" a matter of concern, \" the hill reports. With democrats needing only three gop senators to vote against tillerson, a mccain aide says a confirmation is unlikely. \" putin is a thug, bully, and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying, \" mccain says.",

There's a waiting list at new york's museum of modern art's shop for lagerfeld's karlbox, a collection of colored pencils, markers, paintbrushes and other artsy doodads, reports quartz. But the breathtaking part is the $ 3,000 price tag ( sharpeners included ). Some 2,500 of the limited-edition sets made by faber-castell sold out shortly after going on sale online last month, per the hollywood reporter. \" what amuses me while drawing is the fact to draw, \" lagerfeld, 83, says ponderously on the karlbox website. \" to me drawing is like breathing and writing. These are things that almost relax me. \" although the collection is tagged \" colours in black, \" the tools come in every color of the rainbow. Could pencils costing roughly $ 9 each possibly be worth it? the reviews aren't in, though the design gets raves. Vogue hails the set as \" über-chic, \" while forbes notes the \" elegant \" black wood box \" resembles a chinese wedding cabinet. \" lagerfield said he's used faber-castell pencils since he was a kid and began sketching his own designs. \" i wanted to become an illustrator, so i studied every book of costume design from any kind of period, \" says the chanel impresario, per quartz.

New guidelines released by archbishop charles chaput last friday say divorced couples who have remarried must permanently abstain from sex, instead living like \" brother and sister, \" the guardian reports.

But divorcees aren't the only ones chaput wants to see living without sex. People in same-sex relationships and straight couples who aren't married must also go sexless. Fortunately, the new guidelines explain that anyone can be in a successful heterosexual marriage with kids even with \" some degree of same-sex attraction. \" the guidelines, which come from one of the most conservative catholic leaders in the us, also recommend priests try to break up couples who aren't interested in getting married, which shows they're \" lacking in maturity, \" and claims same-sex relationships will \" produce moral confusion in the community. \" anyone going against the guidelines should not receive holy communion and should be barred from positions of responsibility within the church.

In 74 % of the 101 samples purchased anonymously from two popular websites, the total bacteria count was significantly higher than the level generally considered safe. Bacteria found included e.

Breast milk can be sold or donated on dozens of websites, and while some suppliers hand off the milk in person, others ship it. Problems during collection ( improper hand-washing, dirty breast pumps or containers ), improper storage ( 19 % of the samples in the study were not cooled ), and long shipping times ( some of the samples took as long as six days to arrive ) likely contributed to the health hazards. Another potential problem: researchers say they are \" a little suspicious of some of the milk, \" and are now working to determine if it's authentic breast milk, usa today reports. In response to the study, at least one site that sells milk will stop allowing mothers to purchase from other mothers; donors will instead sell to a company that processes breast milk.",

            "\"we worried at first, \" she said. \"we wanted to be mindful that the donors were healthy, but there was never a moment when we were afraid. We've had the milk of about 30 women and have never had a problem. \" women who do not wish to rely on an informal network may turn to breast milk banks, which store and sell breast milk from donors. Thirteen banks in the united states and canada follow voluntary guidelines set up by the human milk banking association of north america, which require that donors and donations be screened, and that milk be pasteurized. But milk banks give priority to premature infants with significant medical complications, and the milk is available only by prescription. A bank will supply milk by prescription to healthy infants, but only if sufficient supplies are available — and they rarely are. The association's banks distributed 2.15 million ounces in 2011, but the current annual need is 9 million ounces. Even when it is available, milk from banks is expensive, as much as $ 6 an ounce, and the average intake of a 1-month-old is about 25 ounces a day",

        "summary": "Diagnosing alzheimer's is a guessing game — and many doctors are guessing wrong, according to early results from a new study presented wednesday in london. The washington post reports doctors tested 4,000 medicare patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and discovered many of them definitively do not have alzheimer's. Using pet scans, the study revealed only 54.3 % of mild cognitive impairment patients and 70.5 % of dementia patients had brains containing amyloid plaques. These plaques can be a sign of alzheimer's. The patients who had them may or may not have alzheimer's; the remaining percentage definitely don't have the disease. \" to get that right diagnosis, that's really important, \" one woman, whose alzheimer's diagnosis was ruled out by a pet scan, tells the ap. The findings show many people are potentially taking unnecessary alzheimer's medication, and doctors may want to change their treatment to something cheaper or more effective. Unfortunately, the only ways to test for amyloid plaques while a patient is alive are expensive pet scans, which aren't usually covered by insurance, or invasive spinal taps. Or are they? another study presented at the same london conference revealed a new blood test that could potentially reveal the plaques, new scientist reports. The tests are easy and cheap enough that doctors could administer them to patients during regular checkups. Since plaques start showing up 15 to 20 years before alzheimer's symptoms, patients could use the results to change certain lifestyle habits to decrease their risk.

Mary anne, abby, and liddy huntsman are the twentysomething daughters of presidential candidate jon huntsman jr., which means that the sisters — who've become celebrities over the past few months for tweeting snarky updates from the campaign trail at @jon2012girls — are sort of unofficially running for first daughters. Which makes this technically a campaign stop, even though there are no voters here and we're in a banquet room that smells like old rice. As a stylist feathered mary anne's hair with a curling iron, liddy cued up \" hold on \" by wilson phillips on her iphone. Lately they've been playing this song to get psyched up before watching their dad debate. Despite all the free media attention his daughters have garnered on his behalf, as of this writing huntsman remains a margin-of-error candidate. So decide for yourself if their rallying cry of hold on for one more day is touching or painfully ironic. Still — when they break into perfect three-part harmony, they totally crush it.

The huntsman daughters'three-headed social-media presence is a mischievous, seemingly unfiltered corrective to the stage-managed sneering of the campaign.
