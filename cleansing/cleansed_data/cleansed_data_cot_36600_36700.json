        "summary": "A texas man spent nearly two decades in prison — more than half of that time on death row — before being exonerated in 2010. But anthony graves didn't simply celebrate his freedom: he went after the prosecutor who put him behind bars, resulting in charles sebesta's disbarment by the state licensing board, reuters reports. In response to graves ' original january 2014 complaint, the texas state bar yanked sebesta's law license last june, declaring that he had taken part in \" prosecutorial misconduct, \" as the dallas morning news puts it. On monday, a panel appointed by the texas supreme court upheld that ruling. The state board of disciplinary appeals found that sebesta presented false testimony and hid evidence that could have helped free graves, who was wrongly convicted of setting a 1992 fire that killed six people. That misconduct included not revealing to graves'defense team that another man also convicted for the murders ( and eventually executed for them ) had confessed to sebesta that he acted alone. Sebesta also reportedly made false statements in court that scared graves ' alibi witness out of testifying. Sebesta had appealed on the grounds that disciplinary procedures against lawyers had been modified and would affect his disbarment, the texas tribune notes. Sebesta tells reuters that \" we presented the evidence we had and felt like it was sufficient. \" one of graves ' lawyers, however, sees it differently. \" [ the board ] found that charles sebesta's misconduct was so egregious that they characterized him as having ' unclean hands, ' \" he says. ( there were more exonerations in the us in 2015 than ever before. )",

Renaud prudhomme, 56 — and weighing 260 pounds, per the local — was helped home from starter bar in clermont-ferrand last october after the drinking competition. Emergency services were called for prudhomme soon after; he was taken to a hospital, where he died the next day of \" a bronchial inhalation alcoholic coma, \" le figaro reports, per the huffington post. Bartender gilles crepin, 47, admitted he shouldn't have posted the shots record, which perhaps pushed prudhomme too far. A judge sentenced crepin this week and banned him from working in a bar for a year. Crepin's lawyer, renaud portejoie, says he ' ll appeal, calling it \" a decision guided by emotion and the unconscious desire to set an example. \" portejoie argued the brunt of the blame was on the victim's daughter, who encouraged her dad to beat the record, though he had existing respiratory and alcohol abuse problems, unbeknownst to crepin. \" we can't ask every customer who buys alcohol to present their medical certificates, \" portejoie says. A lawyer for prudhomme's daughter says his client wasn't at the bar at the time of the competition and is \" relieved by this decision. \" he adds, \" we want to remind some professionals that it is illegal to serve alcohol to clients that are in an advanced state of inebriation. \" ( forget 56 shots: more than one or two drinks daily can be dangerous. )",

University of arizona researcher charles gerba's team placed a harmless virus with similar properties to the stomach flu-causing norovirus on surfaces like doorknobs and tabletops and found that 40 % to 60 % of people in the same building had the virus on their hands within a few hours, cbs reports. The virus could also be found on surfaces throughout the building and was especially prevalent in break rooms. \" we actually put a virus on a push plate in an office building of 80 people, had three entrances, and within four hours it ended up on over half the people's hands, and it ended up on over half the surfaces that people touched in that building, \" gerba told the 54th interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy earlier this week, reports the washington post. Norovirus is behind 20 million illnesses in the us every year, often through infections caused by people touching contaminated surfaces and then their faces, but the researchers say hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes can reduce virus spread by up to 99 %.

        "summary": "The wall street journal has just complicated jeff sessions ' explanation about his conversations with the russian ambassador. The attorney general has acknowledged that he met at least twice with sergei kislyak during the campaign, but he says he did so in his capacity as a senator rather than as a surrogate of the trump camp. One of those conversations occurred at an event during the republican national convention, and the journal reports that sessions paid for his travel expenses to cleveland with money from his own re-election campaign fund — not from official legislative funds that would typically cover his trips as a member of the senate armed services panel. A spokesoman for sessions offered no comment on the convention expenses, but a general counsel at the nonpartisan campaign legal center spells out the inconsistency. \"if he was truly there solely as a member of the armed services committee, then he could've used his legislative account, \" says larry noble. At the time of the convention, sessions had been chairman of trump's national security advisory committee for about four months. Sessions, meanwhile, appeared on fox news thursday night and told tucker carlson that the controversy over his meetings with kislyak has been \" hyped beyond reason. \" at the convention, for example, he said he spoke with about 50 ambassadors and characterized them as informal chats. Aides say they don't recall sessions talking about the campaign with kislyak at the event, but they also say the room was so loud they can't be positive, per the journal.

Dubbed the \" first lady of bourbon, \" bulleit says she has kept mum at work for a decade since her family rejected her after she came out to them, forbes reports. \" one is not respecting personal family business by staying silent when people's civil rights are at stake, \" she writes in a series of facebook posts. The 43-year-old says the sacking happened one month after she brought her decade-long partner, cher, to thanksgiving — uninvited. \" we were promptly uninvited via text from the following core family christmas, \" she writes. The headdress-wearing heiress and brand ambassador for bulleit frontier whiskey — the world's largest liquor supplier — then recounts a series of slights. She and cher \" were erased and no one lifted a finger, \" she writes. She doesn't accuse bulleit frontier whiskey's corporate owner, diageo, of explicit homophobia itself, but she faults bosses there for failing to intervene when her family ostracized her. \" i should never have been put in a position to hide my family's homophobia or my company's complacency in order to keep my job, \" she writes. Diageo has repeatedly been named as a \" best place to work for lgbt equality, \" the san francisco gate notes. The company denies discrimination, saying it was a contract dispute that led to hollis bulleit's departure. \" we are very proud of our long track record of work, through many of our brands, to support the lgbt community, \" diageo says in a statement. ( an april court ruling was a \" game changer \" for lgbt workplace rights. )",

The testing dates haven't been revealed, officials briefed on a \" recent \" homeland security ig report say, but abc notes that homeland security chief jeh johnson was said to be so \" frustrated \" by the findings that he demanded a meeting last week at tsa headquarters. According to the tsa blog, the agency had a \" busy year \" in 2014, checking out more than 653 million passengers and finding more than 2,200 firearms. But red team members — once described by a tsa administrator as \" super terrorists \" familiar with every weakness — got around security in astounding numbers. One undercover agent set off a magnetization alarm but still got through with a fake explosive taped to his back, even after a follow-up pat-down. Meanwhile, a dhs statement says some vulnerabilities have been addressed: \" upon learning the initial findings, secretary johnson immediately directed tsa to implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place. \" ( tsa agents did find a mother lode of weapons, ammo, and drugs one woman tried to smuggle in cat litter. )",

The resolution, which complex notes was put together in conjunction with the law enforcement against prohibition group, offers up a laundry list of reasons why the so-called \" war on drugs \" is detrimental to society, including violence that's taken innocent lives, overcrowded prisons, overdoses, disease from unsanitary needles — and, perhaps most of all, because of its significant impact on minority groups. \" to people of color, the ' war on drugs ' has arguably been the single most devastating, dysfunctional social policy since slavery, \" the resolution reads. Besides the more humanitarian reasons, the group offers economic backup as well. \" huge sums of our national treasury are wasted on this failed public policy, \" the resolution states.

But mainly, \" it's a justice issue, \" says the pastor from massachusetts ' crawford memorial united methodist church who wrote the resolution. \" our drug war is creating more harm, more problems than it's solving, and i wanted people to be aware of that. \"",

            "Well, it looks like glenn beck wasn't just checking out the sights in israel last week, he was making plans. Beck had promised a \"big announcement \" on his radio show this morning and he certainly did not disappoint.

An angry crowd of african-americans gathered near 12th and clairmount streets in the early morning hours of july 23, 1967, after police raided an illegal after-hours club and made arrests. The crowd grew and a tense situation erupted in violence, gunshots, and flames.

Though lawmakers yesterday managed to arrive at an agreement on europe's bailout plan, the greek pm's chances of emerging on top after this evening's confidence vote are slim, the washington post notes. His socialist party holds 152 of parliament's 300 seats, but at least two members of his party have already vowed to vote against him; an independent lawmaker who previously said she would back him now says she ' ll abstain from voting, reports the wall street journal. If papandreou loses the vote, a caretaker government would likely step in, with elections following shortly; even if he wins, some socialists are calling for elections within a matter of months. Several have even indicated they ' ll only support papandreou tonight if doing so comes with the assurance that elections will be held in early 2013. But the journal suggests that papandreou's resignation is likely, and that a caretaker government could be headed by a former european central bank vp and economic adviser to papandreou, lucas papademos. An mit-educated economist currently at harvard, his financial credentials would likely meet with the approval of european leaders and the markets, the journal adds.",

But new research out of the university of bristol suggests that to keep your good looks through others ' eyes, it may be necessary to cut yourself off at one drink, livescience says. The study published in alcohol and alcoholism used an admittedly small sample size: 40 students who volunteered to throw a few back for science. But researchers found that participants who imbibed just one glass of wine were perceived to be more attractive by a separate group of raters than their previously sober selves or after they had had two drinks. Researchers took a photo of each participant before drinking, after one drink, and after two drinks ( each subject was told to make a \" neutral facial expression \" in all three pictures ). Scientists then asked the rating group to view each subject's sober photo first next to the one-drink photo, then next to the two-drink photo. In the former case, the one-drink photo was rated more attractive than the sober representation, while in the latter, the one-drink photo still won out over the two-drink pic. Researchers aren't sure why, but they speculate it could come down to pupil dilation ( which they suggest makes a subject more appealing ), the slight muscle relaxation that results from just one drink, or the bit of \" rosiness \" that occurs when you're tipsy but not necessarily drunk. \" that obviously doesn't mean that alcohol is healthy, \" the study's lead researcher says. \" what it means is that alcohol is sort of hijacking that mechanism, or promoting the aspects of facial features that we regard as attractive for other reasons. \" ( down more than two drinks a day and you might up your stroke risk. )",

The denver post in october 2013 reported the grand jury's charges didn't accuse the ramseys of murdering their daughter, but instead of putting her in a situation that led to her death; former boulder county district attorney alex hunter decided not to sign off on the grand jury's recommendation. The second big-name guest is da stan garnett, who will address this week's news that the state plans to conduct new dna tests on the underwear and long johns the 6-year-old was wearing when she was killed. A daily camera/9news investigation suggested that former da mary lacy erred when she exonerated members of the ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier dna tests. Abc news reports 20/20 last month obtained those test results, and noted that lacy referenced a \" match of male dna on two separate items of clothing, \" though \" match \" was never used in the lab notes. In fact, the lab said the dna \" should not be considered a single source profile. \" garnett says he doesn't expect \" any dramatic developments \" from the new testing. He's \" always felt that the ramsey case is not really a dna case, \" but authorities \" want to make sure. \"",

While officers detained the 25-year-old, her brother, cameron beck, showed up looking for her, and in his backpack deputies found a \" cut pen with a crystal substance on it \" that tested positive for methamphetamine, reports opposing views via the montgomery county police reporter. So the siblings were carted off to jail, where beck, 26, asked if his sister could be charged instead of him. Deputies refused and put them in adjoining cells — where the siblings were later seen \" kissing each other on the lips through the bars. \" deputies say they separated ellet from her brother and asked about their relationship. She and beck share the same mother, ellet said, but have different fathers, and started a letter-writing relationship when he served prison time. Now they were lovers and liked to have sex in the same motel room as her 2-year-old twins, ellet admitted, separated by only a partition, or in the bathroom. So ellet and beck were charged with prohibited sexual behavior and possession of a controlled substance, and kept in jail.

        "summary": "Macklemore may have put in his 10,000 hours, but maybe the rest of us shouldn't bother — or at least some of us. A new paper disputes the significance of practice over talent, claiming that although practice is important to master a skill ( a theory interpreted and defended by author malcolm gladwell ), it may not be as critical as previously thought, reports the new york times. The paper, which appears in the current issue of the psychological science journal, is a meta-analysis based on 88 studies, and it downplays the results of a 1993 study of musicians by k. Anders ericsson, in which practice time was said to account for almost 80 % of the difference between \"elite performers and committed amateurs. \" the paper claims that practice in certain areas ( e.g., music, sports, chess ) only explains about 18 % to 26 % of that difference in performance — and that the percentage drops to as low as 4 % in areas such as academics. The \"practice makes perfect \" postulation and gladwell's interpretation of it have both been criticized before. One of the new arguments is that success is \"domain dependent \" — meaning deliberate practice ( instruction in which a student's skill set is pushed as hard as possible ) is only a predictor of success in stable fields where the rules don't change much, like in tennis or chess, explains business insider, citing the work of author frans johansson. In more volatile fields such as entrepreneurship and popular music, the effect of practice is significantly less — business insider uses the example of the sex pistols, who became incredibly successful despite sid vicious having little skill on the bass guitar. It doesn't look like the debate will end anytime soon: ericsson himself tells the times that the new study doesn't concentrate on deliberate practice like his study did. \"if you throw all these kinds of practice [ like playing sports for fun ] into one big soup, of course you are going to reduce the effect of deliberate practice, \" he says.",

Andy holt recently got a \" photo enforcement citation \" after being caught on one of the cameras, and in a video that's gotten more than 400,000 facebook views since he posted it wednesday, he set the ticket on fire. \" what to do if you get one? throw it in the trash. Personally, i prefer to burn mine, \" holt says in an accompanying blog post. Holt's argument is that the tickets are issued \" to increase revenue, not to increase safety, \" that it's not a real citation if it's not issued by a police officer in person, and that the citations aren't legally valid since the person being ticketed wasn't actually convicted of an offense. In the video and follow-up facebook posts, he adds that because ticketed drivers weren't actually convicted of anything, they aren't legally obligated to pay the penalty, and that if they don't pay, nothing bad will happen to their credit score, car insurance rates, or driving record. ( holt, the news sentinel notes, sponsored a recently-passed bill that requires traffic camera tickets to include a notice saying just that. ) so how does the local police chief feel about all this? \" no one likes to be caught violating traffic offenses, regardless of how they are caught, but they have a legal obligation to properly address it, \" he says, adding that since the citations are considered a civil penalty, non-payment could result in the same collection efforts that come with any unpaid debt. Another tennessee lawmaker tells wate he suspects that if an unpaid ticket were to go to collections, it would indeed impact a person's credit score.",

But harvesting is a risky job that doesn't pay much compared to the fungus ' value on the open market, al jazeera reports. Why risky? not only are the mountain paths steep and narrow, killing the occasional harvester, but the fungus is worth enough to attract crime. Six men were given life sentences in 2011 for killing harvesters, the bbc reports, and the himalayan times reports that thieves stormed a harvesters'tent on friday and stole more than $ 410,000 worth of fungus. Called yarsagumba, the fungus has been popular for more than 500 years, but nepal's decision in 2001 to legalize its collection, use, and sale may have led to ecologically destructive over-harvesting. Because the fungus grows inside of caterpillars, heavy collection ( 60,000 are now harvesting the nation's midwestern region ) could destroy caterpillar populations and allow moths and larvae to proliferate, nature reports. On the plus side, harvesters make decent money for a couple of weeks ' work, and buyers reportedly enjoy the benefits. \" it regulates the normal functioning of various parts of the body and strengthens the immune and circulatory system, \" says a nepalese professor. \" it has traditionally been used for impotence, backache, and to increase sperm and blood production. \" ( for more on fungus, read about north korea's claim to a new sports drink. )",

Some related coverage: for a nuts-and-bolts explainer on the vote and why it's creating such \" vast uncertainty \" in europe, see usa today. Prime minister david cameron called the referendum after winning concessions at an eu summit last week, and the ap breaks down some related questions. Cameron wants brits to stay in the eu, but london mayor boris johnson, a fellow conservative, is pushing for a \" leave \" vote. The mayor thinks fears related to an exit are exaggerated, and cameron mocked johnson's views in a speech monday. The telegraph has details. Johnson's opposition has caused the british pound to fall, reports the wall street journal. Also not sold on the idea of staying in the eu? the nation's top supermarkets, reports the guardian. Polls are close, and many brits are undecided, notes another primer on the \" insane \" debate, this one at slate. A british exit means \" uncharted waters, \" says an afp analysis.

His mother says he had been living with a type of dementia called cte, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy — which she believes was brought on by childhood football games, nbc news reports. Chernach played in a wisconsin-michigan pop warner youth football league, and his mother, debra pyka of wisconsin, says concussions he endured between 1997 and 2000 prompted his dementia. Now, she's suing pop warner — the biggest kids ' football organization in the us, the new york times reports — for $ 5 million. Her goal, she tells nbc, is to promote awareness of the dangers of kids'tackle football and to keep younger children from playing it.

        "summary": "If you think squeezing an hour of exercise in per day can't come close to making up for the other 23 hours when you're relatively sedentary — and so you don't bother at all — rethink that strategy. A study by cambridge university and the norwegian school of sports sciences published in the lancet journal finds that even if you're sitting in front of a computer monitor or watching soap operas during the 9-to-5, just one hour of physical activity could nix the increased death risk, per a press release. The findings support a university of leicester study done earlier this year that found regular exercise can fend off the detrimental effects of daylong sitting sessions, including increased risk of diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease. \" our message is a positive one: it is possible to reduce — or even eliminate — these risks if we are active enough, even without having to take up sports or go to the gym, \" ulf ekelund, the study's lead author, says. Researchers examined data from 1 million people from 16 studies, dividing them into four groups based on activity level, from less than five minutes a day up to 60 to 75 minutes per day; activities included such exercise as brisk walking at around 3.5mph or leisurely cycling at 10mph. Those who were physically active had a significantly lower risk of death than those who kept up their couch potato habits. And those who put in a minimum of one hour a day of exercise got rid of the risk altogether from sitting for eight hours. That means even if you can't put in the full hour to wipe the slate clean, you ' ll still derive some benefit from even a bit of exercise, scientists say. Gizmodo notes it's no happy accident that this new study, part of a four-paper series, is emerging right on the eve of the summer olympics: it examines how much progress has been made since a lancet series from four years ago that said lack of exercise was a \" global pandemic \" that contributed to the deaths of 5.3 million people annually.

Bloomberg notes that even before the chicago incident, munoz was at risk of losing the money because of disgruntled customers, though he ' ll still be taking home more than $ 13 million without it. In another development, the chicago department of aviation says two more officers have been put on leave because of the incident, the chicago tribune reports. Another officer was suspended earlier this week. Earlier wednesday, david dao, the kentucky doctor injured as he was dragged from the plane sunday night, took a step toward legal action, the tribune reports. His lawyer requested a court order for united and the city of chicago to keep video, cockpit recordings, and other information from the flight. Munoz said wednesday that the airline will never again use law enforcement officers to haul passengers out of their seats on overbooked flights. The airline also says all 70 passengers on sunday's flight will get refunds. \" they are trying to get some positive pr after their consistent horrendous failures on sunday, monday, and tuesday morning, \" henry harteveldt of atmosphere research group tells bloomberg.",

Upi reports that a study published in the journal of clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism found changes in sleep patterns throughout the week can increase people's risk of heart disease, diabetes, and more. The study is the first to show a link between \" social jetlag \" — the difference between someone's natural sleep patterns and the sleep schedule imposed on them by work and other responsibilities — and negative health effects in otherwise healthy people, according to a press release from the endocrine society. Of the 447 people studied by researchers, 85 % went to sleep later and woke up later on their days off, reports the new york times. Those with the biggest shifts in sleep schedule had worse cholesterol, a higher bmi, a larger waist circumference, and more, results that held even when taking physical activity and diet into account. \" our findings suggest that a misalignment of sleep timing is associated with metabolic risk factors that predispose to diabetes and... Cardiovascular disease, \" the study states. Researchers say people need to be better informed about their workplace choices. \" if future studies replicate what we found here, then we may need to consider as a society how modern work and social obligations are affecting our sleep and health, \" one researcher concludes.

Photo by mamuka gotsiridze/shutterstock pittsburgh, nov. 20 ( upi ) -- most people with a day job get up early on workdays, but like to sleep late on off days simply because they can. Those disruptions to regular sleeping patterns can increase the risk for developing metabolic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, according to a new study. Shift work -- people with irregular work hours or who work something other than day hours -- has been shown in previous studies to have a detrimental effect on health. New research conducted at the university of pittsburgh shows, however, social jetlag as basic as getting up late may also be bad for health. Social jetlag refers to a mismatch between a person's socially-imposed sleep schedule and their natural circadian rhythm. Researchers said social jetlag is known to relate to obesity and other cardiovascular conditions, however the link to healthy people is new. \" this is the first study to extend upon that work and show that even among healthy, working adults who experience a less extreme range of mismatches in their sleep schedule, social jetlag can contribute to metabolic problems, \" said patricia wong, a",

Although sleep disturbances enhance the risk for cardiometabolic diseases, the extent to which circadian rhythm disruptions independently contribute to risk remain unclear. Physiological processes such as glucose metabolism, core body temperature, and blood pressure ( bp ) have an intrinsic circadian rhythm that, when disrupted, may contribute to risk for cardiovascular disease. Relative to normal daytime workers, shift workers, who often experience chronic circadian misalignment, are more likely to develop the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, with relative risk increasing as a function of years spent in shift work ( 5 – 7 ). In an experimental study, healthy adults asked to eat and sleep 12 hours out of phase from their regular schedules exhibited vascular and endocrine abnormalities, such as increased arterial pressure, a reversed daily cortisol rhythm, and postprandial glucose levels in the range of a prediabetic state ( 8 ).

He used the hashtag \" #jaredsidea, \" suggesting that the decision to accept the award came from son-in-law jared kushner. Presidents obama and george w. Bush had previously received the honor — trump famously criticized obama because he \" bowed \" to the saudi king — and stone is unhappy that trump decided to accept it, too. \" instead of meeting with the saudis, \" he wrote, trump \" should be demanding they pay for the attack on america on 9/11 which they financed. \" as cnn notes, the tweets come as trump appears to be trying to distance himself from his one-time campaign adviser. After reports emerged that stone was among those who advised trump to fire fbi chief james comey, the president responded on twitter. \" have not spoken to roger in a long time, \" he wrote. \" had nothing to do with my decision. \" those interested in learning more about stone should check out the new netflix documentary, get me roger stone, writes rick jervis at usa today.

The news that so many accounts were fake shocked investors - sending facebook's shares down to below the $ 20 mark when it was announced in august.

Not that facebook is trying to usurp amazon just yet. The launch of facebook gifts is modest: facebook is emphasizing sub-$ 50 products like socks, cupcakes, teddy bears, and starbucks gift cards.

The heavily redacted documents were released monday and the agency drew attention to them with a tweet on tuesday, usa today reports. Clinton spokesman brian fallon described the timing as \" odd \" and wondered: \" will the fbi be posting docs on trump's housing discrimination in ' 70? \" the fbi issued a statement late tuesday saying the documents had been requested under the freedom of information act and \" were posted automatically and electronically to the fbi's public reading room. \" rich, who died in 2013, was pardoned just hours before bill clinton left office in 2001. He fled the us for switzerland in the 1980s to avoid fraud and tax evasion charges, and the fact that his wife had donated to the democratic national committee, the clinton presidential library, and hillary clinton's senate campaign made the pardon appear very suspicious, npr notes. The fbi documents offered little new information on the rich pardon, though they were an unwelcome reminder of the episode for the clinton campaign and caused renewed accusations that the agency is trying to meddle in the election, the washington post reports. Former obama adviser david axelrod tweeted that the agency had branded itself the \" federal bureau of intervention \" with the latest release.",

Using data from the american time use survey, which calculates the proportion of americans who are awake at any given hour, as well as the national violent death reporting system, which provides data for time of fatal injury, researchers categorized more than 35,000 suicides by the hour in which they happened. While the weighted, scaled mean suicide rate is 2 % between 6am and midnight, it jumps to 10 % between midnight and 4am and peaks at 16 % between 2am and 3am. \"this appears to be the first data to suggest that circadian factors may contribute to suicidality and help explain why insomnia is also a risk factor, \" the lead investigator tells penn medicine. \" just being awake at night may in and of itself be a risk factor for suicide, \" he continues. Previous research has found that more suicides occur during the day, but those numbers didn't account for how many people are actually awake at any given hour. Since such a higher percentage of people who are up commit suicide in the wee hours, researchers say that treating insomnia could help lower the risk of suicide, which at 38,000 deaths per year is the 10th highest cause of death in the us, according to medline plus.",

The father of the 6-month-old girl tells police that he forgot his daughter was in the car seat of his nissan leaf when he arrived at work. The 38-year-old had taken the infant to a doctor's appointment at 11am and was supposed to drop her off at day care afterward on his way to work, reports the oregonian. She wasn't discovered until about 5pm, at which point paramedics brought her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Temperatures were in the 50s during the day. Police say the child's mother, who does not work at intel, also was at the scene and performing cpr when medics arrived. It's not clear whether she or her husband discovered the child. No charges have been filed. The couple also has a young son, and police say they are cooperating fully in the investigation. The death follows a spate of high-profile deaths over the summer, along with one earlier this month in arizona. ( a teenager has come up with an invention designed to prevent such deaths. )",

Some povs: dan kois acknowledges for slate that mascots wouldn't make it to the top of his guest list, but he still says it's a \" charmer that packs a sneaky punch. \" although kois laments the absence of guest regulars harry shearer, eugene levy, and catherine o ' hara, enough of the other usual suspects are around to make the movie earn points \" in the most unlikely task of all: making us believe that mascotting is a job worth taking seriously. \" the movie gets a solid b-minus from devan coggan at entertainment weekly, earning praise for its \" weird \" mascots, still-effective \" deadpan jokes, \" and \" insane choreography \" in the film's final competition, while receiving a demerit for never moving most of the characters much beyond \" straight caricature. \" seen and loved every christopher guest film? \" you ' ll be in the stands cheering, \" coggan writes. \" otherwise, mascots feels like a bit of a retread. \" and \" retread \" seems to be how owen gleiberman would peg the film in his review for variety, saying despite the \" chuckles, \" it mainly \" plays like a rerun of past comic glory. \" a major beef he has with the movie: there's none of that element of surprise, that outlandishness that used to exist when characters in past guest movies would speak. \" the movie is a little lazy, \" he notes. \" it doesn't push its premise to the outer fringes of cracked fixation. \" meanwhile, an \" almost nonexistent \" plot and \" uneven \" jokes are what's got stephen dalton yawning at the hollywood reporter, where he describes the movie as being \" essentially best in show with humans instead of dogs. \" and he's another critic who, while lauding the return of jane lynch, fred willard, and parker posey ( among other guest veterans ), missed levy and o ' hara, whose \" wild, dysfunctional energy might have added some much-needed spice to this lightweight farce",

Musophobia is one of the most common specific phobias, which is discussed on the home page. Musophobia is also known as suriphobia and murophobia ( murine stems from the muridae family that encompasses mice and rats ). What causes musophobia? musophobia is created by the unconscious as a protective mechanism. This mechanism was probably created as some point in the persons past when they had a traumatic experience with a mouse or rate. Examples of this could be having your house or room invaded by them, finding them eating your food, being surprised when they jump from a trash can, touching them while getting up as they run from under furniture, smelling them, or getting sick from them ( the black plague in europe was carried by rats ). There are hundreds of ways people could have developed their traumatic experience. This fear could be triggered by the presence of a mouse or rat in a room or store, seeing them on tv or in movies, someone joking about them, or smelling them. These are only a few possible examples. Everyone experiences their fears in different ways and intensity levels and some react in different ways, such as screaming, running to different rooms, and/or getting to higher ground. What are the symptoms of musophobia? as with any phobia, the symptoms vary by person depending on their level of fear. The symptoms of musophobia typically include extreme anxiety, dread and anything associated with panic such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, inability to articulate words or sentences, dry mouth and shaking. Can i take medicine? medicine is often prescribed for musophobia. Please note that these medications can have side effects and/or withdrawal systems that can be severe. It is also importation to note that medicines do not cure musophobia, at best they only temporarily suppress the systems. However, there are treatments for musophobia, which include counseling, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, and neuro-linguistic programming.

The supersonic jump was part of a project by paragon space development corp and its stratospheric explorer team, which has been working secretly for years to develop a self-contained commercial spacesuit that would allow people to explore some 20 miles above the earth's surface. The technology that has gone into developing the balloon, the spacesuit and the other systems that were used in friday's launch will be used to advance commercial spaceflight, namely efforts by arizona-based world view enterprises to take paying tourists up in a high-altitude balloon and luxury capsule starting in late 2016. As more people head into the stratosphere, the spacesuits could be adapted for emergency rescues or other scientific endeavours, officials said. After nearly three years of intense planning, development and training, eustace began his ascent via a high-altitude, helium-filled balloon just as the sun was rising.

Eustace hit a top speed of 822mph during a freefall that lasted four-and-a-half minutes. The supersonic jump was part of a project by paragon space development corp and its stratospheric explorer team, which has been working secretly for years to develop a self-contained commercial spacesuit that would allow people to explore some 20 miles above the earth's surface. The technology that has gone into developing the balloon, the spacesuit and the other systems that were used in friday's launch will be used to advance commercial spaceflight, namely efforts by arizona-based world view enterprises to take paying tourists up in a high-altitude balloon and luxury capsule starting in late 2016. As more people head into the stratosphere, the spacesuits could be adapted for emergency rescues or other scientific endeavours, officials said. After nearly three years of intense planning, development and training, eustace began his ascent via a high-altitude, helium-filled balloon just as the sun was rising. It took more than two hours to hit an altitude of 135,890 feet ( 41,419 metres ), from which he separated himself from the balloon"

Sherine abdel-wahab — described by the bbc as one of egypt's most famous singers and a judge on the arabic version of the voice — was sentenced to six months in prison tuesday for speaking ill of the nile. During a concert in the united arab emirates in 2016, a fan had asked abdel-wahab to sing a song about drinking from the river, with the singer replying, \" no, you'd get bilharzia. Drink evian, it's better! \" per deutsche welle. Bilharzia is a parasitic disease affecting water sources in egypt, with evidence of it appearing in mummified remains dating back millennia. Though abdel-wahab later apologized for the \" foolish joke, \" outrage spread with footage of the comment. In november, a lawyer filed a lawsuit accusing abdel-wahab of disparaging egypt and damaging its tourism industry. On tuesday, a cairo court found her guilty of spreading \" false news, \" though she remains free with an appeal possible. Also tuesday, singer laila amer was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of \" inciting debauchery and immorality, \" stemming from a controversial music video, whose director and fellow actor received six-month and three-month sentences, respectively. In a similar case, singer shaimaa ahmed was sentenced to two years in prison in december over a racy music video that showed her dancing in underwear and eating a banana. Reporting on the cases, the ap notes egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi \" has ushered in the country's fiercest crackdown on dissent and freedoms in its modern history. \"",

Yingying zhang, 26, was last seen on surveillance video june 9 getting into a black saturn astra on the university of illinois campus. According to the chicago tribune, investigators focused on the astra, which video showed appeared to be circling the area at the time. The astra led them to 28-year-old brendt christensen, who drove a matching car. In his first interview, authorities say christensen said he was sleeping or playing video games around the time zhang was picked up, the washington post reports. But during the second interview, he admitted to picking up an asian woman around that time because she looked \" distressed. \" he said he dropped her off a few blocks away. Investigators say the passenger door of christensen's astra was cleaned to a \" more diligent extent \" than the rest of the car. They set up surveillance on christensen, and allegedly recorded him thursday saying he kidnapped zhang and held her against her will in his apartment.

The judge expected to start opening statements by 2 p.m. Thursday, but jury selection took longer than expected. This is a potential death penalty case so the pool of dozens of jurors was questioned heavily on their personal beliefs of what punishments are appropriate. The potential jurors were asked by the defense this hypothetical question: if someone kills four people in cold blood, is the death penalty the only reasonable punishment? in this case, the prosecution will argue this was a cold-blooded killing. They say matos killed his ex-girlfriend, megan brown, her parents, margaret and gregory, and her boyfriend, nick leonard.

The video shows collinson start her run, only to hit a patch of icy snow and tumble 1,000 vertical feet down the mountain, careening for 25 white-knuckle seconds. \" being the badass that she is, angel came out unscathed, but the footage will leave you wondering how she escaped without injury, \" reads the description posted by tgr under the youtube video, promoted during the company's safety week 2016 to inform other backcountry athletes of such dangers. It's doubtful collinson felt especially badass during her tumble. \" the fall was absolutely terrifying — without question, \" she says in a release. \" you have no idea what you are going to tumble over and there is basically nothing you can do but hang on. \" and that's what she did, telling good morning america earlier this week that she covered up her face, used her arms to protect her head as best she could, and \" kind of just held on until i stopped. \" what she had to show for her death-defying plunge: two injured fingers, a few bruises, and the loss of whatever was in her pack, which spilled open as she pitched and rolled in the snow. \" i ' m ok, i ' m ok, \" an out-of-breath, miked-up collinson says in the video when she finally comes to a full stop. \" i ' m fine. … i can go back up and get my s -- t, too. \" ( it's not the first crazy fall caught on video by teton gravity research. )",

        "summary": "North korea has stepped up its anti-american rhetoric even more after the us strike on syria, a country it considers a close ally. In a blistering statement issued saturday, pyongyang denounced the strike as \" a clear and unforgivable act of aggression \" that showed its decision to develop nuclear weapons \" was the right choice a million times over, \" reports reuters. According to north korea's kcna news agency, kim jong un and bashar al-assad have exchanged promises of cooperation. In other developments: syrian activists say new airstrikes have hit the town of khan sheikhoun, where a chemical attack tuesday killed more than 80 people and led to us retaliation, cnn reports. Activists say the saturday strikes killed a woman and injured at least three other people. According to monitoring groups, jets are once again taking off from the airbase the us hit with dozens of cruise missiles. Russia, which warned of \" extremely serious consequences \" after the strike, has vowed to step up syria's air defenses and send a frigate to a syrian base, reports the new york times. The us accuses russia of violating a 2013 agreement by turning a blind eye to syria's possession of banned chemical weapons. The us says it will keep the pressure on syria and strike again if necessary, the ap reports. At the united nations on friday, us ambassador to the un nikki haley said the world is waiting for russia \" to act responsibly in syria \" and reconsider its \" misplaced alliance \" with assad. The pentagon is trying to get russia to reopen a communications hotline it closed after the attack, reports the guardian, which describes the hotline dispute as vladimir putin daring president trump \" to choose between attacking assad and attacking isis. \" the communications channel was set up to reduce the risk of accidents involving us and russian planes over syria. British foreign secretary boris johnson has called off a trip to russia because of the syria situation, the bbc reports. Johnson said the uk deplores russia's \" continued defence of the assad regime. \" he added that us secretary of state rex tillerson will still travel to moscow next week to deliver a \" clear and coordinated \" message to russia. The washington post looks at what led up to trump's decision to strike the base. Insiders say trump — whose aides had requested more images and fewer words in daily intelligence briefings — was deeply affected by images of babies and children killed in the chemical attack. Critics including democratic sen. Chris murphy accused trump of having an \" emotional reaction \" instead of a strategy, though tillerson says trump carefully evaluated the facts before concluding \"",
