South korea's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that the missile fired from a site north of pyongyang flew about 500 miles before crashing off the north's east coast. It was the first medium-range missile launched by the north since it fired two in april 2014, says a south korean defense official. Earlier this week, north korea's state media said kim had ordered tests soon of a nuclear warhead and ballistic missiles capable of carrying warheads. A military expert at the south's konyang university says it's likely that friday's launch was a test of a re-entry vehicle mounted on pyongyang's purported rodong missile. The north korean missile fired may not be a rodong but a long-range missile whose launch angle was altered so that it didn't fly its full range, says a professor at the korea advanced institute of science and technology. He says the missile may have carried an empty warhead, which contains trigger devices but lacks plutonium or uranium, to see if it can survive the fiery re-entry and detonate at the right time. Japan denounced the launch and lodged a formal diplomatic protest, warning that it will take \" all necessary measures \" to defend itself, reports reuters.

        "summary": "Swimmers are now free to go back in the seattle-area pilchuck river without worrying unduly about being attacked by crazed otters, authorities say. Wildlife officials say they tracked, shot, and killed a large, aggressive male otter just yards from where an 8-year-old boy and his grandmother were badly injured in an otter attack last month, reports reuters. Authorities say they initially suspected a female otter protecting pups attacked the boy as he swam and then attacked his grandmother as she went to his aid, but the male they shot was unusually aggressive and they're pretty sure he was the culprit, the ap reports. The otter, which was at least 4 feet long, appeared to have no fear of humans, authorities say. A necropsy will be carried out to determine whether disease may have played a role in its behavior.",

The large male otter was trapped, captured and euthanized just yards from where the late july attack occurred in the pilchuck river in snohomish county, about 36 miles northeast of seattle, the washington department of fish and wildlife said. The otter pounced on an 8-year-old boy as he swam to a rope swing, and then turned on the child's grandmother as she tried to intervene, officials said. Both were hospitalized with dozens of bite and scratch marks to the face, arms and chest. The attack appeared unprovoked, according to captain alan myers of the department of fish and wildlife. \" aggression is not usual for this species, \" he said. In the days after the attack, trappers found several females with pups in the area, and said the responsible animal might have been a mother protecting her brood. However, those females showed no signs of aggression and moved out when dogs came through, myers said.

In an announcement published today, the american academy of pediatrics, which is comprised of 60,000 such doctors, expressed that such unions benefit children, providing them with legal and financial security. It also backed adoption and foster care rights for gay couples. The key statement: \" scientific evidence affirms that children have similar developmental and emotional needs and receive similar parenting whether they are raised by parents of the same or different genders. If a child has 2 living and capable parents who choose to create a permanent bond by way of civil marriage, it is in the best interests of their child( ren ) that legal and social institutions allow and support them to do so, irrespective of their sexual orientation. \" the new york times reports that in addition to its policy statement, the academy published a 10-page technical report that has been four years in the making and reviewed 30 years ' worth of research on the subject. It found that children's \" relationships with their parents, their parents'sense of competence and security, and the presence of social and economic support \" affect a child's well-being more than the gender or the sexual orientation of his parents.

        "summary": "Jupiter's great red spot has never looked greater. On monday, nasa's juno spacecraft got closer to the giant storm than any man-made object in history, the washington post reports. According to cbs news, juno came within 2,200 miles of jupiter's clouds and 5,600 miles of the great red spot itself. On wednesday, nasa started releasing the closest photos of the storm ever taken. The images are composites of photos taken using red, green, blue, and infrared filters, vox explains. Some of them have an hour-glass shape due to juno's spinning. In addition to photos, juno sent back data on jupiter's magnetic fields, the mass and composition of its atmosphere, and more. This data will likely be studied for years. The great spot is the biggest storm in the solar system. Its 400mph winds have been going for nearly 200 years and likely longer than that. At 10,000 miles wide, it would cover the earth. \" here's the largest and most fierce storm in the entire solar system and it's lasted hundreds of years, \" nasa's scott bolton tells cbs. \" the question is, how can it last that long? what's powering it, how's it really working inside? \" in addition to those questions, scientists hope to use the data from juno to find out how deep the great red spot goes, why it's red, and why it's been shrinking in recent decades. The answers to these questions could help us understand more about how the solar system formed and how weather works both at home and throughout the galaxy.",

Researchers studying a 14,000-year-old infected molar say someone tried to clean it with flint tools — a discovery that amounts to the first known evidence of dentistry, reports atlas obscura. The patient was a roughly 25-year-old man who lived in what is now northern italy. When researchers examined his tooth with a microscope, they found \" extensive enamel chipping. \" and while prehistoric people were known to have used toothpicks made of wood or bone, this clearly wasn't the result of that. \"it predates any undisputed evidence of dental and cranial surgery, \" the lead researcher from the university of bologna tells discovery. Previously, dental drilling had been detected on 9,000-year-old molars found in modern pakistan, but this more primitive scraping technique predates that by a mile. It looks like somebody \" tried to dig out the rotten part of the man's tooth with a stone implement, \" in the words of the christian science monitor. Though it wasn't entirely successful, the effort at least shows that even people of that era, the upper paleolithic to be precise, recognized the importance of dental hygiene and the danger of infected teeth, the researcher tells an italian newspaper.

A new study published in scientific reports has found that early humans have been using primitive dentistry techniques for about 14,000 years. Even cavemen had cavities, and now scientists have discovered that they also took pains – literally – to remove them. A 14,000-year-old molar sheds new light on humankind's history of dentistry, which began much earlier than previously believed, a new study has found.

        "summary": "A new lawsuit claims there's a big problem with playboy's website: it's not accessible to the blind. The suit, though, isn't about racy photos. Donald nixon, who is legally blind, filed the class-action suit on wednesday, arguing playboy.com and playboyshop.com aren't compatible with screen-reading software that translates text into braille or recites it using a speech synthesizer, reports tmz. Nixon's suit claims the visually impaired \" cannot fully and equally use or enjoy the facilities, products, and services \" offered, putting playboy in violation of the americans with disabilities act, which requires businesses to make services accessible to people with physical disabilities. Nixon hopes to force playboy to become accessible to the blind but is also seeking unspecified damages. The kardashians'dash website was hit with a similar complaint in 2016. A year later, a blind woman sued kylie jenner's kylie cosmetics, arguing its website wasn't compatible with her screen-reader software. A legally blind man sued some 40 mid-atlantic schools in federal court in manhattan last week for the same reason, per the allentown morning call. The paper notes the justice department has yet to release guidelines on how to make websites compliant with the ada, and the delay has left businesses in the lurch.

And according to politico, sources say female staffers were unclear if the arizona republican was suggesting in vitro fertilization or actual intercourse when he made the pitch. Franks announced his resignation thursday ahead of a house ethics committee investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, admitting to speaking to two female staffers about surrogacy. Now new details are leaking out. A former staffer says franks asked her about being a surrogate at least four times, making her uncomfortable. \" i was asked a few times to look over a ' contract'to carry his child, and if i would conceive his child, i would be given $ 5 million, \" she tells the ap. She says she felt retaliated against after refusing. Meanwhile, sources say the two female staffers asked about surrogacy by franks were unclear if he was suggesting sex as part of the deal. A former staffer says in another instance franks tried to convince a female aide that she was in love with him by giving her an article about how you know you're in love with someone. Andrea lafferty, president of the traditional values coalition, says she reported allegations against franks to house speaker paul ryan in recent weeks, calling his behavior \" horrific \" — \" a powerful man hiring young women, procuring staff, to potentially surrogate children for him. \" ryan then asked franks to resign. While franks had said he would leave office in january, he now says he will resign friday after his wife was hospitalized thursday night \" due to an ongoing ailment, \" cnn reports.",

Sadly, i can, \" stark writes in a letter to kusa. \" i was almost a school shooter. \" it's a confession perhaps as hard to hear as it is for stark to air publicly. But it's a conversation that must be had, stark says. He tells kusa a violent childhood and years of bullying led him to consider murder and suicide in 1996. \" i was going to try to kill a lot of people and then kill myself, \" he says, per nbc news. It had nothing to do with \" the media, or video games, or music. \" rather, \" i felt like i had nothing at all in life to look forward to and... Nothing to lose. \" but though he tried to find a gun, he wasn't able to, in part because of an assault weapons ban in place from 1994 to 2004. \" guns don't kill people, people kill people.

But this issue is bigger than guns alone, says stark, noting one kind act — a friend baking him a pie — kept him from committing suicide. Acknowledging \" a severe lack of love \" took a toll on his mental health, stark now says \" compassion is the only real way we can stop this. \" something as simple as \" a kind word, a hug, saying ' hey how are you ' … could literally save someone's life, \" stark tells msnbc. \" when you're in the worst state and you think that no one cares, having someone actually care can make an entire world of difference. \"",

A review of 61 studies across 14 countries ( for a total of more than 330,000 subjects ) linked working more than 48 hours a week with \" risky \" alcohol use, harvard business review reports. Marianna virtanen and fellow researchers at the finnish institute of occupational health found when subjects worked those longer hours, they were 11 % more likely to be heavy drinkers than those who punched in for no more than the typical 40-hour workweek, new scientist reports. For the purposes of this study, virtanen defined \" risky \" drinking as more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week for women, more than 21 for men — a definition that sarah green writes for hbr is \" rather generous. \" after all, the cdc defines heavy drinking as more than eight drinks a week for women, 15 drinks if you're a guy. Virtanen warns the study is \" observational \" and more studies are needed, but her team did find this when it looked at workers who put in long hours but had normal drinking habits: over a six-year period, 12 % of them evolved into heavy drinkers. The study was published in the bmj in january, and in emails with virtanen, green says she tried to find a \" loophole. \" for instance, is there a difference between working in an office or from home? does the extra time you spend emailing in the evenings count? virtanen answered her with more questions, like, \" what if you enjoy your work and it's highly rewarding? we hope we will get answers to these questions in our future studies. \" ( here's how much america's heaviest drinkers drink. )",

A german fisherman whose previous wild finds include bombs, torpedoes, and a corpse hauled the bottle out of the sea last month, and it made its way to researchers at hamburg's international maritime museum.

Using that address, researchers sourced the bottle to platz, who apparently let loose with the bottle while on a hike. The researchers then turned to a genealogist who tracked down platz's 62-year-old granddaughter. Angela erdmann never met her grandfather, who died in 1946, but describes the situation as \" unbelievable \" and \" pretty moving. \" though the handwriting was verified against other samples from platz, much of what he wrote has largely been lost to the ages, on account of the moisture and time, though experts plan to take a stab at recovering the text. As far as time goes, the 1913 bottle is being hailed as the world's oldest, reports the afp, beating guinness ' current record holder, which entered the water in 1914 and stayed there 98 years.

            "A fisherman pulled the beer bottle with the scribbled message out of the baltic off the northern city of kiel last month. It contained a postcard dated may 17th, 1913 written by a man named richard platz. The modest danish postcard had two german stamps on it and a polite message asking the finder to send it on to his address in berlin. Holger von neuhoff of the international maritime museum in hamburg said: \" this is certainly the first time such an old message in a bottle was found, particularly with the bottle intact. \" researchers then set to work identifying the author and managed to track down his 62-year-old granddaughter angela erdmann, who lives in berlin. \" it was almost unbelievable, \" erdmann told news agency dpa. She was first able to hold the brown bottle last week at the hamburg museum. Inside was a message on a postcard requesting the finder to return it to his home address in berlin. \" that was a pretty moving moment, \" erdmann said. \" tears rolled down my cheeks. \" von neuhoff said researchers were able to determine based on the address that it was 20-year-old baker's son richard platz who threw the bottle in the baltic while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913.

        "summary": "A big boost for medical marijuana advocates: a massive study involving data on a million teenagers in 48 states has found no evidence that legalizing pot for medical use does anything to increase teen usage, the guardian reports. The study, published in the lancet psychiatry journal, looked at some 1,098,270 8th-grade, 10th-grade, and 12th-grade students over 24 years; the teens had been asked if they used pot in the last 30 days. The researchers found that teenage pot use not only failed to rise in the 21 contiguous states where medical marijuana was legalized as of 2014 ( alaska and hawaii bring the nation's total to 23 ), usage actually went down among the youngest teenagers, from about 8 % before the law was passed to 6 % after. In states that brought in medical marijuana laws, teen pot use was already slightly higher than in other states, at about 16 % usage to 13 %. Experts say that could be due to a more liberal general attitude toward the drug, livescience reports. \" our study findings suggest that the debate over the role of medical marijuana laws in adolescent marijuana use should cease, and that resources should be applied to identifying the factors that do affect risk, \" the researchers wrote. As for why pot use fell among 8th graders after it was legalized for medical purposes, here's one theory: that the teens started to see marijuana as a relatively harmless medical product, which \" certainly doesn't fit with the idea of being a rebellious teenager, \" writes debra borchardt at forbes. ( a separate study tracked the pot \" use \" of kids — under age six. )",

The weird formula to success: taa plus tpa equals tpp. The first is something called trade adjustment assistance, would provide job training and other help to people who lose their jobs because of the trade deal. The second is trade promotion authority, which gives obama fast-track authority to negotiate the deal with foreign leaders, and the third is the deal itself, the trans-pacific partnership. The first vote will be on taa, and if it fails, the game is over — no vote on the tpa would even take place. Democrats would typically support a measure such as taa, but they know that if they torpedo it, they can kill the larger deal, explains the hill. \" certain people argued that this is the mechanism to kill tpa, and that that's worth doing, \" says democratic rep. Jim himes, who backs fast-track. \" other people pointed out that that's a terribly cynical gamble. \" at this point, cnn rounds up 124 \" hard nos \" among the 188 democrats, who say that the trade deal will result in too many jobs going overseas. That number means that obama must flip some votes among democrats or john boehner must do the same among republicans. As for how obama tried to do that today, politico notes he spent about 45 minutes making his case and took no questions. The number of votes needed to pass the bill: 217.",

That controversial action probably won't come right away, but obama has met with foreign policy experts and believes he is within his authority to do so when necessary. Obama met with congressional leaders today — john boehner, mitch mcconnell, harry reid, and nancy pelosi — and informed them that he would welcome congressional support but that he plans to broaden the attack on isis regardless, reports the ap. Afterward, none of the four talked about the necessity of an authorization vote, and both parties seem eager to avoid one before the midterms, reports the hill. The first steps in the us strategy will likely be to expand airstrikes in iraq, to beef up an international coalition against isis, and to provide more aid to groups on the ground that are fighting the militants in both iraq and syria. As for airstrikes in the latter country, which could be seen as helping bashar al-assad: isis \" is not an organization that respects international boundaries, \" says former undersecretary of defense for policy michèle flournoy, who was among the experts who had dinner with the president last night. \" you cannot leave them with a safe haven.

In what may be his only achievement in national politics, senator obama introduced s. 2433, the \"global poverty act, \" in 2007. Then, senator joe biden ( d-de ) rammed obama's \"global poverty act \" through his committee as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee — without any hearings.

The pressure on president bush to sign it would be intense, especially from obama's supporters in the media. If the contents of legislation could be judged by the title dreamed up by spinmeisters, anything named \"global poverty act \" would involve noble goals of alleviating poverty. However, we were taught from childhood not to judge a book by its cover. We must also not judge legislation by its title.

Teresa robinette, sister of 49-year-old louise turpin, appeared on megyn kelly today on monday and said she received a few odd phone calls between 2008 and 2010 in which her formerly straight-laced sister revealed she and husband david turpin had been \" experimenting with different religions, \" getting loaded at bars, and going through what the new york daily news calls a \" spiritual and sexual awakening. \" robinette recalls one call in which her sister said her husband dropped her at a hotel so she could have sex with a stranger; a year later, louise turpin called her back to say david turpin had taken her back \" to the exact same hotel room, the exact same bed she slept with this man in, so david could sleep with her in the same bed, \" says robinette. Robinette isn't the only relative speaking up. Louise turpin's brother, billy lambert, has also been making the tabloid rounds, revealing his sister was obsessed with the reality-tv show kate plus 8, which featured kate gosselin and her eight children, and that turpin aspired to be a reality star herself, per the desert sun. In interviews with inside edition and the mirror, lambert says the turpins moved from texas to california to be closer to hollywood and renewed their vows at the elvis chapel in las vegas, with the children ( faces blurred ) by their sides as part of the stunt; the daily news has video. Per the desert sun, court records show all 13 children had names starting with \" j, \" like the duggars of the former tlc show 19 kids and counting. Lambert says the turpins were even planning for a 14th child. \" they didn't care about the kids — it was all about them, \" he notes.",

Archaeologists may have uncovered the remains of a woman whose execution is said to have inspired the death of the main character in tess of the d ' urbervilles. Back in 1856, a 16-year-old hardy was among a crowd of 4,000 that gathered to watch martha brown's public hanging at dorchester prison in dorset, england. The prison has since been closed to make room for a housing development, and archaeologists conducting a routine survey because of the site's history turned up the still-unidentified remains, including a skull. Only eight convicts were executed and buried at the prison before 1878, reports the telegraph. \" i don't think it would be too difficult to establish if any of the remains are those of a woman, \" a dorset-based filmmaker tells the guardian. \" if they are, they are almost certain to be the remains of martha. \" like tess, brown was executed for murdering a man who had wronged her: in brown's case, her violent husband. \" i remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain, and how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half-round and back, \" hardy said of her execution some 70 years later. \" hardy is well-known for storing up experiences and using them decades later, \" says a rep for the thomas hardy society. \" when he wrote tess, i ' m sure he had in mind martha brown. \" the housing developer is resisting requests to allow a more thorough dig that might definitively answer the question about the remains, and the government's senior archaeologist in the county will make the final call on whether it's necessary.

Kaling wald's husband, peter, is believed to have died in march last year, but the 52-year-old's decomposing body remained in a room in their hamilton, ontario, home — sealed to prevent the smell getting out — until that september when the sheriff arrived to evict the family for defaulting on their mortgage, the hamilton spectator reports. She told investigators that the family and seven adult friends who lived in the home all prayed daily for him to come back to life. Neighbors tell the cbc that peter wald was a deeply religious man who had christian sayings and symbols on his van and even his clothes. He had diabetes, and authorities believe he died of natural causes. His wife was initially charged with neglect of duty regarding a dead body and offering an indignity to a body, but that was reduced to a single charge of failing to notify police or the coroner of the death; prosecutors agreed there was no ill intent. On monday, she was given a suspended sentence and told to get counseling. Her lawyer tells reuters that his client now understands the law, is remorseful, and after court proceedings, has finally felt able to properly grieve for her husband.

Matthews avenue home in the city's north end last year. Regional coroner dr. Jack stanborough told cbc news in a previous interview that wald's body was found in an \"advanced state of decomposition \" when it was discovered in an upstairs bedroom. \"evidence suggests he'd been dead for weeks, if not months, \" stanborough said. ' he's in god's hands now ' wald died around march 20, 2013, according to summary of the case's facts provided by crown counsel janet booy. He had diabetes and was suffering from a foot infection",
            "Toronto a canadian family lived with a corpse in their upstairs bedroom for six months because they believed the deceased man would be resurrected if they prayed, but the body was discovered when the family was evicted for not paying the mortgage. Kaling wald, 50, pleaded guilty to failing to notify police that her husband had died, an offense under the provincial coroner's act, and was sentenced on monday to probation and counseling, her lawyer told reuters on tuesday. Peter wald, 52, died in march 2013 of what authorities believe were natural causes following a foot infection linked to his diabetes, defense lawyer peter boushy said. His wife kaling wald left him in bed and sealed up the bedroom in their hamilton, ontario, home to prevent the odor of decomposition from disturbing the busy household, which included five of the couple's six children, as well as other adults living in the home. \" just as jesus raised lazarus after the fourth day, so too did she believe god would resurrect her husband in due time, \" said boushy. The family was active in christian street ministry and outreach in hamilton, an industrial city about 70 kms southwest of toronto. \" there clearly was an over-exuberance of one's faith, \" he added.

        "summary": "Security experts worldwide are melting down over meltdown and feeling haunted by spectre. Those are the names security researchers have given two massive, newly discovered security flaws that affect central processing units at the chip level, meaning nearly all computers are at risk no matter what kind of operating system they run, techcrunch reports. The bugs, discovered by researchers from google's project zero team and independent other teams, exploit flaws in computer architecture that make it possible for malicious software to steal information from other programs, according to a website set up by researchers to explain them. The researchers had planned to wait until fixes were available next week before disclosing the flaws, but they released them early after a tech site revealed the vulnerabilities, the ap reports. The flaws differ in some ways: meltdown, which breaks through barriers protecting computer memory, affects only intel chips and works in a way that makes cloud computing especially vulnerable, while the spectre technique, which is harder to exploit but can trick other applications into revealing information, affects just about everything with any sort of chip in it. Analysts say a patch for meltdown could slow cpus down by up to 30 %, while there is no known fix for spectre, which could require a major chip redesign. Researcher paul kocher, part of the team that discovered the bugs, tells the new york times that focusing on improving speed in new chips resulted in design flaws. \" we've really screwed up, \" he says. \" there's been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both. \"",

        "summary": "The silicon valley billionaire who bought and then closed public access to a popular california beach must let the surfers return, a court ruled thursday. In a 3-0 decision, a state appeals court ruled venture capitalist vinod khosla must restore public access to martins beach near san francisco. Martins beach had been frequented by surfers and fishermen for almost a century before khosla bought its surrounding 89 acres for $ 32.5 million in 2008, per the san jose mercury news. Shortly after, khosla, who the guardian reports does not live on the land, blocked the only road providing beach access. Thursday's decision relates to a suit filed by the surfrider foundation in 2013. The foundation argued that under the 1972 california coastal act, khosla needed to obtain a coastal commission permit before changing \" the intensity of use of water, or of access, \" and both a lower court and the appeals court agreed. A lawyer for surfrider says it's \" probably one of the most important public right-of-access cases in the country, \" with huge implications. He now expects khosla to appeal to the california supreme court. Khosla previously said he would sell a land easement allowing public access to the beach to the state lands commission. But though the 6.4-acre stretch chosen is worth about $ 360,000, khosla wants $ 30 million. His lawyer explained the price in december, saying \" khosla is unwilling to be coerced into giving up a vested constitutional property right. \" a lawsuit in which khosla accuses the commission of harassment is pending.

            "A california court has ordered a silicon valley billionaire to restore access to a beloved beach that he closed off for his private use, a major victory for public lands advocates who have been fighting the venture capitalist for years. An appeals court ruled on thursday that vinod khosla, who runs the venture capital firm khosla ventures and co-founded the tech company sun microsystems, must unlock the gates to martins beach in northern california by his property. The decision is a major blow to khosla and other wealthy landowners who have increasingly tried to buy up the internationally celebrated beaches along the california coast and turn public lands into private property. The beach was a popular destination for fishing, surfing and other recreational activities for nearly a century, and the previous owners provided a general store and public restroom. But khosla eventually bought the property and in 2010 closed public access, putting up signs warning against trespassing. Khosla, who has a net worth of $ 1.55bn and does not live on the property, has faced multiple lawsuits and legislative efforts to get him to open up the gate to the beach near half moon bay, about 30 miles south of san francisco.

            "A california court has ordered a silicon valley billionaire to restore access to a beloved beach that he closed off for his private use, a major victory for public lands advocates who have been fighting the venture capitalist for years. An appeals court ruled on thursday that vinod khosla, who runs the venture capital firm khosla ventures and co-founded the tech company sun microsystems, must unlock the gates to martins beach in northern california by his property. The decision is a major blow to khosla and other wealthy landowners who have increasingly tried to buy up the internationally celebrated beaches along the california coast and turn public lands into private property. The beach was a popular destination for fishing, surfing and other recreational activities for nearly a century, and the previous owners provided a general store and public restroom. But khosla eventually bought the property and in 2010 closed public access, putting up signs warning against trespassing. Khosla, who has a net worth of $ 1.55bn and does not live on the property, has faced multiple lawsuits and legislative efforts to get him to open up the gate to the beach near half moon bay, about 30 miles south of san francisco.

        "summary": "Japan on friday executed the leader of a doomsday cult and six of his followers, public broadcaster nhk reports, a mass hanging that had been rumored for months. Chizuo matsumoto, also known as shoko asahara, was the head of aum shinrikyo, the group responsible for the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on tokyo subway lines that killed 13 and injured more than 6,000 as well as other murders and other nerve gas attacks, one of which killed eight. Thirteen members of the cult had been sentenced to death; six are still awaiting execution. Japan does not carry out executions until all associated cases have been closed, with no more appeals pending; that happened in january, the bbc reports. Matsumoto, 63, had been imprisoned 22 years; his case was finalized in 2006, cnn reports. Matsumoto founded aum shinrikyo in 1984, and at its peak in the 1990s the cult had more than 10,000 members in japan and thousands more in other countries; a successor group still has 1,500 members in japan. The group's scientists produced nerve gas at its commune at the foot of mount fuji as matsumoto, who claimed to be a messiah, preached what the guardian describes as \" a bizarre mix of buddhist and hindu meditation along with christian and apocalyptic teachings, yoga, and the occult. \" there were reports of brainwashing and abuse in the cult, and after the 1995 attack dozens of followers were rounded up in police raids. Per the japan times, matsumoto never offered an explanation for the group's crimes. After the executions, amnesty international released a statement condemning them; it called the mass hanging \" unprecedented in recent memory in japan \" and said the death penalty \" is the ultimate denial of human rights. \"",

He was freed early from his 30-year sentence after giving evidence against other criminals, and colombia is divided on whether he deserves a second chance in society, the bbc reports. The 52-year-old — who murdered his own girlfriend on escobar's orders — is believed to have been involved in the 1989 killing of presidential candidate luis carlos galán, the kidnapping of future president andres pastrana, and the bombing of an avianca flight, which killed all 107 people on board, reuters reports. He left prison in bogota under heavy police guard yesterday and will be on probation for the next four years. But although his testimony against others means he is now a target for hit men himself, it's not clear whether he will be receiving ongoing protection.

            "Washington ( ap ) — the latest on the 2016 presidential campaign ( all times eastern standard time ): 12: 10 p.m. A group of u.s. Secret service agents briefly formed a protective ring around republican presidential candidate donald trump at his rally in ohio, but then quickly left the stage and allowed him to continue his speech. It was not immediately clear why the agents rushed onto the stage saturday morning to surround trump, who appeared to jolt after hearing something in the audience standing behind his right shoulder. Four secret service agents then rushed onto the stage, as the audience chanted \" trump! trump! trump! \" the agents quickly cleared. Trump did not explain what had happened, but said: \" thank you for the warning. I was ready for ' em, but it's much better if the cops do it, don't we agree? \" both the secret service and trump campaign staff did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment. Trump was able to finish his speech and did so without apparent incident. The billionaire businessman called off a rally on friday night in chicago, after protesters filled the arena where he was scheduled to speak. ___ 12: 05 p.m. It's another election saturday in the presidential race. There's a republican contest in heavily democratic washington, d.c. There's a single place to vote — a downtown hotel — and 19 delegates are at stake. In wyoming, republicans are holding caucuses to select the state's first 12 presidential delegates. Ted cruz is the only active republican candidate to have campaigned in the state, which will bring a total of 29 delegates to the national convention this summer. Republicans will choose 14 more delegates at their state convention in mid-april. The other three are the state gop chairman, national committeeman and national committeewoman. Hillary clinton won the democratic caucus on the northern mariana islands. The u.s. Territory located in the pacific ocean near guam held its vote saturday. Clinton received 54 percent of 189 votes cast to earn four of the six delegates at stake. Vermont sen. Bernie sanders picked up two delegates. And results are expected later on the gop side from guam. ___ 12 noon hillary clinton is charging republican front-runner donald trump with encouraging \" violence and aggression, \" saying his heated political rhetoric is \" wrong and it"

Though building 87 on the microsoft campus is home to three anechoic, or \" free from echo, \" chambers the company uses to test audio technology, the largest is \" unimaginably quiet, \" testers say, per science alert. It helps that the room is covered in \" wedges \" made of sound-proofed material and built on springs to cut down on vibrations. But how exactly do you decide which is the quietest place on the planet? it comes down to a sound measurement. The silence inside the chamber measures -20.6 dba ( decibels a-weighted ), compared to -13 recorded at the anechoic test chamber at orfield laboratories in minneapolis back in 2012. A second test in the chamber — which microsoft calls the place \" where sound goes to die, \" per fortune — returned a slightly less impressive -20.1 reading, but both results surpassed even the expectations of microsoft, which had expected about -16, according to guinness. So what does -20.6 dba sound like? humans can't actually hear anything below zero decibels, but \" to give you a rough idea, the brownian motion — that is, a random air particle in space — is around -23 dba. You can't get any quieter because that's just the air particles moving, \" an microsoft engineer explains in a video. \" we are on the edge of what [ are ] the limits of physics. \" thinking building 87 would be a great place to take a nap? sadly, you're probably out of luck.

Homeless man jamal jackson, 49, was arrested and charged with premeditated first-degree murder after the attack on 35-year-old anthony mele at a seaside restaurant in ventura, the washington post reports. Mele, who died after being taken off life support thursday, was dining with his wife and daughter at the aloha steakhouse when jackson walked up to the table and stabbed him in the neck, police say. The girl wasn't harmed. Jackson, a convicted felon, was arrested after customers and restaurant employees chased him to the beach. Police say a man later identified as jackson was reported for yelling and being disruptive on the promenade near the restaurant about three hours before the attack, the los angeles times reports. Officers were out on other calls, so command center staff monitored jackson through security cameras for around 20 minutes before deciding he wasn't a threat, according to police. Jackson had at least six contacts with police earlier this year, including an arrest for fighting. Mele's father says he hopes his son's death will change how ventura deals with its homeless population, the ventura county star reports. \" we need to help the homeless.

The bodies were found at a home in the city amid a crime scene police called particularly grisly — and so \" complex \" that police couldn't say at first whether it was a murder-suicide, or whether any of the victims had been shot, the ap reports. \" we had five deceased persons apparently from blunt force trauma, \" announced the chief of the force that arrested binh thai luc. \" we didn't know what we had. \" luc, who had a previous criminal record, had a \" relationship \" with the victims that police didn't specify, the san francisco examiner notes. Charged with five counts of murder, he was arrested with his brother, who faces unrelated drugs and ammunition possession charges. A relative of some of the victims discovered a body in the home's entryway on friday morning; she then found two others in the garage. Police found two more inside. Officials haven't given a motive for the killings, which occurred in what the san francisco chronicle calls a relatively safe neighborhood.",

After all, writes keith collins at quartz, \" walls are big, they're imposing, and they're almost always nearby. \" collins queried the us consumer product safety commission, which keeps tabs on annual emergency room visits, to find out more about wall punchers. Some of the major findings: more than 1,200 people were treated for wall punching-related injuries in 2014. Of them, 15-year-olds are most prone to punching walls. Men punch walls more than women ( 931 vs. 316 in 2014 ). Wall punching is consistent through out the year. Motives for wall punching range from anger, such as the teen angry that he couldn't see his girlfriend, and intoxication, such as the 25-year-old man who guzzled some brandy and tequila. A reddit thread sheds more light on anger-pain-shame cycle of punching a wall: the rage is \" blinding, like you literally can't see, \" writes one. Upon hitting the wall, the rage turns into \" extreme pain, \" followed by a little shame and embarrassment. \" modernman.com offers a primer for wall punching, calling the practice \" totally immature, \" yet \" totally satisfying. \" one important tip: don't punch a pre-1946 wall — lathe and plaster, after all, just doesn't break like drywall. Walls aren't the only inanimate object people punch, collins notes, just the top one. His research found that people went to the emergency room in 2014 for punching windows, doors, dumpsters, lamps, paper towel holders, and a thermostat, among many other objects.

The goal of their gofundme campaign was to raise $ 100,000 — a goal that was met in hours, the new york daily news reports, and, in just one day, nearly $ 200,000 has been raised. New fliers featuring vetrano's picture and noting a $ 100,000 reward have already been put up, per an update on the fundraising page. The initial $ 100,000 fundraising goal, announced wednesday morning, has been raised to $ 200,000, newsday reports. Meanwhile, the vetranos are in close contact with the nypd and are talking to the media about their daughter. Her father, phil, who normally jogged with her, recalled their last conversation: \" i said, i don't think it's a good idea that you go in there. And she said, it's ok daddy, i ' ll be all right, \" vetrano tells pix 11. Not long after that, when she failed to return home from the run, \" i got a feeling. It came over me, \" vetrano says. \" and i got off that couch, and i went looking for her. \" vetrano says the reward money is being offered with no questions asked, dnainfo reports: \" i don't care if he turns himself in for that money.

In january 1970, cheryl grimmer visited fairy meadow beach in wollongong with her mother and three young brothers, the bbc reports. As the visit wound down, the children went to shower off. Cheryl never returned from the girls ' changing room. Her brother, ricki grimmer, says she was only gone for a few minutes. \" it's something i still live with every day, \" he says. A massive search for cheryl proved fruitless, and her body has never been found. Her parents both died without knowing what happened to her, and her brothers didn't want the same thing to happen to them, according to abc. Then, on wednesday, police made an arrest. The unnamed 63-year-old suspect was a \" person of interest \" during the original investigation. Police, who revisited the case last year, say new clues — including three witnesses who saw a teen \" loitering \" in the area of cheryl's disappearance — allowed them to confirm some details of the original investigation and make the arrest. The suspect was a 16-year-old student at a reform school in 1970, the illawarra mercury reports. Police say he spoke about cheryl's disappearance at the time. He's now charged with her abduction and murder. \" i ' m not going to get into the specifics... But i can say that they are quite horrific, \" one detective tells the bbc. Cheryl's brother, stephen grimmer, tells the sydney morning herald the arrest has been \" unreal \" and \" really emotional. \" ( a 1984 newspaper clip led police to missing sisters. )",

The taliban has claimed responsibility. The attack appears to have targeted an agency similar to the us secret service, providing personal protection for high-ranking government officials, the ap reports. Kabul police chief gen. Abdul rahman rahimi told reporters that another 327 people were wounded in the assault, which began with a powerful suicide car bomb attack on the agency compound gates. A group of armed militants then entered the compound and waged a prolonged battle with government security forces, which officials say has now ended. Dozens of civilian apartment buildings, houses, and shops, as well as several government buildings, were damaged by the car bomb blast. Taliban insurgents have stepped up their attacks since announcing the start of their spring offensive last week, though the guardian notes that the winter was unusually violent, with multiple attacks in the capital and elsewhere. President ashraf ghani issued a statement condemning the latest attack, saying it \" clearly shows the enemy's defeat in face-to-face battle with afghan security forces. \" ( the taliban claimed to have just missed john kerry with a rocket attack during his recent visit to kabul. )",

By saturday, the death toll had reached 23, but it seemed likely to climb. With the entire town of paradise wiped out and the fire still raging furiously in surrounding communities, butte county sheriff kory honea said the county was bringing in a fifth search and recovery team. An anthropology team from california state university, chico was also assisting, because in some cases \" the only remains we are able to find are bones or bone fragments. \" \" this weighs heavy on all of us",

        "summary": "Plenty of people would agree comedians are a bit crazy — but are they psychotic? not quite, but they measure as having higher levels of psychotic personality traits than those in \" non-creative \" professions, a new study finds. Researchers had 523 comedians, 364 actors, and 831 people in the \" non-creative jobs \" group answer a survey that assessed four psychotic qualities, generally: a belief in things like the paranormal, difficulty focusing, a tendency to avoid intimacy, and antisocial or impulsive behavior. Comedians'scores dwarfed those of the non-creative group in all four areas; actors scored higher than that group on three, but didn't show high levels of introverted personalities, reuters reports. This certainly doesn't mean comedians are psychotic, says lead author gordon claridge. Here's his assessment: \" the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis — both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Although schizophrenic psychosis itself can be detrimental to humor, in its lesser form it can increase people's ability to associate odd or unusual things or to think ' outside the box '. Equally, manic thinking — which is common in people with bipolar disorder — may help people combine ideas to form new, original and humorous connections. \" for comedians who may have some psychotic traits, \" their comedy is almost an outlet for that, \" claridge tells the bbc. But a psychiatrist downplays the findings: \" people with psychosis and schizophrenia have a very impaired ability to appreciate humorous material. This study tells us some interesting things about the differences between comedians and actors but not about the link with psychosis. \"",

Researchers at cedars-sinai heart institute reported sunday at an american heart association conference that only one in every 100 cases of sudden cardiac arrest in men occurred after sexual activity. But 94 % of those victims had a history of heart disease, nbc news reports. The study, to be published in the journal of the american college of cardiology, was the first to look at whether sexual exertion can trigger a heart attack, notes live science. Fear of post-sex heart failure has been bolstered by plot lines on tv shows like mad men, but in reality, \" the risk is very small, \" senior author dr. Sumeet chugh tells nbc. Chugh's team analyzed 4,557 cardiac arrests that occurred between 2002 and 2015, and found that 34 happened within one hour of sexual intercourse. Sudden cardiac arrest, which killed tom petty, takes place when an electrical impulse goes haywire and the heart stops beating. There are often no warning signs. Still, the danger is far greater for men: only two of the heart attacks studied involved women. The majority of victims were middle-aged and african-american men, per the bbc. But cpr can make a life-or-death difference. Cpr was performed in only one-third of cases studied, prompting chugh to urge the \" importance of ( teaching ) bystander cpr for sudden cardiac arrest, irrespective of the circumstance. \" another study found that children as young as 6 can learn cpr, per the bbc. ( a boy with an unusual condition went into cardiac arrest after biting into a hot dog. )",

It's been almost a week since the storm hit, and in that time utility companies have restored power to 92 % of homes, according to entergy — meaning nearly 57,000 homes are still without power. Residents are furious, the new orleans times-picayune reports; at least one 90-year-old has died of heat stroke in his powerless home. Some impatient new orleans residents even took matters into their own hands, sneaking out at night to cut up a massive felled tree that had hit a power line — a feat that the paper says has made them \" folk heroes \" in their neighborhood. There has also been significant flooding, an all-too-familiar situation for some residents. One resident says that when the insurance company asked for details about the flood, \" i told them, you can just use my claim from aug. 29 seven years ago. \"",

As the paper explains, brian cullinan and martha ruiz are the two pwc partners who stand at opposite ends of the academy awards stage with the envelopes containing the winners, ready to hand said envelopes to the appropriate presenters — and both hold a full set of envelopes, because they don't know for certain in advance which side of the stage presenters will walk in from. Immediately prior to the best picture award being presented, ruiz had handed the best actress envelope to presenter leonardo dicaprio, who then read it onstage and presented the oscar to emma stone for la la land, sources tell the journal. Cullinan, who still had an identical best actress envelope in his stack, then apparently handed that envelope instead of the best picture envelope to presenter warren beatty. About three minutes before beatty and co-presenter faye dunaway walked onstage to present the best picture award, cullinan tweeted a photo of stone holding her oscar along with the caption, \" best actress emma stone backstage! #pwc. \" the journal says cullinan had tweeted other photos during the awards show, but all of them, including the photo of stone, have since been removed from his twitter feed. ( the journal has a screenshot of the stone tweet. ) \" at the end of the day, we made a human error, \" the us chairman and senior partner of pwc tells usa today. He acknowledges cullinan handed the wrong envelope to beatty, though no mention was made of the tweeting, which tmz says might have \" distracted \" cullinan. The senior partner also tells variety that cullinan \" feels very, very terrible and horrible. He is very upset about this mistake.

Meanwhile, boehner is warning his fellow republicans that if the government shuts down, the democrats \" win. \" at a meeting of house republicans last night, boehner and dozens of other gop lawmakers, some of whom served in congress during the 1995 shutdowns, argued that those shutdowns \" guaranteed president clinton's reelection, \" as one rep tells politico. \" and that's what this would do.

Text size - + reset audio: catanese on shutdown video: obama on shutdown politico 44 boehner's opinion was quickly backed up gop lawmakers who were serving in congress during 1995, when former speaker newt gingrich ( r-ga. ) squared off with then-president bill clinton by shutting down the government twice. Reps. Don young ( alaska ), dana rohrabacher ( calif. ) and buck mckeon ( calif. ) — a close ally — supported boehner's position. Dozens of other republicans rallied to support boehner as well, in a moment that one gop insider called a \"turning point \" for house republicans. \"my view is that a government shutdown doesn't benefit anyone necessarily, but if one party or the other is going to get an edge, it's probably the democrats. I agree with the speaker there, \" rep. Steve latourette ( r-ohio ) told politico. \"if you look at the government shutdown of 1995",
            "The first federal government shutdown in more than 15 years drew closer tuesday as president obama and congressional leaders failed to make progress on a budget for 2011 after back-to-back meetings at the white house and on capitol hill. Obama and congress remained billions of dollars apart and at odds over where to find savings after an 80-minute west wing meeting that included house speaker john a. Boehner ( r-ohio ) and senate majority leader harry m. Reid ( d-nev. ). In the meeting, boehner floated the possibility that he may seek as much as $ 40 billion in cuts, $ 7 billion more than the two sides have been discussing for the past week. Growing irked by the prolonged negotiations, obama demanded that the congressional leaders \"act like grown-ups. \" \"if they can't sort it out, then i want them back here tomorrow. And if that doesn't work, we ' ll invite them again the day after that, \" obama told reporters in a rare appearance in the press room, hours after the meeting. The president invited congressional leaders back to the white house on wednesday, but he is scheduled to spend much of the day traveling and, as of late tuesday, no meeting had been finalized. Boehner, who watched obama's remarks in his capitol suites, pledged to keep talking. His aides deflected reports"

Npr describes the surgery on the rhesus macaques thusly: a neurosurgeon \" placed electrodes in the part of the monkey's brain that controls leg movement, and docked a wireless transmitter on the outside of his skull. Then, she put another set of electrodes along the spinal cord, below the injury. \" the idea is that the brain device beams instructions to the spine, which tells the legs to move. Using this \" brain-spine interface, \" they used electrical activity they recorded in the monkeys'spinal cords prior to the injuries and \" played it back \" to restore movement. \" that's an approach that wouldn't be practical after an actual spinal-cord injury, \" says the lead researcher. \" the whole team was screaming in the room as we watched, \" the lead researcher, who travels between switzerland and china ( where regulations are more lenient on experimenting with primates ) tells nature news. Experts around the world have seen many failed experiments to restore walking over the years, and while the rhythm of the leg movement wasn't totally natural, the monkeys were able to support their weight enough to walk on a treadmill without dragging their feet. A small clinical trial is already underway in switzerland for two people with spinal cord injuries to further test the interface. \" it will take at least another decade in order to achieve the full translation in humans, with no guarantee whatsoever that it will be a successful endeavor, \" says the lead researcher.

Days after authorities confirmed a florida man died when his vape pen exploded, sending projectiles into his brain, a study published in the journal pediatrics tells of an 18-year-old pennsylvania woman who ended up in an emergency room with a cough and stabbing chest pains after trying vaping for only a few weeks. The condition of the unnamed woman with mild asthma only worsened after she was given antibiotics. She eventually suffered respiratory failure and had to be put on a breathing machine because \" she was unable to get enough oxygen into her blood from her lungs, \" one of her doctors, daniel weiner of the university of pittsburgh medical center, tells cnn. The woman also required tubes in her chest to drain fluid from her lungs — a result of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, otherwise known as wet lung. The condition is marked by an inflammation of the lungs caused by an allergen, like dust. In this case, doctors blame the chemicals in the e-cigarette the woman used, perhaps including propylene glycol, glycerin, and nicotine. Casey sommerfeld, another of the woman's doctors, notes the immune response to such irritants \" can lead to increased inflammation and ' leaky ' blood vessels, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs. \" however, the study authors note \" this is the first reported case of [ wet lung ] and acute respiratory distress syndrome as a risk of e-cigarette use in an adolescent, and it should prompt pediatricians to discuss the potential harms of vaping with their patients, \" per the sacramento bee. Given a drug for severe allergic reactions, the woman in this case was back to breathing on her own after five days. ( \" dripping \" is another vape-related concern. )",

The idea of a government team was first floated last summer, and reports say officials will begin manning the post in march or april — a year after a fight broke out between climbers and sherpas some 20,000 feet in the air. \" this will make it easy to resolve any conflict, \" a tourism ministry official told reuters. \" the presence of security officials at the base camp will give a psychological feeling to climbers that they are safe. \" reuters notes that, previously, each climbing team was assigned a government employee, but those liaisons often declined to head to the 17,550-foot base camp with their team. The government officials will also help enforce rules, rescue climbers, and clean up the garbage that's piling up. Meanwhile, national geographic notes nepal is dramatically lowering everest's climbing fee from $ 25,000 to $ 11,000 per climber. The move eliminates the rule that allowed seven climbers to get a permit for just $ 70,000, and will be put in place in 2015 to \" discourage artificially formed groups, where the leader does not even know some of the members of the team, \" an official told reuters. \" it will promote responsible and serious climbers. \"",

            "Mount everest ( c ), the world highest peak, and other peaks of the himalayan range are seen from air during a mountain flight from kathmandu april 24, 2010. The flowing waters of niagara falls turn to ice as the temperature drops. Kathmandu ( reuters ) - nepal will cut climbing fees for mount everest to lure more mountaineers to the world's highest peak, already overcrowded during the peak climbing season. Hundreds of foreign climbers, each paying thousands of dollars, flock to the 8,850-metre ( 29,035 feet ) everest summit during the main climbing season stretching from march to may. Under existing rules, nepal charges $ 25,000 per climber as a licence fee, or royalty. But a group of seven people can secure a permit for $ 70,000, a practice officials say encourages climbers to form big groups. Tourism ministry official tilakram pandey said each climber will be charged $",
            "News that the nepalese government is lowering the fee for climbing mount everest has set the mountaineering world abuzz. Last week, nepal's ministry of culture, tourism and civil aviation announced that it would cut the fee it charges during the spring season from $ 25,000 to $ 11,000 per climber. Though still not cheap, the new fee structure would appear to make an everest expedition somewhat more affordable and thereby available to more climbers. But veteran himalayan guides say a closer look at the numbers tells a different story and raises old questions about safety and the economic health of the area surrounding the world's tallest mountain. Since new zealander edmund hillary and sherpa tensing norgay stood atop mount everest's 29,035-foot ( 8,850-meter ) peak in 1953, more than 4,000 people have followed. Many have paid upwards of $ 50,000 for the privilege. Ever since commercial guiding became popular on",

Some of the night's highlights: both candidates came out of the gate ready to rumble, with each one playing the role of defender for their respective running mates. The ap notes that the \" usually easygoing \" kaine went after pence right from the get-go, to which the \" unflappable \" pence did a lot of head-shaking, laughing, and lobbing accusations of a kaine-clinton \" insult-driven campaign. \" kaine did get in zingers ( or what pence at one point called an extension of the democratic campaign's \" avalanche of insults ), including saying that donald trump \" loves dictators \" — \" he's got like a personal mount rushmore: vladimir putin, kim jong un, moammar gadhafi, and saddam hussein \" — and claiming that clinton would be a \" you're hired \" president, while trump would be a \" you're fired \" president, tapping into trump's oft-used line from the apprentice. Pence dismissed kaine's lobs as \" pre-done \" lines, per abc news. Trump's tax returns were broached, with pence noting his running mate had faced some \" pretty tough times \" in the mid- ' 90s ( including apparently taking a $ 1b loss in 1995 ), but that he worked the tax code \" brilliantly \" to his advantage. Kaine, however, said trump should release his tax returns, audit or no audit, noting the gop nominee should at least meet the \" nixon standard, \" per cnn. ( nixon tried to keep his tax records from the public for similar auditing reasons in 1973. ) russian president vladimir putin also entered the conversation, with kaine accusing trump of calling putin a better leader than president obama, and pence deflecting those accusations. \" putin's run his economy into the ground, he persecutes lgbt folks and journalists, \" kaine said, per the los angeles times. \" if you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you have got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. \"",

By way of explanation, the republican presidential nominee claimed that mitt romney had lost the 2012 election because he had bowed to pressure from the obama campaign and disclosed his filings. Perhaps. But for the past 40 years, almost every presidential candidate has released his ( or her ) tax returns in advance of the general election. Even though there's no law that mandates this transparency, disclosure has become an accepted part of presidential politics, and trump's demurral has sparked widespread condemnation, including from the billionaire investor warren buffett.

        "summary": "When nfl owners got together last month, the cowboys ' jerry jones floated a provocative idea, reports nbc sports. He suggested the league lift its prohibition on marijuana and let players indulge. If the league is smart, it will listen, writes christopher ingraham in the washington post. Jones may be worried in part about losing players to suspensions, but ingraham has a different rationale: saving lives. As things stand now, teams are happy to dole out opioids to players, even though research has shown they do little to relieve the pain so common to the game. What's worse, opioids run the real risk of getting players hooked. Marijuana, on the other hand, has been shown to help with pain, with nothing close to the health risks of opioids. \" the nfl, in other words, is pumping its players full of highly addictive and deadly substances that are of dubious use for treating the long-term, chronic pain suffered by so many players — and fining and suspending players who choose instead to self-medicate with a less-addictive and nonlethal substance, \" writes ingraham. The prospects of jones'suggestion actually happening are unclear. All would have to be worked out in labor negotiations between owners and players, and espn reports that players, perhaps surprisingly, may not want to do away with marijuana testing altogether. If players test above a certain level, for example, it may suggest a problem that needs to be addressed. The report sums up an idea being kicked around by the players ' union thusly: \" let's still test for it, but let's do it in a constructive and less punitive way. \"",

Sitting at mr. Obama's side in the oval office, leaning toward him and at times looking him directly in the eye, the israeli leader bluntly rejected compromises of the sort mr.

Officials said that the meeting was productive, but that there were no plans for formal negotiations or any mechanisms in place to push the two sides forward. Most significant among his public objections, mr. Netanyahu said that israel would not accept a return to the boundaries that existed before the war in 1967 gave it control of the west bank and gaza, calling them indefensible. On thursday, mr. Obama said for the first time that those borders should to be the starting point for negotiations to create a palestinian state, though he emphasized that they would be adjusted to some degree through land swaps to account for israeli settlements. Mr. Netanyahu simply ignored that nuance — as did many conservative critics here in washington — further exacerbating tensions with the administration. \"remember that before 1967, israel was all of nine miles wide; it's half the width of the washington beltway, \" mr. Netanyahu said. He was referring to the narrowest point between the west bank and the mediterranean sea, north of tel aviv, while displaying a well-honed familiarity with american cultural references to make his point for an american audience. \"these were not the boundaries of peace. They were the boundaries of repeated wars. \" if mr. Obama and his aides hoped his speech on thursday would give fresh momentum to the peace process, mr.
