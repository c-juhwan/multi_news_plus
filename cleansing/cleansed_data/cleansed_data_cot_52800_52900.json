        "summary": "An initiative to raise the minimum wage in oklahoma city has been thwarted by a new law banning cities in the state from setting their own minimum wages or requirements for vacation days. A petition being circulated in the city called for raising the local minimum wage to $ 10.10 — the level president obama is pushing — from the current federal requirement of $ 7.25, the oklahoman reports. The coalition behind the petition says it is considering a constitutional challenge to the new law. Gov. Mary fallin, who signed the bill into law, rejected the argument that allowing cities to raise the minimum wage would bring people out of poverty, saying having different minimum wages across the state could scare off businesses and a higher minimum wage would cost jobs. \" most minimum wage workers are young, single people working part-time or entry-level jobs, \" she said. \" many are high school or college students living with their parents in middle-class families. \" numerous studies, however, have found this to be untrue, al jazeera notes. A recent economic policy institute report found that almost 90 % of minimum wage workers are over 20, a quarter have children to support, and more than half work full time.",

Now scientists have proof that a microbial component of \" terroir \" — wine lingo for the individual regional conditions — has an impact, too. Reporting in the journal scientific reports, researchers say they isolated the six major related strains of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ( yeast is a microbe, which the afp describes as a \" brainless, single-celled organism \" ) found at all six of new zealand's wine-producing regions and inoculated those 36 strains into sterilized sauvignon blanc grape juice to begin the process of fermentation. \" we controlled for absolutely everything else other than these microbes, \" one researcher tells the scientist, \" and then we asked: what are the wines that result from those strains? \" the intention was to see whether the genetic differences in the strains had an impact on the wine's taste and smell, but instead of using subjective taste testing, the researchers chemically profiled the resulting wines. And while these signatures showed tons of overlap, they also betrayed regional distinctiveness, with the profiles of wines produced by yeast strains from the same region clustering together. It wasn't the result study co-author matthew goddard was expecting. \" the idea that microbes might play a role in terroir is new, \" he tells afp, \" and we think this is the first time that it has been experimentally shown that this is the case. \" the researchers further determined that \" most of the ' fruity ' notes in wine are in fact derived from yeast not the fruit. \" ( read about three really detestable wine habits. )",

        "summary": "As doctors shift away from drawing vials of blood from patients and rely on lab-on-a-chip diagnostics that identify a myriad of conditions using a single drop of blood, there's now concern that not all of your blood is equal. A new study in the american journal of clinical pathology suggests \" caution when using measurements from a single drop of fingerprick blood, \" write researchers at rice 360 ° institute for global health: our blood can change rather dramatically from one drop to the next. Researchers tested seven drops of blood from each of 10 participants and analyzed them for basic health metrics such as platelet counts and hemoglobin, and found a pretty wide range of results — so much so that they had to average the results from six to nine drops to rival the accuracy of a larger blood draw from a vein, reports the new york times. \" if you're going to take a fingerprick stick to get your measures, you need to be aware that you're sacrificing some accuracy, \" one of the researchers warns. The results have implications for startups like theranos and genalyte, which hope to diagnose diseases using only one drop. Unlike theranos, however, genalyte has produced results via peer-reviewed studies on tests to find autoimmune diseases such as lupus, reports fast company.

The 25-year-old escaped after the mass shooting in charsadda district, and police sources tell the nation that he was already a fugitive for killing his parents and two brothers in november last year in what is believed to have been a dispute over a dowry settlement for the proposed marriage to his cousin. Dawn has a slightly different take on events before the massacre: the newspaper's sources say ahmed allegedly killed his parents, a brother, and his sister-in-law on the orders of his uncle, then killed the uncle and his family after he kept delaying the wedding for assorted reasons. Ahmed reportedly had accomplices when he carried out the pre-dawn shooting, and entry points to neighboring regions to which he might try to flee have been tightened.

The memorial is dedicated to the nearly 3,000 people killed in the september 11, 2001 attacks and six victims of a first attack on the twin towers in 1993. The 78-year-old argentine pontiff clasped his hands together and bowed his head in prayer at one of the two reflecting pools built in tribute to the worst terror attack on us soil. After he placed a white rose on the edge of the pool, on which the names of the victims of the 9/11 attacks are inscribed, the crowd broke into chants of \" francisco, francisco. \" the pope spoke to a group of 9/11 families and responders, before he was to descend into the memorial. He will offer a prayer of remembrance with around 700 representatives of different faiths. The memorial occupies eight of the 16 acres on the world trade center site, where the twin towers were destroyed in the al-qaeda attacks that killed 2,753 people."

            "Pope francis wrapped-up his big day in new york city by rocking the garden. The leader of the roman catholic church took over the home of the new york knicks, liberty and rangers on friday and transformed the sports shrine into a holy hall. \"god is living in our cities, \" francis said in spanish. The 24,000 worshippers packing madison square garden did something that's not usually done at masses — they burst into applause. Live blog: the daily news follows the pope in new york \"in big cities, beneath the roar of traffic, beneath the rapid pace of change, so many faces pass by unnoticed because they have no right to be there, no right to be part of the city, \" francis continued. \" they are the foreigners, their children who go without school, those deprived medical insurance, the homeless, the forgotten elderly. \" embrace them and \"go out and show that god is in your midst, \" francis said. \"knowing that jesus still walks our streets, that he is vitally a part of the lives of his people, that he is involved with us in a vast history of salvation, fills us with hope, \" he said. And with those words, francis hammered some of the same points he has been making ever since he began his pilgrimage to the u.s. On tuesday. God, he said, \"frees us from anonymity, from a life of emptiness and selfishness. \" thousands cheer as pope francis rides through central park. ( justin sullivan/getty images ) still",

One relative described the goodbye as \" torture, \" while another collapsed in agony, reports the bbc. Though it was believed frenchman serge atlaoui would be executed, indonesia's ag says an outstanding appeal will save his life for now. It isn't clear when the executions will occur, but protocol suggests the inmates could be shot by a firing squad just after midnight local time. Some in australia, including actor guy pearce, have criticized prime minister tony abbott for failing to visit indonesia and bring home its two nationals, myuran sukumaran and andrew chan, who were caught trying to smuggle heroin out of the country in 2005. Chan married his indonesian christian pastor yesterday. \" clearly if traveling to indonesia would make a difference, we would have gone there, \" australia's foreign minister says, adding \" while they are still alive, there is still hope. \" the bbc reports indonesia indicated it would not stay the two inmates ' executions despite a corruption investigation into the case.

It turns out that the ocean is not only warm, it seems to have the same kind of hydrothermal activity going on as oceans on earth, reports nasa. Bottom line: \" this may be the place to go look for life in the outer solar system, \" says a cornell scientist not involved with the new study in nature. That would be microbial life, under conditions similar to those in a network of hot springs under the atlantic ocean known as the \" lost city, \" reports ap. Some scientists think that ancient hydrothermal field yielded the first life on our planet. Some extra-terrestrial sleuthing resulted in the enceladus discovery: knowing that a geyser shooting up from the moon's south pole sends up dust particles that settle on saturn's outer ring, researchers analyzed the outer ring. They discovered that the dust particles were mostly silica, explains popular mechanics, and the makeup of that silica yielded details about the ocean in which they were formed. \" we think that the temperature at least in some part of the ocean must be higher than 190 degrees fahrenheit, \" team member sean hsu tells npr. \" if you could swim a little bit further from the really hot part then it could be comfy. \" the only way to \" nail the habitability question \" is to send up a new spacecraft to enceladus with more modern instruments, says the cornell researcher.

Mastering the constant connection of the internet era, gaga generated countless mini-sensations through her style, her videos, and her music, cultivating a devoted audience she dubbed \" little monsters. \" but it wasn't just a cult that turned her 2008 manifesto the fame into a self-fulfilling prophecy: gaga crossed over into the mainstream, ushering out one pop epoch and kick-starting a new one, quickly making such turn-of-the-century stars as christina aguilera and britney spears seem old-fashioned, quite a trick for any artist to pull off, but especially impressive for an artist who specialized in repurposing the past -- particularly the ' 80s -- for present use, creating sustainable pop for a digital world. Perhaps unsurprisingly given her flair for grand gestures,",
            "Lady gaga is on the promotional trail — and she's dressed to kill. Last night, she launched her newest album, artpop, which boasts collaborations with all sorts of artists, and arrived at the launch party wearing nothing less than a flying dress. The brains behind the flying frock — think hexacopter-style aerial drone up top, attached to a platform with a fiberglass bodice and skirt — is techhaus, part of the haus of gaga. The dress, which gaga calls volantis, seems to be a symbol of the voices of today's youth. \" i wanted to make today about something even more important to me, and that something is the youth of the world, \" gaga said. \" their minds are just so boundless. They're just so inspiring. \" though details of the singer's plans for the transport system were few,",
            "In anticipation of her new album, artpop, lady gaga plans to reach new heights, literally. As part of artrave, gaga's fashion, music, art, and tech mash-up party tonight in a brooklyn warehouse, gaga will soar above her audiences in a flying dress called volantis. Volantis was conceived by studio xo in gaga's techhaus. It has six booms in a hex formation and is powered by 50 volts of batteries. The dress also has a carbon fiber molded casket designed to mimic a fitted couture dress. This futuristic machine will make gaga fly. Update nov. 10 6: 47 p.m. Et: lady gaga steps into volantis. Update nov. 10 6: 58 p.m. Et: gaga lifts off! related: lady gaga's top art moments related: 10 things no one told you about lady gaga's artrave"

All were taken to a russian navy base in sevastopol, where russian military questioned them about their activities. \" i was having long political discussions with my polite interrogators, \" said butko. The russians even let her go out with russian journalists, hoping she would speak well of russia later, but the trio seemed unconvinced after being freed: \" i would not advise any activists to go to crimea these days, \" said one.

It also alleges that black employees have been subjected to racial slurs from their superiors. Two other black cnn employees have sued the network for discrimination this year, the hill reports.

He says they have delayed deploying the autonomous underwater vehicle bluefin-21 to search for wreckage because with time running out, they don't want anything to get in the way of the signals. In another promising development, authorities have analyzed the pings detected over the weekend and confirmed that they came from electronic equipment, with signals consistent with those of flight data recorders, cnn reports.",

If the person being \" bombed \" falls fast and hard it can be harder to see that shift. Love bombers, by the way, are narcissists, and they're usually men. In psychology today, psychiatrist dale archer dates the term \" love bombing \" to the 1970s, when unification church of the united states ( aka the \" moonies \" ) first used it. Cult leaders like david koresh and charles manson would employ this tactic to woo followers and then con them into nefarious acts. Archer argues that idealization isn't necessarily harmful when it grows over time, but that the \" common thread \" in love bombing is intense courtship and idealization over just a matter of days or weeks. Soon, \" love bombers exploit the natural human need for self worth, and turn it into shame, regret, and self-loathing. \" ( one study finds that men tend to feel more entitled and be more narcissistic than women. )",

Some critics, however, say it's the nypd that's in the wrong. At gawker today, andy cush delivers this scathing assessment: the department \" is too childish and entitled to deserve its privileged status, and too aggrieved and resentful to be called ' new york's finest.'the new york police department is an embarrassment to the city of new york. \" de blasio's main offense in the eyes of the nypd came after the non-indictment in the eric garner case, when he said that his son needs to be especially careful around police because he's black. After the police union blamed the mayor for the subsequent murder of two officers, the new york times made the case that rank-and-file officers deserve better from their union reps. \" mr. De blasio isn't going to say it, but somebody has to: with these acts of passive-aggressive contempt and self-pity, many new york police officers, led by their union, are squandering the department's credibility, defacing its reputation, shredding its hard-earned respect, \" it says in an editorial. \" they have taken the most grave and solemn of civic moments — a funeral of a fallen colleague — and hijacked it for their own petty look-at-us gesture. \" on the flip side, a new york post editorial says de blasio still owes the city an apology for \" his public insinuations that the nypd is a racist force. \" the mayor was meeting today with leaders of the five police unions to try to calm things down.",

His father — who was being interviewed by nancy grace when he was informed his son had been found — says he had no idea that charlie was in the basement.

Two other children, a 4-year-old and a 10-month-old, have been removed from the home, and charlie has been released to his mother's custody.

Today five women describe his purported attacks in blood-curdling detail to the washington post, with some saying they were drugged before the encounter and others claiming they screamed, tried fighting him off, or said they would fight him to the death ( in that case, he allegedly threw two hundred-dollar bills at model tamara green and walked out ). Victoria valentino — an ex-playboy playmate speaking up for the first time — says he drugged her and a friend with red pills in 1970. Then he \" opened his fly and grabbed my head and pushed my head down. And then he turned me over. It was like a waking nightmare. \" but she never pressed charges: \" what kind of credibility did i have? \" denials by cosby lawyers pepper the article, as do quotes from a friend, a writer, and a district attorney who say they heard the women's accusations years ago. The post also looks at cosby's marriage to camille cosby, saying \" it's unclear how much camille knew about her husband's activities \" since six of the alleged sexual assaults occurred at his house. She was reportedly aware of his \" selfish \" behavior in los angeles, which contrasted with his upstanding life on the east coast as a man studying for a phd and sitting on a board at temple university. Yet even there, a temple employee accuses him of drugging her with blue pills and sexually assaulting her. In other cosby news: ex-nbc employee frank scotti tells the daily news that during the cosby show's heyday, he guarded cosby's dressing-room door while the comedy star hosted young models. Scotti says he then paid off the women with money orders using cash provided by cosby ( he produces the money orders ). \" he had everybody fooled, \" says scotti. \" nobody suspected. \" when cosby appeared on the late show with david letterman, he asked female staffers to do an odd thing: watch him eat curry, gawker reports.

She was so eye-popping that mexico's election commission apologized. \" we are sorry about the production error associated with the clothing of one of the assistants, and want to apologize to the citizens and candidates, \" said a commission statement. An independent production company hired the former playboy playmate — who held a box with paper slips for the candidates to pick from that determined who would go first — and she was allowed to choose her own dress, reports the bbc. In fact, such women are fixtures in many political, entertainment, and business events in mexico, and are considered a nod to the machismo culture, notes the los angeles times. Known as edecans, they're frequently long-haired, beautiful women in sexy dresses and heels who serve as hostesses. An election commission member blasted the \" outrageous stereotype \" that overshadowed the presidential debate. The tight-fitting gown was \" not in keeping with the seriousness of the debate, \" added presidential candidate josefina vazquez mota.",

It's unclear what relationship she and the man have, but some reports say she is his estranged wife. Asked whether the hijacking involved romance, the cyprian president laughed and said, \" always, there is a woman involved. \" however, much confusion surrounded the incident, with the bbc citing reports that he had asked for the release of female prisoners in egypt. There was also some confusion about the identity of the hijacker, who reportedly claimed to have explosives on him and had allowed most of the passengers to leave the plane upon landing. At a news conference prior to the arrest, egypt's civil aviation minister refused to identify him. Earlier, an egyptian government spokesman offered up a name, but an egyptian woman who identified herself as his wife said her husband is not the hijacker and was on his way to cairo so he could fly to the us to attend a conference.

        "summary": "Israel has paid its final respects to divisive former leader ariel sharon, who died over the weekend after eight years in a coma. World leaders and israeli officials gathered for a state memorial service in jerusalem, which will be followed by a second funeral service at the sharon family ranch near the gaza border where he will be buried next to his wife, reports the guardian. The israeli military says two rockets were fired from gaza just before the service but they do not appear to have landed in israel, the ap reports. Critics denounce sharon as a war criminal but funeral speakers including joe biden and tony blair were full of praise at the jerusalem service, reports reuters. Biden paid tribute to sharon's decision to pull out of the gaza strip, while acknowledging that he had serious differences with us leaders. \" the security of his people was always arik's unwavering mission — an unbreakable commitment to the future of jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now, \" biden said, describing sharon as a complex man who lived in complex times. \" arik was never uncertain. But there were times when he acted, and those actions earned him controversy and even condemnation, \" he said. \" and in certain instances american leaders, american presidents, had profound differences with him. And they were never shy about stating them. Nor was he ever shy about stating his position. \"",

The east liverpool department says officer chris green got some of the powder on his skin after a drug bust and suffered an accidental overdose, reports wfmj. He ended up in the hospital but is ok after multiple doses of the overdose-reversal drug narcan. Green had participated in the arrest of two men friday night who were suspected of conducting a drug deal inside a car. When cops blocked their vehicle, police say the men began trying to dispose of the evidence, and white powder ended up all over the inside of their car. Officers donned protective gear in collecting evidence from the scene, and accounts differ on how green got some of the powder on his skin. The best guess is that some ended up on his shirt and he wiped it off with his bare hand, reports wkbn. \" just out of instinct, he tried to brush it off — not thinking, \" says a police captain. Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, and green quickly began suffering the effects. Meanwhile, justin buckle, 25, and cortez collins, 24, face drug charges after their friday night arrests.",

Pistorius in particular comes off as an egomaniac with long-standing anger issues. \" when pistorius competed at the london olympics, last summer, ( a radio host ) interviewed the athlete's roommate at the olympic village: 'what is it like to sleep in the same room with a superstar?

The new york times calls it \" a major environmental victory for the obama administration, \" and scotusblog agrees that it's a \" clear victory for the epa. \" the result is that about 1,000 power plants will have to put into place new pollution controls to limit nitrogen and sulfur emissions, reports the guardian. The problem of air pollution blowing from coal-burning states into states downwind — think ohio and kentucky vs. Connecticut and new york — is a complex one, ginsburg wrote, and the epa must have the leeway to deal with the \" vagaries of the wind. \" she thinks the epa got it right with its current formula, though antonin scalia disagreed in his dissent.

The court's 6-2 decision unblocks a 2011 rule requiring 28 eastern states to reduce power-plant emissions that carry smog and soot particles across state lines, hurting the air quality in downwind states. Justice ruth bader ginsburg, writing the court's majority opinion, said the epa's formula for dealing with cross-state air pollution was \"permissable, workable and equitable \". Justice samuel alito recused himself, and justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas dissented.

But a new analysis of 619 deaths since 2011 by the green bay press-gazette raises that number to at least 46 dogs, with 18 others succumbing to heatstroke during other activities ( e.g., training exercises, being tethered outside in the sun ), putting heatstroke as the no. 1 cause of police dog deaths for non-medical reasons. Failures in the cars ' ac or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases, while officer negligence was blamed in 26. One especially egregious case in 2013 involved 10 us customs and border protection dogs who died after the ac failed. \" those dogs were essentially in an oven, \" a rep said at the time. \" you don't have to be an animal lover to be sick about this. \" it's unclear exactly how many police dogs die this way, since agencies don't have to report it, the press-gazette notes; instead, stats are typically culled from memorial websites and other sources. \" it is a painful, horrible death, \" a veterinary specialist told buzzfeed.

But advocates say it comes down to human diligence. \" it's not a matter of changing policy, \" the director of a wisconsin canine handler group tells the press-gazette. \" check on your dog. \" an animal legal defense fund director puts it in harsher terms: \" an officer who allows a dog to die of heat exhaustion on duty is as neglectful as leaving a service revolver on a school playground. \" ( a florida officer was \" distraught \" after two police dogs died in his car. )",

Roger freeman of federal way a second term with about 53 % of the vote, nbc news notes. There's just one problem: the 48-year-old freeman died last week after a long battle with colon cancer, the seattle times reports. Many voters either didn't know freeman had died or had already sent in their ballots, the washington post reports. \" i did not know that. When did he pass away? \" one voter told kval. \" this is extremely rare, \" a spokesman for washington's secretary of state tells nbc. \" but there are protocols in place. \" those protocols would be much simpler if voters had simply elected the very much alive republican candidate, jack dovey. However, since freeman is apparently the victor, democrats in the district will pick three names to serve as his temporary replacement; the county councils will then vote one of those candidates in to serve for one year, with a special election next year to pick someone for the final year of the two-year term, nbc notes. Dovey, now known as the challenger beat by a deceased candidate, simply tells kval, \" it's a tragic thing that happened. \" ( this county candidate dropped out of the race after his dead friend supposedly voted for him. )",

Police have closed a stretch of state route 374 and ordered residents of cadyville, ny, to stay inside and keep their exterior lights on, residents tell wptz. In other developments: timothy vail was the last man to escape from a new york prison, according to the new york daily news, and he says he hopes matt and sweat can avoid capture. He tells the daily news that he hopes they \" stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes. \" vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the elmira correctional facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the rochester democrat and chronicle reports. The former chief of police in north tonawanda, near where matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before matt's first arrest, he had a \" fearsome \" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986 — 11 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder — matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later. Early reports described the pair as among the first to escape in the clinton correctional facility's long history, but dozens of men have made it out in various ways since the forbidding dannemora, ny, institution opened in 1845, the new york times reports. In 1860, a fraudster known as the \" gay deceiver \" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened. The reform-minded warden decided not to punish the two men after they were recaptured, the professor says, but it wasn't long before a new warden installed a dungeon for solitary confinement, where punishments included waterboarding.",

            "The festival of green screen that is \" bitch slap \" is surely intended to be a fond tribute to any number of hot-women-in-peril movies. Think zack snyder meets roger corman. Meets christopher nolan. Seriously. But when it offers only scant humor ( and costumes ) and interminable girl-fighting, isn't that actually just another entry in the genre?there is a plot, for those who look beyond the belles and whistling, but it has something to do with buried treasure and the cia and other stuff like that, in a structure borrowed from \" memento, \" so the less said, the better. This movie's raison d ' être bursts forth in close-up after close-up lovingly caressing the assets of its actresses. And they are appropriately cast as the three stupefyingly sexed-up conspirators/combatants/abrupt make-out session participants.there are moments of enjoyment -- the oh-so-gratuitous water fight, the lusty sadism of the most unhinged of the three, and did i mention the abrupt make-out session? there's plenty not to enjoy as well, including a surfeit of fistfights. The target audience must be that awfully precise niche that never tires of women punching each other. The film also suffers from the lack of zoë bell; it's the latest film",

The ancient library was committed to protecting its most valuable works. That spirit of protection continues on in the restoration of khizanat al-qarawiyyin. Chaouni and her team have added underground canals and temperature controls to keep unwanted moisture from the ancient texts, some of which date back to the 600s. They've also added a machine to keep the works just moist enough to prevent cracking. Of the 4,000 or so books the restoration is protecting, the most valuable is a copy of the koran written on camel skin from the ninth century, bustle reports. The library is scheduled to reopen by 2017 — five years after the restoration project began. Chaouni hopes it will be embraced by the people \" like a second home. \" ( researchers made a \" fantastically exciting \" koran discovery at a library last year. )",

        "summary": "Lauren mccluskey's killer was a master manipulator who penned messages under various names — even posed as a police officer — in an effort to lure and extort the 21-year-old university of utah student before her death, according to police. Nine days before she was fatally shot on campus by an ex-boyfriend later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, mccluskey told university police she'd wired $ 1,000 to an account to prevent the release of \" compromising \" photos of her and the killer, 37-year-old melvin rowland, says university police chief dale brophy, per fox news and espn. Mccluskey had ended her relationship with the registered sex offender days earlier after discovering he'd lied about his background. \" if his lips were moving, he was lying, \" brophy says of rowland, who described himself as a manipulator of women at a 2012 parole hearing. Rowland told an acquaintance, for example, that he needed a gun because his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot, reports cbs news. After shooting mccluskey multiple times in the backseat of a car he'd driven to campus, rowland was picked up by a woman he'd met online. Before she recognized him as the murder suspect and called police, the pair went to dinner and back to the woman's apartment where rowland showered before leaving, brophy says. Meanwhile, the investigation into mccluskey's extortion complaint had been delayed by workload issues, and the utah department of corrections had yet to be notified. Gov. Gary herbert announced an investigation into the handling of the case on thursday. Hindsight is 20/20, but \" you never know when these things are going to occur, \" he said.

        "summary": "The information is readily available online: the mugshot of a female inmate, the charges she was convicted on, and her release date. And predators are using it, finds the guardian in an investigation. It reports that sex traffickers are both wooing \" potential victims while they are still behind bars \" and even preying on them before they get there by manipulating the bail bond system. The guardian found cases where pimps paid women's bail — alerted to their situation, again, by online records or nefarious bondsmen — only to force them into sex work to \" pay off \" that debt in florida, texas, ohio, north carolina, and mississippi. And it's not occasional, according to a former florida prosecutor who tells the guardian that all but about 20 % of the sex trafficking cases she handled in 2016 involved these bondsmen working with traffickers. For the women already in prison, the traffickers use letters and calls to reel them in. In a companion piece, the guardian shares kate's story: while incarcerated at florida's lowell correctional institution, a stranger named richard rawls began to write to her, saying he saw her mugshot online and that it stuck with him. He knew she'd be out soon. He told her to \" come on home to your daddy, \" that he would provide a comfortable home and all the love she needed. Instead, she was taken to a roach-infested house guarded by pit bulls; inside were other former inmates from the same prison. Rawls fed her drugs then demanded she pay him back for them by working as a prostitute. Four months later, she was freed by a swat team. Read the full investigation here, or more on rawls here.",

The agency says it is opening a scientific investigation into what is calls an \" unusual mortality event, \" with the number of whale deaths at three times the historical average for the area, reports the ap. The noaa describes the event in a release as \" a significant die-off \" involving 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale, and four unidentified whales. A rep suggests the deaths could be tied to algae bloom toxins, but there's no evidence for that yet. The noaa notes the investigation could take months or even years. Officials have only been about to nab a sample from one of the 30 whales and it was labeled \" less than ideal, \" reports the cbc, which notes the sample contained no presence of one strain of algae toxins. Getting to more whales is difficult: parts of the coastline can be tough to get to, floating carcasses are hard to access as well, and beached whales can be magnets for bears, a coordinator says. Scientists will thus study environmental factors, historical data, and deaths among seabirds and other creatures to help shed light on the issue. \" our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live, \" the coordinator says.

        "summary": "Fraternity members from the california state university's chico campus are facing federal criminal charges after they allegedly cut down dozens of trees in lassen national forest during a camping trip as part of a pledge-initiation ritual, cbs san francisco reports. Per the los angeles times, at least 32 trees were cut down at the deer creek trailhead campground in late april, and members of chico state's pi kappa alpha fraternity, including president evan jossey, now face counts of vandalism, possessing firearms, and degrading us territory. The us forest service tells cbs the fraternity left the campsite in disarray, and it has publicized surveillance pics showing college-age students buying tools that may have been used to cut the trees down. The trees that were felled included douglas firs, white firs, and cedars, a lassen rep tells the sacramento bee. Per the times, camper jon elam told federal authorities he ran into 80 or so of the frat's members at the campground, including jossey and three others who identified themselves as part of a chico state fraternity that would be taking part in an initiation ceremony; elam says he heard gunfire and trees being felled that night.

No, blue moons aren't actually blue ( although there have been moons that were blue, most recently in 1950 ); rather, the term refers to the second full moon in a month, usa today reports. But wait, you exclaim! last night was august's first full moon, so something must be amiss, right? international science times clears things up: the first ( and, in its telling, \" most valid \" ) definition of a blue moon is the third of four full moons that occur in a single season. A season would typically have only three, and this extra moon comes about every two to three years. The next will be in 2015.",

The latest: the ap reports that castro physically aided in the search for gina dejesus, going so far as to hand out fliers with the 14-year-old's photo and perform at a musical fundraiser held in her honor. ( dejesus ' uncle played in bands with castro over the last two decades. ) as previously reported, castro attended a 2012 vigil for dejesus; the ap now reports that a witness saw him comforting the girl's mother. A neighbor tells the ap he was with castro the day investigators dug up a yard looking for remains. Castro reportedly told him, \" they're not going to find anyone there. \" brother pedro reportedly took things even further: he spoke to fox 8 in 2012 after the crews excavating a lot in search of a body found nothing. The line from its report at the time: \" cleveland resident pedro castro said,'that's a waste of money. ' \" but fox 8 also reports on ariel castro's bizarre connection with another one-time suspect: fernando colon, who the fbi questioned in 2004 about dejesus'disappearance, after it was determined that he and his stepdaughter were the last ones to see her. And here's where it gets weirder: his stepdaughter, arlene, is castro's daughter. Colon was convicted that same year of molesting two of castro's daughters; castro himself testified for the prosecution, and colon now says he plans to appeal his conviction, asserting that castro was attempting to keep the spotlight off his own crimes. Further, he says he told the fbi to look into castro in connection with the missing girls. Odder still, arlene actually appeared on america's most wanted to discuss the case in 2004. She says that she was with dejesus on the day she went missing, and borrowed 50 cents from her to call her mom to ask for permission to go to dejesus ' home, reports the plain dealer. Her mom said no and the two went in different directions; but dejesus no longer had enough money for bus fare, so she began to walk, then vanished.",

This isn't as easy an issue to solve as it sounds — something maria rose belding realized while volunteering at a soup pantry as a teen. At one point, the pantry received 10,000 boxes of mac ' n cheese, but couldn't find enough people in need before the stuff expired, reports quartz. \" we were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate, \" belding tells the washington post. Now a 20-year-old american university student, belding hopes the app and website she co-created can help: overflowing pantries list what extra food they have available on the means ( matching excess and need for stability ) database, and neighboring pantries get notifications, belding writes at the huffington post. Grocery stores and restaurants with food to unload can make use of the site, too. Belding remembers watching the first donation of canned beans pop up after means launched in february. \" we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, \" she says — the anxiety intensified by the fact that beans are donated so regularly they aren't a hot commodity. Suddenly, \" it just disappeared. \" since then, the database has kept 4,000 pounds of food from the trash. While a similar service saved 50 million pounds of food in new york in 2015 by matching donations with food kitchens, means allows smaller organizations to do the ground work themselves, and currently has 200 accounts across 27 states. While grants and awards keep the site running for now, belding has plans: to track large retailers'donations from a tax-benefit perspective, something most don't currently do since those donations are made on such a local level. Means would charge a small fee for doing all the tracking. ( on the food front, this young chef has left one of the world's best restaurants to try to save america's school lunch program. )",

Harry reid and mitch mcconnell had a conversation yesterday that reid says left him \" optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion. \" but there's no indication of what a compromise might look like, and democrats are now pushing for a deal that would lift the sequester budget cuts, showing what the new york times calls a \" newfound aggressiveness. \" the sequester demand has republicans frustrated. \" the democrats keep moving the goal posts, \" complains sen. Susan collins, the centrist gop senator whose plan to resolve the crisis was rejected. Bob corker agreed, saying of lifting the cuts, \" i just can't imagine how that has any possibility of becoming law. \" the post worries that the increasingly bitter mcconnell-reid feud could deep-six the deal. Things have gotten so bad that their colleagues recently held \" the equivalent of an intervention, \" the paper says. World bank and international monetary fund leaders urged the us to hurry up and forge a deal, with imf director christine lagarde warning that \" massive disruption the world over \" looms. A foreign ministry spokesman in china called for american lawmakers to \" shoulder their responsibilities, \" reuters reports, and a scathing editorial in china's xinhua state news agency called for politicians to end the \" pernicious impasse \" — and for everybody else to \" start considering building a de-americanized world. \" claims that america has never defaulted on its debt are part of every debt-limit battle but the us has stiffed its creditors at least twice, the ap finds. In 1814, the government ran out of gold and silver to pay interest to bondholders in new england after setbacks in the war of 1812, and in 1979, a technical glitch that followed a long debt-limit squabble caused a delay in redeeming maturing t-bills that ended up adding about $ 12 billion to the cost of servicing the national debt.",

        "summary": "President obama looks genuinely worried about the fate of obamacare: he will meet wednesday morning with house and senate democrats to plot strategy on how to prevent republicans from killing it, reports politico. The problem for democrats is that there may not be much they can do in the near future. As both politico and the hill point out, republicans can pass a repeal measure without any democratic support through a legislative maneuver known as a reconciliation vote. The procedure requires only a simple majority, not 60 votes, and the gop has promised to move on it immediately in the new year. The caveat is that, assuming repeal passes, republicans are expected to delay the actual dismantling of the law for quite a while to give them time to craft a replacement. That delay could be as long as three years, reports time. So what can democrats do? for one thing, raise political pressure. Senate democratic leader chuck schumer and his house counterpart, nancy pelosi, plan rallies next month, and obamacare advocates promise to flood the airwaves with ads in states such as arizona and nevada, where they think gop senators might be swayed. The idea is not only to try to block repeal itself but to keep as much of the law in place as possible if repeal passes. President-elect trump, for example, has said he would like to keep parts of obamacare intact, notably protections for those with pre-existing conditions.

He survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he'd fallen asleep at the wheel. The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in frisco. A day later, the breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the washington post. His family told the summit daily news mcatee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like chris mccandless, the subject of his favorite book, into the wild. They reached out to contacts in alaska, where mcatee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In july, mcatee's father wrote online that \" there is a 50 % chance that jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive. \" but a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the peak one, immediately south of frisco; dna confirmation that the skull was mcatee's came earlier this month. \" our search has come to fruition, \" mcatee's family wrote. \" our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process. \" it's still not clear how or when mcatee died. His skull was all that was found of his remains, reports the denver post. What is certain: \" a person, an irreplaceable person, is gone, \" his family says. But \" the story's not over, \" mcatee's father adds. The family is hoping to raise $ 50,000 to build wells in kenya in mcatee's memory. Nearly $ 15,000 has been raised so far.

        "summary": "Caitlan coleman hailed from stewartstown, pa., a \" land where bad things aren't supposed to happen. \" and yet a gripping philadelphia magazine story describes how something bad did happen to the 26-year-old and her husband — canadian activist joshua boyle, once married to the sister of gitmo prisoner omar khadr — in 2012: they were kidnapped by the taliban in afghanistan during a hike across central asia. The story by holly otterbein ( an acquaintance of coleman's from the same town ) documents the disbelief the pair's loved ones felt when they first heard they were missing, the horror when they heard in 2013 the taliban was holding them captive, and the panic when a series of proof-of-life videos of the two emerged, the third one in august. \" we never think that someone we love will end up in a video released by the taliban, \" otterbein writes. But the american public at large is \" grotesquely indifferent \" to the fate of the couple and their two kids, since born in captivity. Officials believe the couple were taken hostage near kabul by a taliban affiliate known as the \" sopranos of the afghanistan war \" and are now being held in pakistan. They've been in captivity for four years — just one year shy of the five years us army sgt. Bowe bergdahl was held captive. The taliban told the ap this summer the family was in good health, but in the august video, coleman and boyle said they and their kids would be executed unless kabul officials stop killing taliban prisoners. Otterbein notes their story has barely made a blip with the media, the us government has remained mostly tight-lipped, and online commentary about the disappeared pair can be cruel: \" if we get them back, they would probably travel to syria for their next little getaway, \" one poster noted. \" caitlan, like the war in afghanistan and the fight against the taliban, has been forgotten, \" otterbein writes.

            "Philadelphia ( ap ) — an 89-year-old nazi war crimes suspect has died, the night before a judge ruled that he should be extradited to germany to face trial, his lawyer said wednesday. File - this undated file image shows the main gate of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz i, poland, which was liberated by the russians in january 1945. Writing over the gate reads: \" arbeit macht frei \"... ( associated press ) johann breyer died tuesday night at a philadelphia hospital, attorney dennis boyle said wednesday, the same day that u.s. Magistrate timothy rice approved the extradition request. The ruling would still have been subject to a final u.s. Government review. Breyer was hospitalized saturday. His lawyer said his health had deteriorated but he didn't know the cause of death. The u.s. Attorney's office said it didn't have any information yet on breyer's status. Rice had found probable cause that \" breyer, the individual before this court, is the same person sought for aiding and abetting murder in germany. \" \" no statute of limitations offers a safe haven for murder, \" he wrote. Breyer, a retired tool-and-die maker, was being held on allegations stemming from his suspected service as an ss guard at auschwitz during world war ii. U.s. Marshals arrested him in june outside his home",
            "A nazi war crimes suspect from philadelphia has died a day before a judge approved his extradition to germany, his lawyer says. Johann breyer, 89, died on tuesday night at a philadelphia hospital, his lawyer told the associated press news agency. He was accused of taking part in the killing of hundreds of thousands of jewish men, women and children during his time as an auschwitz death camp guard. A judge issued an order on wednesday approving a request for breyer to be extradited to germany. The us government had yet to approve the motion. Us magistrate timothy rice said in the order there was probable cause that \" breyer, the individual before this court, is the same person sought for aiding and abetting murder in germany \". \" no statute of limitations offers a safe haven for murder, \" he wrote. The us judge also said: \" given breyer's role as an elite ss armed guard at a camp designed and operated almost exclusively as a killing center for jews, germany has established probable cause of breyer's complicity in the mass murders at auschwitz. \" in a case that had been building for years, german authorities issued a warrant for breyer's arrest last year charging him with 158 counts of aiding and abetting the deaths of 216,000 jews.

        "summary": "Claims are coming in from multiple european countries that television manufacturers are pulling a volkswagen and installing software to cheat energy-efficiency tests, the bbc reports. An eu-funded lab presented findings tuesday that showed televisions manufactured by samsung — the largest television manufacturer in the world — cut their energy consumption nearly in half during efficiency tests through their \" motion lighting \" feature, which would activate under test conditions but not under normal viewing. Critics are comparing it to this month's volkswagen scandal, in which the company installed software to fool emissions tests, according to the guardian. \"there is no comparison, \" a samsung spokesperson says. \"this is not a setting that only activates during compliance testing. \" earlier this year, the swedish energy council complained to the european commission that another, unnamed television manufacturer had sets that recognized the standard test video and immediately dimmed to cut energy use when the video started, the bbc reports. And the united kingdom complained about similar \" defeat software \" in televisions three years ago, according to the guardian. Televisions in europe account for the equivalent of the total electrical consumption of sweden and portugal every year. If televisions are cheating efficiency tests, that means energy consumption, electricity bills, and carbon emissions are all higher than advertised. The european commission says it will be investigating the claims.",
