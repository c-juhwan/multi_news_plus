New calls for protests went out in algeria, bahrain and libya. From festive scenes of just days ago, the revolt has become more martial, as exhausted men defend what they describe as the perimeter of a free egypt around tahrir square. Their demands have grown more forceful and the uprising more radical. After pitched clashes of two days that left at least seven dead and hundreds wounded, banners in tahrir square declared mr. Mubarak \"a war criminal, \" and several in the crowd said that the president should be executed. Major television networks were largely unable to broadcast from the square on thursday. The united states joined a chorus of criticism, with secretary of state hillary rodham clinton saying, \"we condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats. \" the government's strategy seems motivated at turning broader opinion in the country against the protests and perhaps wearing down the demonstrators themselves, some of whom seemed exhausted by the clashes.

        "summary": "Housing and urban development secretary julian castro may have wrecked his chances of becoming hillary clinton's running mate — with a hillary clinton endorsement. An office of special counsel investigation has determined that castro broke the 1939 hatch act, which restricts the partisan political activities of federal executive branch employees, during an april interview with katie couric for yahoo news, usa today reports. Clinton is the \" most experienced, thoughtful, and prepared candidate for president that we have this year, \" castro said during the interview, which was arranged through his office, involved discussion of hud policies, and took place in front of the hud seal. He told couric that clinton had a \" positive vision \" for the country and went on to describe donald trump as not prepared to be president. Before praising clinton, castro told couric he was \" taking off my hud hat for a second and just speaking individually, \" but he still \" impermissibly mixed his personal political views with official government agency business, \" according to the osc report, which explains that federal employees are \" permitted to make partisan remarks when speaking in their personal capacity, but not when using their official title or when speaking about agency business. \" castro has admitted he goofed, and while he could be fined up to $ 1,000, he's highly unlikely to receive anything more than a reprimand for the hatch act violation. Still, this may be a \" reminder that castro is still a relative political newcomer and lacks the savvy and expertise of some others on clinton's short list, \" the los angeles times notes.",

Judge gerald bruce lee put out a 70-page ruling today that orders the us patent and trademark office to cancel all registrations for the nfl team's trademark, noting the moniker is offensive to native americans, the ap reports. The team had sued for the right to trademark it after the trademark trial and appeal board decided last year the name didn't qualify for federal trademark status under the lanham act, which nixes protection for names that \" may disparage \" a certain population, per the washington post. The team can still use the name and seek protection under state trademark laws — and the cancellation won't happen until any appeals process has run its course, the post notes — but the ruling is a major blow for the team and a victory for native american advocates who've fought the name for years. The team tried to build its argument around the fact that it believed the lanham act violated its first amendment rights, that there wasn't proof of enough native americans hating the name, and, according to court documents, that patent officials had stripped them of a lucrative commodity \" without just compensation \" after it had dumped millions of dollars into the trademark, the paper notes. Meanwhile, those who've long protested the name are celebrating. \" this is a huge victory, \" an attorney for the activists who initially brought the issue before the patent board tells the post. He concedes, though, that the fight probably isn't over, adding, \" the team has been fighting this case so hard and leaving no stone unturned and scorching every square inch of earth that it's hard to imagine they will not appeal. \" ( here are some less-racist alternatives for the team that bloggers came up with a few years back. )",

But in an editorial accompanying the study, the managing editor of the american journal of medicine says the solution to obesity isn't as simple as telling people to get off the couch, cbs news reports. \" if you are spending your time and energy just eking out a living for your family, it's not surprising that you're not exercising, \" she says. And food isn't off the hook completely, the director of policy at the world obesity federation tells the guardian, explaining that eating habits need to change to match today's more sedentary lifestyles. \" while it may be possible to raise your physical activity enough to match the amount of food you eat, it is not easy, so the message still has to be ' cut the calories ' or perhaps ' cut your calories to match your physical activity level, ' \" he says.",

            "Mitt romney acknowledged earlier today that he \" misspoke \" when he made his now-famous comment about not being \" concerned about the very poor \" because they have publicly-funded safety net programs, according to a transcript. In an interview with nevada mega-report jon ralston for \" face to face with jon ralston, \" romney said it was a misstatement. He made the remark after ralston said that \" major garrett pointed out that you have said similar things along the trail. But that it reinforces this perception that this mitt romney, he's up here and the rest of us are down here and you just can't relate to regular folks. Put that into context for me. \" \" jon, it was a misstatement, \" romney said. \" i misspoke. I've said something that is similar to that but quite acceptable for a long time. And you know when you do i don't know how many thousands of interviews now and then you may get it wrong. And i misspoke. Plain and simple. \" it was the rare moment when romney has acknowledged a misstatement on the stump. But that was probably the easiest way for romney to end the questions about it, at least in the short term, despite the reality that democrats - and newt gingrich - will make hay of"

It didn't stop patrick peacock, 53, and chris rittenmeyer, 38, whose bodies were recovered from the eagle's nest dive area in weeki wachee on monday, reports the tampa bay times. The experienced fort lauderdale divers had decided to explore the cave system — up to 300 feet deep with a mile of passages and incredible views — around 2pm sunday just as they'd done several times before, including on friday, reports the south florida sun-sentinel. But an hour later, the pair failed to meet up as planned with a less experienced diver who'd stayed close to the surface, hernando county police say. That diver alerted police around 6pm sunday, and his friends ' bodies were found close together monday in a \" very dangerous and complex area of the cave system \" at a depth of about 260 feet, authorities say. Peacock's wife says the pair were \" prepared \" and \" excited. \" however, \" they may have lost their line, they may have lost visibility, they may have been restrictive, there may have been gear issues, \" a man who's logged 50 dives at the site tells fox 13. \" more than likely it was a series of issues. \" at least 10 people have now lost their lives at eagle's nest, known as the \" mount everest of cave diving \" for challenging even the most experienced divers.

Police who converged on that apartment say they found johansen concepcion de la ros inside, along with daniel alvarez ( it was his apartment ) and the rifle. Both men were taken in for questioning, with concepcion de la ros telling cops the shooting was an accident, and that he'd been firing toward a nearby lake when the puppy and her owner crossed into the line of fire.

The $ 75 internet-connected doll uses an app to record kids and talk back to them.

Researchers from security firm bluebox announced friday that hackers could bypass hello barbie's safety controls to access recordings of children talking to the doll, according to cnet. One big problem is the use of \" outmoded encryption technology, \" reports gizmodo. Last week, a different researcher found hackers could possibly use hello barbie to find the home addresses of its owners. \" such security concerns could give parents second thoughts about buying the internet-connected toys on their children's holiday wish lists, \" observes cnet. \" the timing is especially critical for hello barbie, which was released last month just in time for the holiday shopping season. \" slate says the makers of most toys with internet connections either don't know how to protect users ' privacy or don't care to try. But mattel and toytalk — the makers of hello barbie — tell cnet they had a cybersecurity company review the doll before it was released and are continuing to upgrade its security features. \" security has been a major focus throughout the entire process, and i think we've done a very good job of it, \" one executive says. \" i ' m very proud of the [ doll ]. \" ( a new barbie commercial features a milestone of sorts. )",

He said that while at&t did nothing illegal, the hiring of cohen was a \" serious misjudgment \" that has hurt the company's reputation.

        "summary": "Some of the public sympathy for the family of a woman killed in an apparent road-rage incident dried up after it emerged that tammy meyers and son brandon had gone looking for the driver involved, but police say the las vegas mom is still the victim in the case. A police spokeswoman say meyers was \" scared and upset \" when she enlisted her armed son to look for the people who had frightened her and her daughter, the ap reports. After the assailants followed them back to their cul-de-sac, brandon meyers returned fire after shots were fired from the vehicle, and then \" found that his mother had been struck by gunfire, \" the spokeswoman says. \" the suspect vehicle then backed out and sped away. That's what happened. Tammy is a victim. \" a gofundme page to raise money for meyers ' funeral was removed yesterday after people questioned whether the family had been honest, the las vegas journal-review reports. It also emerged yesterday that brandon, 21, made a facebook post last summer about a road-rage incident of his own, where he said that if his girlfriend hadn't driven away, he would have \" beat the brakes off \" a pedestrian who walked in front of their vehicle, reports the journal-review. Police, who are still looking for the shooter, held a press conference yesterday to advise the public not to lead people to their home after road-rage incidents, but to call police or drive to busy areas where police will probably be.

            "Apple has signed oprah winfrey to a multiyear deal for new original programs. The marquee signing comes as apple ramps up its original content portfolio and goes head to head with the likes of netflix and amazon in a war for consumers ' attention. \" together, winfrey and apple will create original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world, \" the company said in a statement friday. \" winfrey's projects will be released as part of a lineup of original content from apple. \" apple did not specify whether winfrey would appear in any of the shows, but she is expected to have an on-screen role as a host and interviewer. The company also declined to discuss financial aspects of the deal. Apple said the deal will not affect winfrey's contract with own, the television network she launched in 2011. Winfrey recently extended her contract there through 2025. Apple, amazon and netflix have been racing to lock-in producers, showrunners and performers, and paying unprecedented sums to do so. Backed with enormous financial capital, their entry into hollywood has radically changed the entertainment business and forced traditional studios to pay more for top talent. In the last year, apple has made deals for more than a dozen shows with big names like reese witherspoon, steven spielberg, octavia spencer and kevin durant."

        "summary": "President trump stood out saturday as the only g20 leader not offering his support for the paris climate agreement, but that wasn't the only buzzworthy happening in hamburg with the name \" trump \" attached to it. Per bloomberg, when the president slipped away from a meeting on migration that included such world leaders as uk prime minister theresa may, german chancellor angela merkel, and chinese president xi jinping, another trump slipped quietly into his seat. A spokesman for ivanka trump concedes the first daughter, who'd been sitting in the back of the room, did briefly take the place of the president ( who'd gone off to some one-on-one meetings with other leaders ) at the table of global bigwigs, though an official who saw the seat swapping take place says ivanka didn't say anything during her time at the table. A photo of ivanka sitting between xi and may, with merkel a few seats down, was first posted on twitter ( and then removed ) by svetlana lukash, who calls herself a \" russian g20 sherpa, \" per cnn. Critics are upset that the unelected ivanka stepped in for her father in a move the washington post calls \" somewhat unusual, \" as heads of state in such situations are usually replaced by senior government officials. The hill notes reaction online, with some calling the move by the \" inexperienced \" ivanka \" banana-republicky, \" others snarking the summit wasn't \" take your daughter to work day, \" and some noting ivanka had said just last month: \" i try to stay out of politics. \" per bloomberg, though, other leaders ' aides took their place when they stepped out ( ivanka is an unpaid adviser to her father ), and merkel later noted each country's delegation decides who represents them, and \" ivanka trump was part and parcel of the american delegation. \"",

At tomkat ranch, tom steyer and kat taylor raise grass-fed cattle, and according to steyer, \" we could sell 10 times the amount we raise in 10 minutes. \" the movement of the herds over the ground, an expert says, actually improves grass quality. That grass can then be eaten by the migrating cows the next time they visit a particular area of the ranch, the new york times reports. Chickens and turkeys that live on-site get a chance to eat the bugs drawn by cattle droppings, which clears away parasites that could bother the cattle in the future. Meanwhile, steyer is shelling out for a range of other environmental causes, politico reports in a profile: for instance, his political action committee called out virginia gubernatorial candidate ken cuccinelli on his climate views.

Archbishop carlo maria vigano, former vatican ambassador to the us, sent a statement to the conservative website lifesitenews that was published friday, the new york times reports. In it, he recounts what he says happened prior to the pope's controversial 2015 meeting with kim davis, the kentucky clerk who wouldn't issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The statement was spurred by a times article in which chilean abuse survivor juan carlos cruz claimed pope francis told him vigano sneaked davis in for the meeting without the pope being aware of why she was controversial. \" one of them is lying: either cruz or the pope? what is certain is that the pope knew very well who davis was, and he and his close collaborators had approved the private audience, \" vigano writes in the letter. Vigano's accusations highlight an ideological divide in the catholic church, and that divide is mirrored in us bishops, the wall street journal reports. The more liberal bishops, who back the pope's focus on immigration, climate change, and other such issues, are criticizing vigano while conservative bishops, who disagree with the pontiff's attitudes about such issues as homosexuality, are on vigano's side.

After paramedics took him to the hospital, a woman who identified herself as kelly's friend told an investigator that kelly had taken a mixture of heroin and cocaine tuesday night, and that she had brought kelly home \" to recover from his drug use, \" according to a police report. Betty honey, with the fulton county medical examiner's office, said that an autopsy showed no signs of trauma or foul play. A toxicology report is expected to be complete in three to four weeks, at which point, a cause of death will likely be determined, she said. Kelly, together with chris smith, shot to stardom in 1992 with \" jump, \" which spent eight weeks on top of the billboard hot 100. The duo opened for michael jackson that year on his dangerous world tour. Their penchant for wearing their clothes backward was, at least for a time, widely emulated. \" i ' m wearing my clothes to work backwards tomorrow, \" michael skolnik, edito-in-chief of the hip hop site global grind said, when he learned of the death. Leslie tookes, a cnn project coordinator, lived next door to kelly. Like others, she was saddened by his untimely death. \" we often heard him playing classical music and the piano, \" tookes said. \" he was a low-key type of person who was very talented and courteous, friendly and wonderful to our 5-year-old twins. \" indeed, gone too soon. \" his family also mentioned the notable wardrobe adjustment in a statement mourning kelly's passing. \" to millions of fans worldwide, he was the trendsetting, backwards pants-wearing one-half of kris kross who loved making music.

When firefighters found menatta \" barely conscious \" in february, she couldn't give them any info about herself, notes the bbc; a hospital visit revealed she was suffering from stage 3 ovarian cancer, and doctors pulled out a volleyball-sized tumor. They also told menatta they think she lost her memory due to tumor antibodies, per nbc news. She had a slight australian accent and had memories of being in various spots down under, so authorities initially focused their search there. ( it turns out she had taken extended trips there, per nbc. ) menatta, who was single, is now going to live with one of her sisters in maryland, where she ' ll continue to receive chemo for her aggressive disease. She credits god with getting her through her mysterious ordeal. \" i had peace where there should be none and i believed he would bring me back together with people that...

Allyson scerri founded new beginnings in medford, new york, in 2011, and schiavo's mother and brother took part in the ribbon-cutting when it opened. That's where mcmath's family wants to transfer the 13-year-old, and the terri schiavo life &amp; hope network said in a news release yesterday that it has been helping the family for weeks now, the san jose mercury news reports. \" jahi mcmath has been labeled a'deceased ' person. Yet she retains all the functional attributes of a living person, despite her brain injury, \" the statement reads. \" jahi is a living human being. \" scerri is willing to take mcmath into her facility, currently an outpatient center, and ultimately move her into a planned inpatient center that is being constructed. But the teen still needs two surgeries before she can be safely moved, and the ap reports her family is still struggling on that front. Children's hospital oakland, where mcmath currently is, has already refused on the basis that it considers mcmath \" a deceased person. \" yesterday, a lawyer for the hospital said it also will not allow an outside doctor to come in and perform the procedures ( mcmath needs breathing and feeding tubes implanted ). And a state appeals court yesterday refused to order the hospital to do the procedures, though the issue is still pending in the court system. Mcmath's mother tells abc news the hospital is not feeding her daughter, and refers to her only as \" the body. \" meanwhile, the state department of public health is investigating the hospital and its handling of the case.",

        "summary": "It's quite the epic timeline: some 15 million years ago, the creature swam in our oceans. In the 1880s, its remains were found in california. In 1925, remington kellogg classified it in an extinct genus of walrus. Now, nine decades later, researchers with the smithsonian's national museum of natural history say the fossil has been rediscovered — as a white whale. As smithsonian reports, kellogg based his walrus assumption on the skull's large tooth. But the specimen's true identity came to light thanks to marine mammals curator nicholas pyenson, who 10 years ago as a student \" made a trip to the smithsonian, and there was this big skull... \" realizing nothing had been published on it since 1925, he and alexandra boersma dug in and soon found they had on their hands something new, as they described wednesday in plos one: the albicetus oxymycterus. As a press release explains, the new genus of ancient sperm whale, albicetus, means \" white whale, \" a name that's a nod to moby dick and so given thanks to the fossil's bone-white color. As for that tooth, plos blogs reports that the sperm whale is not only toothed, but the largest toothed predator currently living. But it features just one set of bottom teeth, used primarily for seizing or tearing prey, while the fossil features an upper row. It's possible, then, that the ancient version ate seals or smaller whales, something today's sperm whales don't do ( they mainly swallow squid whole ). Per boersma, the ancient teeth indicate an evolutionary shift; \" they changed their feeding strategy. \" another evolutionary change: though modern sperm whales reach some 60 feet in length, the albicetus oxymycterus is believed to have been at most a third that long, notes smithsonian. ( these baby whale killers could come from the sky. )",

            "Whales are pretty majestic creatures, in spite of their enormous size. Among living whales, the sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales, and the largest toothed predator on earth. It comes from a group known as physeteridae, which includes just two other species: the dwarfed sperm whale, and pygmy sperm whale of the genus kogia. While the larger species of sperm whale is considered to have a vulnerable conservation status, both the pygmy and dwarf sperm are data deficient, which means that any information we can glean on this group could be super important for helping to protect them. Physeterids are considered to the most early branching group of the larger group of toothed whales, known as odontocetes. This also means that any fossils we can find of sperm whales can help us to understand the origins and early evolution of odontocetes. Researchers have identified a new genus of",

        "summary": "Barry obama was just 6 years old when ann dunham decided to take him to war-torn indonesia, and sunday's new york times magazine examines the reverberations of that decision. On the surface the answer is simple: she was following her second husband, lolo soetoro, an indonesian native who'd been called back to serve in the army. But the article offers a revealing look at dunham's life there. Some tidbits: the young barack ( then barry ) was subject to constant racial discrimination; once, when other children threw rocks at him, dunham told a friend, \"he's ok. He's used to it. \" when lolo got a job with a us oil company, dunham refused to socialize with the wealthy american wives of the other execs. She once complained to a friend that lolo \"was becoming more american every day. \" one former servant for the couple says that dunham once emerged from an argument with her husband with a bloody nose — though author janny scott notes that no one else even hinted at any abuse in the relationship. But perhaps the most interesting part is obama's surprisingly candid reflections on his mother's parenting flaws. \"she was a very strong person in her own way, \" he says. But \"she was not a well-organized person. And that disorganization, you know, spilled over. Had it not been for my grandparents, i think, providing some sort of safety net financially, being able to take me and my sister on … i think my mother would have had to make some different decisions. \" click here for the nyt magazine's cover image.",

            "Ann dunham, who jettisoned the name stanley upon emerging from childhood, was just 17 years old in the fall of 1960 when she became pregnant with the child of a charismatic kenyan named barack hussein obama, a fellow student at the university of hawaii who was more than six years her senior. She dropped out of school, married him and gave birth shortly before their union ended. In the aftermath, she met lolo soetoro, an amiable, easygoing, tennis-playing graduate student from the indonesian island of java. They married in 1964, after ann's divorce came through, but their early life together was upended by forces beyond their control. On sept. 30, 1965, six indonesian army generals and one lieutenant were kidnapped and killed in jakarta, in what the army characterized as an attempted coup planned by the communist party. Students studying abroad, including lolo, whose studies were sponsored by the government, were soon summoned home. A year later, in 1967, ann graduated with a degree in anthropology, gathered up her 6-year-old child and moved to indonesia to join her husband.

Demolition started sunday and should be wrapped up in 10 days. But the 30-foot-by-50-foot us flag flying some 200 feet above the property will remain, a simplot family spokesman says. The flag, a neighbor tells ktvb, serves as an indicator of blustery weather: \" that sucker makes noise. \" simplot built the massive house located off bogus basin road in 1979. In 2004, per the statesman, he donated it to the state to serve as the permanent governor's mansion. That never happened and, the ap reports, the mansion came to be regarded as a \" money pit \" ( $ 30,000 each year to keep the lights on; $ 12,000 for janitorial services ). In 2013, the state gave the house and grounds back to the simplot family. No one in the family wanted to live there, the spokesman tells the statesman, \" so it was agreed that … taking it down was the best option. \" fixtures, furniture, and appliances were donated to the idaho youth ranch, he says. And, for the moment, the family has no plans for how to use the land. Simplot, who died in 2008 at age 99, was worth $ 3.6 billion, according to an obituary in the new york times. Despite once reportedly saying, \" hell, you freeze spuds and they will go to mush, \" simplot made a fortune, per the times, supplying frozen french fries to mcdonald's, among other enterprises.

            "Simplot family demolishes iconic boise home ( photo: deren martinez / ktvb ) boise – an iconic boise home will soon be no more. The simplot family announced today that the mansion of potato magnate j.r. Simplot will be torn down. Simplot died in 2008. The house along bogus basin road, and former idaho governor's mansion, has been vacant for more than a decade. Family members decided taking down the house, rather that continuing to maintain a vacant home, is the best option. The announcement came the same day that demolition began. \" the neighbors were a little shocked, they didn't know what was coming but no one expected this, \" said neighbor tim mccarthy, \" it's sad because mr. Simplot gave a great gift to all of us to have this house, this property. All that's really gonna be a loss. \" for neighbors, the house was a reminder of the man who lived there. \" he used to open the house to trick-or-treaters, give them a silver dollar and a story about how to invest it wisely, \" said mccarthy, \" i think that's just priceless. \" the large american flag that flies over the site will remain. It has been removed temporarily, but will be restored once the work is complete. \"",
            "There had been earlier efforts to develop an acceptable frozen french fry, but a new market opened up after world war ii, when freezer compartments became standard in refrigerators. One of mr. Simplot's researchers, ray dunlap, urged mr. Simplot to give him a freeze box so he could practice freezing vegetables. Advertisement continue reading the main story \"hell, \" mr. Simplot answered, according to an article in range magazine in 1998, \"you freeze spuds and they will go to mush. \" but mr. Simplot bought mr. Dunlap a large freezer anyway, and a few months later, mr. Simplot tasted hot french fries that had been frozen. \"my god, good product, \" he said. In the mid-1960s, mr. Simplot signed a contract with ray kroc, who built mcdonald's into an empire, to supply fries to mr. Kroc's chain. Mr. Simplot promised to build an entire factory just for mcdonald's. The deal was sealed with a handshake. Late in life, mr. Simplot still regularly drove his lincoln town car ( he owned a dealership ) to a mcdonald's outlet for an egg mcmuffin and hash browns or fries. The license plate on his car read mr. Spud. John richard simplot, usually called jack, was born on jan. 4, 1909, in dubuque, iowa."

        "summary": "The saga over whether the white house will or won't release \" the memo \" may be over on friday. Multiple reports — including at fox news, abc news, and the washington post — say president trump has read the document and is set to release it. The white house, however, has agreed to make some redactions at the request of the fbi, which strongly came out against the release on wednesday. Fox describes them as \" technical edits, \" but it seems the gist of the memo — asserting that the fbi and justice department abused their authority in the early stages of the trump-russia investigation — would stay intact. The only big question, then, is when the public would be able to read the memo. Abc lays out the steps: after the white house informs the house intelligence committee that it doesn't object to the memo's release, the panel would then enter it into the congressional record. That step can only take place when the house is in session, which abc notes would be the case at 4: 30pm friday. Failing that, the house would again be in session on monday. One last wrinkle: gop sen. John thune on thursday told reporters that the senate intelligence committee must see the memo before it's made public. \" i think they have to take into consideration what the fbi is saying, \" thune said of house republicans, referring to the agency's concerns. He added that a democratic rebuttal memo also should be released.",

Ace pitcher luke heimlich, 22, was convicted of molesting his 6-year-old niece when he was 15. As part of a plea deal when he was 16, heimlich was placed on two years ' probation and was required to register as a low-risk sex offender for the next five years, reports the new york times. Last june, the oregonian revealed heimlich's status as a sex offender after he neglected to make a necessary update to the state's sex-offender registry; cops hit him with a citation. Shortly after that, heimlich's five years on the registry were over, and his record was expunged. However, reporters had gotten wind of the citation and the word was already out, and heimlich left the team for the remainder of the 2017 season. Considered a top mlb draft pick before his record came out, the left-hander, who had a 0.76 earned run average last year, was passed over. Once again pitching for oregon state, heimlich has repeatedly denied committing the crime he was convicted of and says the plea deal was what he and his parents thought was the \" best option to move forward as a family. \" all of this has roiled beaver fans, sexual abuse survivors, and even family members, with some saying heimlich has fulfilled his court-mandated obligations and deserves a second chance. His coach is mum, except to say he's \" a fine young man. \" the victim's mother, the ex-wife of heimlich's older brother, thinks he shouldn't be allowed to play in college or for the pros. Dennis dodd of cbs sports agrees: \" heimlich's admitted actions are intolerable, heinous. His privileged presence on the mound mocks every victim of sexual violence. \"",

Ekkapol chantawong was the only member of his family who survived the epidemic which overcame his northern thailand home town in 2003. The disease killed his seven-year-old brother, then his mother and ­father. Until he was 12, mr ekkapol was looked after by extended family but was a \"sad and lonely \" little boy, his aunt umporn sriwichai told the australian newspaper. Relatives decided to send the boy to a buddhist temple to train to be a monk. Mr ekkapol spent a decade at the temple, learning meditation and wearing a saffron robe. He still returns to the temple to stay and meditate with other monks. But three years ago, at the mae sai prasitsart school in the northernmost district of the chiang rai province near a border crossing into myanmar, a football team was set up.

A new study out of the federal technology institute eth zurich studied 100-plus cows over a three-day period at 25 farms. Those who wore cowbells — some of which rang, some of which didn't — ate for shorter amounts of time and even chewed less, reports swiss radio international. Researchers say it's unclear which was the chief culprit: the weight of the bells ( 12 pounds ) or the sound ( up to 113 decibels ). The decibel level of the bells is the equivalent of a chainsaw; the swiss accident insurance fund says human exposure to this level of noise for even eight hours a day would negatively and seriously affect health. And since the bovine ear is even more sensitive than the human one, the bells might lead to deafness in cows, reports time. But the head of the swiss countryside union counters that the cows only wear \" size 31 \" bells during ceremonial occasions — as little as once a year, reports the local. He brushes off the idea of replacing the bells, which farmers use to locate their cattle, with gps devices; farmers point out that reception in the alpine areas would be poor. The study didn't investigate whether the bells had any effect on milk production. ( meanwhile, check out why it's not uncommon in switzerland to see cows hanging from helicopters. )",

Photos and videos of the numerous parked cars started popping up online back in july, and a group of amateur detectives calling itself the shorty air force has taken to tracking down the various locations where they've been stashed, the new york times reports. Members of the sleuthing group use drones and even, in one case, an airplane to get the photos. The sites have been found in california, washington, nevada, arizona, utah, illinois, texas, and new jersey. They raise quite a few questions, and though a tesla spokesperson tells the times they're simply \" logistics transit hubs, \" the saf members who spoke to the paper anonymously aren't so sure. They say they have their doubts about how candid elon musk is being when he discusses tesla's sales. One big question: is demand for the vehicles as high as he says? some worry the parked cars represent an overflow of vehicles tesla has produced that it doesn't have enough customers for; business insider noted in july there was talk of model 3 pre-order cancellations. When confronted by customers waiting for vehicles for which they've put down a payment, musk has said tesla is encountering difficulties delivering cars to customers due to a shortage of car-hauling trucks, but experts say no such shortage exists and that other automakers are shipping their cars around the us just fine. There's also the possibility that, as some reports suggest, there's a shortage of replacement parts for cars needing repairs before delivery. But even if it's just a logistics issue, one expert points out that tesla should have anticipated all of these needs: \" it's not like this is unexpected demand. \"",

        "summary": "Earth's gravity is making patterns in the thousands of small cliffs that wrinkle the shrinking surface of the moon, according to a new in geology. Scientists determined the moon was shrinking — its surface has moved about 300 feet closer to its core over 4 billion years — back in 2010 based on approximately 84 small cliffs, called lobate scarps, discovered on its surface, the washington post reports. The scarps, which are less than 6.2 miles long and 300 feet high, are formed when the moon's cooling interior causes the moon to contract and its crust to buckle, explains a nasa post at science daily. But if that's all that was happening, the appearance of the scarps should be random. \" this is not what we found, \" says thomas watters of the national air and space museum in washington. \" there is a pattern in the orientations of the thousands of faults and it suggests something else is influencing their formation, something that's also acting on a global scale — massaging and realigning them. \" in the five years since 2010, nasa's lunar reconnaissance orbiter has discovered more than 3,000 more lunar cliffs, and an analysis of them confirms scientists'suspicions that earth's gravitational tidal forces are affecting them, says nasa.

As one of my colleagues noted, paul beat the not-so-mighty quants of wall street. Director xiao jiang was shooting a \"comic suspense \" film in south africa at the time under a completely different title ( \"the legend of world cup \" ). But in a feat of stunning commercial alacrity, the director has changed the name of his darling to ride the psychic creature's coattails — er, tentacle tips? — to box office glory. Perhaps a savvy move: paul certainly has chinese fans, who are crazy about soccer despite the fact that their soccer teams stink.

He provided no job-cut figures, but offered this: it \" probably goes without saying we think we can run the government more efficiently than the previous administration can. \" he did indicate that agencies whose budget trump proposed significantly reducing ( like the epa ) would be expected to cut generously, though npr notes congress will ultimately set all budget levels. The wall street journal reports even the departments of defense and veterans affairs, which may end up increasing their ranks should their budgets be increased, must consider whether redundant or nonessential positions can be eliminated. Npr points out the freeze hasn't been a total one: military hiring continued, as did hires tied to national security and public safety. The ap cites labor department figures that show 6,000 federal jobs were added over january and february. As of 2014, there were 2.66 million federal employees, down from a high of about 3 million three decades prior; cnn reports the figure excludes those in military uniform and legislative and judicial branch employees.",

Food scientists say the harmless change, known as fat blooming, is a major source of complaints and rejections from chocolate lovers and actually costs the confectionary industry millions, according to a study. The process, which involves fat migrating to chocolate's surface, was also largely a mystery until german scientists decided to take a closer look. They mixed up cocoa, milk powder, cocoa butter, and sugar, ground the mixture to a fine powder, then watched through an x-ray generating synchrotron as sunflower oil was added, science reports. Within hours, the oil had melted the chocolate crystals, which allowed the fat in cocoa butter to navigate to the surface where it crystallized, turning the usually glossy treat into an unappealing mess. \" the technology used to examine the samples shows us both the fat crystals and the pores inside the product, down to a scale of a few nanometers, \" explains a researcher, who worked alongside scientists from nestle. \" for the first time, we have been able to track in detail the dynamic mechanisms that lead to the creation of fat bloom, \" another adds. Such a close-up view also revealed clues about how chocolatiers could avoid fat blooming in the future, say, by reducing the \" porosity of the chocolate during manufacture, so that the fat migrates more slowly, \" the study author says, per upi. \" another approach is to limit the amount of fat that is present in a liquid form by storing the product in cool, but not too cold, conditions. \" if you're really serious about keeping your chocolate looking and tasting its best, store it at an optimal 64 degrees, researchers say.

Police say he told two men their applications had been accepted; they in turn paid him more than $ 5,000 for upfront rent, security deposits, and remodeling costs. Paul allegedly told potential renters to make out all checks to his \" uncle, \" a man police say cashed the checks in exchange for $ 20 worth of heroin from paul.

In its latest test drive of tesla's new model s p85d, the writers said the all-wheel-drive sedan \" performed better in our tests than any other car ever has, breaking the consumer reports ratings system. \" it so wowed the raters that they called it \" brutally \" and \" explosively \" quick, saying tesla had created an \" insane \" drive mode whose 1.02 g's of force on acceleration ( it goes from zero to 60mph in 3.5 seconds ) is like jumping off a building, not to mention \" frighteningly eerie in its silent velocity \" sans the traditional engine roar. Basically, the 80-year-old publication's auto editor mark rechtin tells business insider, it \" defies the laws of physics. \" and it was built by a startup in, wait for it, the united states of america. Back in 2008, popular mechanics had jamie hyneman from mythbusters see how electric cars stack up against their gas counterparts in five tests — using a ferrari, harley, atv, compact car, and hand-built go-kart. The electric versions beat the traditional gas models every time. Now tesla is delivering proof of the electric car's superiority, but with a price tag that will make it unattainable to most: $ 127,820. ( the model 3, due in 2018, starts at $ 35,000. ) and while it broke the scale at 103 out of 100, forcing a restructuring of the rating system to get it down to a cool 99, it does have imperfections, including interior materials that aren't as \" opulent \" as those in other luxury cars and a ride that's \" louder \" than the base model s. The rating also doesn't account for reliability, which perhaps thanks in part to the 200-plus-mile drive range is rated average by surveyed owners. ( see what tesla calls this new mode of speed. )",

Specifically, researchers compared a common, \" direct \" interrogation — where the questions are direct and specific — to the scharff technique, named after the highly successful german interrogator hanns scharff. He once shared his wife's baked goods and a long stroll with a world war ii fighter pilot, reports pacific standard magazine; when he claimed that american tracer bullets left a white instead of red smoke due to a chemical shortage, the pilot jumped in to correct him, saying the white smoke was a signal to pilots that they were low on ammo. Thus scharff was armed with the information he sought. And as the magazine notes, researchers are only now beginning to put his techniques to the test. In the study, where participants were given a story with 35 details and interrogated by phone, scharff's approach not only resulted in more ( and more precise ) information, but those being interrogated thought they gave up less information than they actually had, while those being interrogated directly felt they gave up more than they actually had. Kindness is not the only key ingredient to the scharff technique; having a \" know-it-all \" attitude compels information-disclosing corrections, as in the case of the pilot correcting his \" friend. \" pacific standard has more on scharff, who ended up as a chief interrogator of allied fighter pilots after an odd series of events.",

By the year 2500, in the worst-case scenario, the simulations predict seas 42 feet higher — purely from antarctic melt. \" you're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, \" says study lead author robert deconto, a climate scientist at the university of massachusetts. He warns that because of geological conditions, the east coast could face sea level rises even higher than the global average. \" north america has a lot to fear from ice loss from west antarctica, which is where it all begins, \" says deconto, whose research looked at little-studied factors such as the effects of pooling water and the collapse of giant ice cliffs.

            "Ice sheet – ice shelf model we use an established ice-sheet model, with hybrid ice dynamics following the formulation described in ref. 27, and an internal condition on ice velocity at the grounding line15 that captures misi ( fig. 2a – c ) by accounting for migrating grounding lines and the buttressing effects of ice shelves with pinning points and side shear. Bedrock deformation under changing ice loads is modelled as an elastic lithospheric plate above local isostatic relaxation. A grid resolution of 10 km is used for all simulations, the finest resolution computationally feasible for long-term continental simulations. The model includes newly added treatments of hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure ( fig. 2d – f ) described in ref. 25 and extended here. Basal sliding coefficients are determined by an inverse method51, iteratively matching ice-surface elevations to observations until a quasi-equilibrium is reached. In this case, inverted sliding coefficients are derived from a modern ( preindustrial ) surface climatology, using the same rcm used in our pliocene, lig, and future simulations. In addition to the pliocene and lig targets highlighted here, the ice sheet – ice shelf model has been shown capable of simulating: ( 1 ) the modern ice sheet, including grounding-line positions, ice thicknesses, velocities, ice streams, and ice shelves ( fig. 1b ), ( 2 ) the last glacial",

A new study points says... ( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — warmer air, less frigid water and gravity may combine to make parts of antarctica's western ice sheet melt far faster than scientists had thought, raising sea levels much more than expected by the end of the century, according to a new study. New physics-based computer simulations forecast dramatic increases in melting in the vulnerable western edge of the continent. In a worst case scenario, that could raise sea level in 2100 by 18 to 34 inches ( 46 to 86 centimeters ) more than an international panel of climate scientists predicted just three years ago. And even if the countries of the world control heat-trapping gases at the moderate levels they pledged in paris last year, it would still mean three to 12 inches ( 8 to 31 centimeters ) higher seas than have been forecast thought, according to a study published wednesday in the journal nature.

As nasaspaceflight.com reports, the 355-foot-high launch tower is now \" leaning, \" possibly due to the recent addition of connecting arms. Nasa acknowledges \" some deflection and imperfections \" but says the launcher is \" structurally sound \" and does not need any design modifications. \" while nasa seems to believe this lean is not enough to require additional construction, it will likely mean that the mobile launcher won't be used for more than one or two launches, \" writes avery thompson at popular mechanics. That's partly because the tower would need yet another upgrade after its initial launch anyway — to accommodate larger payloads — and it might well be faster and cheaper in the long run to build a second one. Nasa's aerospace safety advisory panel has recommended doing just that for $ 300 million. The maiden launch is expected to take place in 2020.

However, nasa insists it is structurally sound and does not require modifications to counter what is portrayed as \"some deflection \". The ml is undergoing a conversion process, realigning it for a role with sls after initially being constructed for the ares i rocket. The ml began construction for the ares i rocket almost ten years ago, marked by trestles and girders arriving at the kennedy space center ( ksc ) by barge in february 2009, beginning the opening phase of work to create a base platform – one which was designed to be lighter than the mobile launch platforms ( mlps ) that previously hosted the space shuttle stack. This base – which can be picked up by nasa's modified crawler transporters – is the platform for a fixed tower that hosts an array of umbilical connections and access for engineers and astronauts. As with all large projects, design changes were added during the initial construction phase, including the winning concept from the emergency egress system ( ees ), a roller coaster car system that would race astronauts – and/or pad crews – away from a major incident with the vehicle. Engineers from disney were cited as members of the large design team. When the constellation program ( cxp",
            "Nasa's latest tower for launching rockets has a little bit of a lean, which means it may be able to launch just a single rocket. The cost of this tower boondoggle? almost $ 1 billion. The tower in question is the mobile launcher designed for nasa's upcoming space launch system, which would become the world's most powerful rocket once completed in a few years. The tower is supposed to keep the rocket stable and upright on the platform during a launch. The system was built for nasa's now-defunct ares i rocket and later repurposed for the sls. Advertisement - continue reading below the mobile launcher is a behemoth piece of equipment, standing nearly 400 feet tall and weighing more than 10 million pounds. It holds miles of cables, tubes, and pipes to ensure the sls can remain operational on the launch pad. Building such a structure is a challenging task, which is why it cost approximately $ 912 million. The sheer size and complexity may also be the cause of the difficulties the mobile launcher is currently facing. According to a report from nasaspaceflight.com, the launch tower is leaning slightly toward the north, which is in the direction of the rocket on the launchpad. The structure also seems to be twisting slightly. While nasa seems to believe this lean is not enough"

We ' ll be hearing from the justices on a number of key cases that have been argued since january, ranging from obamacare to free speech. Usa today outlines the highlights; this week's decisions will be issued today, wednesday, and thursday, notes scotusblog: the court will decide whether for-profit companies can receive religious exemptions from the obamacare's requirement that employers cover contraceptives. Justices will address the constitutionality of a massachusetts law barring protests within 35 feet of an abortion clinic. Another question concerns a president's the authority to make executive appointments without congressional confirmation. In this case, president obama appointed labor officials while noting that the senate was on recess; at the time, senators were holding pro-forma sessions every few days. Usa today notes the ruling could touch on appointments made by george washington. On the environment, the court will address the government's ability to require permits for companies emitting greenhouse gases. Labor unions face a potential funding threat: a case deals with whether workers can be required to pay fees despite not belonging to a union. As it stands, public sector unions have to fight for all workers in their industry, even if they're not dues-paying members. Those non-members may still have to pay \" fair-share \" fees; justices are examining whether workers can reject these fees, which cbs news explains could be a \" devastating \" blow to the unions, which would have to rep workers who don't contribute anything to them. The court is also weighing in on how we tune into tv. People who use the aereo antenna tv service can watch shows online; broadcasters say the service is a lot like cable, and aereo should have to pay retransmission fees as cable providers do.",

Ptv cited local sources and its correspondent in north waziristan. A taliban source denied the report to cnn, saying that mehsud has simply gone \" underground \" after being targeted by drone attacks. The source, who requested anonymity because he is not an authorized spokesperson for the taliban, said mehsud is alive and well and will release a taped recording to prove as much. Military spokesman maj. Gen. Athar abbas told cnn that \" we cannot yet confirm \" mehsud's death. Pakistani interior minister rehman malik told cnn on sunday that officials have received reports of the taliban leader's death, but also could not immediately verify it. Mehsud has been the target of suspected u.s. Drone attacks in pakistan. The u.s. Military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by the pilotless aircraft.

            "Islamabad, pakistan ( cnn ) -- the pakistani military on sunday was looking into a local report that the region's taliban leader had died, officials said. State broadcaster ptv reported that hakimullah mehsud, the taliban commander in pakistan, was wounded in a drone attack this month, and that he died and was buried last week. Ptv cited local sources and its correspondent in north waziristan. A taliban source denied the report to cnn, saying that mehsud has simply gone \" underground \" after being targeted by drone attacks. The source, who requested anonymity because he is not an authorized spokesperson for the taliban, said mehsud is alive and well and will release a taped recording to prove as much. Military spokesman maj. Gen. Athar abbas told cnn that \" we cannot yet confirm \" mehsud's death. Pakistani interior minister rehman malik told cnn on sunday that officials have received reports of the taliban leader's death, but also could not immediately verify it. Mehsud has been the target of suspected u.s. Drone attacks in pakistan. The u.s. Military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by the pilotless aircraft. The taliban leader's status came into question following two drone attacks aimed at him this month. U.s.

Here's what the pundits are saying: fiorina \" commanded voters ' attention early on by responding sternly, and unflinchingly, to donald trump's attacks on her appearance, \" writes gabriel debenedetti at politico. \" women all over the country heard very clearly what mr. Trump said, \" she said, and trump ended up walking his comments back, saying fiorina \" has a beautiful face and is a beautiful woman. \" fiorina also impressed with her moving remarks on planned parenthood and on losing her stepdaughter to drug addiction. It was \" carly's night, \" agrees rich lowry at the national review, describing her handling of trump as \" pitch perfect, understated, but pointed \" and predicting that she will continue her rise in the polls. Chris christie also had \" a good night by any measure, \" according to niall stanage at the hill, who says his best moment came when he told trump and fiorina that the average worker \" could care less about their careers. \" marco rubio, ben carson, and ted cruz also had solid nights, stanage writes, while scott walker, rand paul, and jeb bush failed to impress. Trump \" was attacked from all sides, \" but that's exactly how he likes it, writes anthony zurcher at the bbc, noting that the front-runner did well with some early one-liners, but was \" uncharacteristically muted \" when responding to fiorina. Trump emerged \" bruised but not beaten, \" zurcher decides. In chris cillizza's roundup of winners and losers at the washington post, he puts bush in both columns, saying he was \" flat \" in the first couple of hours and didn't seem to have the heart for attacking trump, but that he had a great final hour with remarks on iran — and about his mom still being angry with him for smoking pot in high school. Cillizza also calls the debate length a loser, saying three hours demanded \" a massive amount of the candidates, the moderators, and the people watching. \"",
