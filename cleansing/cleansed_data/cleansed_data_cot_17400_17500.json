In a letter to the state, smith says the public has the wrong idea about her. \" i am not the monster society thinks i am, \" the 43-year-old writes to reporter harrison cahill. \" i am far from it. \" for one thing, she disputes prosecutors ' contention that she killed the boys to be with a man. \" something went very wrong that night, \" writes smith. \" i was not myself.... There was no motive as it was not even a planned event. I was not in my right mind. \" she made up the carjacking story, she says, because \" i didn't know how to tell the people who loved michael &amp; alex that they would never see them again. \" she also reveals that she planned to kill herself and leave a note about what happened before the truth came out. Smith is serving a life sentence. Nbc recalls a sad coda: in 1996, seven people, including four children, drowned while visiting memorials for the boys at john d. Long lake.",

Sheriff wells, who was largely credited with breaking mrs. Smith's story, said that investigators \" do not have any reason to suspect foul play \" in the latest tragedy and that the investigation would continue. Why no one was able to stop the truck is still a mystery. \" no skid marks, no sign they tried to stop, \" the sheriff said. The accident claimed an entire family from buffalo, a community just west of union. Killed were tim phillips, 26; his wife, angie, 22, and their three children, courtney, 4; melena, 23 months, and kinsleigh, 4 months. It also drowned another child, austin ( cody ) roodvoets, 3, of inman, s.c., and carl sydney white, 29, of campobello. Both towns are about 30 miles northwest of union. Mr. White, along with mrs. Phillips, had tried to rescue the others. Mr. Wells said mr. Phillips was behind the wheel when the vehicle was found. Union residents milled around the site of the latest drownings, as they had done in 1994, when the smith boys were found."

        "summary": "A case in afghanistan has pitted a religious figure against the outraged parents of a 6-year-old girl, underscoring the ongoing problems surrounding child marriages there. Per radio free europe, sayed mohammad karim, a mullah in the ghor province said to be in his 50s, was arrested last week and charged with stealing the young girl away and marrying her — allegations he denies. \" the girl was given to me as a gift and we were married so i could raise her, \" says karim, who notes the girl's parents attended their wedding ceremony. But that's not what the parents are saying, per the deputy police commander of ghor. \" we spoke to her parents and they strongly deny they attended the wedding, \" he says. \" [ they ] told me their daughter was kidnapped. \" complicating things are the sticky rules governing child marriage in afghanistan: the country's civil law says a girl has to be 16 to be legally married, but citizens may also follow sharia law, which has been interpreted to allow children to be wed. These early marriages can pose dangerous health hazards for young girls: human rights watch — which cites a 2010 mortality survey that says 53 % of afghan women ages 25 to 49 were wed by the age of 18 — notes that early marriage means early pregnancies, which can cause injury and even death if their bodies aren't ready for childbirth or if they're in rural areas with sub-par medical care. But rfe notes that such \" gifts \" are common in the country's remotest regions — not only girls, but also cash, property, and livestock — to curry favor with local religious leaders. Perhaps the only bright spot in this story: karim insists he didn't have sexual intercourse with the little girl, which a local doctor says appears to be true. But despite the doctor's assertion that the \" examination showed that the girl had endured no physical or psychological harm, \" the head of the ghor women's affairs department says, per the sun: \" this girl does not speak, but only repeats one thing: ' i am afraid of this man. ' \" ( a nigerian child bride was accused of killing her husband with rat poison. )",

Workers shut down the machine before he climbed into the hopper remove the jam. What happened next is somewhat unclear, and under investigation. The 23-year-old tells the daily news that \" apparently the piece ( of machinery ) i was standing next to was on a different circuit, \" and somehow started back up again, sucking him from the hopper into the \" porcupine. \" in katu-tv's telling, a coworker who was unaware he was inside started the machine up. Reuters also says a coworker was at fault, but notes that arce had fallen through the hopper's hole before it was turned on. What is clear is that the machine was shut off when workers heard arce's screams — but the lower half of his body had already been shredded by the porcupine, which uses curved metal tines measuring roughly half a foot to break up bark. \" there's no way i should be here right now, \" he tells reuters, crediting his survival to \" guardian angels. \" ( a wide tattoo on his chest appropriately reads \" send me an angel. \" ) he suffered permanent nerve damage and it's not clear whether he will be able to walk normally again. \" he might not be at 100 % but he's alive and that's all that we care about, \" his mother says.

Mike ward has to pay $ 35,000 ( $ 25,000 in moral damages, $ 10,000 in punitive damages ) to jeremy gabriel — who ward has referred to as \" petit jeremy \" — for a series of jokes about gabriel, who suffers from treacher collins syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes facial deformities and hearing issues, at shows between 2010 and 2013, per the toronto star. The tribunal, which found the remarks to be discriminatory, also awarded gabriel's mom $ 7,000. The jokes revolved around gabriel's visit with the pope in 2006, which ward first addressed in his 2010 act. In that set, the comedian noted he had initially been happy for gabriel's meeting with the pontiff, since he thought gabriel was terminally ill, the cbc notes — \" but now, five years later, and he's still not dead! me, i defended him, like an idiot, and he won't die! \" is how he wrapped his piece up, adding gabriel was \" ugly, \" not dying. Gabriel says his self-esteem plunged and it led to him being bullied; he says he even tried to commit suicide. Some don't agree with the tribunal's decision, noting it sets a sticky precedent for free speech. \" this is terrifying. A comedian forced to pay someone who got offended by his joke, \" a fellow comedian who has dwarfism tweeted. Ward, who says the bullying against gabriel likely started before his joke, doesn't appear to be giving up the fight. \" even rocky lost the first one, we're gonna appeal, \" ward posted on facebook early thursday, with vice noting he also joked around about the tribunal's decision.

            "Treacher collins syndrome is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly, ranging from almost unnoticeable to severe. Most affected individuals have underdeveloped facial bones, particularly the cheek bones, and a very small jaw and chin ( micrognathia ). Some people with this condition are also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a. In severe cases, underdevelopment of the facial bones may restrict an affected infant's airway, causing potentially life-threatening respiratory problems. People with treacher collins syndrome often have eyes that slant downward, sparse eyelashes, and a notch in the lower eyelids called an eyelid coloboma. Some affected individuals have additional eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. This condition is also characterized by absent, small, or unusually formed. Hearing loss occurs in about half of all affected individuals; hearing loss is caused by defects of the three small bones in the middle ear, which transmit sound, or by underdevelopment of the ear canal",

            "The university of california has agreed to pay nearly $ 1 million to settle a lawsuit filed by demonstrators who were pepper-sprayed in the face during an occupy protest, an incident that became a defining moment in the short-lived movement against economic inequality. Images of a police officer casually spraying the faces of seated, nonviolent protesters became a rallying symbol, and the nov. 18, 2011, incident on the davis campus prompted national outrage. Online videos shot by witnesses went viral. The demonstrators had been protesting steep tuition hikes and police brutality. The university and the plaintiffs, represented by the american civil liberties union, filed the preliminary settlement wednesday. The agreement is subject to the approval of a federal judge. \" the settlement should be a wake-up call for other universities and police departments, \" said michael risher, staff attorney with the aclu of northern california. \" if the first amendment means anything, it's that you should be able to demonstrate without being afraid of police violence. \" under the proposal, the university will pay $ 30,000 to each of 21 plaintiffs named in the complaint and $ 250,000 for their attorneys. The university also will set aside $ 100,000 to pay others who can prove they were arrested or pepper-sprayed. \" it was felt that the proposed settlement was in the best interest of the university,"

            "Correction appended, july 10 the estimated annual market demand for marijuana in colorado is roughly 130 metric tons, according to the first post-legalization study of the market. The study, released by state regulators, used actual sales data to draw up the figure rather than rely on survey responses as studies have done in the past, and was able to provide some revealing information. Surveys have estimated that a third of marijuana users consumed the drug less than once a month, according to the associated press. But the study found that those users comprise only.3 percent of the total market, meaning the most of the marijuana is consumed by heavy, more regular users. The study's estimate for total market demand, which includes both medical and recreational marijuana, surpassed past figures by nearly a third. The analysis found that demand from residents hovers around 121 metric tons and demand from visitors stands at around 9 metric tons. But in some of the colorado's vacation spots, out-of-staters account for as much as 90 percent of the recreational dispensary traffic. According to the study, legal marijuana is, on average, going for $ 220 per ounce. Correction: the original version of this story incorrectly suggested that the study contradicted previous findings about infrequent marijuana users in colorado."

The virginia pair met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets — splitting a $ 2,500 winner — and married earlier this year. But that union — an interracial one in a state that banned such marriages for decades — has instigated a court battle over hill's estate and could end with the couple splitting up, the ap reports. Hill is legally incapacitated, and a judge has ruled daughter rebecca wright shouldn't have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission. Wright's sister, patricia barber, claims the union complicates the division of hill's $ 475,000 estate, because now harrison could inherit a portion. \" she wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money, \" wright tells wusa9. Should barber win, hill would have to move in with her or be put in a nursing home — either way, she and harrison would be separated. \" they're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them, \" harrison tells the station. The judge agrees on that score: breaking them up could \" create a circumstance in ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve, \" he ruled. To protect hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed and her daughters removed as guardians. Wright believes ageism and racism are also at play in her sister's court action, telling wjla that mindsets haven't changed. But hill and harrison don't mind: \" we see hearts, we don't see color. \" ( this couple got married after 72 years together. )",

An fda advisory panel today gave the green light to flibanserin, a drug designed to increase the sex drive of women with low libido, reports the los angeles times.

Today's acceptance means that fda chief stephen ostroff will make his final decision within months on whether the drug should hit the us market, and while he isn't obligated to accept the panel's recommendation, that's how things usually play out. The drug, made by sprout pharmaceuticals, would be sold under the name addyi. The panel gave its blessing provided that sprout makes sure that women are aware of side effects such as low blood pressure and fainting, reports npr. Sprout estimates that about 7 % of pre-menopausal women have a condition called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or hsdd, that the little pink pill can help fix, reports the new york times. It would be taken nightly. Debate over the drug has gone on for years, with advocates saying it's sexist for the pharmaceutical industry and the fda to provide drugs that cater to men's sex needs and ignore women's. But critics say big pharma is trying to cash in on a non-existent problem and is, in the words of npr, \" oversimplifying female sexuality. \" in clinical trials, women taking the drug had about one more \" sexually satisfying event \" per month than usual, reports ap.

If not by direct exposure, the information the artist is exposed to through other people, media, etc. Influences them. We are all a product of our times and have the benefit of those who have walked similar paths we are now on. We all borrow because it has all been done before and we are not the originators. To merely copy is to take an existing interpretation and not run away with it. To steal an idea is to take something of value and make it yours. To make an artistic element yours you have to interpret it your way with your own approach. This cannot be done when you are merely copying the idea. When copying the idea you are just doing everything exactly like it was previously done. When you have done it your way you have used the element and not simply duplicated it. It is not required that you advance the element. You can go sideways and even backwards with the idea and you can be stealing the element and not copying it. On the contrary, when merely copying the element you have failed if you do not match the original. Source( s ): m t · 9 years ago",

All brains shrink with age, but researchers found those who ate a mediterranean diet lost less brain mass than others. In fact, their brains appeared to shrink at half the rate of those who ate less healthy food, says study author michelle luciano of the university of edinburgh. What's so great about having a bigger brain? \" people who have bigger brains in general can tolerate more brain pathology, more brain disease, than those who have smaller brains, \" a doctor not involved in the study tells nbc news. \" so the reduced loss in the people who adhered to the mediterranean diet in general would be expected to protect them from developing dementia, \" he continues. The study, however, didn't look at the effects of a larger brain on memory or thinking. A 2015 study also found people who followed a mediterranean diet had larger brains, but it attributed that to a high intake of fish over meat and poultry. In what should be good news for steak lovers, this latest study found participants ' habits of eating meat or fish didn't affect brain size. \" it's possible that other components of the mediterranean diet are responsible for this relationship, or that it's due to all of the components in combination, \" luciano tells the bbc.

        "summary": "Modern hunter-gatherers used \" digging sticks, \" crafted from wood, to search for edible roots and tubers, as well as to hunt. It's a tradition that stretches back at least 171,000 years, according to a new pnas study. Digging in italy, scientists have uncovered 58 wooden tools — including fragments of digging sticks carved by stone tools, with a rounded and pointed end and some more than 3 feet long — believed to have been crafted by neanderthals in the region of poggetti vecchi in tuscany during the mid-pleistocene period, reports newsweek. Their link to modern society is only one cool element of the discovery, though. The boxwood sticks — some of which appear to have been deliberately burned — present the earliest evidence of fire use by neanderthals, per a release. Researchers say burning the hard wood would've softened it, making it easier to shape, and helped to remove stubborn bark. Indeed, researchers who tried to replicate the digging sticks say they were unable to shape boxwood without charring it first, reports ars technica. Because women primarily use digging sticks in modern hunter-gatherer groups, lead researcher biancamaria aranguren says the discovery also suggests \" the active presence of women, something that rarely happens in prehistoric sites. \" she tells newsweek that hot springs in the area, which preserved the digging sticks for almost 200,000 years, might've actually been what drew both male and female neanderthals to the spot as they fostered \" rich plant and animal resources \" at a time when the region was growing colder.

The find sheds important new light on the earliest use of fire, and it reveals how sophisticated neanderthal technology was. The tools, called digging sticks, are still in use today. If you're a hunter-gatherer, the digging stick is your version of the swiss army knife for foraging: about a meter long, with one end rounded to offer a handle and the other tapered into a blunt almost-point. They're useful for digging up roots and tubers, hunting burrowing animals",

            "A collection of broken wooden tools unearthed in southern italy offers new evidence that neanderthals used fire to shape wooden tools as early as the middle paleocene, about 171,000 years ago. The find sheds important new light on the earliest use of fire, and it reveals how sophisticated neanderthal technology was. The tools, called digging sticks, are still in use today. If you're a hunter-gatherer, the digging stick is your version of the swiss army knife for foraging: about a meter long, with one end rounded to offer a handle and the other tapered into a blunt almost-point. They're useful for digging up roots and tubers, hunting burrowing animals",

Credit: pnas a team of researchers from several institutions in italy has found evidence of neanderthals using fire to craft tools approximately 171,000 years ago. In their paper published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences, the group outlines where the naturally preserved wood artifacts were found and how they discovered their purpose. Wood, as the researchers note, has always been a popular material for crafting tools and weapons. It is readily at hand and can be relatively easily crafted to allow for specific uses.

The developing story is fairly murky: employees of fosun group, which owns club med and cirque du soleil and is run by billionaire guo guangchang, say they've been unable to contact their boss since noon thursday. Guo — known as \" china's warren buffett \" with a fortune estimated at $ 7 billion — hasn't responded to messages sent on an internal company-wide app, per the bbc. An update on the story from south china morning post cites two fosun officials who say guo has been permitted to make phone calls but otherwise has limited personal freedom. Caixin previously referenced social media messages noting the billionaire was seen in the company of police at a shanghai airport after he flew in from hong kong. If true, the morning post reports it's unclear whether he might have been reeled in on corruption charges or is participating in the investigation of others. Police haven't commented, but guo was accused of granting favors to an executive of a chinese state-owned company back in august, notes the guardian. That exec was sentenced to 18 years in jail for embezzlement and bribery. \" we are still in shock, \" a fosun source tell the south china morning post. \" guo is very cautious in his handling of the government.

Democratic rep. Nita lowey accused the company of showing an \" epic lack of understanding of the dangers associated with excessive alcohol consumption, such as sexual assault and drunk driving, \" the new york times reports.

        "summary": "First the nra repurposed little red riding hood; now it's reloading hansel and gretel. The gun lobby group's fairy tales-with-firearms series, penned by amelia hamilton and appearing on the nra family site, aims to place traditional tales in a new \" utopia filled with empowered and unharmed children, \" as npr puts it. And interestingly enough, in contrast with the original fairy tales filled with horror and bloodshed, there's not much violence in these nra fantasies. In the new hansel and gretel rendition, for instance, the doomed brother and sister don't get captured by a witch and shoved into an oven: instead, the two go on a hunting trip and rescue two boys from the witch's clutches, with rifles at the ready ( but ultimately unnecessary ) by their sides. In red riding hood, weapons are similarly drawn but nary a bullet fired, which is still enough to scare the wolf away. \" it's all about safety and it's for parents to start those conversations, \" hamilton, a conservative blogger, tells cbs news. Still, the series has elicited criticism from gun-control advocates who call it a \" desperate \" move to boost gun sales. \" this is a disgusting, morally depraved marketing campaign, \" dan gross of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence said in a statement, per the washington post. But gun rights activist bob owens, who runs the bearingarms.com site, commented on media matters: \" so you would rather have one of the more traditional endings to the tale, where the grandmother is slaughtered and fed to her granddaughter...? \" meanwhile, the hashtag #nrafairytales has spurred online tales that are grimmer than grimms '. One notable tweet: \" jack &amp; jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down and the gun accidentally discharged. Jill is dead. \"",

Reuters/via reuters taipei ( reuters ) - archaeologists in taiwan have found a 4,800-year-old human fossil of a mother holding an infant child in her arms, museum officials said on tuesday. The 48 sets of remains unearthed in graves in the taichung area are the earliest trace of human activity found in central taiwan.

At the proximal end, it is irregularly broken at the distal portion of the lesser trochanter, and at the distal end, about 2 cm distal to the beginning of the divergence of the two components of the linea aspera. The bone is too incomplete to even roughly estimate its total length.

Humans are usually on top of the food chain, but that position in the pecking order was not as clear half a million years before our own time. A femur bone discovered within a cave in morocco shows signs its one-time owner was likely eaten by a large hyena. The middle pleistocene era found human ancestors competing head-to-head with many large carnivore species. These included not just hyenas, but also saber-toothed cats and giant baboons. However, little physical evidence of these ancient struggles for survival has, so far, been unearthed by investigators. Examination of the femur"

            "What is constipation? constipation occurs when bowel movements become difficult or less frequent than normal. The frequency or time between bowel movements ranges widely from person to person. Some people have bowel movements several times a day while others only one to two times a week. Going longer than three days without a bowel movement is too long. After three days, the stool becomes harder and more difficult to pass. What causes constipation? constipation is most commonly caused by inadequate fiber in the diet or a disruption of the regular diet or routine. Chronic constipation may be due to a poor diet, dehydration, certain medications ( such as antidepressants, strong pain medications ), stress, or the pressure of other activities that force you to ignore the urge to empty the bowel. Various medical conditions can also cause or aggravate constipation. Some of the more common medical conditions that cause constipation include endocrine problems, such as decreased function of the thyroid gland or diabetes. Colorectal cancer is another medical condition that can cause constipation but it usually also accompanied by other symptoms including blood in the stool and weight loss. Common causes of constipation include the following:",

Recall the rhetoric of the last few weeks. \" can anyone really say that u.s. Debt is completely riskless? \" our political system is deteriorating, and s&p was right to point it out. Let's hope the push begins for genuine fixes, writes klein. \" if not, then this may be the first of many downgrades to come. \" at time, stephen gandel also thinks the downgrade was justified. We're likely facing higher interest rates, which \" will make it harder for the government, americans and corporations to borrow money and expand, \" he writes. \" and after all the borrowing we have done in the past few decades, it's an outcome we deserve. \"",

It was funny, and all was well — until lavin started noticing the comments that began surfacing about her online. Hence, the headline of her piece: \" the ugly, sexist aftermath of appearing on jeopardy! \" she was soon \" running a sexualized gauntlet of unwelcome tweets, emails, and facebook messages replete with explicit sexual material. \" lavin reprints some in lurid detail, and describes how she got a radically different haircut and changed her social media photos, \" hoping to render myself unrecognizable. \" the kicker, though, is that when she reached out to other women from the show, she discovered she wasn't alone. \" nearly every female jeopardy! contestant that i spoke to talked about receiving one form of unwelcome sexual attention or another, which most of them hadn't expected when appearing on a show they'd loved since childhood. \" despite that, the piece ends on a defiant note: not one of the women regretted appearing, and lavin uses a quote from fellow contestant tiombi prince to end the piece: \" those men don't own me.

While he and neighbor daniel lapoint were excavating a backyard pond, they happened upon more than 40 mastodon bones, reports abc news. An expert from the university of michigan museum of paleontology confirmed the find and says the bones are from a male mastodon, about age 40, that lived between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago, reports the lansing state journal. The two unexpected archaeologists plan to donate the ice age bones to the museum. \" finding them was very, very cool, \" says lapoint, while the museum official is happy about the \" the new perspective, the new information, that specimens like these can bring. \" it's not uncommon for bones from the elephant ancestor to turn up in various parts of michigan, though sometimes the discovery is of a single tusk. In alaska, meanwhile, the study of mastodon teeth has solved a longstanding puzzle, reports alaska dispatch news. Carbon dating had suggested that mastodons roamed alaska between 10,000 and 75,000 years ago, but that never quite made sense: alaska had few trees then and mastodons had teeth tailor-made for chomping wood. The new study of tooth enamel shows that mastodons were in the region much earlier, about 120,000 years ago, when trees were more plentiful.

Here's a rundown of what the pundits are saying: based on dozens of polls, nate silver's fivethirtyeight projection system gives romney a whopping 97 % chance of victory, predicting that he ' ll win around 44 % of the vote, to newt gingrich's 29.3 %. That's close to the final florida poll from ppp, which has romney winning 39 % to 31 %. Indeed, romney has a sizeable lead already. At least 15 % of florida republicans voted in advance, the washington post reports, and one poll suggests romney won that round 55 % to 24 %. Romney's victory would be especially significant because florida is so diverse, the wall street journal adds; a win would indicate that he is indeed the candidate best poised to beat obama. Politico will be watching a few key demographics with interest. Will gingrich's marital shenanigans hurt him with women, as they didn't in south carolina? and will romney win over hispanics, as he didn't in 2008? ( polls indicate that he will. ) gingrich's totals in the panhandle and northeast will be interesting as well — those are the regions most similar to south carolina. And then there's rick santorum. He devoted no resources to florida, but if his total is too low, expect calls for him to drop out to intensify.

Guards thought carroll was taking a shower in the lamar county jail shortly after midnight, but authorities say he instead used the rod he took from a table to make a hole big enough to shimmy through, per wsb-tv and 11alive. He then vacated the jail itself by squeezing through an access door in a storage area before escaping the premises through a hole in the fence. At that point, carroll managed to steal a county van, which authorities later found abandoned in his native south carolina. The state patrol there is now helping in the hunt. Carroll had been in the jail awaiting transfer to prison on three counts of obstruction of an officer and one count of theft by receiving stolen property.

The blobs, which are actually whole colonies of tiny organisms, look most like polyps or coral, but they're probably more closely related to mollusks. And now, they've been unearthed in a biofiltration pond near stanley park's lost lagoon in vancouver, reports the vancouver courier. ( see the newspaper's video on the blobs here. ) \"it's kind of like three-day-old jello — a bit firm but gelatinous, \" says a member of the park's ecology society. The discovery is notable because bryozoan clumps have typically been found only east of the mississippi. Scientists are currently debating whether they are invasive and whether a warming climate is helping them spread, reports national geographic. They filter nutrients from algae, so there's a chance they harmfully alter freshwater ecology — and they can clog pipes. On the flip side, their presence suggests good water quality, reports gizmodo. They do require water that is warmer than 60 degrees, and the us fish and wildlife service published a 2012 report suggesting that climate change is helping them pop up all over the pacific northwest.

If you don't want to be freaked out, think of it as a peeled giant lychee fruit that can grow to the size of a deflated basketball.

Only one scientific journal mentions bryozoan found in british columbia, and that was in the gulf islands, the society says.

Recently, one such blob was found near the lost lagoon in stanley park, vancouver. While it might not look like something from earth, the blob is very much alive — and it contains multitudes. According to the vancouver courier, the stanley park ecology society found the alien-looking lumps — which are actually colonies of tiny marine invertebrates called pectinatella magnifica — in the pond back in mid-august. Upon further inspection, the team found the pond was actually rife with these weirdos. Advertisement pectinatella magnifica are members of the phylum bryozoa, which dates back roughly 500 million years. Here's how the blob forms: one tiny pectinella magnifica will reproduce asexually, and the process will keep repeating itself until there's an entire colony. Since pectinella magnifica are kind of gross and no one wants to be their friend, they have to make their own. Gross as it may look, the blob is actually good. It eats microscopic organisms in the water, filtering it as it feeds. According to the missouri department of conservation, a freshwater bryozoan presence \"usually indicates good water"

Known in latin as pectinatella magnifica, it's ok if you call the bryozoan found in a pond near lost lagoon by its less formal name — a \"chunk of goo. \" article continues below or at least that's how kathleen stormont of the stanley park ecology society describes the bryozoans that were discovered a couple of weeks ago in the biofiltration pond a few metres away from the causeway. \"it's kind of like three-day-old jello — a bit firm but gelatinous, \" she says. If you don't want to be freaked out, think of it as a peeled giant lychee fruit that can grow to the size of a deflated basketball. For those who aren't queasy, let your thoughts turn to what a brain or kidney might look like if it had evolved under water. Only one scientific journal mentions bryozoan found in british columbia, and that was in the gulf islands, the society says. More recently, a bryozoan was chanced upon in lake okanagan. \"they're a colony of tiny organisms that like to hang out together, \" stormont says. \"they have a very ancient lineage that hasn't changed for",

            "Image: vancouver courier via youtube sometimes, we are all this blob — a large, gelatinous mound sitting in a lake, begging to be left alone. Recently, one such blob was found near the lost lagoon in stanley park, vancouver. While it might not look like something from earth, the blob is very much alive — and it contains multitudes. According to the vancouver courier, the stanley park ecology society found the alien-looking lumps — which are actually colonies of tiny marine invertebrates called pectinatella magnifica — in the pond back in mid-august. Upon further inspection, the team found the pond was actually rife with these weirdos. Advertisement pectinatella magnifica are members of the phylum bryozoa, which dates back roughly 500 million years. Here's how the blob forms: one tiny pectinella magnifica will reproduce asexually, and the process will keep repeating itself until there's an entire colony. Since pectinella magnifica are kind of gross and no one wants to be their friend, they have to make their own. Gross as it may look, the blob is actually good. It eats microscopic organisms in the water, filtering it as it feeds. According to the missouri department of conservation, a freshwater bryozoan presence \"usually indicates good water"

As the last state where republicans will hold a convention in which delegates are up for grabs, nebraska represented the last chance for paul's supporters.

Organizers would be required to grant paul's faction up to 15 minutes for a nominating speech.

But the post notes that the lack of specificity was hailed by the daily stormer, a neo-nazi/white supremacy site that posted, \" trump comments were good. He didn't attack us.

        "summary": "A new study has found that the population of mexico is so genetically diverse that the term \"mexican \" doesn't really apply to anyone. Think about the differences between a european and an east asian — that's about how different a mexican from the north is from a yucatan native, reports nbc news. The study, published in the journal science, reveals that indigenous mexicans belonged to numerous pre-columbian kingdoms that remained separate from each other for thousands of years — and that since then, population growth, migration, and genetic blending haven't erased those differences, explains national geographic. It doesn't even matter that most mexicans are mestizos, or some combination of indigenous, european, and african heritage. \"hidden among the european and african ancestry blocks, the indigenous genetic map resembles a geographic map of mexico, \" says one of the study's authors. Such ancient genetic heritage has modern implications for mexicans ' health. Almost a million genetic variants were found among the study's 1,000 participants, which can explain why mexicans have varied rates of breast cancer and asthma, for example, adds the university of california san francisco, whose researchers were involved in the study. Significantly, the study found a link between lung function and genetic heritage; when looking at lung capacity, researchers found that a mestizo from the west could appear to be 10 years younger than one from the yucatan … even if they were the same age. The implications? doctors shouldn't base a diagnosis on someone's general ethnic heritage alone. The findings may also lead to more exact diagnoses and therapies.

He was unsure what to do, but father manuel saldivar told him to cross it. He made it to the other side, lost control in a dip in the road, and the van plunged into the bayou. He squeezed himself out of the driver's side window and grabbed a branch, clinging to it as he heard the children \" screaming and crying, trying to get out of the van, \" ric saldivar says.

At the meetings, officials from the nation's biggest internet service and content providers, including google and verizon, have tried to reach a consensus on how broadband internet service should be regulated in light of the decision.

The bbc and abc australia report that sewing needles have been found embedded in strawberries, from six different brands, that came out of supermarkets in queensland, new south wales, and victoria, per nsw police. Queensland health said in a thursday tweet that \" consumers should cut up strawberries before consuming them, \" even if they're not from one of the six named makers. Three brands — donnybrook berries, berry licious, and berry obsession — have been taken off the shelves completely. Among the reports cited by the bbc are a 9-year-old boy who's said to have bit into a strawberry with a needle ( he didn't swallow it ) and a 21-year-old man who reportedly went to the er after he ingested half a needle and experienced \" severe abdominal pain. \" a rep from the queensland strawberry growers association tells the bbc she thinks it was \" sabotage, \" and in a statement, the qsga says it has \" reason to suspect \" that an ex-supermarket employee is behind it all, per abc.",

Researchers had people from three different age groups sing ( kindergarten, sixth grade, and college-age ); subjects listened to what they were supposed to sing, then sang and were tested for their singing accuracy. Researchers found that accuracy improved between kindergarten and sixth grade, a time period during which most kids get regular music instruction, according to a press release. The college-aged group, however, had slid back — presumably because they had stopped practicing singing — and performed at the same level as the kindergarteners on two of the three tasks they were given. \" our study suggests that adults who may have performed better as children lost the ability when they stopped singing, \" the lead researcher says; the press release notes that just 34 % of us students are still participating in music instruction by eighth grade, and that number goes down further as high school graduation approaches. The researchers acknowledge that some people likely have an easier time staying on key, but the lead researcher notes that the skill \" can be taught and developed, and much of it has to do with using the voice regularly. \" just a \" tiny subset of the population \" is actually tone deaf, the press release notes. \" no one expects a beginner on violin to sound good right away, it takes practice, \" the lead researcher says, but \" when people are unsuccessful [ at singing ] they take it very personally, but we think if you sing more, you ' ll get better. \" ( either that, or take a pill that could give you perfect pitch. )",

        "summary": "A comedian's routine went off the rails over the weekend in south carolina when an audience member jumped up on stage and went after comic steve brown, reports tmz. In video of the event, the man can be seen trying to punch brown, before picking up the mic stand and swinging it violently at him multiple times. He never connects, however, and when the mic stand flies into the crowd, the man picks up the stool on stage and throws it at brown. At that point, two members of the audience break up the altercation. Another audience member tells the state that the incident began when brown began questioning the man, wondering why he came to a comedy club and wasn't laughing. \"i just remember the comedian asked the guy what was his problem, \" she says. \"the comedian asked, 'what's wrong? ' he just shook his head like, move on to somebody else. \" the man apparently became enraged and rushed the stage at the comedy house in columbia. The richland county sheriff's department was investigating, with an incident reporting identifying the suspect only as \" marvin \" and saying that he had been drinking. Two spectators were injured by the mic stand, and a bouncer took a punch to the face, say police. Brown escaped largely unharmed, but in a post to instagram, he said the incident shows \" why these comedy clubs should have well equipped professional security to protect us entertainers who bring their club so much money. \"",

As for the shipwrecks, \" never before has such a large number and types of well-preserved vessels been found at a single location, \" says cemal pulak. His new report on eight of the ships, which date from the seventh to 10th centuries, has been published by the international journal of nautical archaeology. As the new report explains, pulak's examination of the eight ships suggests shipbuilding had progressed to a more advanced state by the 7th century than had been believed, with the shell-first to skeleton-first ( with planks then affixed to the frame ) transition already underway by then. The institute of nautical archaeology describes pulak and his team as laboring \" for over three years through the heat and dust of summer as well as the sleet and mud of winter \" to carefully excavate what included two oared galleys roughly 100 feet long. The six oared ships in the overall find are the first byzantine galleys ever discovered, with depictions in books and art being the only former indication of their existence. ( in lake michigan, divers say they've found the \" holy grail \" of shipwrecks. )",
