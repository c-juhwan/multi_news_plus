        "summary": "Paula broadwell's fellow biographers are predictably unhappy that the author \" violated the bond of trust \" between herself and her readers by having an affair with the subject of her book, david petraeus, writes laura miller on salon. Opinions from two biographers miller spoke to: james mcgrath morris: \" she participated in something with her subject that reflects on his character and brings his judgment into question and she didn't disclose it. It doesn't even matter much what it was that she did. The real issue is the lack of disclosure of important information like that to the reader. \" david nasaw: \" when jayson blair did his nonsense, it reflected badly on all journalists, and this will reflect on all biographers. \" one issue: broadwell was not trained as a journalist. \" many of us come from careers in journalism and history, and for us the rules are clear, \" nasaw says. \" but they're not clear for everyone. \" but at the guardian, emma g. Keller notes that there's no clear \" code of conduct for biographers \" — and adds that writing a biography often involves \" flattery, seduction, and attempts to establish intimacy \" with your subject, which can lead to some tricky situations.",

But two military pilots seem to confirm the story: they landed in malta, declaring that they'd been ordered to bomb protesters, but had refused to do so and defected instead. Security forces on the ground are also reportedly using live ammunition, and witnesses told al jazeera that at least 61 have been killed today. Despite the crackdown, protesters say they're gaining momentum, and have captured several key towns, including benghazi. The country's justice minister has also reportedly resigned in protest over the deadly force being used against demonstrators, as have several ambassadors. Meanwhile, britain's foreign secretary said he had intelligence that moammar gadhafi himself had fled to venezuela, but venezuela denied the report.",

In fact, per records kept by the highpointers club, fewer than 300 people have managed the feat. Succeeding at the undertaking means climbing all 20,310 feet of alaska's denali — and all of florida's britton hill, which sits 345 feet above sea level. The wall street journal takes a quirky look at florida's highpoint, which it points out is no. 50 out of 50 in terms of elevation and isn't even half as tall as miami's tallest building. It's certainly not the only easy one to knock off the list: louisiana, mississippi, and rhode island also don't hit the 1,000-foot mark. Neither does delaware, and cnn reports that getting to the sign marking its 442-foot highpoint, ebright azimuth, is as easy as pulling over alongside a suburban wilmington road. Gear junkie reports at least 25 % of states ' highpoints are accessible via road, meaning you can drive your way to the top. But then it offers this foil: wyoming's gannett peak, which \" requires up to 40 miles of roundtrip backcountry hiking in the remote wind river mountain range. \" and then there are those in between, like south dakota's 7,242-foot harney peak, which can be knocked off the list after a six-mile roundtrip hike. While united states geological survey data is what has been used to compile the official list, the journal notes that there have long been whispers in florida that somewhere in the woods near britton hill sits a point that actually measures a sky-high 352 feet above sea level.

Two new studies suggest that there's a link between exercise and drinking, and that it \" could be a good thing, \" reports the new york times. What's more, neither study showed that exercise incites heavy drinking ( defined as four or more drinks for a woman, five or more for a man ). In one study, researchers at pennsylvania state university report in the journal health psychology an \" unequivocal correlation, \" as the times puts it, between exercising and then drinking, most notably when the workout was particularly strenuous. As the authors found, \" people drank more than usual on the same days that they engaged in more [ physical activity ] than usual. \" in the other study out of the university of houston, researchers report in the journal frontiers in psychiatry that the brains of lab rodents tend to respond very similarly, though not identically, to exercise and alcohol — and that the neurological high is markedly stronger when both activities are performed instead of just one. It's possible, one researcher posits, that by drinking after a workout we're subconsciously seeking to extend the euphoria of the workout. And the authors of the first study observe that while exercise \" has intuitive appeal as an alternative activity \" for drinking, \" the literature does not support this approach as a universal, primary prevention strategy. \" meanwhile, drinking during the daytime is on the rise, reports the telegraph.

Gizmodo reports china has been rolling out its \" terrifying \" social credit system since 2013 and on friday added travel restrictions to the list of punishments citizens can face. The system ranks people on what they do, say, and buy, according to the verge. That includes criminal and financial misdeeds but also things like blocking a footpath with a bicycle, and the system doesn't seem to account for much of a difference between the behaviors. Reuters lists other activities that can lower a person's social credit rank to the point of punishment by the state, including putting out misinformation about terrorism, failing to pay fines, and smoking on trains. While china doesn't plan to have its full social credit system in place until 2020, it has already punished over 7 million citizens under an early version. Travel restrictions will be added to those punishments beginning in may. The system is based on president xi jinping's goal to follow the principle of \" once untrustworthy, always restricted, \" but it could be yet another way he is consolidating power under the guise of anti-corruption. It can be unclear to people if they're on the list of citizens being punished for a low social credit score and what they can do about it if they are. \"chinese government authorities clearly hope to create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people's rights, \" the verge quotes a senior researcher for human rights watch as saying.",

To compensate, students are relying on federal aid, the ap reports. Last year 7.7 million students received $ 28.2 billion in pell grants — an almost $ 10 billion jump from the year before. That, combined with tax breaks and help from schools, kept average net tuition below what it was five years ago.

At public four-year schools, many of them ravaged by state budget cuts, average in-state tuition and fees this fall rose 7.9 percent, or $ 555, to $ 7,605, according to the college board's \" trends in college pricing. \" the average sticker price at private nonprofit colleges increased 4.5 percent, or $ 1,164, to $ 27,293.

Should we be encouraging even more people to pursue degrees when their economic futures are far from certain? like this article? join our mailing list: sign up to stay up to date on the latest economy headlines via email. For politicians, boosting college graduation rates has always been a fairly uncontroversial goal to support. The obama administration is doing so, rather relentlessly, through a number of initiatives designed to better prepare students for college and support them once they get there. The assumptions are 1 ) that students who graduate from college have increased potential for economic mobility, and 2 ) the more students who earn college degrees, the more our economy will grow. But are either of those assumptions still true, in light of our new economic reality? or are we wasting money investing in a sector that's producing thousands of janitors with ph.d.s? one thing's for sure: our higher education system has produced thousands of janitors with ph.d.s or other professional degrees -- about 5,057 of them, in fact, plus more than 8,000 waiters and waitresses.

Kids in the top 25 % of chemical exposure scored 6.6 to 7.6 points lower. \" the magnitude of these iq differences is troubling, \" a senior study author tells science daily. \" a six- or seven-point decline in iq may have substantial consequences for academic achievement and occupational potential. \" so what should pregnant women do? avoid scented products; plastics labeled 3, 6, or 7; and \" microwaving food in plastic, \" an epidemiologist involved in the study tells the guardian. It's smart to store food in glass containers rather than plastic ones, she adds. Meanwhile, certain phthalates have been banned in american children's toys and other childcare products, and linked to diabetes, negative hormone effects, and a decline in child cognitive and motor development. Yet the chemicals aren't usually labeled on us products, and officials have never warned pregnant women about them. The new research may not tip the scales, either: \" this study adds usefully to our knowledge, \" says a professor, but is \" not entirely consistent \" and \" may in part reflect...

Maezawa says the powerful painting had been unseen for more than 30 years and he now wants to lend it to institutions around the world. Basquiat, a brooklyn native who died from a heroin overdose at the age of 27, was a former graffiti artist mentored by andy warhol, whose silver car crash ( double disaster ) ( in 2 parts ) had held the previous record for most expensive american painting.

That might change, after a state witness whose testimony helped seal small's conviction recanted his testimony on monday. \" i was forced to do something i didn't want to and i can't take it back, \" david bollinger told north carolina's new hanover county superior court. The ap reports that when the police came to arrest small for the shooting death of pamela dreher, 32, who was found face-down in the pet store she owned, he thought they had come for him over a curfew violation. On the contrary: a teenager's call to a tipline led police to small and bollinger, then 19, reported the star news in july; he had lived with small for a time. Bollinger now says a wilmington police department detective told him he'd get the death penalty unless he said small was the killer. He says police also told him small would be released by age 21. So he pointed the finger at his friend, saying he drove small to the shop to use a payphone, and that small admitted to killing dreher. He testified monday he wasn't with small that day, and that an unexpected 2012 meeting with a man who had been exonerated of rape compelled him to step forward. The star news reports bollinger's grandfather, a former cop, had instructed bollinger to keep quiet about the lie, but that the 2012 experience made him feel the truth would be believed. A motion filed in 2015 lays out problems in the case, among them: bollinger's boss said the two were at a car auction in south carolina on the day in question.

Taylor was being questioned about possible bias in a case involving a man who allegedly penetrated a woman with a broom handle after holding her at bay.

As most sports fans know, tebow used his time at florida not only to prove he's one of the greatest college football players ever, but also to promote his christian values. And as he transitions into professional football, tebow is showing his values remain important to him, even with millions of dollars at stake now.

        "summary": "Hillary clinton's private email server was vulnerable to cyberattacks from june to october 2013 when there was no program in place to monitor threats, reports the ap. Shortly after platte river networks — which maintained the server at a data center in new jersey during that time — hired a company to install a product that would block hackers ' attempts to gain access in october, it halted five attempted attacks from individuals in china, south korea, and germany, per a letter from sen. Ron johnson, who's leading a committee investigation into clinton's email. It isn't clear how threatening the attacks were or what security measures were protecting the server prior to june 2013. Clinton's camp calls the probe a \" taxpayer-funded sham... With the sole purpose of attacking hillary clinton politically. \" meanwhile, subcontractor datto, which backed-up clinton's email, tells the washington post it contacted platte river networks in august about boosting security when it learned it was handling clinton's messages. Though there was never sign of a breach, an official says the company feared the emails would be vulnerable to attacks because of the \" sensitive high profile nature of the data. \" platte river says it ignored the request because the fbi had told it not to make any changes during an investigation. Datto earlier turned over its on-site back-up of clinton's emails to the fbi, but a \" hardware device \" relating to an off-site back-up was just handed over on tuesday, reports politico, meaning some of clinton's deleted emails may still be recovered.

The victim suffered serious wounds, while his companion reportedly suffered minor wounds. Chuang was rushed to a hospital but succumbed to the injuries.

A second chinese tourist was injured in the incident saturday night and received treatment in the local hospital in naivasha, 91 kilometers ( 56 miles ) miles southeast of nairobi, the kenya wildlife service said in a statement. In the same area, a kenyan fisherman was attacked by another hippo a few kilometers ( miles ) from where the incident with the chinese occurred, a police official said. \" the man was bitten on the chest and his injuries were serious and he died minutes after he was retrieved from the lake, \" said rift valley head of criminal investigations gideon kibunja. The deaths brought to six the number people who have been killed by hippos around lake naivasha so far this year. Wildlife service spokesman paul udoto said the circumstances are not clear in which the two chinese were attacked. He said attacks on tourists are rare because they are usually protected by guides.

Kennedy, and the granddaughter of the man who shot the latter now wants one of two things: the film back, or $ 10 million. Gayle nix jackson on saturday filed suit against the federal government, and in her complaint she traces the film's largely vague path. On nov. 22, 1963, a 52-year-old orville nix stationed himself at the corner of main and houston, ready to use the new 8mm home-movie camera he had bought the week prior. Per the complaint, he filmed it all: the shot, jackie climbing onto the trunk, the secret service reaction. And as wfaa explains, he captured nearly a mirror image of what zapruder did, having been on the opposite side of the limousine. On dec. 1, 1963, nix gave his footage to the fbi in dallas, which duplicated it. Five days later, united press international bought the original for $ 5,000 and a fedora and agreed to a 25-year copyright ( though the deal was based on a handshake, the houston chronicle notes ). Jackson alleges the original was handed back to the feds \" on at least several occasions, \" with the house select committee on assassinations in 1978 being \" the last to acknowledge having the original nix film in its possession. \" in 1991, the family got back all the material upi had, minus the original, its \" whereabouts unknown to this day. \" wfaa notes that some claim the original contains more frames than the copies do and could conclusively answer whether there was a second gunman, which nix believed was the case. \" he told us there was another gunman over there [ on the grassy knoll ], \" the washington post quotes jackson as saying in 1991.

The university of utah researchers used a technique called seismic tomography, which they liken to a ct scan, to detect a vast reservoir of partially molten rock under a smaller one that was already known to exist, reports reuters. Together, the two chambers make up the world's biggest known magma reservoir, the new scientist reports. The newly-discovered reservoir has a volume of 11,500 cubic miles, which is more than 11 times the volume of the grand canyon, nbc news reports. The study is published in the journal science. Scientists say the existence of the vast reservoir, which sits on top of a plume of magma from deep inside the planet, doesn't make a catastrophic eruption any likelier, the washington post reports. \" the existence of the second magma chamber does not make it any more or less likely that a large volcanic eruption at yellowstone will occur.

( photo: stephen mally for usa today ) human breast milk has been sold online for years, and health experts have warned about possible dangers. Now they have a new warning: some of the milk for sale isn't strictly human — it's been topped off with cow's milk. That milk could be dangerous for some babies, says",

The discovery that purchased samples of human milk may be purposely \" topped off \" with cow's milk or infant formula confirms a danger for the large number of babies receiving the purchased milk due to medical conditions. These babies are also vulnerable to the risk of infectious disease from bacterial and viral contamination of such milk, which was identified in a prior study by the same research team led by nationwide children's hospital. \" we found that one in every 10 samples of breast milk purchased over the internet",
            "Abstract background: the us food and drug administration recommends against feeding infants human milk from unscreened donors, but sharing milk via the internet is growing in popularity. Recipient infants risk the possibility of consuming contaminated or adulterated milk. Our objective was to test milk advertised for sale online as human milk to verify its human origin and to rule out contamination with cow's milk. Methods: we anonymously purchased 102 samples advertised as human milk online. Dna was extracted from 200 µl of each sample. The presence of human or bovine mitochondrial dna was assessed with a species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nadh ) dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene.",

The new goop office is under construction — \"it's like a dust bowl, \" she says with a laugh — so today she's helming her company from the kitchen island of her los angeles home. Fitting, considering it was at her kitchen table ( then in london ) that paltrow, 43, started goop as a newsletter to friends nearly eight years ago. Since then, she has built goop into a global brand: it has produced sought-after collaborations with valentino and stella mccartney; opened pop-up shops; and brought terms like conscious uncoupling and vaginal steaming to the masses ( the first a description of her amicable split from husband chris martin of coldplay; the second, a way to cleanse one's uterus — don't try it at home ). Her presence has also unwittingly exposed a dirty little secret: as fans, we provide actresses with wealth and fame, only to scoff when they actually lead that rich and famous lifestyle publicly. We want these stars to be \"just like us. \" but paltrow's life simply isn't. She won't pretend that she shops at the dollar store for beauty products or feeds her kids, apple, 11, and moses, 9, a steady diet of fast food;",
            "Gwyneth paltrow was definitely in the mood to share during her appearance on howard stern's siriusxm radio show on wednesday.... Especially when it came to her a-list exes. In the hour-long chat, stern of course wanted to know all about paltrow's ex-fiance brad pitt, who the shakespeare in love star was engaged to when she was 24 years old. The beautiful blondes eventually called it quits in 1997 after three years together. Getty images \" i didn't think about it at the time, but i ' m sure it did help with my career, \" the now 42-year-old actress admits about the start of all the paparazzi attention when the two got together on the set of seven. \" i definitely fell in love with him. He was so gorgeous, and sweet -- i mean, he was brad pitt, you know? \" video: a history of gwyneth's former flames her parents, the late bruce paltrow and actress blythe danner, also 100 percent approved. \" my father was so devastated when we broke up, \" she dishes. \" my father loved him like he was his son. \" in hindsight, she blames the demise of their relationship on her youth. \" i was such a kid, i was 22 when we met, \" she explains. \""

        "summary": "An american student detained in israel for 10 days will have to wait a bit longer to learn her fate. A judge on thursday delayed ruling on the case of 22-year-old lara alqasem, a florida resident of palestinian origin, per abc news. Granted the proper visa in the us, alqasem arrived in tel aviv on oct. 2 with plans to pursue a master's degree at hebrew university in jerusalem but was ordered deported. She appealed, and remains in a holding facility at ben-gurion airport, reportedly with bedbugs and no internet, per al jazeera. Officials allege alqasem, the former president of the university of florida's students for justice in palestine, supported the boycott, divestment, sanctions ( bds ) movement and so is ineligible for entry; a relatively new law gives israel power to turn away certain activists and anyone who \" knowingly issues a public call for boycotting israel. \" \" we believe miss alqasem meets those criteria, based on her actions and the actions of the organization of which she was a senior leader over several years, \" says an assistant to israel's minister of strategic affairs; his boss earlier this week suggested israel might change its tune if alqasem denounced the bds movement, which seeks to punish israel for its actions against palestinians. Lawyers for alqasem, who hails from the fort lauderdale area, say she cut ties with the movement in april 2017. They also say her student group had only eight members, per the jerusalem post. Israel is \" abusing its power in order to misapply its own rules regarding who is an activist, \" one lawyer adds. A ruling is expected in the coming days. Alqasem can return to the us at any time.",

Yet kathrine switzer entered, got a bib number, and completed the race, becoming the first woman to do so in an official capacity. Fifty years later, she's running the marathon again, outside online reports. \" women make up almost half the field at boston, \" she says. \" it's a phenomenal social revolution, and it has happened in my lifetime. To be there in boston to celebrate that moment, the place where it all began, is extremely gratifying and validating. \" switzer also cleared up some misconceptions about her 1967 run: \" people say i disguised myself — i did not. I was wearing baggy gray sweats like everyone else... All the men near me knew i was a woman. \" she also explains that she registered for the race using her initials only because she's been using her initials since age 12. She wanted to be a writer, and using her initials instead of her first name seemed more interesting, she says, insisting she wasn't trying to deceive race officials. In her official account of her story on her website, she says the rule book and entry form didn't specifically mention gender. But when the race managers figured out a woman was running — with an official bib — they tried and failed to physically pull her from the course. Though she was the first woman to officially complete the race, bobbi gibb ran it unofficially the year prior, and actually finished an hour before switzer in 1967, albeit again unofficially. In 1972, the boston marathon officially began allowing women to run.",

        "summary": "A heist of epic proportions took place over the weekend in london's famous hatton garden jewelry district. Authorities are remaining tight-lipped while the \" slow and painstaking \" forensic investigation continues at hatton garden safe deposit, but so far the bbc reports that as many as 70 safe deposit boxes were opened. James riley, chief executive of the gemmological association of great britain, frames the crime as a \" hollywood-style heist \" in comments to the guardian. Early reports suggest the burglars got to the vault area via an elevator shaft and used heavy machinery to cut through a wall. The thieves reportedly used the holiday weekend to their advantage: they allegedly broke in on thursday night, and police weren't notified until yesterday morning, the guardian reports. Hatton garden is packed with a heavier concentration of jewelry dealers and shops than any other place in the uk, and the guardian notes that many who stored jewelry with hatton garden safe deposit did so to avoid paying hefty insurance premiums, meaning some of the stolen goods may be uninsured. Authorities haven't yet placed a value on what was taken, though one former police official said the figure could hit $ 300 million. While riley describes the building as a \" safe on steroids, \" a bbc correspondent says it's possible the burglars had inside info, noting that the building was outfitted with a new alarm system that had yet to be activated. The chances of recovering any stolen gems? \" near impossible, \" says one diamond dealer. \" once diamonds have been recut and polished there is no geological map. \" ( another heist, in france, involved armored cars. )",

Senate were told tuesday that they could no longer film interviews with senators in the hallways outside their offices, an abrupt break with precedent that has set off alarm bells for journalists and media watchdogs. Hours later, however, amid heavy criticism from reporters and several senators, the chairman of the senate rules committee appeared to suspend that decision while his committee reviewed the matter. \" as of now, the rules committee is simply examining what the rules are, \" a spokesperson for republican sen. Richard shelby, the chairman of the committee, told cnnmoney. \" while the rules committee is reviewing the rules, reporters should continue to operate as they were operating yesterday. \" staff members of the senate radio and television correspondents gallery had told reporters late tuesday morning that they would not be allowed"

The cdc, for example, has a category on its mers information page dedicated solely to \" people with exposure to camels, \" noting that while scientists don't yet know for sure how people contract mers, there have been people in close contact with camels who've come down with the disease. And foreign policy points to a long tradition in the middle east dating back to the prophet muhammad of quaffing the excreted liquid for \" allegedly palliative properties. \" most people who've read one vice writer's review of drinking camel urine while in yemen probably won't contract the disease this way, though, as the writer's warning will likely inspire a healthy level of wariness: \" the taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting.

While officers were en route, they learned that a man had carjacked a vehicle belonging to the teenage girl at a nearby intersection. The carjacker then apparently abandoned that vehicle and tried to carjack a second one at walmart, but the driver refused to give it up. The carjacker shot the driver twice, then was confronted by two armed bystanders, one of whom opened fire, police say. \" he is a hero, \" witness brian adams tells king5. \" this guy could have taken out more people, wounded or killed. \" the bystander who killed the carjacker then got a medical kit and began helping the wounded driver.

        "summary": "Turmeric, a spice best known for its use in indian cuisine, may someday help prevent e. Coli outbreaks, but in a highly unusual way. Researchers at southern illinois university have made progress on incorporating turmeric into food processing and preparation surfaces — think cutting boards, knives, and countertops — according to a university news release. Curcumin, a primary component of turmeric, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Using nanotechnology, the researchers developed a way to bind curcumin to metal and glass; essentially they used tiny bubbles ( nanovesicles ) to enclose a curcumin compound. The coated surfaces kill microbes — including e. Coli — and prevent food from spoiling without imparting turmeric flavor into the food. As grist notes, this application could go well beyond food prep. Theoretically, the insides of cans could be coated with the material to make sure food stays fresh and safe. Other types of food packaging could take advantage as well. \" we know now fresher foods are also higher in antioxidants and nutritive value, \" says researcher ruplal choudhary. \" my goal is to find practical ways to use this technology to preserve food freshness as well as to create antimicrobial surfaces. \" it raises an intriguing possibility, writes nathanael johnson at grist: \" what if our next-generation, futuristic antimicrobial turns out to be the same thing people have been using for the 4,000 years? \" ( other e. Coli research has some advice for spinach eaters. )",

        "summary": "\" marcos rodríguez still finds it hard to be human. \" so writes matthew bremner in a profile of marcos rodríguez pantoja, a spaniard who has said he lived with wolves for 12 years beginning at the age of about 7. Bremner's piece for the guardian focuses the least on that period: rodríguez says he stumbled upon a den and went to sleep with the pups; when the mother returned, he says she fed him some of the meat she had and the rest was essentially history. He describes learning how to set up rabbit traps and use their blood to attract fish; when he was found by police, he was reportedly wearing a deerskin. Those details are as fascinating as they are easy to question: bremner digs much deeper into the aftermath of rodríguez's return to civilization and what led to him being in the sierra morena mountain range in the first place. After his mother's death and his father's remarriage and amid tough economic times, he was around the age of 6 \" sold \" to a man and tasked with looking after his goats ( bremner speaks with an anthropologist about the likely nature of the arrangement ). Rodríguez says he was brought to the sierra morena to apprentice under a shepherd who taught him some survival skills but disappeared one day; wary of returning to a home he said was abusive, he vanished into the mountains, where he says he befriended snakes and feared only wild boar. Life upon emerging was confusing, a maelstrom of \" rejection and disbelief \" combined with struggles like learning how to speak again. It wasn't until a 2010 film based on him that celebrity came, and with it more confusion: \" the intensity of their belated fascination was almost as puzzling as their earlier contempt — rodríguez could never understand what was expected of him. \" read the full story here.",

Komen's vp for public policy, abortion-rights opponent karen handel, fueled the decision, an insider with the group tells the huffington post. Handel worked to paint the decision as nonpolitical, the source says. She \" was the prime instigator of this effort. She said, ' if we just say it's about investigations, we can defund planned parenthood and no one can blame us for being political. ' \" huffpo reports that it was shown internal emails sent on the day the planned parenthood cuts were announced that confirm that handel had \" sole authority in crafting and implementing the policy. \" komen remains in the media spotlight following the decision. Financial records show that the charity's founder and ceo, nancy brinker, earned a $ 417,000 salary in 2010, with 50 other execs earning $ 100,000 each, the washington post reports. That ( along with expenditures like $ 3 million on travel ) may not help komen as it scrambles to recover from the mess. In order to win back donors, the group needs to \" tell the story of how many women they reach, how many women get access to care, how much research they're funding, \" a consultant tells npr. To that end, the group says it's bringing former bush press secretary ari fleischer aboard to help komen with damage control.",

        "summary": "The supreme court grappled tuesday with whether an indian tribe retains control over a vast swath of eastern oklahoma in a case involving a native american who was sentenced to death for murder. Some justices said they fear a ruling for the muscogee ( creek ) nation could have big consequences for criminal cases, but also tax and other regulatory issues on more than 3 million acres of creek nation territory, including most of tulsa, oklahoma's second largest city. The issue is before the high court in the case of patrick murphy, who was convicted of killing a fellow tribe member in 1999. A federal appeals court threw out his conviction because it found the state lacked authority to prosecute murphy. The appeals court ruled that the crime occurred on land assigned to the tribe before oklahoma became a state and congress never clearly eliminated the creek nation reservation it created in 1866. Lawyers for the state and trump administration, supporting oklahoma, told the justices that the practical effects of ruling for murphy would be dramatic, after more than 100 years of state control over the area, the ap reports. Violent criminals could go free and the state would lose its ability to tax a chunk of the population, the lawyers said. Other native american prisoners and defendants in oklahoma have asked to have their convictions overturned or their cases thrown out as a result. But lawyers for murphy and the creek nation said fears of chaos that would result from a ruling for murphy are overstated. The creek nation already has agreements with 40 local governments that allow its police to work collaboratively with other law enforcement agencies, said riyaz kanji, representing the tribe. The court's liberal justices seemed generally more sympathetic to the tribe, while the conservatives appeared likely to side with the state. ( click for more, including one potential wrinkle. )",

        "summary": "Following the recent murders of three female joggers in new york, massachusetts, and michigan, women have been warned: don't run alone. Meghan kita calls that admonition \" ridiculous \" at runner's world. Women know they are safer in numbers, but such advice is impractical — and sexist. \"some women — just like some men — simply enjoy running alone, \" she writes. Kita outlines a few other inappropriate reactions to the tragedies ( among them, safety-tips stories that imply the dead runners bear some responsibility for their fates ) before zeroing in on a message for men: while attacks like these are incredibly rare, harassment is anything but, and men need to understand the reality and the implications. Kita recounts a runner's world staff meeting where women shared stories \" of being honked at, shouted at, followed by strange men in cars \" — leaving a male co-worker shocked at the pervasiveness of the experience. \" i want you to care about this, \" kita says to male readers. \" if you feel you have the right to interrupt my run with ' a friendly honk ' or a comment about my appearance, what other rights do you think you have in your interactions with women? \" while, yes, it's a massive leap for women to fear that a man \" disrespectful enough to honk \" would go so far as to physically harm a runner, \" awareness and understanding from our male counterparts \" of what female runners regularly experience will do more for women than a bunch of \" hackneyed \" safety advice will.

The beloved satao was found dead by poisoned arrows may 30 in a remote region he'd migrated to in search of fresh water, his four legs splayed and his head mutilated where his face and tusks had been hacked off, reports the telegraph. His identity was verified on friday. The creature was said to have adjusted his habits to conceal his gigantic tusks from humans, keeping them cloaked by bushes. More than 20,000 african elephants were slaughtered in 2013 alone, according to some estimates, with the demand for ivory sending poaching levels higher than they've been since its trade was still legal in the 1980s. China and the us are considered the top markets for illegally acquired tusks, according to cnn, though in the case of the latter, obama is trying to change things. \" satao was probably one of half a dozen of kenya's great tuskers, possibly the largest, \" says a british documentary filmmaker who filmed satao extensively. \" if satao's death can galvanize the focus on what's actually happening here in terms of poaching, then he won't have died in vain. \" ( read about the baby rhino who won't sleep alone after poachers killed its mom. )",

        "summary": "It can be tough to tell, without biting into an apple, whether it's unripe, just ripe enough, or its tastiest days are behind it. Fortunately, scientists in lebanon and france are working on a new way to determine ripeness, and instead of using their teeth, they've opted for what they call a \" laser biospeckle technique. \" researchers shined a laser at the outside of an apple, and it revealed a speckled texture, as shown at phys.org. The riper the apple got, the smaller the individual speckle grains became, probably because of activity in the apple's cells, the researchers say. After the apple had passed its ideal point of ripeness, those grains started getting bigger again. Researchers checked their work by watching the apple's production of ethylene gas at the same time; the gas is increasingly produced until a fruit is ready to eat. As the grains got bigger again, the gas production got slower, science reports. Researchers are working on a similar process for pears. The hope is that farmers could eventually use the process to ensure their harvest comes at just the right time, photonics online reports.

Saying he was speaking as a private individual and not as head of state as the matter concerned his private life, hollande told afp over the phone: \" i wish to make it known that i have ended my partnership with valerie trierweiler. \" trierweiler, 48, had been convalescing at a presidential residence in versailles outside paris after leaving hospital last saturday, where she was treated for what was described as fatigue brought on by press revelations of hollande's affair with 41-year-old actress julie gayet. \" i extend all my gratitude to the fantastic elysee staff. I will never forget their dedication nor the emotional farewell, \" trierweiler said on twitter saturday. She is due to fly to mumbai on sunday for a charity trip organised by french relief group action against hunger ( acf ), in her first public appearance since the scandal broke two weeks ago.

A suspect identified as 58-year-old terry lee loewen was arrested this morning at the airport inside a vehicle he thought was full of explosives, reports the wichita eagle. Us attorney barry grissom said loewen, an alleged al-qaeda supporter, had been under surveillance for months. Federal authorities supplied him with the fake explosives, and they say loewen planned to drive the vehicle into an airport terminal in a suicide attack. It was timed to take place near christmas to make it especially devastating, they say. The ap reports that loewen is an \" avionics technician \" who came to the attention of the fbi after making pro-jihad and anti-american statements online. He also professed admiration for the late anwar al-awlaki, a us-born al-qaeda leader. At one point, according to court documents, an undercover agent suggested that loewen place a bomb at the airport, and the suspect wrote back, \" wow! that's some heavy stuff you just laid down. Am i interested? yes. I still need time to think about it, but i can't imagine anything short of arrest stopping me. \"",

            "For months, authorities allege, a 58-year-old avionics technician named terry lee loewen  driven by radical ideas and prepared to die in a suicide attack  moved forward with a plot to detonate explosives at wichita mid-continent airport. The planned attack was designed to inflict the maximum number of deaths at an airport in the nations midsection before christmas, says a detailed criminal complaint filed friday. The plot got as far as a gate to the airport shortly before 6 a.m. Friday, when authorities arrested loewen without incident. What he didnt know until his arrest is that the people he had been conspiring with all along were fbi agents, u.s. Attorney barry grissom announced friday, stressing that the public and passengers were never in danger. Loewen now faces three federal charges filed in wichita: one count of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of attempting to damage property and one count of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization that loewen thought was al-qaida in the arabian peninsula, based in yemen. On the afternoon of the day he had allegedly arranged for himself to die, he appeared instead in u.s. District court in wichita to hear himself accused of terrorism charges. When magistrate karen humphreys asked loewen, do you understand your rights? he replied yes, maam in a steady voice. Loewen is being held in the sedgwick county jail. Loewen worked as an avionics technician at the hawker beechcraft services facility at the airport. The company said it suspended his employment after learning of the arrest. He is alleged to have spent months developing a plan to use his access card to airport grounds to drive a van loaded with explosives to the terminal. Authorities said he planned to pull the trigger on the explosives himself and to die in the explosion. Grissom and fbi special agent in charge mike kaste stressed that there was no indication that loewen was involved with or working with any religious community in wichita and that his alleged actions in no way should reflect on any religious group. Hussam madi, spokesman for the islamic society of wichita, said friday: we dont even know who he is at all. We havent seen him here.

Greater hornbills are native to asia and prominently identifiable by their huge golden horn, called a casque. After mating with a female, the male hornbill will help the female enclose herself and their eggs in the hollow of a tree for safekeeping from predators. The male feeds the female through a small opening while she incubates the eggs. Generally, only one out of two eggs will hatch. Shortly after the chick hatches, the mother breaks her way out of the nest. But these parents aren't done yet. With the help of the chick, they rebuild the \"wall, \" shutting him or her in.
