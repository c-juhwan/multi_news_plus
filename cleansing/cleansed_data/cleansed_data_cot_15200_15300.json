The unusual thing about the case is that he never fired a single shot — the bullet came from a police officer's gun, reports wesh-tv. But authorities hold 23-year-old kody roach responsible for the woman's death because they say his actions forced police to open fire. As the orlando sentinel reports, the shooting took place in august when police responded to reports of a man waving around a gun at an orlando bar. When officers arrived, they say roach refused their orders to get on the ground and began reaching for his waistband. Officer eduardo sanguino fired nine times, hitting not only roach but bystander maria fernanda godinez, 22, who was killed. Roach did indeed have a gun, though authorities later determined that it was unloaded. Another officer had tried to zap him with a stun gun prior to the shooting, but it didn't work, apparently because of roach's loose clothing, say police. Roach got shot several times and was hospitalized for weeks, but he appeared in court today in a wheelchair for the first time since the shooting. Though his attorney says police were \" overzealous, \" the judge ordered roach to be held without bail. The state's department of law enforcement is investigating the shooting.",

        "summary": "Choreographer moon ribas describes herself as having two heartbeats: \" my own heartbeat and the earth's. \" she's not exactly speaking metaphorically. Thanks to a small chip grafted into her elbow, ribas feels vibrations based on seismic readings from around the world. During her performances, dubbed waiting for earthquakes, audiences watch as she moves and shakes — sometimes slightly, sometimes violently for up to a minute — in response to the vibrations she feels. If there's no vibration, she remains still. \" when you think about dance, you think about movement. Then you realize that not only humans move, \" ribas tells hopes and fears. \" the planet moves constantly. \" but even when ribas is off stage, the tremors continue, meaning \" earth keeps interrupting my daily life, \" the self-described cyborg says. Surprisingly, \" it's a nice feeling. \" ribas first experimented with gloves and earrings that vibrated based on how fast something was moving around her, creating a kind of new sense. Her chip, however, led her to create the nonprofit cyborg foundation — which aims to promote cybernetics and defend cyborg rights — together with colorblind friend neil harbisson, who says an antenna lodged in his skull helps him translate color into sound. Though the foundation faces critics in the bioethics community, ribas hopes others won't shy away from \" sensory extensions, \" which the washington post equates to the next generation of tattoos or plastic surgeries. While they may seem scary now, they could bring a wealth of good, ribas says. In the future, \" if everyone extends their sense of ultraviolet light, for example... You would be more conscious of the sun and how it will affect your skin. \" ( read about 10 ways technology is changing our sex lives. )",

Persky sentenced former student brock turner to six months in county jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. The 20-year-old could have been given more than 10 years in prison. The petition was started by nurse maria ruiz, who tells reuters that she was outraged when she heard about the sentence. \" honestly, i was terribly upset, \" she says. \" as soon as i heard about it i jumped on the computer and i was like, ' i have to do something. ' \" more: new york notes that turner's case may have been helped by the fact that authorities didn't release his mugshots until monday, allowing him to be presented as \" a well-dressed college athlete instead of the convicted felon. \" a booking photo from the night of his arrest can be seen here. In a statement, stanford said it \" did everything within its power to assure that justice was served in this case, \" including imposing the \" harshest sanction \" it could on turner, and that the release of mugshots was up to the sheriff's office. New york observes the university's department of public safety and the santa clara sheriff's office \" seemed to be volleying the responsibility for releasing the mugshot back and forth. \" the latter released the photo from turner's sentencing day, and the former provided one from the night of the assault. On cnn, meanwhile, the victim's extraordinarily powerful court statement was read aloud monday by ashleigh banfield, who spent 20 minutes of her legal view show reading all but the most graphic parts of the 7,000-word statement, the huffington post reports.

For the first time, authorities say that 22-year-old darwin martinez-torres also raped the teenager, reports the washington post. The allegation is significant: as the ap explains, virginia law allows prosecutors to pursue the death penalty if a murder occurs during the commission of a rape or during an abduction with intent to defile. \" you conform the charges to what the evidence will show, \" says fairfax county commonwealth's attorney raymond morrogh. \" it is my intention to seek the death penalty. \" nabra was killed on june 18 after she and a group of muslim teens were confronted by a motorist as they walked back to their mosque in sterling about 3: 40am. The teens had gone out for breakfast ahead of fasting for ramadan. Police say the driver chased the teens with a baseball bat, and witnesses recall seeing him standing over nabra before putting her into his vehicle. Police have called the slaying a result of road rage, though muslim groups say that it's a hate crime and that the driver went after the teens because they were muslim.

        "summary": "This little piggy went to market — or was it that little piggy? according to researchers at oxford university, it may be hard for people to tell which toe is which if their eyes are closed and someone's touching their lower digits — a condition called agnosia, afp reports. In a study in the journal perception, scientists had a group of 19 healthy ( i.e., no brain damage or other malady that would affect sensation interpretation ) volunteers between the ages of 22 and 34 stick out their feet and have their toes prodded, and while 94 % knew if it was their big toe or little toe being touched, only 57 %, 60 %, and 79 % could correctly id their second, third, and fourth toes, respectively. Meanwhile, when asked to id their fingers using the same method, the rate shot up to 99 %. The most problems came in differentiating between the second and third toes, per a press release, and no subject was able to guess every toe correctly. The confusion seemed to be more prevalent when testing a subject's non-dominant foot, and surprisingly, just under half of the volunteers reported feeling like one of their toes wasn't even there. \" we do know of medical conditions that can cause people to lose the sense of one of their digits, \" nela cicmil, one of the study's co-authors, says in the release. \" the people being tested here were healthy, yet some were reporting the feeling of a missing toe. \" why this finding could potentially be useful: if healthy people aren't able to \" feel \" their toes accurately, tests that check toes for sensation or movement may not be the best method to assess if a patient may have brain damage. Plus, \" a better understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie simpler mistakes of body representation … will help us to understand disturbance of body image in more complex cases like anorexia, \" cicmil tells afp.

Eli avivi — who gained fame when he declared independence from israel in 1971 and created the 3.5-acre micronation of achzivland, populated by himself and his wife — died tuesday, with his sister citing severe pneumonia, reports the bbc. He was 88. Avivi was well known among travelers, particularly hippies who ventured from all over the world to visit achzivland on the mediterranean sea near israel's border with lebanon. Avivi arrived at the site, once the palestinian fishing village of al-zeeb, four years after it was conquered during the 1948 arab – israeli war. Avivi, who'd fought with the jewish navy, took up residence in a lifeguard hut, per haaretz, and was eventually joined by his wife, rina, before israel sent bulldozers to turn the area into a national park. The couple declared independence, destroying their israeli passports, as they fought the plan. A subsequent court case and 1972 rock concert made achzivland famous the world over before avivi secured a deal in which he paid israel for access to the site and the sea, whose din would become achzivland's national anthem. Its similarly themed flag features a mermaid, but it was the micronation's utopian ideals that attracted hippies and celebrities like sophia loren and paul newman; those who entered were treated to an achzivland stamp on their passports, per abc australia. While the micronation's future is now in doubt, avivi previously said he hoped rina, 71, would continue to live at achzivland after his death. She said she hoped to make the site a memorial to her husband, whom she called \" the best president ever. \" ( the us has its own sovereign nation. )",

What's not to like about moxduo, a new painkiller an fda advisory committee will hold all-day hearings about today? its makeup, perhaps. Moxduo merges morphine and oxycodone ( that's the active ingredient in oxycontin ) into a single pill. And though its intention, per maker qrxpharma, is to bring comfort to patients in severe pain, an addiction specialist doesn't mince words: \" this is pure morphine and pure oxycodone. This is a product that is very easy to misuse. Very easy to crush and snort or crush and inject.... We think it will exacerbate the opioid addiction epidemic. \" to understand one of moxduo's touted benefits, you have to understand the risks of morphine and oxycodone. Take too much, explains npr, and they could suppress breathing to the point of death. That leaves some patients unable to take enough of either drug for fear of too great a breathing risk, not to mention other side effects ranging from vomiting to extreme itchiness. And as examiner.com explains, other painkillers like vicodin and percocet have liver toxicity implications due to the acetaminophen in them; it reports that qrxpharma sees moxduo as a replacement for these drugs, too. It estimates the \" addressable market \" for the new drug could be as many as 214 million prescriptions annually. After today's hearings the fda committee will make a recommendation to the agency about whether to approve the drug. ( read about another contentious painkiller that did get fda approval. )",

Now the former federal reserve chair is referring back to that same concept to describe a more specific, current phenomenon: that of \" abnormally low \" interest rates and a bond market on the brink of collapse, per cnbc, which notes the benchmark rate was pulled back to almost zero during the financial crisis and then kept there for seven years. ( the fed has since raised rates four times since 2015, but government bond yields are still lacking. ) \" there's only one direction in which [ interest rates ] can go, and when they start they will be rather rapid, \" he said friday on cnbc's squawk box. When and if this happens, greenspan said, it can also have a domino effect and put stock prices at risk as well, notes thestreet.com. The 91-year-old financial guru made sure not to blame current federal reserve management — he left in 2006 after serving as its head for nearly two decades — and he noted he himself didn't have any reliable prediction for when this collapse may take place. But he says it will likely be precipitated by a robust-looking landscape right before it all falls apart, which would send everyone reeling. As for those who think they can try their hand at analyzing the data and figuring out when this possibly calamitous event may happen, greenspan says they're setting themselves up for a \" disastrous \" experience.

The newspaper interviews a psychology professor and other experts who say that paddock doesn't seem to fit the criteria. For one thing, psychopaths are impulsive, and police have made clear that paddock's attack sunday night had been meticulously planned. Paddock also kept in touch with family members and had a girlfriend, traits at odds with the classic picture of a psychopath as a cold loner. In the story, one former fbi profiler suggests a simple if macabre motive: \" paddock may have fantasized becoming the greatest mass murderer ever. \" but that still doesn't explain what prompted paddock to move from fantasy into reality. Another former fbi agent wonders if some childhood trauma, perhaps related to paddock's father being a bank robber sought by the fbi, finally bubbled to surface. Meanwhile, paddock's girlfriend, marilou danley, has told fbi investigators that he seemed to exhibit symptoms of mental health troubles, reports nbc news. \" she said he would lie in bed, just moaning and screaming, ' oh, my god, ' \" one agency official tells the network.",

Non-islamic proselytism is prohibited by sharia, as imam rauf, who wants the united states to be more sharia-compliant, could tell you.

Flip-phone shipments climbed 5.7 % to 10.58 million, while smartphone shipments went the other direction, dropping 5.3 %. It was the second year in a row that smartphone shipments fell, though their total number last year — 27.7 million — still dwarfs the number of flip-phone shipments. Reuters suggests some possible explanations: for one thing, japan's smartphone fees are some of the highest in the developed world. Also, flip-phones are particularly cheap to own in japan. In fact, it seems a flip-phone culture of sorts exists in the country: as engadget reported last year, the phones are known as \" galapagos phones \" because they couldn't make it anywhere else ( reuters says the term refers to the phones ' evolution in japan ). But the market still faces trouble: it ' ll be tough to grow when the mobile phone penetration rate is at 98.5 %.",

        "summary": "As many on the left criticize big, secretive money funding republican races, liberals have decided to fight fire with fire. Leading donors, organized by the likes of george soros and venture capitalist rob mckay, are quietly putting their cash behind the democracy alliance. The group says it has donated some $ 500 million to groups on the left over the past nine years. That's not as much as it would like to be generating, however, given that competing nonprofits on the right raised $ 400 million in the 2012 election cycle alone, the washington post reports. Still, the democracy alliance has recently been garnering new members, it says. Instead of donating money itself, the group requires members to give at least $ 200,000 per year to selected organizations. Its new focus is on democratic efforts at the state level, particularly when it comes to redrawing districts. Yet the goal of the democracy alliance, members say, is to limit the power of money in politics. President gara lamarche acknowledges the apparent disconnect: \" there is a degree of irony in using the current system to change the system, \" he notes. \" but the alternative is a kind of unilateral disarmament. \" at politico, however, kenneth vogel sees a double standard on secrecy. Counters one donor: \" you can focus on the irony, but it's not hypocrisy because we're not trying to get something for our donations. \"",

The comet is roughly 1.4 miles long, and scientists say it is surprisingly active and has been spewing out jets of cyanide gas for days. \" we have a lot of work to do to try to understand what's going on here. This is just spectacular, \" a team astronomer told the baltimore sun. The nasa team cheered as they saw the first images from the fly-by — only the fifth time a spacecraft has come close to a comet.

The complicated process, which utilizes ticketmaster's new verified fan service, asks fans to buy swift merch or promote her music on social media to earn \" boosts \" to their place in line for tickets, all in the hopes that when tickets go on sale, they've boosted themselves to the front of the line and are able to snag seats at a show. Of course, buying stuff gets you a lot more boosts than simply watching swift's music video or posting about her online, but even that doesn't actually guarantee you a ticket. Not surprisingly, many are calling the scheme \" pay-to-play \" and a \" scam. \" a roundup of reactions: \" what swift and ticketmaster have essentially done is alleviate the stress and anxiety of dealing with scalpers...

At paste, hannah fleming notes the system is obviously skewed to the benefit of fans with money: \" wealthy sally can purchase the album up to 13 times and get the golden ticket! poor sally can watch the video an infinite number of times and post on social media but frankly — she doesn't stand a very good chance. \" \" i also take issue with the fact that this whole thing is being framed as a way for ticketmaster to weed out bots, \" writes hazel cills at jezebel. \" it would be one thing to have fans register and be vetted as non-scalpers before they buy tickets, but i ' m not sure how getting fans to buy merch ( one item is a $ 60 snake ring plated with 24k gold ) does anything to stop bots ( which, by the way, is not the fans ' job, it's ticketmaster",

The magazine issued a correction blaming an \" oversight involving a haphazardly-installed chrome extension during the editing process \" after trump was repeatedly referred to as tiny hands in one article, but it didn't notice until later that at least one other story had been affected, gizmodo reports. \" even if someone with tiny hands or sanders dropped out of the race tomorrow, they're still going to have fans, \" a merchandising company chief was quoted as saying. At wired, jason tanz says the confusion arose because a member of the art team had the anti-trump extension on their browser, and \" our production team thought the phrase was a meta-gag, and let it through. \" tanz takes a look at the whole concept of text-replacement extensions and finds that while they can be briefly hilarious, the idea amounts to \" filtering out or editing anything you might disagree with — not to make a public argument or convince anyone, but merely to comfort or amuse yourself. \" marco rubio, meanwhile, who launched the \" tiny hands \" line of attack, told an msnbc town hall wednesday night that he's \" not entirely proud \" of the personal attacks and his \" kids were embarrassed by it. \"",

A nashville fire department rep tells the tennessean that hailey, 16, and matthew, 14, heard noises downstairs around 11: 40am. Fearing a possible intruder, they hid upstairs, reports wkrn. Those noises turned out to be the hoverboard, and they soon found themselves trapped; matthew tried to open a door only to burn his hand on the knob. He ultimately broke a bedroom window and escaped using a ladder fox had retrieved after catching his daughter in his arms after she leaped from a bathroom window. The teens sustained minor injuries. The more than 4,000-square-foot house was \" destroyed \" by the toy, with the family only able to save a few pictures, reports newschannel 5. The foxes bought the \" fiturbo f1 \" for their son for christmas on the recommendation of friends, reports nashville public radio; the friends ' \" fiturbo f1 \" also caught fire, though it was a small blaze.

Q13 cites animal services officer erika johnson as describing the \" extremely horrific \" methodology: the animals were sliced from their stern to their genitals, and their spines had been taken from them. Johnson tells kiro 7 the cats had been strangled and surgically cut with a knife, but not in a professional manner. One cat was reportedly cut in half, per the olympian. The seventh death occurred early sunday morning; in an interview with q13, kathy harrigan described feeding the elderly feral cat she had tended to for the past two years around midnight. When she awoke, he wasn't at her door per usual. But later, someone else was: the police. Harley's mutilated body had been found in her neighbor's west olympia yard. Harley's was the sixth known death this year, with a seventh from october believed to also be connected. But it's the second in just a 48-hour period. Olly was found friday morning, and johnson says it's believed that cat may have fought its attacker; samples from her claws are being submitted for dna analysis. Pasado's safe haven and a local newscaster are offering a $ 3,000 reward in connection with the case.",

The death of 16-year-old patrick cooper on sunday during a trail race was followed on monday by the killing of a pogo mine contractor. The pogo underground gold mine sits about 300 miles northeast of anchorage; the daily news-miner reports that contract workers were collecting geological samples some distance from camp when the attack occurred. A second worker suffered non-life-threatening injuries and the bear was reportedly shot dead. \" right now we have more questions than answers, \" says the mine's general manager. Questions persist around patrick's death during the bird ridge mountain race, too. The alaska dispatch news reports the events that led to it are unclear beyond a text message he sent to his family saying he was being chased. Alaska fish and game rep ken marsh tells the ap the hunt is on for the bear, who was shot in the face and is believed to have attacked in a rare predatory move, rather than as a defensive action. Marsh describes the likelihood of the mauling as \" sort of like someone being struck by lightning. \" the dispatch news provides more context around the rarity, saying only 10 % of bear attacks in the state occur at the hands of black bears. A 64-year-old fairbanks man mauled in 2013 represents the prior most recent black-bear fatality. Read more about the attack on patrick here.",

            "Patrick cooper died sunday as the 16-year-old came down bird ridge near anchorage following a mountain race, the victim of an unusual fatal attack involving a black bear. A day later, a pogo mine contract employee in the interior was killed — also by a black bear. Experts say fatal maulings by black bears in alaska are rare. Until the past few days, only six deaths had been linked to black bears in 130 years, according to a biologist compiling a report on alaska bear attacks since 1880. The sequence of events leading to cooper's death is unknown beyond a text message he sent to a relative, saying he was being chased by a bear as he descended after finishing the 1.5-mile juniors division course of the robert spurr memorial hill climb. A state park ranger shot a black bear found near cooper's body but the animal ran off. Little information was available monday about the attack on the pogo contractor that left a second contract employee injured. If black bears are found responsible",

        "summary": "Mars isn't particularly habitable to humans at the moment, but nasa's latest brainstorm could one day bring back the planet's beaches — or at least some of its oceans, engadget reports. At a workshop in dc last week, scientists from the agency's planetary science division presented the possibility of erecting a magnetic shield around the red planet to replace the one that vanished more than 4 billion years ago and boost what's left of mars ' atmosphere, per phys.org. The result of such a shield, according to the researchers, would be protection from solar radiation and winds, which have worked over the eons to help strip the planet of its waters and warmth. The shield could, therefore, help \" terraform \" mars to more closely resemble earth. In a plan some say is \" so crazy it just might work, \" the shield ( maybe an inflatable one ) would be placed at the l1 lagrange point. It would hopefully thicken the atmosphere to the point where carbon dioxide ice at the planet's north pole would thaw, spur greenhouse-gas warming, and melt regular ice, which would restore up to one-seventh of mars ' oceans, according to nasa estimates. Per the scientists'report on what they admit is a \" fanciful \" topic, this \" enhanced \" atmosphere would be more conducive to human exploration, offering more possible oxygen extraction, more plant growth in \" open-air \" greenhouses, and the ability of larger structures to land on the planet's surface.

That's not exactly how it went. Daniel boria was forced to bail early in bad weather and landed elsewhere — and was arrested for his trouble, reports the cbc. After pleading guilty to dangerous operation of an aircraft in december, he was on friday sentenced to pay about $ 20,000, which includes a fine and a victim impact fee. Provincial court judge bruce fraser called the stunt \" unconscionably stupid, \" adding that \" there is no precedent for so foolish an escapade. \" fraser said the lawn chair made it up to an estimated 14,000 feet, into the flight paths of commercial airplanes. ( \" i saw a westjet flight go right below me, \" he says in this video, which notes he flew for about an hour and traveled at least 6 miles. ) boria has apologized for the danger he caused but insists he has no regrets, reports the canadian press. The star noted in 2015 that he broke his ankle when he separated himself from his balloon contraption and crash-landed; the lawn chair ended up landing in a farmer's field. Outside court, boria, now nicknamed \" balloonatic, \" told reporters: \" why climb the highest mountain? why 85 years ago fly the atlantic? why do the oilers play the flames? i chose to fly a chair; not because it is easy but because it is hard. \" ( read about another unconscionably stupid stunt. )",

( ap photo/richard drew ) ( associated press ) united nations ( ap ) — israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu accused iran on thursday of keeping a \" secret atomic warehouse \" just outside its capital, despite the 2015 deal with world powers that was meant to keep it from obtaining nuclear weapons. Hours later, iran dismissed the allegation. Holding up a poster-board map of an area near tehran as he spoke at the u.n.

Netanyahu's disclosure — which he presented as a big reveal on the international community's biggest stage — came four months after israel announced the existence of what it said was a \" half-ton \" of iranian nuclear documents obtained by israeli intelligence in the shourabad neighborhood near tehran. Israel said the cache proved that iranian leaders covered up their nuclear weapons program before signing the nuclear agreement. Iran hasn't acknowledged the alleged seizure. \" you have to ask yourself a question: why did iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse? \" netanyahu asked. \" what iran hides, israel will find. \" netanyahu didn't specify what the material and equipment was, and it was not immediately clear whether it proved to be a violation of the nuclear deal. The international atomic energy agency, which has been monitoring iran's compliance with the agreement, had no immediate comment. Netanyahu also said iranian officials had been clearing some radioactive material out of the site, which sits a short distance from shourabad, and \" spread it around tehran. \" he then even suggested that residents of the capital might want to buy geiger counters.

After finally endorsing paul ryan, trump also offered belated endorsements of john mccain — saying he holds him in the \" highest esteem \" for \" his service to our country in uniform and in public office \" — and new hampshire sen. Kelly ayotte, cnn reports. He also focused his attacks on hillary clinton, the hill reports. \" in one way, she's a monster, \" he said. \" in another way, she's a weak person. She's actually not strong enough to be president. \" in other coverage: trump, apparently keen to move on from a week widely seen as terrible for his campaign, even addressed the controversy over having a crying baby removed from one of his rallies, saying he had only been joking, the new york times reports. \" the baby that had a voice that was superior to pavarotti, \" he told the green bay crowd. \" i want to sponsor that baby. \" in a cnn interview friday, ohio gov. John kasich said he doesn't know how he will vote this november — but trump still has a long way to go to get his support. \" i wish that i could be fully enthusiastic. I can't be, \" he told jake tapper. \" so i don't know what's going to happen at the end. \" he also admitted that he avoided the gop convention in cleveland because he thought it would be \" inappropriate \" to attend when he wasn't going to endorse the nominee. Politico looks at recent poll numbers and concludes that trump is now definitely the underdog — he's further behind clinton than john mccain, mitt romney, or john kerry were behind their rivals at this stage of their campaigns — but he appears ready to fight back with a big push for working-class white voters in maine, michigan, minnesota, and wisconsin the washington post reports on a group of voters that confuse some in both parties: those who voted for obama in 2008 and plan to vote for trump in 2016.

The consulate staffer was charged with espionage and accused of having links to fethullah gulen, a muslim cleric who lives in pennsylvania. The turkish government blames gulen for the 2016 coup attempt against the government of president recep tayyip erdogan. In a statement sunday, the us embassy in ankara said nonimmigrant visa services for us citizens had been suspended because the commitment of turkish authorities to the security of the us diplomatic mission had been suspended. Turkey fired back hours later with an almost identical statement about visa services for americans, per the bbc. Reuters reports that us-turkish relations, already strained by attempts to extradite gulen, started going downhill faster after violence broke out at a protest during erdogan's visit to the us in may.

            "Ankara ( reuters ) - turkey urged the united states on monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a u.s. Consulate employee sharply escalated tension between the two nato allies and drove turkey's currency and stocks lower. Relations between ankara and washington have been plagued by disputes over u.s. Support for kurdish fighters in syria, turkey's calls for the extradition of a u.s.-based cleric and the indictment of a turkish former minister in a u.s. Court. But last week's arrest of a turkish employee of the u.s. Consulate in istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to u.s.-based muslim cleric fethullah gulen, blamed by ankara for a failed military coup in july 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup. The u.s. Embassy in ankara condemned ankara's charges as baseless and announced on sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in turkey while it reassessed turkey's commitment to the security of its missions and staff. Within hours, ankara announced it was taking the same measures against u.s. Citizens seeking visas for turkey. The u.s. Ambassador said the duration of the visa services'suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in turkey. In a written statement late on monday, ambassador john bass said the length of the"

        "summary": "Republican candidates held their final debate of the year in las vegas on tuesday night, and while there was no shortage of big lines, one of the night's strongest performances may have been too little, too late from a struggling candidate. Here's what the pundits are saying: donald trump managed to emerge as the winner despite a performance that was middling at best, according to john dickerson at slate, who notes that candidates were competing to show \" strength and toughness \" in the foreign policy debate, \" which meant the debate took place on trump's turf. \" anthony zurcher at the bbc notes that the other candidates seemed largely unwilling to tangle with trump, with the candidate's proposed ban on muslims entering the us attracting only \" tepid condemnation. \" jeb bush, the candidate who challenged trump the most, had his best and most spirited debate performance yet, though analysts suspect the impressive performance isn't going to budge his low poll numbers. \" donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency, \" bush quipped in an exchange that steve peoples at the ap describes as the \" kind of moment bush supporters had been desperate for in the year's first four prime-time debates. \" marco rubio had a good night, showing once again that he is \" the best natural debater in the field \" and winning a heated exchange with ted cruz over nsa data collection, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Mike allen at politico calls rubio the \" barack obama of 2008, \" a \" gifted communicator and performer \" who can rise to big moments. Chris christie's strong debate performances have helped fuel a modest rise in the polls and he \" acquitted himself well \" once again on tuesday, \" especially when he contrasted his executive experience as a governor with the work of the three senators onstage, \" writes niall stanage at the hill. Ted cruz \" had a mixed night, \" decides allen, noting that he \" looked afraid of trump \" and \" rather than breaking with him, he smooched harder. \" his multiple exchanges with rubio, including one on immigration, made both men appear to be \" the candidates on the rise, right behind trump, \" writes stanage. Carly fiorina, john kasich, and rand paul largely failed to get the kind of standout moments their campaigns badly need at this stage. Paul was in a \" fighting mood, \" but nobody was interested in sparring with him and he was \" effectively shut out by the overwhelming opposition to his foreign policy views present on stage,",

A new york city firm erected a statue of what business insider describes as a \" defiant girl \" to face down wall street's famous bronze bull in lower manhattan — all in the name of empowerment for women. While many people discuss gender diversity, state street global advisors wanted to \" take it to a broader level, \" company rep anne mcnally tells reuters. And so ssga obtained what mcnally calls the piece of \" guerrilla art \" from artist kristen visbal and placed it in front of the bull on tuesday. Ssga's installment of the fearless girl was done with an assist by the mccann new york agency, adweek reports. The move is part of the investment firm's initiative to push for more women on corporate boards, which it believes would increase both shareholder value and company performance. The firm, said to be the world's third-largest asset manager, planned on delivering that exact message to 3,500 or so companies on tuesday, asking each one to ensure at least one woman was on its board and threatening to vote against those who didn't make an effort to do so. Mccann has secured a weeklong permit for the girl statue, but organizers are hoping she might stick around for good, much like what happened with the adjacent bull. That piece was initially taken down after artist arturo di modica snuck it in front of the nyse on broad street in december 1989, but it was reinstalled a short time later by the city in nearby bowling green park.

An international team of scientists has announced news of the largest otter ever found, one that lived some 6.2 million years ago and has been given the name siamogale melilutra, the latter word a mash-up of the latin words for \" badger \" and \" otter. \" the discovery was made after studying an \" incredibly complete, \" though completely flattened fossilized cranium found in a mine in china's yunnan province, researcher denise su explains in a press release. She says the bones were in such fragile condition that a physical reconstruction wasn't possible — so the team relied on ct scans and virtually reconstructed it instead. The end result revealed a head with badger-like dental characteristics, says su, hence the animal's name. The researchers believe the creature was a mollusk-eater, which raises a, well, big question. \" a lot of times in modern carnivores, the large size is partly due to subduing prey, so their prey is bigger and the carnivores also get bigger, \" su tells npr. An otter wouldn't need to be wolf-sized — as siamogale melilutra was, clocking in at about twice the size of the south american giant river otter — to eat mollusks. Or would it? lead researcher xiaoming wang speculates that perhaps these ancient otters hadn't learned how to use rocks, as modern otters do, to open mollusks. It's possible they needed to \" apply brute strength \" from their large jaws \" to crush hard shells, \" he tells live science.",

It's no easy task to bring whisky into its golden years.

A neighbor apparently saw the children walking alone and called 911 to report it. Fox 5's marina marraco reports the children were walking about a third of a mile from home at the time. Danielle meitiv tells fox 5 she had told her kids to be home by 6: 30 p.m., and when they weren't, she and her husband became frantic and started driving around looking for them. The meitivs say cps didn't call them to let them know they had the kids until about 8",

Today spends between 4 and 7 minutes outdoors daily — a 90 percent drop from the time spent outside by their parents. For at least 7 waking hours a day, these kids are indoors and sedentary, in front of electronic screens, he said. If these figures are accurate, they represent a stunning behavioral shift within a single generation. Among those fighting back are free-range parents who aim to raise active, independent kids. Free-range parenting is meant to counter not only this housebound syndrome, but also over-protective, \" helicopter \" parenting which, says lenore skenazy, the founder of free-range kids, has"

Yellowstone's wildlife rules are clear: stay at least 25 yards away from large animals, quadruple that for bears and wolves. But one woman ignored that sunday and got too close for an elk's comfort — and got charged for her trouble, the san francisco chronicle reports. Jody tibbitts, a yellowstone guide for 25 years, was giving the grand tour to a family from florida when he noticed the woman creeping closer to the elk with her camera. \" she was practically stomping up to it, \" he tells the east idaho news. \" i'd say she was probably 25 feet away from the elk as opposed to the 25 yards. \" another man with tibbitts ' group started filming the encounter as the guide warned her to steer clear, and the elk can be seen on the video suddenly dashing toward her. When the camera pans to the woman, she's on the ground, the elk a short distance away ( tibbitts says the elk didn't hit her — she tripped ). \" i was just going to tell you you're too close to that elk — and that's why, \" tibbitts can be heard admonishing the woman. She thanks him, saying, \" it won't happen again. \" \" i ' m sure it won't, \" he replies. A park rep tells abc news that people often get overzealous, especially in their quest for selfies. \" people generally are just so excited to be in a park, and the next cool thing is if they can get a picture of wildlife, and then the third thing is: ' can i get a picture of me and the wildlife? ' \" he notes. Tibbitts, who says even the most docile-looking animals can prove dangerous, notes the elk had just given birth and may have been protecting her calf; he adds, per cnn, that female elks can weigh up to 500 pounds, capable of causing serious damage or even death. \" imagine a stranger coming into your home and whistling and staring and taking photos, \" he tells the east idaho news. \" you'd be pretty upset, too. \" ( yellowstone had to euthanize a baby bison after tourists tried to \" help \" it. )",

The findings have scientists not only rethinking how long ago gomphotheres lived, reports io9, but when and where the clovis people lived and whether they had an appetite for gomphotheres, which were the size of today's elephants. Seven clear quartz clovis points were unearthed at the site, and four of those were actually in place among the bones; one had bone and teeth fragments around it.

But a new usda report shows they aren't all bad: surprisingly, k-cups actually help users to be less wasteful. Rather than guessing how much coffee to put in a filter, then dumping the remains of a pot down the drain, people are brewing only the coffee they drink, reuters reports. \" people used to make a pot of coffee, now they make a cup, \" says the owner of a california-based roaster. \" right there we're losing the sink as a consumer. \" the effects are actually pretty huge. For the first time in six years, american coffee consumption is expected to fall by more than 1 %, from 24 million 60kg bags in the 12-month period ending in september to 23.7 million bags in 2015-2016, reports the washington post. That equals about 1.85 cups of coffee per person per day. While an aging population plays a role in the decline, so do single-serve brewers. At least one in four us homes now has one, an increase of 15 % since last year, according to the national coffee association — though the machines are less popular abroad. That might explain why the us is the only one of the top eight coffee-consuming countries to suddenly drink less, though countries including south korea, thailand, switzerland, and colombia will also cut their consumption this season. The global coffee demand, however, is expected to climb by nearly 2 million bags to 147.6 million. Some less-welcome news: americans may be drinking less coffee, but we're spending more than ever: a record $ 11.9 billion in 2014. That figure will reportedly climb to $ 12.8 billion this year and $ 13.6 billion in 2016, reuters reports. ( keurig recently admitted another k-cup fail. )",

Sculpting is apparently big at schools like this, slate explains, because hubbard said students are frustrated when they have no access to \"mass, \" or the physical presence of whatever object they're studying. According to the official study technology website, without mass students feel, among other things, \"sort of spinny \" and \"squashed. \" therefore, suri will probably be encouraged to use clay to sculpt concepts she's learning about. She ' ll likely start each day with a list of lessons and tasks, which a teacher or more advanced student will check off as each is completed. Students work at their own pace, so rather than lecturing the entire class, teachers usually rotate amongst the students to provide individual support. Students track their progress with a graphing, point-based system, but some critics and former students say it's easy to pad point totals with easy tasks, and that grade inflation is common. One more odd tidbit: hubbard, who didn't believe in learning disabilities, said yawning was a sign that a student had misunderstood a word — so if suri yawns, that ' ll likely bring a teacher post-haste.

She has clothing even i would kill for and she drinks coffee, too. But none of those things bothered me. But red lipstick is just ridiculous and that is exactly what she was spotted wearing in manhattan last week. It's sad, really. Childhood is a blip on the course of life, a mere 10 years in a lifetime. So why would anyone want to rush through that? sure, my daughter loves to try on mommy's makeup and put on lip gloss and wear my heels. But she also knows those activities are for fun. She would never think she could wear lipstick just out and about. And i would never let her, especially red lipstick, which is dramatic and sexy on adults. On children, it just looks weird.

Tagouri won praise from some quarters for breaking barriers. Noting that \" veiled women bear the brunt of the animosity the entire muslim community faces in america, \" aymann ismail writes in slate that tagouri \" speaks out and treads new ground as an individual … [ and ] deserves the full support of the entire muslim community. \" \" congrats@ntagouri, \" one female supporter tweeted.

Despite good intentions, playboy has \" fallen into the slut-shaming game of islamists around the world, \" writes maajid nawaz at the daily beast.

Let us not ban the hijab, but let us not glamorize it either. \" tagouri, an aspiring on-air reporter, said she's ignoring the backlash. \" it's just negative energy and unhealthy, \" she told the magazine.

The dispute between billionaire philanthropist george soros and prime minister viktor orban escalated tuesday when soros announced that he was closing his open society foundations offices in hungary and moving them to berlin. Soros blames the \" repressive \" policies of orban, while orban accuses soros of trying to flood hungary and the rest of europe with immigrants to undermine governments. A look at what's going on:'stop soros ': orban campaigned on a law known as \" stop soros \" designed to hobble non-government organizations such as the osf, reports the bbc. Among other things, it would put a crippling 25 % tax on foreign donations to programs designed to promote immigration. Surprising tie: back in 1988, a young orban applied for and received a scholarship from the soros organization to study how countries make the transition from dictatorships to democracies, reports the new york times. \" one of the main elements of this transition can be the rebirth of civil society, \" he wrote.

The man wanted for questioning in connection with a triple-homicide in caldwell may have been seen near salt lake city. Idaho state police in eastern idaho said saturday that a caller reported seeing gerald \" mike \" bullinger on wednesday, june 28, driving southbound on interstate 15. The canyon county sheriff's office, which is investigating the homicides, could not verify the reported sighting. Monday morning investigators released more photos of bullinger that were taken prior to the deaths around the middle of may by security cameras inside a local retailer. Officials hope to show a more accurate representation of what he might currently look like. The sheriff's office has said that bullinger was seen on june 11 in ogden, utah. Three people, all female, were found dead on june 19 at bullinger's home on kcid road. Canyon county investigators on friday identified one of the victims as bullinger's wife, cheryl baker, who was 56 years old. The other two victims have not been identified. An arrest warrant charging bullinger with failure to report a death has been issued. The canyon county sheriff's office is calling him a person of interest in the homicides. Bullinger is 60 years old. He is described as 6-foot-1, 240 pounds, with gray hair and brown eyes. He may be driving a white 2007 ford focus with utah license plate 129ump. If you believe you have seen him, call your nearest law enforcement agency. © 2017 ktvb-tv"

        "summary": "The world's \" highest significant wave height as measured by a buoy \" was 62.3 feet, located in the ( very ) high seas between the uk and iceland, and occurred in 2013, the world meteorological organization has confirmed. The wave formed after a strong cold front passed through the remote area, which is home to \" intense extra-tropical storms \" sometimes called \" bombs. \" other waves have been reported to be taller, including tsunamis, rogue waves, and a 95-foot wave observed by a ship in the same waters in 2000, but this is the highest to be confirmed by a buoy, which is arguably the most exacting tool we have, reports usa today. Estimates by satellites and ships \" are generally unverifiable, since there is no ground truth for the satellite, and the others tend to be from pitching and rolling platforms, \" one wave expert says. The 62-footer is now part of the wmo's global weather &amp; climate extremes archive, reports the guardian. The archive logged two other records earlier this year: the longest distance of a single lightning flash ( in oklahoma ), and the longest duration of one ( in southern france ). As for other waves, the smithsonian reports that the tallest tsunami wave ever recorded ( though not by a buoy ) was a 100-foot wave that followed a landslide in 1958 in alaska's lituya bay, which destroyed trees 1,700 feet upslope. And the national ocean service and european space agency confirm that freakish rogue waves, once \" dismissed as a nautical myth, \" do exist, though they've only been measured by the ships that suffer their wrath.

The victim, who was not named but was in her early 30s, was admitted to hospital by police after she leapt from the first floor when two men tried to enter her room in the hotel agra mahal at around 4: 00 am. The incident came just days after a swiss cyclist was gang-raped by a group of villagers on friday night while on a cycling trip with her husband that was meant to include a stopover in agra. That attack refocused attention on the country's poor record on safety for women, after thousands took to the streets in nationwide protests following the fatal gang-rape of an indian student on a bus in new delhi in december.

Exec john smedley had been tweeting about a \" large scale \" hack of sony's systems; he then tweeted that he was boarding a plane.
