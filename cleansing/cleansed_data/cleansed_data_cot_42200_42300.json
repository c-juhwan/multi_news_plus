        "summary": "Before his big immigration speech on wednesday, donald trump plans to visit somewhere where he is hated so much that he is regularly burnt in effigy during parties — and it's not ted cruz's house. Instead, trump will make a surprise visit to mexico to meet president enrique peña nieto, who has slammed trump's plan to make mexico pay for a border wall and compared the candidate to the likes of adolf hitler and benito mussolini, reports the washington post. Trump's campaign says peña nieto invited both trump and clinton to mexico a few days ago and trump has decided to take him up on the offer for private talks. Trump's arizona speech on immigration is scheduled for 6pm local time wednesday and the mexico visit will probably happen around midday, after a fundraising trip to california, reports the guardian, which notes that trump made no mention of a border wall or a \" deportation force \" during a speech in everett, wash., on tuesday night. Sources tell the post that new campaign chief steve bannon urged trump to make the visit, saying it would get headlines and make him seem statesmanlike. It's less clear what benefits the visit could have for peña nieto, whose approval level has sunk to just 23 % and is unlikely to be raised by appearing with trump.",

        "summary": "A third of americans own firearms, and they are more likely to do so because of \" gun culture \" than a need for protection, according to a study in injury prevention, which, as the journal's name suggests, approaches gun ownership from a public-health angle. The researchers say gun owners tend to be married white males over 55, but there's a lot of variation among regions in gun ownership rates, with delaware the lowest at 5.2 % and alaska the highest at 61.7 % ( see where your state ranks here ). The researchers say people exposed to \" social gun culture, \" which includes having friends and family who owned guns, were more than twice as likely as others to own a gun themselves, and to say that their social circle would think less of them if they didn't have one. To reduce gun ownership — and consequently gun-related deaths and injuries — the study's authors say policymakers should consider tackling gun culture, which sounds like a pretty tall order to duke university behavioral sciences professor jeffrey swanson. \" it's important to realize that this is the country we live in, \" he tells healthday. \" guns are domesticated. We celebrate them, and have a lot of them. It's part of the landscape. All we can do is try and figure out who are the dangerous people who should not have guns.

On the national assessment of educational progress engineering and technology exam, given in 2014 to 21,500 eighth-graders from 840 schools, 45 % of female students were proficient in tech skills, compared to 42 % of male students, fortune reports. But they did even better on questions that involved communication and collaboration ( involving troubleshooting and coming up with solutions; girls earned a 5-point lead here ) and communication technology ( a 6-point lead in an area that measured familiarity with software and systems ). \" we did not expect this pattern, and the pattern does seem to be pretty clear from the data, \" says peggy carr, acting commissioner of the national center for education statistics. Carr says the gap between females and males was surprising, since boys tend to do better on math and science achievement tests, as well as seem more into engineering and tech jobs, per this year's us news/raytheon stem index. Except for asians, the gender difference existed even parsed by race: white females surpassed white males by 4 points, black females enjoyed a 5-point lead, and hispanic females came in 2 points better than males. The reason for the interactive test, as noted by the wall street journal: to gauge how us students will do when they're sent out into today's technologically advanced world.

        "summary": "On thursday, president trump withdrew from the paris climate agreement, joining nicaragua and syria as the only countries not on board with the international accord. The new york times looks at what happens next with the agreement and climate change. First, the formal withdrawal process takes four years, ending the day after the next presidential election, meaning a future president could rejoin. In the meantime, other countries could relax their own plans to curb emissions with the us out of the picture. But other experts predict a \" galvanizing effect \" among the remaining countries. Here's what else you need to know about trump's decision: first, fortune explains the paris climate agreement. The gist is that countries agree to work toward keeping the global average temperature from rising 3.6 degrees over the pre-industrial average, at which point scientists believe the effects of climate change would be irreversible. In a statement, al gore called trump's decision \" reckless and indefensible. \" but he adds the transition to clean energy will be continued by mayors, governors, the business community, and the american people. Bill mckibben, writing for the new york times, calls withdrawing from the agreement \" our nation's dumbest act since launching the war in iraq \" and one that hurts not only civilization's ability to survive climate change but also civilization itself by undermining both diplomacy and science. Pascal-emmanuel gobry in the week counters that outrage over the decision is \" absolute nonsense \" in that the agreement was weak and ineffectual, with countries left to set their own goals for reducing emissions. ( though he also says withdrawing from it won't do anything to add jobs in the rust belt. ) president obama says leaving the paris climate agreement is a rejection of the future, leaving the countries that remain to \" reap the benefits in jobs and industries created, \" the hill reports. Elon musk is leaving trump's presidential advisory council over the decision, tweeting, \" climate change is real. \" weather.com was also, clearly, not a fan of the decision. Below a livestream of trump's press conference, it ran stories about \" antarctica turning green \" and \" california's coast disappearing into the sea \" in an effort to get the american public to care about climate change. Finally, quartz reports a us not fully committed to reducing emissions may have actually hurt the climate agreement more by staying in it. \" it is a club for countries who are part of a global effort to tackle dangerous climate change... The us no longer meets these admission criteria, \" says a member of ireland's",

        "summary": "The \"bunga bunga \" fallout continues: police nabbed an italian businessman for allegedly blackmailing silvio berlusconi in the sex scandal that's clouded his tenure as prime minister. Giampaolo tarantini has acknowledged recruiting women for berlusconi's alleged sex parties, but he's maintained that the pm didn't know that some were escorts. Police say tarantini was paid almost $ 750,000 to protect berlusconi and to seek a fast-track trial that would reveal as little as possible about the parties. The arrest of tarantini and his wife, angela devenuto, comes after investigators listened in on 50 phone calls, the telegraph reports. Berlusconi says he paid tarantini simply out of the goodness of his heart. \"i helped a person and a family with children who found themselves, and still find themselves, in grave economic difficulties, \" he told a magazine last week. \"i did nothing wrong, i simply helped a desperate man, asking nothing in return. That's the kind of person i am and nothing will ever change that. \" however, phone transcripts paint a different picture: in one, berlusconi pledged to leave the \"shitty \" country he leads, the guardian reports.",

        "summary": "An international team of scientists studying the effects of salt intake on our bodies has discovered a surprise: high-salt diets seem to make us less thirsty over time. Reporting in the journal of clinical investigation, they confirm previous findings that more salt makes humans pee more, but added \" seemingly counterintuitive \" findings that humans on higher-salt diets also consume less water and feel hungrier. The findings, part of the mars500 project to research space travel, may not only help nutritionists plan what meals astronauts traveling 510 days to mars and back should eat, but could help us better understand how our bodies achieve homeostasis, or balance, reports usa today. It seems that bartenders aren't wrong in putting out salty snacks — they make us thirsty in the short term. But after a while, the opposite appears to hold true. In their study, researchers observed 10 healthy men in a highly controlled environment for 205 days and tested three levels of daily salt intake: 6 grams, 9 grams, and 12 grams, reports the independent. Over time, the more salt consumed, the less water the men drank and the hungrier they became. So what's going on? the answer apparently revolves around the bodily compound urea. \" its function is to keep water in when our bodies get rid of salt, \" says one of the researchers. \" nature has apparently found a way to conserve water that would otherwise be carried away into the urine by salt. \" but because producing urea is a taxing process that requires energy, it results in feelings of hunger. The latter point was confirmed in a separate but related study of mice, per popular science.",

( it opens jan. 26. ) the play, which had its first new york staging off broadway in 1998, is an actor's tour de force about an exacting poetry professor who undergoes a brutal — and by now outdated — experimental treatment for stage 4 ovarian cancer, a woman who excelled all her life by analytical brainpower suddenly forced to grapple with extreme, unwelcome emotions. Nixon herself discovered she had breast cancer during a routine mammogram in 2006 ( it was caught at an early stage and required a lumpectomy and radiation but no chemotherapy; she still takes tamoxifen ).

Because i never felt i was not free in all these years, so the fact that i am no longer under house arrest does not make me feel any freer. \" she adds, smiling, \" i am a lot busier. \" her message for u2's bono and outside supporters: \" after many years, i am finally able to speak to you. You who across such distances sent support to burma, we thank you. Students, teachers, workers, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, music fans — u2 fans like me.

Now he's in the news again after his arrest in florida last week, with authorities saying he was on the lam for two years to avoid facing lawsuits from investors and sonar analysts who want their promised share of whatever booty he pulled up, the ap reports. The state of ohio is trying to extradite thompson after he failed to show up for a court appearance there; a florida judge has postponed his next hearing to next week. As for those aforementioned investors and business associates, they want to know where thompson's money is — after all, he used just cash for two years in order to remain undetected, and us marshals say they found almost $ 500,000 in cash in his hotel room — and they've filed subpoenas seeking documents from his hotel stay. \" if he has millions of dollars of cash hidden somewhere, if he has 500 gold coins hidden somewhere, those are assets he needs to answer questions about, \" says an attorney for the sonar analysts who sued for profits they say they were cheated out of. The recovered gold was reportedly sold for $ 50 million to a gold marketing firm in 2000, though thompson's lawyers and supporters say he used most of the sale funds to pay off loans and legal fees, but what florida authorities say they found in 2012 at a mansion he used to rent doesn't look good: bank wraps for $ 10,000 amounts, a dozen cellphones ( each one designated for a different attorney or relative ), and pipes ostensibly used to hide money underground. The attorney says there is evidence thompson has gold coins worth at least $ 2 million.

        "summary": "Sony is calling on news organizations to stop publishing the mountain of information coming out of hackers ' breach of company data. After the emergence of material ranging from hollywood pay to personal attacks on angelina jolie, a letter to the los angeles times, new york times, gawker, and other media organizations called on them to destroy any material from the leak. It's \" stolen information, \" says the letter from leading lawyer david boies, and it's \" protected under us and foreign legal doctrines protecting attorney-client privileged communications, \" the los angeles times reports. Sony has written to other film studios seeking their support, bloomberg reports. Though the letter threatens legal action, many experts say it's unlikely that news agencies will be held legally accountable for publishing the material, thanks to first amendment protections, the washington post reports. Cases in the past involving the publishing of information stolen by an outside figure and provided to the media have been found in favor of the media. \" so long as media outlets didn't participate in the illegal taking of the information, they are protected in using the information in any way they see fit, \" an attorney tells the los angeles times. In other reactions: aaron sorkin, whose jobs script surfaces in the hacked material, is swinging at the media, writing in the new york times that those who publish leaked information are \" giving material aid to criminals \" who have threatened violence against sony employees and their families. As for the \" newsworthy \" defense: \" there is nothing in these documents remotely rising to the level of public interest of... The pentagon papers, \" he notes. There are two ways the media could face legal trouble, an expert tells the washington post: one, for publishing private information, such as medical records, of sony workers — though the workers, not the studio, would have to sue. The media could also be held accountable under copyright law for publishing full emails. Finally, the new york times reports that sony's ceo in japan stepped in to tone down a scene in the interview involving the kim jong un's head being blown up. Not in 25 years has a sony ceo interfered with sony pictures ' filmmaking, insiders tell the paper. But while americans might see kim as an object of comedy, japan sees a serious threat. Kazuo hirai called on the studio to \" remove images of flaming hair and chunks of skull \" from the scene, the times reports.",

Action news jax reports on the incident, which took place monday night in a jacksonville restaurant and started with what witnesses say was a teen boy complaining he wasn't satisfied with his order. Allison music, who recorded part of what happened on her phone, says she first saw the boy \" making a complete fool of himself \" while arguing with workers for 15 or 20 minutes. Next, she continues, two women approached the counter, which is where her video ( posted on facebook ) begins. In the clip, one of the women can be heard referring to the boy who'd been involved in the previous argument as \" our brother, \" and the two verbally spar with employees over his nuggets being cold and how he should get a refund. A woman who appears to be a manager finally tells them she did give him his money back. A police report notes that at one point the women were told to leave because the store was closing, but once outside, one allegedly tried to re-enter, slamming on a locked door and causing $ 900 worth of damage ( music says the door handle broke off and the women then entered through an unlocked door ). A second video shows one of the women storming off, leaving behind a floor littered with condiment packs and straws. Once off-screen, she appears to hurl something ( reportedly one of chick-fil-a's table vases ). The restaurant owner says they are cooperating with the police in the probe. A news4jax crime expert laments that \" now, people are more and more unable to talk to management properly to resolve … [ conflicts ]. \" ( here's where chick-fil-a ranks in customer service satisfaction. )",

Officials say that in one of the most destructive fire outbreaks in state history, at least 15 fires have scorched more than 90,000 acres in eight counties. More than 20,000 people have fled their homes. At least 100 have been injured and 1,500 structures destroyed. The latest: gov. Jerry brown declared a state of emergency in butte, lake, mendocino, napa, nevada, orange, sonoma, and yuba counties and asked president trump to declare a major disaster, the new york times reports. \" the heat, the lack of humidity, and the winds are all driving a very dangerous situation and making it worse, \" he said. As firefighters continued to battle the blazes overnight, a spokesman for brown's office of emergency services said favorable weather conditions were helping, though the death toll could still rise. \" firefighters and emergency management workers were taking advantage of the winds dying down... And a lot of work is going to be done overnight and early ( tuesday ) morning, \" brad alexander said, per reuters. The region's famous wineries were hit hard: the signorello estate winery in napa valley and the paradise ridge winery in sonoma county were destroyed and many other suffered damage just when workers were almost finished harvesting this year's grapes, the ap reports. Wineries that escaped damage still had to deal with the loss of power. Cal fire captain amy head says it is unprecedented for so many fires to start around the same time of night, the guardian reports. She believes climate change is responsible. \" it has been hotter, it has been drier, our fire seasons have been longer, fires are burning more intensely, which is a direct correlation to the climate changing, \" she says. Celebrity athletes including barry bonds were at ronnie lott's celebrity fundraiser at mayacama golf club in santa rosa when the rapidly approaching fire led to a scramble to evacuate, the san francisco chronicle reports. \" i was out on the balcony at mayacama when the power went out and sat down, and saw the moon come up.

It wasn't immediately clear how many prisons were affected by the protests — or how many people had responded to a call by the workers ' force union for guards to walk off the job entirely. Unions representing protesting prison guards called for a \" total blockage \" as the justice ministry said a new round of talks was expected. Guards rejected ministry proposals last week. Attacks in about a half-dozen prisons have fueled guards'demands for more staff and better security.",

A week-long french prison strike sparked by a spate of inmate attacks on guards looks set to enter a second week after unions on saturday rejected proposals to end the standoff. A solution to the crisis had looked to be inching closer after two of france's three major prison unions -- cgt and ufap-unsa -- suspended a protest action to put fresh proposals on security and employment to staff after a week of tension. But by saturday evening both those unions said their members had rejected the proposals as they called for a \" total blockage \" of prisons on monday. The strike has seen guards across the country down tools following a string of attacks by inmates and scuffles at jails, including europe's biggest, fleury-merogis just south of paris. A third major union, fo, did not join the talks and called for an even tougher stance"

The president's chief strategist said trump's goal is the \" deconstruction of the administrative state, \" meaning dismantling systems of taxation, regulation, and trade. Bannon said trump picked his cabinet nominees with that deconstruction in mind. Here's what else is making headlines at cpac: chief of staff reince priebus, who spoke alongside bannon, says they aren't rivals, as characterized by the media. Instead he says they work alongside each other and share a connection through trump, politico reports. White nationalist richard spencer was kicked out of cpac after being spotted in the lobby of the hotel where it's taking place. \" his views are repugnant and have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism, \" a cpac spokesperson tells npr. The hill reports bannon also reserved some of his time to bash reporters and the media, who he repeatedly called the \" opposition party. \" he warned that every day will be a fight against the \" corporatist, globalist media. \" meanwhile, sen. Ted cruz predicted — without explanation — that trump will have a second supreme court seat to fill by the summer, time reports. He also called the democratic base \" bat crap crazy. \" speaking of cruz, a lot has changed since last year's cpac, where he was the headliner and trump canceled his speech, according to us news. Kellyanne conway, who was working for cruz this time last year, says cpac is now \" tpac, \" in reference to trump. Despite earlier reports that she clashed with the attorney general and trump on protecting the bathroom rights of transgender students, at cpac betsy devos said she supported the removal of obama's guidelines, calling them \" overreach, \" the huffington post reports.

Cataracts are \" clouding and discoloration of the lens of the eye. \" they cause fuzzy vision, trouble seeing at night, and more. According to reuters, about half of all americans develop cataracts by the time they're 80 years old. A 20-year study published in october in jama ophthalmology looked at more than 74,000 women over the age of 65 who had cataracts and found the ones who got their cataracts removed were 60 % less likely to die during the study period. There were an average of 1.5 deaths per 100 women who got the surgery per year; the average was 2.6 deaths for women who didn't get the surgery. \" not only can cataract surgery give people a better life while they're living it, they can also live more of it, \" one of the study's authors, dr. Anne coleman, tells the times. Women who got cataract surgery during the study lived longer on average despite tending to be sicker overall than women in the non-surgery group. Coleman has a few theories on why that is: improved vision allows women to be more active, avoid accidents and injuries, and correctly take their medication. \" it's important to get the best vision a person can have, \" coleman says. There are limits to the study, most noticeably that it only included women, and its authors say more research is needed, according to a press release.

        "summary": "In 2012, a team of researchers out of the university of washington's institute for learning and brain sciences thought they'd stumbled upon a new pathway in the brain associated with reading that had somehow been glossed over by their predecessors. \" we couldn't find it in any atlas, \" one researchers tells livescience. It turns out the pathway had indeed been identified before, first by well-known neuroscientist carl wernicke in 1881 ( it's called the vertical occipital fasciculus, or vof ), but it was left largely unexplored and unlabeled in brain maps for the next century-plus. So the researchers set out to understand not only the pathway itself, but also why it's been so widely ignored, and they published their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. Thanks to new brain imaging of 37 people, the team learned that the vof spreads out like a sheet from the occipital lobe, which processes visual information, and connects different brain regions that deal with motion perception, attention, and eye movements, as well as the perception of visual categories, like faces or words. This pathway — which, unlike most in the brain, travels up and down instead of side to side ( which might explain why one prominent neuroscientist overlooked it ) — may show how these different types of visual perception are connected. Thanks to two case studies dating back to the 1970s, researchers learned that people with damaged vof could no longer recognize words and thus couldn't read. Even the nerve cell coating that helps move information quickly ( called myelination ) looks different in the vof than elsewhere in the brain.

Sam hemming, a law school graduate of north wales ' bangor university, was being driven home to hereford by her boyfriend, tom curtis, in july when they got into an accident, per the mirror: the car flipped, and while curtis wasn't badly hurt, hemming was left with broken neck bones, a fractured arm, and severe head injuries, leading doctors to place her in a medically induced coma, the sun notes. After 19 days, the doctors said hope was gone, and hemming's family gathered to say their goodbyes. Doctors said they'd switch her life support off and on three times before turning it off for good, just to make sure there was no brain activity — and as they prepared to switch it off for the final time, a medic brushed against her big toe with an icy-cold wipe and her toe wiggled. Doctors gave her a tracheotomy, and a few days later when they turned the life support off again, she could breathe on her own. The second part of hemming's story: doctors didn't think she'd ever walk or talk again, though now she's doing both as she recuperates at her parents ' home. Even though hemming suffers from ptsd and has memory loss, doctors are hopeful they can keep boosting her brain function, per the hereford times. \" when i look at the pictures of me in the coma, it seems unreal, \" hemming says. \" and when i hear that my toe saved me, it's amazing. \" ( a college student in a coma gave his mom a christmas \" miracle. \" )",

Researchers drew this conclusion after comparing more than 54,000 grades of undergraduates in the dutch city of maastricht, where some were banned from the city's 13 cannabis coffee shops, the guardian reports. The upshot: the banned students had a 5 % better chance of passing courses. For weaker students, the improvement in their chances rose to 7.6 %. And the overall effect was a stunning five times higher for courses involving numbers and math. \" the effects we find are large, consistent, and statistically very significant, \" says study co-author olivier marie. \" the grade improvement this represents is about the same as having a qualified teacher. \" marie says it's hardly surprising, since we already know that thc ( the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis ) affects cognitive functioning. But this comes at a key moment, as more than 20 states in the us permit weed for medical use, four states allow recreational use, and uruguay may become the first country to totally legalize cannabis. The finding could also inform the debate over thc levels, which are getting higher. \" i think it is reasonable to at least inform young users much more on consequences of consuming such products, \" says marie. An amusing side note: the study says that students from france and luxembourg had been banned from the cafes for being \" drug tourists \" and \" creating the most nuisance \" for locals, the independent reports.

This is the finding of a unique study that is likely to be fiercely debated by those in favour of and those against the liberalisation of cannabis laws. Economists olivier marie of maastricht university and ulf zölitz of iza bonn examined what happened in maastricht in 2011 when the dutch city allowed only dutch, german and belgian passport-holders access to the 13 coffee shops where cannabis was sold. The temporary restrictions were introduced because of fears that nationals from other countries, chiefly france and luxembourg, were visiting the city simply to smoke drugs, which would tarnish its genteel image. After studying data on more than 54,000 course grades achieved by students from around the world who were enrolled at maastricht university before and after the restrictions were introduced, the economists came to a striking conclusion. In a paper recently presented at the royal economic society conference in manchester they revealed that those who could no longer legally buy cannabis did better in their studies. The restrictions, the economists conclude, constrained consumption for some users, whose cognitive functioning improved as a result. \"the effects we find are large, consistent and statistically very significant, \" marie told the observer. \"for example, we estimate that students who were no longer able to buy cannabis legally were"

            "If you want to do well in your exams, especially maths, don't smoke dope. This is the finding of a unique study that is likely to be fiercely debated by those in favour of and those against the liberalisation of cannabis laws. Economists olivier marie of maastricht university and ulf zölitz of iza bonn examined what happened in maastricht in 2011 when the dutch city allowed only dutch, german and belgian passport-holders access to the 13 coffee shops where cannabis was sold. The temporary restrictions were introduced because of fears that nationals from other countries, chiefly france and luxembourg, were visiting the city simply to smoke drugs, which would tarnish its genteel image. After studying data on more than 54,000 course grades achieved by students from around the world who were enrolled at maastricht university before and after the restrictions were introduced, the economists came to a striking conclusion. In a paper recently presented at the royal economic society conference in manchester they revealed that those who could no longer legally buy cannabis did better in their studies. The restrictions, the economists conclude, constrained consumption for some users, whose cognitive functioning improved as a result. \"the effects we find are large, consistent and statistically very significant, \" marie told the observer. \"for example, we estimate that students who were no longer able to buy cannabis legally were"

        "summary": "A japanese court is holding a man legally responsible for his biological child — despite her being born long after he was in any way involved with her conception. The japan times reports the nara family court on friday dismissed a lawsuit from a 46-year-old foreigner seeking to avoid legal responsibility for his now 2-year-old daughter. The man and his then-wife married in 2004, had a son through in vitro fertilization in 2011, and separated in 2013. But in 2014, the woman used a frozen embryo to impregnate herself. She gave birth to a daughter in 2015. The staff of the clinic handling the woman's in vitro fertilization believed the man had consented because he had never asked them to destroy the frozen embryo, according to the bbc. The court dismissed the man's lawsuit because the girl was born while he and his wife were still technically married — they didn't divorce until 2016. The judge also based her ruling on the fact that the man was spending time with his estranged wife and son post-separation, japan today reports. His lawyer argues he was only doing that to preserve his relationship with his son. The man plans on appealing the ruling and says new laws are needed to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future. In a separate lawsuit, he's seeking $ 178,000 from his ex-wife and the clinic for mental suffering. ( an nypd officer became a father more than two years after his death. )",

Both were jailed until a breakthrough in the case was made through old-fashioned police work instead of new technology, afp reports. The brothers — who shared an apartment, a car, and even a facebook profile — both denied the series of 2012 and 2013 attacks on women ranging in age from 22 to 76, but police were able to build a case against yoan because some of elvin's alibis were solid, and because yoan, who is partially deaf, had a speech impediment that some of the victims were able to identify, reports the local. Elvin spent 10 months in prison after both twins were arrested and was freed last year after yoan confessed to stealing the women's handbags and phones but not to raping them, la provence reports. Yesterday, yoan pleaded guilty to all seven counts of rape, attempted rape, and sexual aggression, apologizing for having lied for so long and saying he \" just couldn't admit it, \" reports the local. In what may be the most bizarre aspect of the strange case, yoan's lawyer says nothing that has happened has caused a rift between the twins.

As wired explains, it helps to be a mathematician. Christopher mckinlay was a 30-something looking for love on okcupid and not having much luck. He also happened to be a math wizard working on his phd dissertation at ucla, and thus he struck upon his great plan: he created 12 fake okcupid accounts, along with a computer program to manage them and harvest every bit of information possible about potential dates. This resulted in a huge mass of information. To narrow the field into two key groups — \" one full of mid-twenties arty types and one full of slightly older professional creative women, \" explains buzzfeed — he employed, of course, an algorithm originally designed to analyze soybean crops. It's uber-complicated and might even be laughable except for the fact that mckinlay — on his 88th first date — finally met christine tien wang, a 28-year-old artist. They are now engaged. \"i think that what i did is just a slightly more algorithmic, large-scale, and machine-learning-based version of what everyone does on the site, \" he says. ( beware, though, cops like creating fake online dating profiles, too. )",

Out of the thousands of personality questions you might get asked, what if there was a way to find out which questions mattered to the women he might be interested in and just answer those?",

He'd sent dozens of cutesy introductory messages to women touted as potential matches by okcupid's algorithms. Most were ignored; he'd gone on a total of six first dates.

Researchers had long believed mammoths and mastodons were nomadic, but their teeth tell a different story. Mammoths ate grasses and sedges near retreating ice sheets; and mastodons chomped on leaves and shrubs near the forest, live science explains. And those feeding grounds seem to be where they stayed year-round. Researcher brooke crowley analyzed the carbon, oxygen, and strontium in the enamel of 20,000-year-old molars for clues about diet, climate, and travels. \" strontium reflects the bedrock geology of a location, \" says crowley. \" if an animal grows its tooth in one place and then moves elsewhere, the strontium in its tooth is going to reflect where it came from, not where it died. \" mammoths and mastodons living in southwestern ohio and northwestern kentucky didn't stray far: for example, research revealed molars from all but one mastodon matched local water samples. Crowley says the findings may benefit endangered asian and african elephants — their fuzzy counterparts are ancient cousins — since it \" allows us to understand how species in the past lived and interacted.

        "summary": "Scientists already knew that water ice lurked below mars'surface. But a new study published in the journal science sheds new light on what space.com calls \" apparent glaciers, \" seen anew thanks to high-res imagery from the hirise camera on nasa's mars reconnaissance orbiter. Using this data, researchers found eight spots on the red planet that had been eroded, with steep slopes of ice sheets, or scarps, reaching from just below the surface ( meaning it won't be hard to get to if humans or robots ever get there ) to more than 325 feet deep. The images, which render the ice in 3d, show discrete layers within the ice, which could offer clues on how climate change has affected mars. The scientists believe the ice was once snow that fell when mars ' axis was tilted more prominently toward the sun; that snow has since evolved into \" massive, fractured, and layered ice. \" the ice sheets are located at latitudes that would be the equivalent of scotland or the tip of south america on earth, per nbc news. \" it's like having one of those ant farms where you can see through the glass on the side to learn about what's usually hidden beneath the ground, \" study co-author shane byrne says of the detailed imagery, per phys.org. Although scientists haven't yet figured out how these ice scarps form, they do know that once they peek out into the atmosphere, they turn from ice into water vapor, a process called sublimation, and \" retreat \" as they get taller and wider. The ice chunks could even prove handy as water sources if and when humans ever touch down to explore the planet, the study notes. \" astronauts could essentially just go there with a bucket and a shovel and get all the water they need, \" byrne says.

Npr reports on saga vanecek's discovery in july, made as she crawled on her hands and knees in the shallow waters of lake vidostern. Accustomed to bumping into rocks and sticks as she played in the lake, saga instead stumbled on an object in the mud with a handle. \" she picked up the object, lifted it high above her head, and shouted as if she was pippi longstocking,'daddy! i found a sword! ' \" her dad, andy vanecek, said in a wednesday facebook post, adding it's the \" first sword of its kind to ever be found in scandinavia. \" the bbc notes the water level in the lake was low due to drought, which made it easier for saga to find the sword. An expert from a local museum, which shows a pic of the \" exceptionally preserved \" sword, says the weapon is about 33 inches long and came in a wood-and-leather sheath. \" why it has come to be [ in the lake ], we don't know, \" the expert tells the local, via npr. \" but perhaps it's a place of sacrifice. \" also found by researchers, who swore saga and her family to secrecy until now so the site wouldn't be overrun by amateur excavators: a brooch from around the same time period as the sword, as well as an 18th-century coin, per mpr. Saga's dad is pretty excited, noting, \" i ' m a huge minnesota vikings fan, and this looks just like a viking sword. \" as for saga, who moved to sweden with her family in 2017, the guardian notes some have dubbed her the country's \" true queen \" for her find. \" all hail! queen saga! lady vanecek of...

Jan duff claims the area was poorly lit and that the speed bump at the exit to minico high school's stadium is the same color as the black asphalt, reports magicvalley.com. The district responds that the lighting near the speed bump is just fine and that its location is \" so obvious the plaintiff knew it existed. \" it adds that it was \" her own negligence in failing to keep lookout and awareness of her surroundings \" that led to her fall in september 2015. Duff and husband curtis duff are suing the minidoka county joint school district for damages, including past and future pain and suffering, permanent impairment, disfigurement, mental anguish, a decrease in the enjoyment and value of life, inconvenience, and past and future medical expenses. Her husband also claims to have suffered the loss of companionship and consortium. It's unclear whether she was on her phone or in some way distracted, or whether anyone else has tripped over the bump, but the district adds that it cannot be held liable under the state's recreational use statute. Meanwhile, a long row of pedestrian speed bumps are being installed in china, reports mother nature network, in an apparent attempt to slow people down as they walk past the longest manmade waterway in the world.

            "Considering all of the unexpected things that one might encounter at a unesco heritage site, the pedestrian speed bumps that now line a major footpath in the ancient chinese canal town of tai ' erzhuang could very well be a first. Purportedly installed by officials to slow the pace of fleet-footed visitors, 50 so-called \"calming devices \" almost completely blanket a 100-meter ( 328 foot ) pedestrian pathway leading to this popular heritage site located along a picturesque stretch of the beijing-hangzhou grand canal — the longest man-made waterway in the world and one of eastern china's top tourism draws — in zaozhuang, shandong province. A bit overconcerned? speed bumps seen in a short range of pedestrian walks at a scenic spot in east china stunned many chinese netizens pic.twitter.com/oeouc0h5hj — people's daily, china ( @pdchina ) april 30, 2017 looking at photos of the site, it appears that the path itself is at an incline, which does lead one to wonder if the black and yellow speed bumps were installed to prevent visitors from slipping in wet weather or loosing their footing and rolling down the hill en masse. Or perhaps the speed bumps were put in place as a sort of makeshift staircase to better help visitors better gain their footing climb up the path, which has been renamed \"washboard road \" by locals due to the washboard-esque appearance of the devices. Yet according to reporting from the daily mail, the purpose of the speed bumps is indeed to slow scrums of camera-wielding tourists moving at a speed that would suggest that there's a hot sale on designer handbags at the end of the path, not a revered cultural site. By forcing hurried visitors to move at a more leisurely pace, officials at tai ' erzhuanghope hope that they will gain a \"greater appreciate of its beauty and heritage. \" noting that the speed bumps are in \"stark contrast to the natural beauty of the site, \" the daily mail goes on to explain that \"there were concerns that increased footfall was becoming too frenetic — and thus compromising the experience. \" whatever the case, there is room on both sides of the path, albeit limited, for tourists to avoid the mini-obstacle course and traverse the path unencumbered.

Headed for galveston, the united kalavyrvta was anchored at least 60 miles off-shore when it vanished from radar screens. The ship's haul fell under legal dispute when iraq filed a lawsuit in us courts, urging american officials to grab the ship's oil in galveston because it belongs to iraq, not the kurdish national government. But kurds say it's theirs, and insist they need oil-export dollars to survive and fund their future independence, the washington post reports. In any case, a us court denied the lawsuit monday because america has no jurisdiction over ships more than 60 miles off the coast. Meanwhile, the united kalavyrvta may have moved beyond us antennas or could be suffering technical problems, the us coast guard says ( or maybe it \" voluntarily switched off its transmitter, \" says the daily news ). It's not unusual for ships to vanish from radar systems when transporting disputed oil, reuters notes: a few days ago, a kamari ship with kurdish oil \" went dark \" near egypt's sinai and turned up near israel two days later, its oil gone.",

If kris weren't so \" hellbent on dragging her name through the mud by prolonging the divorce proceedings, \" she'd probably already be married to kanye west by now, the source adds. Plus, there's one other little matter: if kim and kris are still married by the time she gives birth, which they likely will be, the state of california will presume humphries is the father, tmz reports. But when all is said and done, a happy ending: this little bundle of joy could make kardashian and west more than $ 16 million before he or she even enters the world, a source tells the sun. Think reality specials following kim on doctor visits and other fun pregnancy errands, plus kardashian-endorsed baby products. None of those millions, however, will come from jenny craig or medifast: hilariously, the companies tell tmz they are absolutely not interested in making post-pregnancy weight loss deals with kardashian.

The footage set off a debate about whether the benefits of showing mutual respect to the general outweighed the fact that north koreans could use the film as a propaganda tool to bolster their own credibility. Trump reportedly had been briefed on saluting protocol, which is not to salute military officers from other countries, but rather to shake hands after their salute. White house press secretary sarah sanders defended the salute and said it was \"common courtesy. \" but retired rear adm. John kirby, disagreed and found the moment \" striking, \" reports cnn. \" ( trump ) doesn't even salute his own generals. They salute him. That's the way it works. \" \"you certainly don't do it with leaders of foreign military and you most certainly don't do it with the leaders of foreign militaries of an adversary nation, \" kirby added. Indeed, north korean state television has already released a 42-minute documentary that includes the salute. The inclusion of the salute is significant, north korea scholar jean lee tells the washington post. The salute will be used \"over and over in north korea's propaganda \" and is \"one more moment from a summit that essentially handed legitimacy and invaluable propaganda to kim jong un and north korea on a silver platter, \" lee said. Some who watched the exchange saw it as a reflexive act rather than a sign of respect. As col. Jack jacobs, a medal of honor recipient, told nbc, \"i would have told him,'they're going to salute you, but don't return the salute, just move smartly down the line. ' \"",

Seneca police chief john covington said in a short statement that tiller was being terminated and would stay on the payroll until friday. He refused to give a reason, calling it a personnel matter.

        "summary": "Karl ward is long dead, but some say the once-revered school superintendent in a small alaska fishing town was not the benevolent educator worthy of having the high school gym named in his honor. A cellphone video made by a man before he died by suicide last month has given voice to at least four other men, all of whom say they were sexually abused decades ago by ward, confirming publicly whispers that had long existed quietly. Rick martin, who the washington post reports had an incurable liver disease, graphically explained on the video what he said ward had done to him; the chilkat valley news reports he says he was raped. The paper's kyle clayton used yearbooks and phone calls to get four other men to go on record with their own decades-old claims. Haines police chief heath scott said he has no reason to doubt the allegations, but there's nothing to investigate, nor reason to suspect any sort of cover-up. Ward worked in the school district for more than 20 years, including as superintendent in the 1960s and ' 70s, according to the valley news; he died in 1997. The school board issued a public apology, saying the district must learn from this \" heartbreaking \" situation. The plaque outside the gym bearing ward's name has been removed, though a decision remained on whether to rename the facility, reports the ap. His widow is in an assisted living facility, and the facility's nurse administrator said the woman asked her to tell people that she is \" in shock and she's in mourning for the life she thought she had. \" haines, a fishing and tourist community of about 1,740, is located about 80 air miles northwest of juneau.",

Romney captured just 27 % of the latino vote, a proportion that will have to improve if the gop wants to remain a viable national party in 2016 and beyond, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. A major gop figure like jeb bush or marco rubio will have to put his foot down and speak \" the truth to his party about the effect their stances on immigration are having on their long-term political prospects, \" he predicts. But the loss wasn't down to just the hispanic vote, writes jonathan martin at politico. For the second presidential election in a row, \" the republican got thumped among women and young voters in the states that decided the election, \" and the gop won't recapture the white house \" until they find a way to appeal to a rapidly changing america, \" he writes. The big debate in the party now will be about whether to maintain the anti-government stance that won in the house in 2010, writes carl hulse at the new york times, predicting a clash between the party's old guard and conservative newcomers who \" seem to have the upper hand for now, even in defeat. \" the big test will come this month, when house republicans will come under pressure to forge a deal on the looming fiscal cliff, he writes.",

So she took hormone tablets designed to right her estrogen and progesterone levels, ease her osteoporosis, and enable her womb to grow. It all worked, but only gave her the option of in vitro fertilization. Using sam's sperm and an anonymous egg donor, the couple spent nearly $ 16,000 on an ivf treatment that harvested 13 eggs, only two of which were viable. Amazingly, both took. After a healthy pregnancy, she gave birth naturally two weeks early, on christmas eve, to non-identical twins avery and darcey. \" it's not just our wallets that are empty, \" hayley says. \" we are emotionally exhausted.

They tell reuters that height can tell us a lot about various aspects of human health — including diseases like \" obesity, diabetes, asthma that are also caused by the combined influence of many genes acting together, \" says one geneticist — with taller height often being linked to better health, and shorter stature in children to worse health. The study involved more than 250,000 participants, all of european ancestry, and focused on 2 million common genetic variants ( meaning they appeared in at least 5 % of their subjects ). From those, they identified 697 gene variants in 424 regions related to height — which is the largest number ever associated with a trait or disease, according to the group's press release. In spite of the scope of their findings, the researchers say they're just getting started. \" we can now explain about 20 % of the heritability of height, up from about 12 % where we were before, \" says a study co-author. That might not seem like a lot, but it's a giant step forward. \" in 2007... We knew absolutely nothing about the genes and regions of the human genome, \" adds one geneticist.

Police say the suitcase brought ashore by sailors held the body of an asian woman who had probably died of starvation — and who may have been alive, though already severely malnourished, when she was put in the case, the bbc reports. Investigators say they've determined that the body is not that of li yinglei, the woman who disappeared during a mediterranean cruise last month, the irish independent reports. Her husband, german citizen daniel belling, was arrested after trying to board a flight out of italy with their two children and is still being held in a rome prison. Investigators say the woman in the suitcase is 6 or 7 inches taller than li. The case had only been in the water for around 10 days, while li vanished more than six weeks ago. Belling, who failed to raise the alarm after his wife disappeared, has told investigators she disappeared from earlier family vacations and he thought she might be hiding out somewhere on the ship. The daily beast reports that there are suspicions the woman in the suitcase might have been one of the thousands of undocumented chinese immigrants working in illegal factories in italy, where former workers say conditions are harsh and the bodies of workers who die tend to disappear.",

Orrin hatch is the longest-serving republican senator in us history — and president trump apparently wants the 83-year-old senate finance committee chairman to seek another term in 2018. Sources tell politico that trump, who will appear with hatch at an event in salt lake city on monday, is pushing for hatch to rethink retirement plans because he doesn't want mitt romney to run for the seat. The sources say trump not only wants to keep romney — a prominent \" never trumper \" before last year's election — out of the senate, he wants to keep hatch around because he values the loyalty the senator has shown since the early days of his campaign. \" hatch is a known entity for trump and has been really good for the president for the most part, \" says kirk jowers, former chairman of romney's political action committee. \" he knows for a fact he's not going to get that with romney. I don't know that he knows what he's going to get with romney, but it's not going to be what he's got with hatch. \" politico's sources say trump has tried to persuade hatch to stay on in phone calls and white house meetings. They will travel together from washington to utah on monday for trump's first trip to the state as president, reports the salt lake tribune. During the visit, trump is expected to sign an executive order shrinking the bears ears and grand staircase escalante national monuments, a move hatch says he is \" incredibly grateful \" for.",

            "Donald trump is going all out to persuade seven-term utah sen. Orrin hatch to seek reelection — a push aimed in no small part at keeping the president's longtime nemesis, mitt romney, out of the senate. Romney has been preparing to run for hatch's seat on the long-held assumption that the 83-year-old would retire. Yet hatch, the longest-serving republican senator in history, is now refusing to rule out another campaign — a circumstance romney's infuriated inner circle blames squarely on the president. Their suspicions are warranted: trump has sounded off to friends about how he doesn't like the idea of a sen. Romney. Story continued below the president's mostly behind-the-scenes campaign to sway hatch will burst into public view on monday, when he arrives in salt lake city to hold a well-choreographed event designed to showcase his affection for the powerful senate finance committee chairman. Trump's appearance is ostensibly official in purpose: he will announce his decision to reduce the size of utah's bears ears and grand-staircase escalante national monuments, a cause that hatch has championed.

Trump, visiting utah to announce he ' ll shrink bears ears and grand staircase-escalante national monuments, will be brief — he's spending less than three hours on the ground — but will consume the state's focus for the day. Monday marks trump's first visit to the state as president, though no public events are scheduled for residents to see him. Trump arrives just before 11 a.m. Monday at the utah air national guard base attached to salt lake city international airport. From there, he heads to welfare square to meet with officials from the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and where he's expected to take a quick tour of the faith's humanitarian efforts for the needy. After that, trump will appear at the capitol to sign an executive order reportedly removing some 2 million acres from the national monuments created by his democratic predecessors in southern utah.
