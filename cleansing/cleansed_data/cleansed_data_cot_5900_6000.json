The philae robot will have to navigate a \" very, very rough \" surface, and officials won't know whether things have worked out until after what nasa has dubbed \" seven hours of terror. \" parent spacecraft rosetta is due to release philae at 3: 35am est tomorrow, and they ' ll know whether all went well by 11: 02am. Prior to that little stretch of suspense comes four hours of sending directions to the probe. \" we have four hours to put them together, check to verify they are consistent, uplink to the spacecraft... And double-check they are ok, \" says a mission head. The team announced a landing spot in september; getting there will require a harpoon due to low gravity. A successful landing would mark the first time a probe has landed on a comet, a process that's taken years of preparation. Officials began work on rosetta in the 1990s, and the mission was launched in 2004. And that probe, by the way, has \" less computer processing power than your iphone, \" venturebeat reports. Experts aim to find out whether comets, which have been around for 4.6 billion years, might have delivered water to earth, helping life to emerge, the wall street journal reports. \" sometimes, we wake up and wonder if this dream is going to be true, \" says an official. \" but we are ready for every option and are still very confident we can make it. \" ( join in the terror via webcast here. )",

        "summary": "Yahoo is punishing ceo marissa mayer and parting ways with its top lawyer for the mishandling of two security breaches that exposed the personal information of more than 1 billion users and already have cost the company $ 350 million, the ap reports. Mayer won't be paid her annual bonus nor receive a potentially lucrative stock award because a yahoo investigation concluded her management team reacted too slowly to one breach discovered in 2014. Yahoo's general counsel, ronald bell, resigned without severance pay for his department's lackadaisical response to the security lapses. Although yahoo's security team uncovered evidence that a hacker backed by an unnamed foreign government had pried into user accounts in 2014, executives \" failed to act sufficiently \" on that knowledge, according to the results of an internal investigation disclosed wednesday. At that time, yahoo only notified 26 people that their accounts had been breached. The report didn't identify the negligent executives, but it chastised the company's legal department for not looking more deeply into the 2014 breach. Because of that, the incident \" was not properly investigated and analyzed at the time, \" the report concluded. Yahoo didn't disclose the 2014 breach until last september. In a blog post on yahoo's tumblr service, mayer said she didn't learn about the scope of the breaches until september and then tried to set things right. \" however, i am the ceo of the company and since this incident happened during my tenure, i have agreed to forgo my annual bonus and my annual equity grant, \" mayer wrote. In its report, yahoo's board said it decided to withhold a cash bonus that otherwise would have been paid to her. Mayer is eligible to receive a bonus of up to $ 2 million annually. The board said it accepted mayer's offer to relinquish her annual stock award, which is typically worth millions of dollars.",

Given the interest around our journey to this point, i wanted to share more about today's announcement. – marissa dear yahoos, moments ago, we announced an agreement with verizon to acquire yahoo's operating business. This culminates a rigorous, thorough process over many months, and yields a great outcome for the company. Today's announcement not only brings us an important step toward separating yahoo's operating business from our asian asset equity stakes, it also presents exciting opportunities to accelerate yahoo's transformation. Among the many entities that showed interest in yahoo, verizon believed most in the immense value we've created, and in what a combination could bring our users, our advertisers, and our partners. This is a good moment to reflect on yahoo's journey to date. Yahoo is a company that changed the world. Before yahoo, the internet was a government research project. Yahoo humanized and popularized the web, email, search, real-time media, and more. What really sets yahoo apart is the shared passion to create great products for our 1b+ users, and in doing so, transforming the world for the better. You can clearly see that spirit,"

The paper tracks three separate efforts in three corners of the world to salvage the meeting: in new york, singapore, and the dmz. Yonhap's sources tell it that kim yong chol departed beijing on wednesday aboard an air china flight en route to new york, where he is set to meet with secretary of state mike pompeo; the two have met twice prior, during pompeo's past visits to north korea. How reuters frames the purpose of their meeting, per a us official: to evaluate \" whether north korea is prepared to make sufficient commitments toward getting rid of its nuclear weapons. \" if that path to denuclearization reveals itself, shoring up security for the summit becomes paramount, and deputy white house chief of staff joe hagin and counterpart kim chang son have been in singapore since monday to establish meeting locations and related details. On sunday in the dmz village of panmunjom, us ambassador to the philippines sung kim and choe son hui ( who made the now-infamous comments about mike pence ) met, with the times speculating they were ironing out an agenda. Meanwhile, nbc news casts doubt on the depths of north korea's intentions on the denuclearization front, citing sources with knowledge of a cia analysis who say the best the us may be able to hope for is that the north undoes some of its recent progress on nukes. A quirky concession it may be willing to make: bringing a western hamburger franchise to pyongyang.",

The post and courier calls it \" a rare measure in police shootings \" that could offer another route to a conviction for michael slager. Slager was charged with murder by the state of south carolina but has been free on bail since january; he will be allowed to remain out of jail for now, while the federal charges are pending, the ap reports. \" this is history, \" says an attorney for the family of scott, who was shown on video to be running away from slager when he was shot five times from behind in april 2015. \" it could be a turning point in history that the federal government is no longer going to sit on the sidelines. They're going to make police officers face federal justice. \" slager was indicted on charges of depriving scott's civil rights when he used unreasonable force while acting as a public official; he had originally pulled scott over for a broken tail light when scott allegedly got out of the car and fled. He was also indicted on charges of misleading investigators ( he told them scott was approaching him with a taser ) and using a firearm in a violent crime. Slager, 34, can be put on trial in both state and federal courts over the same incident because the jurisdictions are considered sovereign, the post and courier explains. Because scott died, slager could be facing life in prison on the civil rights charge. The obstruction of justice charge has a 20-year maximum sentence and the firearms charge has a 10-year maximum sentence. On the state charge of murder, which carries up to a maximum of life in prison, slager will go on trial oct. 31.",

When law enforcement arrived on the scene, they found two dead; investigations uncovered five more deceased and one injured person at three other tyrone residences. The injured person was taken to a hospital, police tell ktvi. They also say an elderly female was found dead in a fifth residence, though sgt. Jeff kinder of the missouri state highway patrol said in a press conference this morning that she \" appears \" to have died from natural causes and is not considered a victim.

The findings from the nonpartisan congressional budget office revived a fierce debate about the impact president obama's signature health-care program will have on the u.s. Economy.

The \" christmas creep \" appears to have begun earlier than usual this year, if mariah carey's \" all i want for christmas is you \" is an accurate metric. The washington post tracked google search interest in the 1994 hit, finding it's currently \" trending well ahead of prior years. \" as for those prior years, a look at search behavior since 2006 shows the upward trend begins in mid-september ( yes, really ), sees a significant jump around halloween, and gets another big boost in mid-november. Quartz found something similar in analyzing the song's annual reappearance on the billboard hot 100 chart, which ranks the week's most popular songs. Since billboard allowed older songs to reenter the charts in 2012, the popular tune has premiered slightly earlier with each holiday season. This year, it premiered more than a week earlier than in 2017, hitting no. 29 during the week of nov. 16-22. Last year, the song hit the charts in the week of dec. 1-7, a full week earlier than it did in 2012. \" before we know it, ' all i want for christmas is you ' will be the song of summer, \" quartz quips, though you aren't likely to hear carey complaining. She's already nabbed $ 60 million in royalties from \" all i want for christmas is you \" — also the title of her latest holiday-themed tour across europe, per bustle — and turned her 7-year-old twins into apparent fans.

As a result, there are more berries for the bears, which like to gorge on them before hibernation. ( researchers figured this out the hard way — by examining bear scat. ) on the face of it, this seems like pretty good news for the bears, and most of the coverage, like this story in reuters, emphasizes how wolves are unintentionally helping the park's grizzlies.

It's the culmination of a bizarre story that began when her husband, mike williams, went missing on lake seminole on dec. 16, 2000. The initial line of thought was that he'd drowned and been eaten by alligators. In truth, the man denise was having an affair with — mike's best friend, brian winchester — tried to drown mike, shot him in the face, and buried him in a mudhole. Denise and winchester had been having a three-year affair and ultimately married. Things later fell apart between them, and winchester was convicted of kidnapping denise in 2016. He was granted immunity from prosecution in this case in exchange for testifying against her. The tallahassee democrat reports her attorney argued the physical evidence against her was paltry: some concert tickets related to the affair, life insurance documents, and photos from the monthslong search for mike. The prosecution, however, emphasized a recorded phone call between denise and winchester's ex-wife, who twice said winchester told her the truth and she knew denise was involved. Denise didn't directly answer but instead tried to shift the conversation. \" it's not what she said, it's what she doesn't say, \" said assistant state attorney jon fuchs. Denise is to be sentenced next year, reports the ap. She plans to appeal.",

The shocking bush-era tactics are being criticized by activists throughout the state. The marin alliance for medical marijuana, three stores in san francisco and a dozen in san diego were targeted this week by u.s. Attorneys, the dea and local authorities as well. Letters were sent to the dispensaries and owners of buildings that house the medi-pot shops stating they must vacate because of zoning issues, such as distances from schools and parks. Some of these shops were simply selling things like dry herb vaporizers( ex. Firefly 2 ). \"with the federal budget on empty, the economy in disarray, our prisons overflowing and prohibition-related violence raging across the border, it's an outrageous misuse of federal resources to wage war on marijuana dispensaries, \" says california norml coordinator dale gieringer. \"federal anti-drug bureaucrats are afraid because the dispensaries are proving that it's possible for marijuana to become a safe, legal, tax-paying industry and so expose their own last-century policies as bankrupt and obsolete. \" republican presidential candidate gary johnson issued the following statement: \"doj and the administration have better things to do than mount an assault on medical marijuana dispensaries in california that are legal under state law.

The remnants date back about 4.3 billion years and were found embedded in younger granite near hudson bay, reports live science. While the granite itself is only 2.7 billion years old, the researchers analyzed it for chemical signals of a \" parent rock \" that had previously melted and been recycled into another form. Popular mechanics reports that the team used a new and rarely used scientific technique that tracks the decay of a specific isotope, and were thrilled by what they found. \" i think that it's a piece of the original crust, \" says lead researcher jonathan o ' neil of the university of ottawa. \" it was cooked, but i think it's still very close to what it used to be. \" the larger granite formation is part of earth's second crust, but the geologists believe the parent rock is basalt, or oceanic crust. According to o ' neil, modern oceanic crust usually stays above the surface for 200 million years. It is then forced back into the mantle, where it melts partially. The parent rock the team found in hudson bay's granite, on the other hand, remained at the surface for more than a billion years before being recycled. Atlas obscura calls it \" the most direct evidence ever found of how the crust on this planet was composed when it first formed. \" ( scientists say they've found an eighth continent. )",

Musk rejected suggestions that the mars colony would be a bolthole for the rich, saying it would be as difficult and dangerous as early expeditions to antarctica. But he added that there will be plenty of opportunities for entrepreneurs after a rudimentary base was set up, the bbc reports. \" mars will need pizza joints, great bars — mars bars, \" he quipped.

        "summary": "Future lunar colonists shouldn't have too much trouble finding water: in a first, astronomers have discovered ice — specifically patches of frost — on the moon's north and south poles, in areas permanently shaded from the sun. Found by observing how molecules absorb infrared light, the ice is particularly concentrated in surface craters or \" cold traps \" around the south pole, where temperatures are a chilly -250 degrees fahrenheit, live science reports via a pnas study. It notes this is the first \" direct and definitive evidence \" of ice exposed on the moon's surface. Though water molecules were previously found, the ice deposits \" might be utilized as an in-situ resource in future exploration of the moon, \" the study authors write, per the guardian. The ice could theoretically be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen needed for rocket fuel and to allow colonists to breathe, reports the bbc. Yet the ice isn't widespread, even at the poles. Just 3.5 % of the shadowy areas scientists observed were found to contain ice, and none of the more recently formed craters had any. It's possible craters were exposed to sunlight as the moon's axis shifted more frequently over time than the axes of mercury and the dwarf planet ceres, where surface ice is more abundant, reports space.com. It's also possible that impacts from meteorites disrupted the moon's ice supplies. Either way, the suggestion is that any lunar ice present is \" very old, and is likely not replenished quickly, \" per live science. ( humans might live in a lunar lava tube. )",

Palo alto is an incredibly wealthy town — the median family income of $ 167,000 was more than three times the national median in 2014, and the average cost of a three-bedroom home is currently around $ 2.18 million. \"prices have just gone through the roof, making it unaffordable for middle-class people, your firefighters, your teachers, and, frankly, some of your doctors, \" vice mayor greg scharff tells cbs san francisco. That's why scharff proposed subsidizing housing for families that make between $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 per year, according to reuters. The palo alto city council voted this week to study scharff's plan, which he says will subsidize \" what is basically middle-class housing \" in palo alto. The proposal would create 2,000 new housing units set aside for families making between $ 150,000 and $ 250,000. It would also call for the construction of tiny \" micro \" apartments near transit for residents without cars.",

        "summary": "Things appear to be heating up in the probe of a land deal made by bernie sanders ' wife, jane, a new washington post article suggests. A state official has been called to testify before a grand jury in the federal investigation into the deal, which jane sanders made when she was president of vermont's burlington college in 2010. Sanders intended to boost enrollment at the college by purchasing the land and relocating the school, but the deal ultimately pushed the college into deep financial trouble, resulting in its shuttering last year. A bank fraud investigation was opened after allegations that sanders may have fudged college donor levels on the loan application ( allegations that led to her resignation from the college in 2011 ) and that her husband may have used his political office to get the application approved. The post spoke to half a dozen people who said they had been contacted by the fbi or federal prosecutors recently about the probe, plus former college trustees who say sanders ' lawyers have contacted them. And sources say prosecutors took more than a dozen boxes of records from burlington college recently. The investigation appears to be centered on jane, not bernie, sanders, per the post's sources. A spokesperson for the couple has denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the ap has a look at the republican lawyer pushing the investigation — brady toensing's letter to vermont's us attorney and federal bank regulators got the investigation launched last year — and finds that he has a history of filing complaints and public records requests against left-leaning politicians in vermont. The sanders ' attorney says he's leading a \" crusade \" against vermont democrats.",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — the obama administration is running out of time and options to close the guantanamo bay detention center in cuba, so officials are scrambling to release as many prisoners as possible and considering novel legal strategies that include allowing some men to strike plea deals by video-teleconference. Another option would be to send others to foreign countries to be prosecuted.

An 80-year-old man in scotland says he found a long-lost sherlock holmes story that appeared in a 1904 short-story collection, the new york daily news reports. Walter elliot says the 1,300-word tale, titled \" sherlock holmes: discovering the border burgs and, by deduction, the brig bazaar, \" was contained in a 48-page booklet given to him by a friend more than 50 years ago. The booklet was produced and sold as part of a fundraising effort to replace a wooden bridge that had washed out in selkirk in 1902, the daily record notes. \" he really must have thought enough of the town to come down and take part and contribute a story to the book, \" elliot tells the daily news. Without giving too much away, the story is about a journalist who tracks down the renowned detective and finds him talking with ( who else ) dr. John watson about a trip to edinburgh and a mystery about a \" secret cabinet. \" when watson declines an invitation to go with holmes, the sleuth uses his powers of deduction to figure out where watson is headed instead. \" i have no idea if it has ever been published — i've never seen it, \" elliot tells the record. \" i've always been interested in history, and my family has always passed on stories, and i suppose this was one of the stories that was passed down. \" the book will reportedly be on display at a local pop-up museum — and you can read the story in full at the daily record.",

        "summary": "Some good news to share this week: deaths from breast cancer have plummeted over a 26-year period. A report released tuesday by the american cancer society shows a 39 % decline in breast cancer-related deaths between 1989 and 2015, reports the washington post. The report notes 322,600 deaths were prevented in that period thanks to better treatment — doctors describe improvements in chemotherapy, as well as the introduction of new drugs like tamoxifen and herceptin — and early detection through mammograms. But this doesn't mean we're in the clear. Far from it: one in eight american women is still expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime. In 2017, 252,710 are expected to receive that diagnosis; of those, 40,610 will die, the report suggests. Black women — who had a 39 % higher risk of death from breast cancer than white women in 2015 — are especially at risk. Black women have a lower rate of the type of breast cancer that is treated with tamoxifen and \" a higher rate of triple-negative cancer, \" lead author carol desantis says, per a release. But a medical oncologist tells the post that there are also social and economic factors in play that explain why black women in louisiana, for instance, had a 66 % higher rate of death from breast cancer compared to white women. In this way, the disparity \" is not acceptable, \" he says. Desantis notes in the release that \" increasing access to health care to low-income populations can further progress the elimination of breast cancer disparities. \"",

Needless to say, the story has since gone viral — and now burger king is paying for the whole affair. Burger and king are used to getting comments on their combination of names, and they ran with it when announcing their engagement: instead of the woman's name appearing first, as is traditional, they let burger have the honors. They also posed with a burger king sign for their engagement photo. They told the state journal-register they'd love to include the bk logo on the coozies they're planning as wedding favors, but that king had had no luck getting hold of anyone at corporate headquarters. The newspaper also reached out, the story went viral, and voila: yesterday, burger and king spoke to burger king via skype, and the chain made the offer. \" when we heard about the happy burger-king couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage, \" a spokesperson explains. \" we wanted to create a ' whopper of a wedding'that's uniquely their own. \" burger king will pay for the expenses and provide wedding favors for the july 17 nuptials in jacksonville. \" we were shaking \" when bk made the offer, king says.

Following through with recommendations from a grand jury in monroe county, prosecutors say they will file third-degree murder charges. Police allege chun \" michael \" deng, 19, was blindfolded, weighed down with a bag of sand, and told to walk toward a voice as other frat members tried to tackle him during an outdoor ritual known as \" glass ceiling. \" at one point, deng complained that his head hurt after he'd been lifted and dropped on the ground, but he continued until he was knocked unconscious, reports the new york times. He died later at a hospital. Thirty-two others face charges including aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, and hazing, reports cbs new york. Before deng was driven 30 minutes to a hospital, frat members moved him inside, changed his clothes, and researched his symptoms online, police say. They also called their national fraternity president, who reportedly told them to hide all evidence they were in a frat. \" a minimum of at least two hours went by before he actually received any type of medical care, \" a police chief said after the incident, per cnn. A forensic pathologist found deng died from multiple traumatic injuries, including a brain injury, and delayed medical care which led to neurogenic shock. Deng's parents say they \" applaud \" the charges, calling deng's death \" entirely preventable. \" they add they ' ll continue pursuing a wrongful-death suit in the hope of ending pledging altogether. \" if there was no pledging process, michael would not be dead, \" their lawyer says.",

He was gone by the time police arrived, but officers learned that an infant placed in his care ( the relationship isn't spelled out ) hadn't been seen for hours. Police finally tracked down crowley thanks to another caller's tip, and though officers say he appeared to be on drugs and was nearly incoherent, he managed to convey that the baby was \" somewhere in the mountains, \" per the washington post. The search then ensued. The baby is in good condition, but it's \" especially hard knowing what this small baby endured, \" says the sheriff's post.",

He said that it initially was difficult to contact these women, but that eventually several of them responded to detectives and are now cooperating with the investigation. In all the reported sightings, the suspect, a heavyset white man estimated to be in his late 40s or early 50s, approached women while driving a silver or black sedan with his genitals exposed. He then displayed a piece of sliced swiss cheese and offered to pay the women to put the cheese on his penis and perform sexual acts on him using it. Since the daily news first wrote about the pervert on saturday, at least four people have provided a reporter with evidence linking him to posts made on dating sites including match.com and okcupid that discuss - in great detail - a similar sexual cheese fetish."

The potential suspect was identified after detectives from the svu reached out to women from the mayfair area who had previously told police they were approached by the \" swiss cheese pervert, \" mcfadden said. He said that it initially was difficult to contact these women, but that eventually several of them responded to detectives and are now cooperating with the investigation. In all the reported sightings, the suspect, a heavyset white man estimated to be in his late 40s or early 50s, approached women while driving a silver or black sedan with his genitals exposed. He then displayed a piece of sliced swiss cheese and offered to pay the women to put the cheese on his penis and perform sexual acts on him using it. Since the daily news first wrote about the pervert on saturday, at least four people have provided a reporter with evidence linking him to posts made on dating sites including match.com and okcupid that discuss - in great detail - a similar sexual cheese fetish."

In one, he said somebody looked like a \" gay bill board for aids. \" as the outcry began, hart said in an instagram post that he was \" nearly 40 years old, \" and if \" you don't believe that people change, grow, evolve as they get older, then i don't know what to tell you. \" this was seen by many as a \" defiant non-apology, \" variety notes. In a second post hours later, hart said the academy had given him an ultimatum to apologize for the tweets or be replaced — and he had chosen to pass. \" the reason why i've passed is that i've addressed it several times, \" said hart, who thanked the academy for the opportunity. \" if it goes away, no harm no foul, \" he said.

The 83-year-old died around 11pm monday at a hospital in panama city after undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor in march, reports the bbc. He is believed to have been placed in an induced coma after a brain hemorrhage, reports cnn. In a tweet tuesday, panamanian president juan carlos varela said noriega's death \" closes a chapter in our history. \" after the death of his mentor, gen. Omar torrijos herrera, noriega became general of the national guard in 1983 and ruled as the de facto leader of panama until his capture by us authorities in 1990, reports the new york times. During the 1980s, he was a us ally who shared intelligence on cuba, terrorism, and drug activity. But he was also accused of oppressing political opponents, rigging elections, working with drug traffickers, and assisting cuban secret agents, reports the times. He was eventually charged with drug trafficking and money laundering in the us and captured during the us invasion of panama. He was convicted and served 18 years before he was extradited to france and convicted of money laundering in 2010. A year later, he was returned to panama to serve a 20-year sentence for embezzlement, corruption, and the murder of his opponents, per the guardian.

( associated press ) tultepec, mexico ( ap ) — the latest on an explosion at mexico's best-known fireworks market on the northern outskirts of the capital. ( all times local ): 16: 40 p.m. The chief prosecutor of mexico state says 26 people have been killed in an explosion that tore through a fireworks market near mexico city. Alejandro gomez is raising the toll from tuesday's blast from the previous nine dead, in comments broadcast on local television. The explosion and fire raged through the open-air san pablito market in tultepec, in the state of mexico, in the afternoon as it was crowded with shoppers buying fireworks for the holidays. The blast leveled stalls and left rescue workers to comb through ash and charred metal. Similar fires and explosions destroyed hundreds of stands in two other incidents at the same market in 2005 and 2006.",

        "summary": "Had william shakespeare had a chance to peruse a new study, he might have praised nitrate for the dizzying view from atop the white cliffs of dover. That's because the tiny algae, known as coccolithophores, which helped form the famous cliffs some 100 million years ago benefited from a specific recipe of nutrients — specifically high concentrations of nitrate, per a release. While examining coccolithophores and competitors known as diatoms in the \"great calcite belt \" around antarctica, researchers found that lots of iron and silicate in water benefit diatoms, which keep coccolithophores from ballooning to numbers that make the cliffs of dover possible. But when nitrate levels are high and iron levels low, coccolithophores thrive. Only under such conditions could tiny coccolithophores, each about ten-thousandth of an inch wide, be forced together to reach heights of 350 feet, researchers explain in global biogeochemical cycles, per the washington post. But perhaps the coolest thing researchers discovered is that such conditions are occurring today in the southern ocean near antarctica, reports live science. \" while we don't have the great cliffs of the southern ocean, there is solid evidence that the calcite is making it to the seafloor, \" the lead author says. That means in millions of years, white chalk cliffs like those in dover could be found elsewhere. That's good news, notes gizmodo, since dover's cliffs will have been washed away by then.

A blockage caused toilets in 410 of the crown princess'staterooms — about a quarter of its cabins — to stop flushing, forcing passengers in those rooms to use the public bathrooms. A rep for carnival-owned and -operated princess cruises told cruise critic that thursday's outage lasted from 5am to 6: 30pm, though \" a small number of passengers continued to experience problems over the next few days. \" needless to say, this led to the now-familiar scene of long restroom lines, terrible smells, and flooded rooms, one passenger says; \" i will never, ever, ever, ever cruise with princess again, ever, \" another tells click2houston. The cruise ended in galveston on saturday. To recap, since the beginning of the year carnival has experienced really gross problems on the triumph and the dream, plus technical problems on two other ships. The navy and the coast guard have spent millions assisting carnival in recent years, leading one senator to ask last month if the cruise line intended to reimburse anyone. Carnival's response, issued friday: it avoided the topic of repayment entirely, reports the ap, and asserted that its policy is to \" honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community. \"",

A study published in the journal evolution finds that bigger actually is better when it comes to the pelvic bone, with a correlation between whales with larger testes and the size of their pelvic bones to help control the larger member, the washington post reports. The bone is attached to the male whale's penis muscles and likely helps the animal exert a \" crazy amount of control \" over its reproductive organ, scientists say. It wasn't easy to cull this info: \" whale sex is a particularly enigmatic thing and remains basically unobserved, \" the post notes. But scientists collected pelvic specimens from 130 cetaceans ( an order that also includes dolphins and porpoises ) and scanned their finds with lasers, smithsonian reports. Creatures with larger testes — which have been shown to mate more, a study in ecology letters reports — seemed to have larger pelvic bones. Researchers also believe that whales with the most \" unique \" pelvis shapes are able \" to move their reproductive organs in novel ways. \" \" it's like someone operating a trick kite, where you pull two strings, and pulling left and right makes it go in a loop-de-loop, \" one scientist explains. \" that's basically how a whale's penis is working. \" ( read about richard nixon's predilection for talking about panda sex. )",

For a long time scientists figured that the bones are so small because they are vestigial, a shrunken evolutionary remnant from an ancestor that once walked on land. But now scientists have discovered that the tiny bones may actually play a huge role in whale reproduction. Whales belong to a group of sea-dwelling mammals called cetaceans, which also includes dolphins.

            "The rapid divergence of male genitalia, probably the result of sexual selection affecting male – male competition and/or male – female interactions ( eberhard 1985; dixson 1998; hosken and stockley 2004; miller 2010 ), has emerged as a preeminent pattern in evolutionary biology. Male genitals may have evolved to remove sperm or otherwise reduce the fertility of competing males, to induce the female to accept insemination, to harm the female and inhibit her from remating, and/or to sneak matings ( reviewed in eberhard 1996; simmons 2001; arnqvist and rowe 2005 ). Thus, male genitals are not solely involved in transfer of gametes, but participate in various arenas of competition and conflict, the intensity of which is expected to intensify in relatively promiscuous species. Accordingly, male genitalia diverge more rapidly in more promiscuous species ( arnqvist 1998; hosken and stockley 2004; ramm 2007 ), and some genital",

He praises the bravery of police officers who put their lives on the line, but also stresses that \" good law enforcement requires forging bonds of trust between the police and the public. \" trust \" requires that force be used in appropriate ways, \" he writes. \" enforcement priorities and arrest patterns must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended.

        "summary": "\" there is a tiger walking down the exit ramp onto the interstate, \" 911 operators in georgia heard wednesday, prompting a feverish response from police and plenty of speculation on how the animal got there. That mystery is now solved. A microchip implanted in the female bengal tiger, shot and killed as it attacked a dog in henry county early wednesday, revealed the animal belonged to feld entertainment, a live production company that formerly operated the ringling bros. Circus, reports wxia. The 6-year-old tiger named suzy had escaped unnoticed from a truck carrying the animal from florida to tennessee when the vehicle stopped in georgia overnight. Residents, however, were quick to notice suzy wandering a residential area around 6am. Brittney speck, who spotted the tiger on a neighbor's property, was one of several people to call 911. Moments later, she says the tiger jumped a fence into her backyard and attacked her dog. That's when police arrived and \" started firing rounds, \" speck tells cnn. While her dachshund was remarkably unhurt, the tiger was killed \" quickly and humanely \" as was \" necessary for public safety, \" says a rep for georgia's department of natural resources. The department — which notes feld entertainment only realized the tiger was missing when its truck arrived in memphis, where suzy was to board a flight to germany — tells wsb that charges are pending. According to a feld rep, \" this tiger was raised by its owner since it was a cub. Clearly, this was a tragic accident. \"",

Belinda lane spent 10 years using social media to track down people involved in the feb. 24, 2006, murder of her daughter, and the arrest of sotelo in mexico last week brought her hunt to an end, reports the riverside press-enterprise. Sotelo, 28, who has now been extradited to the us, is suspected of driving the car from which shots were fired that killed crystal theobald, a 24-year-old mother of two. Gang members in riverside, calif., are believed to have mistaken her vehicle for one belonging to a member of a rival gang. Lane tells abc7 that she made a promise at her daughter's funeral. \" i told her, baby girl, i promise you if it takes my last breath, i will get them. I promise you, you will have justice. \" she says she set up fake myspace profiles in her search for suspects and used one of them to communicate with sotelo. She says she continued to contact him after he fled to mexico, and a tip received on facebook eventually led to his arrest. He faces charges including first-degree murder. The gunman was sentenced to life without parole in 2011 and at least six other gang members are also serving time for their involvement in the case. Lane says it is a huge relief for the search for justice to finally be over. \" it could have taken a lifetime, \" she says. \" i never would have stopped. \" ( in ohio, a few grains of pollen might solve an old murder case. )",

With the literacy rate under 50 %, the country has adopted a unique voting system in which each voter drops a marble into one of three different colored drums representing presidential hopefuls, reports the telegraph. Election monitors listen for the sound of a bell that rings as a marble is dropped. Incumbent president yahya jammeh, who seized power in a 1994 coup, is widely expected to get the vast majority of the marbles, the guardian notes. The self-proclaimed mystic, a close friend of jermaine jackson, has spent heavily on roads and hospitals but has also cracked down on dissent and imprisoned dozens of journalists.

        "summary": "You've just gone on a wonderful vacation, and now you want to tell your friends all about it. But a new study in psychological science finds that doing just that could actually end up making you feel bad. Essentially, researchers found that people would rather talk about an ordinary experience that was shared among them than discuss an extraordinary experience only one member of the group had. Meaning that, if you bust out your paris photos at the next dinner party, you may end up feeling excluded. Researchers came to their conclusions by showing people one of two films — either an excellent one or a mediocre one — and then putting them in groups to discuss what they had just watched. The groups were made up of three people who saw the \" ordinary \" movie and just one who saw the \" extraordinary \" one, and the lone viewer who got to watch the good movie ended up feeling left out — and actually reported feeling significantly worse after the discussion than those who were subjected to the bad movie. And, not surprisingly, people wrongly predicted that getting to see the better movie would, in turn, make their social interactions better. \" our subjects thought they would be the star of the interaction, and they were surprised they were left out of it, \" a co-author explains to the new york times. \" they didn't understand why everyone else wanted to commiserate [ about the sub-par movie ] rather than hear about their great one. \" as the study author puts it in a press release, \" extraordinary experiences are pleasurable in the moment but can leave us socially worse off in the long run.... Social interaction is grounded in similarities. \" but, he tells the boston globe, \" i definitely don't want to say the take-home message to be you never seek experiences that are unique and awesome, because that's just silly. \" he further explains to medical news today, \" the idea is that people don't naturally consider the social costs of having extraordinary experiences.

        "summary": "One of the two people killed in sunday night's mass shooting on popular danforth avenue in toronto was a 10-year-old girl. The other wasn't much older: an 18-year-old recent high school graduate named reese fallon, who was attending a birthday party at a restaurant, reports the toronto globe and mail. The younger victim hasn't yet been identified, but police have made public one more key name, that of the suspected shooter: faisal hussain, 29. Police say it's too early to declare a motive, but hussain's family issued a statement saying he suffered from \" severe mental health challenges, struggling with psychosis and depression his entire life. \" it added that \" medications and therapy were unable to treat him, \" but that the family never thought his illness would lead to such \" horrific actions. \" the statement offered condolences to the victims. \"at this time, there is no national security nexus to the investigation, \" said a spokeswoman for canada's ministry of public safety. In addition to the two fatalities, 13 people ranging in age from 17 to 59 remain injured, reports ctv news. Hussain also was fatally shot, but it was unclear monday night whether he died by suicide or a police bullet. Ctv also has a chilling video that shows the gunman walking on danforth avenue and opening fire with a handgun. The link is here, and while it doesn't show any victims, it may be disturbing. The avenue is filled with cafes, shops, and restaurants, and generally is bustling at night. Toronto mayor john tory sees one issue he thinks needs to be addressed in the aftermath. \"this city has a gun problem, in that guns are far too readily available to far too many people, \" he says.",

No one at doctors hospital in coral gables, where the surgery took place, had a good answer for timiriasieff, reports the miami herald. \" when we contacted the hospital, they claimed they could not give us any explanation for why or how this happened, \" his attorney says. The hospital did release a statement that reads, in part: \" proper procedures have been reinforced at the hospital to prevent similar situations from happening in the future. \" but having one's limb turn up at a waste management facility is highly unusual — amputated body parts are typically incinerated — and timiriasieff wasn't satisfied. He filed a lawsuit last week in miami-dade county circuit court claiming emotional distress.

Japanese researchers had nearly 1,400 women and men, with an average age of 67, try the balancing act for at least a minute — and found that those who lasted less than 20 seconds were more likely to have already suffered a small stroke, webmd reports. Such strokes are considered a serious contributor to dementia and mental decline. People who can't go 20 seconds \" should receive increased attention, as this physical frailty may signal potential brain abnormalities and mental decline, \" says chief study author yasuharu tabara. Those who failed the test were at greater risk of small vessel disease like \" infarctions \" — ischemic strokes caused by a block or leak in the brain's blood supply, medical daily reports. Worse, such strokes show no symptoms. So the one-leg test \" may be an inexpensive, low-tech method to screen people for small vessel disease who are most likely at risk for further strokes and brain damage, \" says a vascular neurologist. Published in the journal stroke, the study recalls a finding earlier this year that 53-year-old men and women who could rapidly stand and sit in a chair for a minute, and stand on one leg for more than 10 seconds, were at less risk of an early death, the telegraph reports.
