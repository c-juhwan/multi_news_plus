The suit argues that ohio recognizes other types of out-of-state marriages that would not have been allowed in the state, such as marriages between minors or cousins. In his ruling yesterday, the judge cited the supreme court's rejection of doma, and noted, \" the issue whether states can refuse to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages is now surely headed to the fore. \" gay marriage saw another victory in california, where inmates are now allowed to marry partners of the same sex, the sacramento bee reports.

That's the new directive in the chicago suburb of deerfield, where the board of trustees voted unanimously monday to amend a 2013 ordinance calling for the safe storage and transport of certain firearms and now outright ban them, the chicago tribune and cbs chicago report. High-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds are also banned. The decision to bar the \" possession, manufacture, and sale \" of such weapons and ammo holders was made to \" increase the public's sense of safety, \" per cbs news. After june 13, any resident who holds onto such firearms — which include ar-15s, ak-47s, and uzis — will be hit with a daily fine that the village's attorney says can range from $ 250 to $ 1,000, and that will keep being imposed until the resident adheres to the ban. Current and retired cops don't have to comply, per one town official, who added the ban was based on a similar one made in nearby highland park in 2013; that ban was deemed constitutional after a legal battle. Also exempt: antique handguns that are no longer functional and firearms made for olympic shooting events. Dozens of people attended monday's trustees meeting, with many in opposition to the ban; some even called for civil disobedience to resist the law. A high schooler in favor of the ban feels otherwise: \" this is our generation's fight. We're going to keep fighting and this is part of it. \" gun rights group guns save life plans to sue deerfield over the ban, with the nra's support, per the washington post.",

Street said the new law is modeled after one approved by highland park in 2013. That ban survived a legal challenge by one of the city's residents and the illinois state rifle association.

The village board of trustees unanimously approved a ban on certain types of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, amending a 2013 ordinance that regulated the storage of those items. The new ordinance prohibits the possession, sale and manufacturing of certain types of assault weapons and large capacity magazines within the village, according to the ordinance. One change from the law as it was originally discussed exempts retired police officers from the ban, according to village manager kent street. Violations carry a fine of between $ 250 and $ 1,000 per day, according to matthew rose, the village attorney. He said the fine is levied each day until there is compliance. Street said the new law is modeled after one approved by highland park in 2013. That ban survived a legal challenge by one of the city's residents and the illinois state rifle association. The 7th u.s. Circuit court of appeals held that legislation constitutional and the u.s. Supreme court let the decision stand when it declined to take up the appeal. Unlike highland park, deerfield opted not to enact a total ban on assault weapons during a 10-day window that illinois lawmakers ' gave home-rule municipalities in 2013 before the state"

If it does ( a determination that will make use of dna from the bones of gherardini's relatives ), he ' ll create a computer-generated image of her face — one that may or may not be identical to the painting. As the wall street journal reports, vinceti made waves in 2011 by floating the theory that a male model sat for leonardo da vinci during the painting process. If any generated likeness is not a true match, it could indicate that da vinci used multiple models, perhaps for a specific reason. Vinceti says the test results should be ready by may or june. \" if we don't find her, art historians can continue to speculate about who the model really was, \" he tells the journal. The painting currently resides in the louvre, but two years ago, vinceti launched a push to bring it back to italy. One apparent supporter of the move: george clooney, the telegraph reports.",

The aim was to raise a 100,000 signature petition to return the mona lisa to florence in 2013, exactly 100 years after it was recovered following a theft from the louvre in 1911. The painting has officially left paris just three times – once in 1962 when it went to new york and washington and 12 years later when it was exhibited in moscow and tokyo. The painting was stolen in 1911 by an italian when the theft was not discovered for two days and the painting was not recovered from florence for two years. Mr clooney warned that he would make the provocative call for the mona lisa to leave its french sanctuary at a bad-tempered press conference in london where he backed greek demands for the recovery of the elgin marbles. Mr clooney previously called for \" an open discussion \" on returning the parthenon marbles to greece this week, throwing into question the friezes, which were taken by lord elgin 200 years ago.

The wall street journal reviewed 34 publicly traded financial firms and calculated their total compensation to be $ 159 billion for 2011, the smallest amount since 2008. Actually, pay was on track to hit a record high for the first three quarters of 2011 at those companies, but a miserable end of the year wiped out much of that, according to the journal's survey. At goldman sachs, the average employee compensation will likely fall 10.7 % to $ 385,000; for its 400 partners, pay could be cut in half compared to 2010. At morgan stanley, bonuses for investment bankers could fall as much as 40 %. And with new regulations reining in risk taking, industry experts say the party is over for wall street. \"it's likely 2011 will be the worst year for revenue growth for the banks since 1938, and so far 2012 isn't feeling much better, \" one analyst told the new york times. \"the industry simply grew too fast over the past two decades and now it's downshifting. This process will take time, but the hit to revenue is happening now. \" on the other hand, many wall street employees are getting more bonuses in the form of company stocks, and with markets down now, those stocks could turn into a major windfall should the markets rebound.",

The layout, which the verge calls \" kind of eerie, \" features a dashboard with a console situated smack in the middle of the driver and passenger seats, with nothing but \" blank real estate \" in front of both. The revamped electric chevy bolt from cruise automation, gm's autonomous-vehicle arm, is set to be tested in 2019 and will eventually be shipped out to serve in ride-hailing services in certain us cities. \" it's an interesting thing to share with everybody, \" gm president dan ammann says. But there are some logistical hurdles for gm to clear for what wired calls its \" robo-chariot, \" including getting the national highway traffic safety administration to let 2,500 of the cars ( the maximum number allowed ) off the hook on 16 safety requirements, such as having an airbag in the steering wheel — moot as there's no steering wheel. The company's petition to the nhtsa doesn't ask for an exemption per se, ammann explains, but simply the ability to meet the safety standards in different ways ( such as putting that aforementioned airbag on the driver's side where the steering wheel would have been ). Per the financial times, which notes this is the fourth generation of the company's autonomous car in just 18 months, ammann suggests more innovations may be forthcoming, noting that \" the fourth generation will not be the last generation. \"",

This newest plos one study says that number is more like 3,000, all of which you can now peruse using a free database. \" urine is an incredibly complex biofluid.

It's doubtful the left's smear campaign will affect roberts or any of the justices, adds the editorial. \" the court's reputation will be tarnished if it bows to the political distemper of the moment, not if it follows the constitution. \" click for the full op-ed.",

What those reporters encountered: an acute awareness of the risk of injury — though some players say they do their best to ignore fears, others say it affects players ' actions on the field — and broad suspicions that teams aren't always providing the best care, or acting in the best interest of the players themselves; those suspicions were more prevalent among veteran players, with 35 % saying their interests are protected, as opposed to 71 % among those who have played professionally less than four years. \" some places are really good at it, other places are, in the players ' opinion, not good at all, \" says a 12-year veteran with the arizona cardinals. Other findings from the investigation: 39 of the 100 players said they are more worried about the long-term effects of concussions than other types of injuries. 52 rated their general level of concern about injuries as high or medium ( \" you can break your neck at any moment; it's not like we're playing golf, \" washington redskins cornerback deangelo hall said ), while 48 said it was low or nonexistent. 71 said they have noticed other players ' play affected by health concerns, and 36 acknowledged their own play has been influenced. \" the one thing i always say is: the game catches up to everybody, \" said a redskins lineman not involved in the survey. \" my hope and prayer is that i want everybody to be healthy and to be prosperous.

Almost 400 samples of both kinds of milk found that the organic stuff, from cows grazed in grassy pastures, was richer in heart-healthy fatty acids than milk from corn-fed cows, reports nbc. \" all milk is healthy and good for people, \" the lead researcher says, but organic milk has a better balance of omega-3 fatty acids versus omega-6, which has been linked to heart disease when it is too high in the balance. \" there's really no debate around the world — when you feed dairy cows more grass, you improve the fatty acid profile of milk. You also increase the protein level, \" says the lead researcher, who suggests people who can't afford organic milk stick to full-fat milk. The study was largely funded by an organic dairy cooperative but experts say the data appears credible, the new york times notes.

Per fox news, the female trapdoor spider was killed by a parasitic wasp in october after she was studied by scientists starting at her birth in 1974. The findings were published in a study in pacific conservation biology journal, per a statement from curtin university in western australia. According to phys.org, researchers believe the spiders can survive so long in the australian outback thanks to their slow metabolism, distance from humans and sedentary nature. Dubbed \" number 16 \" by the study, this particular female lived her entire life in a single burrow that was extremely close to the place of her birth. Per the curtin university release, number 16 outlived the previous record holder, a captive tarantula in mexico, by some 13 years. \" to our knowledge this is the oldest spider ever recorded, and her significant life has allowed us to further investigate the trapdoor spider's behaviour and population dynamics, \" lead author leanda mason said in a statement.

The controversial comments were made during a domestic violence case at a court in bangalore. A 28-year-old woman had complained to the court that her husband regularly beat her up. Controversy: high court judge justice bhaktavatsala has caused outrage in india by saying it is fine for a husband to beat up his wife - as long as he was taking good care of her she also told the court he had once thrown her out of their house.

He will take care of you. Why are you still talking about his beatings? ', he said. The woman told the court she did not want to return to her husband.

            "Following an outrage over certain remarks made by a judge of karnataka high court on women in an open court, all family court matters, including child custody and guardianship, have been shifted from him and another judge.

There was no other change in the subjects listed against the name of justices bhakthavatsala and indrakala. The changes will come into effect from september 10, official sources said. The shifting of the matters comes in the wake of the outrage expressed by women lawyers and activists to certain oral remarks made by justice bhakthavatsala in an open court. The modification of subjects assigned to the judges of the high court normally happens to those judges who return from their sittings at the circuit benches. Karnataka has two circuit benches — in gulbarga and dharwad.

The controversial comments were made during a domestic violence case at a court in bangalore. A 28-year-old woman had complained to the court that her husband regularly beat her up. Controversy: high court judge justice bhaktavatsala has caused outrage in india by saying it is fine for a husband to beat up his wife - as long as he was taking good care of her she also told the court he had once thrown her out of their house. According to headlines today, justice bhaktavatsala told the woman that all women suffer in marriages and that she had to adjust to her husband. ' your husband is doing good business. He will take care of you. Why are you still talking about his beatings? ', he said. The woman told the court she did not want to return to her husband. But the judge's response was to suggest that the husband take his wife and son out for lunch. According to india today, the judge also remarked to an unmarried female lawyer",

There was no other change in the subjects listed against the name of justices bhakthavatsala and indrakala. The changes will come into effect from september 10, official sources said. The shifting of the matters comes in the wake of the outrage expressed by women lawyers and activists to certain oral remarks made by justice bhakthavatsala in an open court.

They tried to sell their home on meadow creek drive, but had no buyers. Mcalpine moved to a house nearby and the two, as co-owners, decided to rent their property, she said. In early april, mcalpine's ex-wife rented out the home, myren said. But before the tenants moved in, police said mcalpine returned to the house, crawling into a small space underneath a stairwell. Myren said the renters never suspected anything. \" for whatever reason, they didn't detect an odor, \" she said. It wasn't until they moved out and mcalpine's ex-wife was preparing the home for new renters that she smelled \" a foul odor. \" she looked underneath the stairs in a storage space blocked by a 3-foot-tall door and found mcalpine's body, myren said. Attempts by the daily news to contact mcalpine's ex-wife tuesday were unsuccessful. Myren said police do not suspect foul play in the case of mcalpine's death, but drugs or alcohol may be involved. The alaska state medical examiner's office is conducting an autopsy. In december, the body of stephen gingrich, 58, was found buried under a heavy concrete slab in a crawl space underneath his eagle river home. He had been missing about a month, police said.

Olexiy pukach has been sentenced to life in prison in the high-profile case; the court says he killed gongadze and cut off his head afterward. Pukach has confessed to the killing, saying it was ordered by then-interior minister yuri kravchenko. The case was embroiled in politics, with gongadze's death occurring shortly after he set up a news website that attacked then-president leonid kuchma. After the murder, protesters demonstrated against the president. But kuchma, who says he wasn't involved, escaped conviction after recordings used in the case were deemed to have been illegally obtained. Pukach said he had killed gongadze by accident, strangling him in an attempt to gain information on the journalist's reported spying, the kyivpost reports. Pukach also acknowledged decapitating gongadze. Pukach's team, however, plans an appeal. Kravchenko died in what was ruled a suicide in 2005, just before his questioning in the case. The bbc notes, however, that controversy exists over how he was able to shoot himself twice in the head.",

Chuck schumer received a unanimous vote by senate democrats during a closed-door meeting to become the minority leader who will succeed harry reid, who's retiring in january, the ap reports. Across the aisle, in what the los angeles times says was another unanimous decision, senate republicans re-elected mitch mcconnell as majority leader. Mcconnell first took on the post when republicans gained control of the senate in 2015, after eight years serving as minority leader. Although mcconnell kept a wary distance from trump during the campaign, he's now rallying behind the president-elect. Republicans are likely to have a 52-48 advantage in the incoming senate.",

He thought he was going onstage in 15 minutes when a page grabbed him to tell him he only had a minute and 15 seconds. But backstage, he was distracted by goldie hawn. She's \" charismatic, sexy, beautiful, she's got an amazing thing, and i was starstruck, \" he said. \" i ' m starstruck hugging and loving her up and forgetting that i have to go and do this bit. \" then, as he was rushed onstage, he was told that the teleprompters would be showing menzel's name spelled phonetically, which isn't how he'd rehearsed it. As he tried to read it aloud, \" in my mind, i ' m going, what? what? what is that name? i don't know that name, \" he explains. Of course, next year, travolta may find himself having to explain all the weird stuff he did at this year's oscars. He actually did address one thing on kimmel — his excessive touching of menzel's face while they were onstage together ( examples in the image gallery, or watch it here ) — by noting, \" apparently i played with her chin too much. \" but he made headlines for two more incidents: on the red carpet, he swooped in to give scarlett johansson a surprise ( and very awkward-looking ) kiss on the cheek. In return, she gave him some pretty epic side-eye. Click to see the pictures ( and some of the resulting memes ). Then, sitting behind benedict cumberbatch in the audience, travolta was photographed apparently staring intently at cumberbatch, leading to yet more memes ( with captions like: \" i ' m going to kill you, brendadirk cramplescrunch \" ).

The shallow lake — it's about a foot deep, according to livescience — isn't the result of sea water overtaking the ice; it consists entirely of the melted ice itself. And it's a vicious cycle, writes william wolfe-wylie for canada.com. That water picks up more radiation from the sun than solid ice would, so the area is getting even warmer. At the beginning of the month, a lot of the arctic ocean saw temperatures two to five degrees warmer than average; the lake began forming july 13. But it's nothing new: the lake has been appearing each year, the atlantic wire notes. More than half of arctic sea ice is newly formed and thin, livescience reports, making it easier for meltwater ponds to form and combine. An arctic cyclone due this week will boost the melting process even more. Visit the north pole environmental observatory for images. In related news, arctic warming could end up costing the world an extra $ 60 trillion, researchers say. ( compare that to the size of the global economy in 2012: $ 70 trillion. ) that's because the methane gas emitted as the permafrost under the east siberian sea thaws could quicken the effects of climate change, adding to the costs heaped upon the world by global warming, the christian science monitor explains.

The agriculture department today gave the go-ahead to a canadian company to sell gmo apples in the us, reports reuters. They've been doctored to resist browning when cut or sliced open, which canada's okanagan specialty fruits thinks will be attractive to restaurants and other businesses that serve or sell food. The trick will be overcoming public apprehension about gmo products and convincing farmers to grow them. Okanagan plans to sell two varieties, called the arctic granny and the arctic golden, and the company says it will put a snowflake logo on them, reports the wall street journal. It's possible the fda will require further labeling, but that remains unclear. The fda is currently reviewing the apple to ensure its safety, but as the new york times explains, that review is voluntary, though \" virtually all genetically modified crops have gone through it. \" in any event, don't expect to see the apples in widespread distribution for several years — even after the company convinces growers to sign on, the trees will need time to bear fruit.",

            "U.s. Regulators on friday approved what would be the first commercialized biotech apple, rejecting efforts by the organic industry and other gmo critics to block the new fruit. The u.s. Department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) approved two genetically engineered apple varieties designed to resist browning that have been developed by the canadian company okanagan specialty fruits inc. Okanagan plans to market the apples as arctic granny and arctic golden, and says the apples are identical to their conventional counterparts except the flesh of the fruit will retain a fresh appearance even after it is sliced or bruised.

        "summary": "New research suggests being unemployed may actually alter a person's \" core personality \" for the worse, making it harder to secure new employment, per the american psychological association. A study published in the apa's journal of applied psychology looked at nearly 6,769 german adults who took a personality test at two points during a four-year period; 210 of the subjects were unemployed for one to four years during this period, while 251 were briefly unemployed but got another job within a year. Results showed the impact of joblessness on the \" big five \" personality traits: conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness. Among the findings: men showed increases in agreeableness during the first two years of unemployment ( compared to employed men ), but those levels ultimately fell below those of men who had never lost their jobs. Women, meanwhile, became more disagreeable with every passing year of joblessness. \" in early unemployment stages, there may be incentives for individuals to behave agreeably in an effort to secure another job or placate those around them, but in later years... Such incentives may weaken, \" the researchers write. The study also found that, for men, conscientiousness and openness declined the longer they were unemployed. For women, openness decreased sharply in the second and third years without a job, then rebounded. As for conscientiousness, it actually grew for women toward the beginning and end of an unemployed period, but decreased in the middle. Lead author christopher boyce says that the findings are important in understanding how unemployment transcends economics; he adds that public policymakers should try harder to lower unemployment rates and offer greater support for the unemployed, aol jobs notes. ( at least the first jobs report of 2015 offered some hope. )",

Harvard, which receives federal funding, claims some consideration of race is necessary to ensure a diverse student body. But as its admissions process remains a secret, the doj says harvard violates legal parameters requiring schools to show they can't meet diversity-related goals without using race as a factor. \" there is ample record evidence that harvard's use of race is not narrowly tailored \" as required, a doj official tells buzzfeed. The filing specifically refers to \" a vague ' personal rating'that harms asian-american applicants ' chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias, \" reports the new york times. A lawsuit brought by students for fair admissions, led by conservative legal activist edward blum, claims asian-american applicants scored higher than other groups in academics and extra-curricular activities, but had consistently lower personal ratings, which are to be based on personality, personal essays, admissions interviews, and teacher recommendations, per the wall street journal. The paper describes the doj move as expected considering the trump administration's efforts to reverse guidelines encouraging the use of race to promote diversity on school campuses, adopted under president obama.

            "[ read the statement of interest. ] the justice department has increasingly used such statements of interest to intervene in civil rights cases. Before 2006, such statements appeared only seven times in civil rights-oriented disputes, according to a recent paper by law school student victor zapana. From 2006 to 2011, they were drafted in at least 242, almost all by the obama administration on issues such as videotaping police brutality and ensuring that blind people and their service dogs have access to uber. But the trump administration is turning the same tool against affirmative action in college admissions, a major — and highly contentious — legacy of the civil rights era, and one that white conservatives have opposed for decades. In the past few years, the anti-affirmative action cause has been joined by asian-americans who argue that they are being held to a higher standard, losing out on coveted slots at places like harvard as african-americans, latinos and other groups get a boost. A handful of states already ban public universities from relying on affirmative action, pushing several toward a model that takes socioeconomic factors into account instead of race.",

A sampling: wrong decision: the court's majority ruled that state voters were within their rights to decide that colleges can ban affirmative action policies in their admissions. But the new york times editorial board thinks sonia sotomayor got it right in her dissent when she wrote that the us constitution \" places limits on what a majority of the people may do. \" they can't, for instance, pass laws that oppress minorities, declares the times, and \" that's what the affirmative action ban does, by altering the political process to single out race and sex as the only factors that may not be considered in university admissions. \" right decision: the washington post editorial board doesn't agree with the ban itself, but it says the court \" nevertheless made the right call in respecting voters ' prerogative to make a different judgment. \" reasonable people can disagree on the matter, and \" it's not surprising that many citizens are uncomfortable with policies that explicitly favor members of one race over another. \" backers of affirmative action shouldn't give up, though. They just need to start developing other ways to push campus diversity. Ditto: the detroit news agrees with the latter point. \" it's no time to be complacent, \" write the editors. \" universities like u-m should cultivate other alternatives for boosting their diversity. For instance, they could focus more on students'socioeconomic status. \" what's more, schools \" could work more closely with minority students in middle and high school — helping them make sure they're prepared for the academic challenges of college. \" ' i am affirmative action:'stephen henderson of the detroit free press won the pulitzer for commentary this week, and he reflects on how affirmative action helped him in his career. As a beginner, his newspaper's parent company waived a hiring freeze for him because it wanted to boost minority presence in its newsrooms. \" opportunity, based at least in part on race, opened the door to that career.

Disaster was avoided, but what if a collision had occurred? kevin poormon with the university of dayton research institute's impact physics division set out to find out. The answer he arrived at isn't a very reassuring one. His group is able to launch things at high rates of speed, so he set out to simulate a crash using the right wing of a mooney m20 plane, a drone ( the 2.1-pound dji phantom 2 quadcopter ), and the biggest air cannon his lab has. The phantom was inserted into the 40-foot cannon and released at the estimated impact speed: 238mph. The hit occurred 0.03 seconds later, and popular mechanics observes that though the drone was obliterated, it held together long enough to strike the wing as one object, rather than multiple fragments. Wired describes the slow-motion video of the drone entering the wing as \" like a spoon through chocolate mousse. \" but it's poormon's own description of the impact that's more jarring. He explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage its main weight-bearing spar, per a press release. \" if you damage the spar enough on that side, you would not, um, survive. The aircraft would crash, \" he says. A simulated bird collision ( he used gelatin instead of a dead bird due to the mess and \" mean stink \" that would result ) tore a bigger hole into the wing but didn't breach it to the same depth, or cause the same damage. Wired notes the mooney m20 doesn't adhere to the same safety regulations in terms of construction as commercial jets, but poormon says it's close. ( this drone did in 20 minutes what humans couldn't do. )",

Although similar in square footage, the two mega-mansions aren't much alike. The faux-french fleur de lys was completed a dozen years ago and sits less than two miles away on five acres. Beverly house, built by local banker milton getz in the 1920s, was the onetime residence of publishing magnate william randolph hearst and actress marion davies.

The ruling from the 5th u.s. Circuit court of appeals means ramiro hernandez-llanas, 44, is set for execution wednesday. Attorneys for hernandez-llanas and another inmate, tommy lynn sells, had filed a lawsuit last week saying they needed the name of the drug supplier in order to verify the drug's potency. They said they feared the prisoners could suffer unconstitutional pain and suffering if the drug weren't tested. The state argued it was protecting the company from threats of violence. A lower court initially sided with the inmates, but the 5th circuit reversed that ruling last week for sells, who was executed thursday after the u.s. Supreme court upheld the appeals court decision. The appeals court had said it would rule later on hernandez-llanas ' case. The state attorney general's office had urged the 5th circuit to lift the lower court order, arguing that the new supply of pentobarbital came from a licensed compounding pharmacy. The state also noted that the drug had been used \" painlessly and successfully \" on sells, and that there was \" no pharmacy, no drug and no assurance of quality that hernandez",

The volume of material is so great it will take awhile for media outlets to sift through them and authenticate — according to the washington post, wikileaks says the leak is larger than the dump of nsa documents provided by edward snowden. The 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments released so far, with information redacted, were reportedly created between 2013 and 2016, come from the center for cyber intelligence, and include hundreds of millions of lines of code on more than a thousand hacking systems, reports the new york times. The documents show \" the cia had created, in effect, its ' own nsa ' with even less accountability, \" says wikileaks, claiming the cia used apps like signal, whatsapp, and telegram to listen in on conversations, while a separate program developed with british intelligence reportedly allowed the cia to also use samsung tvs even when the tvs were off. Wikileaks says the documents appear to have been shared among former government contractors before one \" provided wikileaks with portions of the archive \" with the goal of sparking \" a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons, \" per usa today. A cia spokesman says simply, \" we do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents. \"",

        "summary": "The gop field will have its last debate before the florida primary tonight, and it just might be a doozy. Here's why: newt gingrich's polling advantage may have vanished. The latest cnn poll has mitt romney at 36 % and gingrich at 34 %, a statistical tie, and a far cry from some of gingrich's earlier numbers. Nate silver says his statistical model now rates gingrich's chance of victory at 60 % — a huge dip from the 75 % it predicted yesterday. But looking at polling trends, silver thinks romney might actually be a slight favorite. All of which underscores the stakes for gingrich tonight, writes ronald brownstein of the national journal. Gingrich surged in south carolina thanks to \" searing debate performances, \" of the kind he didn't deliver monday. Since he's being outspent badly, tonight is \" his best, and perhaps last, opportunity \" to \" consolidate the party's populist wing. \" gingrich is winning by one metric at least: his crowds are drastically larger than mitt romney's, the new york times reports. Romney's never managed more than a couple hundred, whereas gingrich draws thousands. … which means gingrich has lots of practice in front of the kind of raucous crowds these debates tend to have. That rowdiness is by design, the times reveals: hosts have been deliberately hyping audiences into frenzies before debates.",

Romney moved into the lead during that period because he consolidated the center of the party behind him more than any one of his rivals consolidated the right of the party against him. Instead, conservatives fragmented among a long menu of choices.that pattern flipped in gingrich's crushing south carolina victory last saturday. Gingrich ran better among the key elements of what could be called the gop's populist wing-including evangelical christians, strong tea party supporters, non-college voters, those earning less than $",
            "Polling released within the past 24 hours suggests that mitt romney has stopped and possibly reversed newt gingrich's momentum before the florida primary on tuesday. The fivethirtyeight forecast model still projects mr. Gingrich as the slight favorite in florida, giving him a two-point lead and a 60 percent chance of victory. However, this lead is diminished considerably from two days ago, when the model saw a potential double-digit win for mr. Gingrich, as polls released immediately after the south carolina primary had him surging in florida. In fact, i suspect that the model is being too conservative and that there is enough evidence — when you look carefully at the day-to-day results — to conclude that mr. Romney has re-emerged as the slight favorite in florida instead. The complication in florida is that there are two conflicting trends. It should be quite obvious that mr. Gingrich's position is much stronger than it",

Gingrich ran better among the key elements of what could be called the gop's populist wing-including evangelical christians, strong tea party supporters, non-college voters, those earning less than $",
            "Polling released within the past 24 hours suggests that mitt romney has stopped and possibly reversed newt gingrich's momentum before the florida primary on tuesday. The fivethirtyeight forecast model still projects mr. Gingrich as the slight favorite in florida, giving him a two-point lead and a 60 percent chance of victory. However, this lead is diminished considerably from two days ago, when the model saw a potential double-digit win for mr. Gingrich, as polls released immediately after the south carolina primary had him surging in florida. In fact, i suspect that the model is being too conservative and that there is enough evidence — when you look carefully at the day-to-day results — to conclude that mr. Romney has re-emerged as the slight favorite in florida instead. The complication in florida is that there are two conflicting trends. It should be quite obvious that mr. Gingrich's position is much stronger than it",
            "7 years ago jacksonville, florida ( cnn ) - one day before the final gop presidential debate in florida, it's all tied up between mitt romney and newt gingrich, according to a new survey. A cnn/time/orc international poll also indicates that while gingrich surged following his 12-point victory in saturday's south carolina primary, his momentum appears to be quickly cooling off.

But when people follow a low-carb diet, the types of carbs they eat may not be so important, finds a new study out of harvard and johns hopkins published this week in the journal jama. Following the highly regimented diets of 163 participants ( each assigned to one of four diets, all of which contained the same calories but had different carbs ), researchers were surprised to find that when overall carb levels were low, the glycemic level of the carbs consumed didn't seem to matter, reports livescience. Some argue that low glycemic diets, with lots of whole grains and low-starch veggies, are better for blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. But the new york times reports that the new findings suggest that low glycemic diets actually worsened insulin sensitivity. \" the dogma out there is that a high glycemic index is bad, \" a former president of the american heart association not involved in the study tells the times. \" i hope that ultimately the glycemic index will be left on the shelf. \" still, the findings only relate to short-term health effects and didn't take into account the effects on the growing population of adults with type 2 diabetes.
