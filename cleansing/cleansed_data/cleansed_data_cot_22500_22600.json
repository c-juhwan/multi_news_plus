But the good times apparently have an expiration date. The men found that their happiness began to diminish around age 70, which npr dubs \" the approximate moment when grumpiness kicks in for men. \" the study, published in march's psychology and aging, shed some light on why the men, who were between the ages of 53 and 85 during the 15-year study, found that life improved at first, then started to be a downer around 70. \" older adults, \" referring to those around 50, \" on average have fewer hassles — and respond to them better — than younger adults, \" explains lead author carolyn aldwin. But as decades pass new \" hassles \" set in, and how the men \" appraised \" them changed. Per a press release, appraisals of hassles improved during one's 60s, then downgraded in one's 70s ( aldwin points out that later-in-life hassles include health issues, the death of family and friends, and mental decline ). But she adds that old men aren't doomed to gloom, as there are new sources of happiness: \" you may lose a parent, but gain a grandchild. \" ( more good news for the young: a new study finds we peak at 24. )",

        "summary": "Another sign of the severity of california's drought: farmers who hold some of the oldest and thus strongest water rights in the state have agreed to voluntarily cut their water use by 25 % this season. The move by the farmers in the delta of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers is \" unprecedented, \" reports the los angeles times. It affects those with \" riparian rights, \" explains the paper, meaning farmers whose land has direct access to a stream. Some of those rights go back 100 years. The state accepted the offer today, which the farmers made because they feared the government would impose even stricter reductions. The agreement heads off what likely would have been a long, costly legal fight, reports the sacramento bee. Consumers everywhere can expect to feel at least some impact of the drought in food prices, and the new york times provides a graphic on how much water is used to make a typical week's serving of crops from avocados ( 4.1 gallons ) to bread ( 6.4 gallons ) to mandarins ( 42.5 gallons ). Meanwhile, drought-shaming is now a thing.",

            "In a move reflecting the growing severity of california's drought, state water regulators have accepted a historic proposal by delta region farmers to voluntarily cut water usage by 25 %, or, alternatively, to allow a quarter of their fields to lay idle. The action follows a move by gov. Jerry brown to cut urban water use by 25 % — an emergency measure that has caused no small amount of resentment among many residents who claim agriculture is not doing its share to conserve water. Under an agreement with growers in the sacramento-san joaquin river delta, the hub of the state's water system, the state will allow farmers with some of the oldest and most secure water rights to voluntarily reduce usage by 25 %. \"these are senior-water-rights holders stepping up to say they ' ll do their part, \" said felicia marcus, chairwoman of the state water resources control board, which announced the deal friday. The action applies only to so-called riparian rights holders, landowners whose property has direct access to a river or stream. By volunteering the cuts, delta farmers avoid the risk of being hit with even larger cutbacks mandated by state water regulators. The delta region represents less than 10 % of the state's total 6.9-billion acres of farmland, yet some see friday's action as a foreshadowing of new limits on agricultural water use statewide. Regulators have suggested that such cuts are a near certainty, but say that cool, overcast weather, as well as recent rainfall, have allowed them to delay action. The delta farmers ' proposal was particularly welcome as it seemed to remove the threat of lengthy and divisive litigation in a time of crisis. \"it allows participating growers to share in the sacrifice that people throughout the state are facing because of the severe drought, while protecting their economic well-being by giving them some certainty,",
            "California farmers produce more than a third of the nation's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. To do that, they use nearly 80 percent of all the water consumed in the state. It is the most stubborn part of the crisis: to fundamentally alter how much water the state uses, all americans may have to give something up. The portions of foods shown here are grown in california and represent what average americans, including non-californians, eat in a week. We made an estimate of the amount of water it takes to grow each portion to give you a sense of your contribution to the california drought. The estimates include the amount of water used to make derivative products. For example, grape consumption includes not just fresh grapes, but also wine, jam and juice."

O ' callaghan-westropp and zoe holohan — who arrived in greece on saturday following their thursday wedding in kells — were forced to abandon their car in gridlock as winds pushed flames toward the sea. They ran in that direction but became separated close to the water, reports the irish times. Holohan reached a beach and realized her husband was no longer with her. The irish ambassador to greece confirmed o ' callaghan-westropp's body was later found, per the bbc. \" our sympathies and hearts go out to his family at this time, \" said orla o ' hanrahan. She added holohan was admitted to a hospital tuesday with burns to her head and hands and is expected to fully recover. She's one of an estimated 200 people injured, per the guardian. With another 40 missing, officials expect the death toll to continue to climb as rescue workers comb through as many as 2,500 burned homes. Identification of the deceased won't be easy. \" sometimes it's difficult to see the people; they look like charcoal, \" the new york times quotes a red cross volunteer as saying. Per the times, an investigation into the cause will only begin when all the fires are out, though arson is suspected given \" the proliferation of so many small fires \" in drought-affected areas.",

        "summary": "She's been known to german archaeologists for more than a century, but they only now know where a mysterious mummy came from — and how she died. The study in plos one explains that the mummified woman was brought to bavaria in the 1900s. It's possible she was acquired by princess therese von bayern during a 1898 trip to peru, though the study authors note that is according to her own records, and no documentation exists. But it's now clear that the mummy did indeed hail from south america, the bbc reports, where she was killed by blunt-force trauma to the head; the researchers suspect the killing came as part of a ritual sacrifice. Though the mummy visually appeared relatively normal, a ct scan showed \" she must have received a couple of really severe hits by a sharp object, \" study co-author andreas nerlich of munich university tells livescience. \" the skull bones that had been destroyed fell into her brain cavity, and they are still there today. \" an analysis of isotopes in her hair revealed a fish- and maize-heavy diet, indicating she likely lived near the peruvian or northern chilean coast — according to carbon dating, sometime between ad 1451 and 1642. After death, she was buried in a hot, dry, and sandy region that facilitated natural mummification. The researchers learned the woman wasn't long for this world anyway: she also suffered from chagas disease, a parasitic infection that would have killed her. Her remains could now help scientists better understand the pathogen's origins; chagas disease remains endemic in the continent, the bbc notes.",

The anderson cooper who was bitten was the cnn host. It was all thanks to his interest in spike's k9 fund, a nonprofit that cooper did a story on two years ago. It works to get bulletproof vests on police and military dogs at a cost about $ 2,500 each. Cooper has since been a donor and fundraiser and just this week aired a 7-minute segment about the organization and its co-founder, jimmy hatch, the virginian-pilot reports. It was while filming the segment for cnn's weeklong champions for change series that cooper's canine namesake — a dog cooper had outfitted with a vest — bit cooper's elbow, though without injury to the host. \" jimmy somehow convinced me to suit up so i could experience the power and discipline of these dogs, \" cooper explained of the protective suit he had donned, something a suspect being attacked by a dog obviously would not have. Hatch, a former navy seal who founded the k9 fund after seeing military dogs shot to death in iraq and afghanistan ( one of whom, he says, saved his life ), asked cooper if he felt how \" intimate \" the dog's bite was. Hatch tells the virginian-pilot cooper responded with a look that seemed to say, \" what the hell is intimate about a dog trying to rip my arm off? \" in the first two days after cooper's cnn segment aired, donations to the nonprofit jumped to more than $ 30,000; typically, it gets just a few hundred dollars a week. \" he's done so much, \" says hatch.",

Scientists have discovered that males grow longer, sharper beaks than females as they age — which they then use to stab each other in the throat during an elaborate mating ritual, according to research carried out by university of connecticut scientists. The study, published in behavioral ecology, looked at costa rica's long-billed hermit. Scientists observed the lek mating ritual, in which as many as 100 male hummingbirds gather around a female until she seems interested in one, at which point he ' ll dance for her; if she likes his jig, they ' ll partake in a mating session that lasts less than five seconds, notes world of hummingbirds. To keep attention on themselves, male birds will wield their beaks, which \" double as deft, dagger-like weapons, \" as the university of connecticut blog puts it; those with longer, sharper beaks were more likely to win. It hasn't been a secret that male and female hummingbird beaks are different, but scientists had long assumed it had something to do with their feeding habits: the guys and the gals feed on different flowers, and researchers figured the males evolved over time with longer beaks to fit the particular flowers they needed for sustenance. Now alejandro rico-guevara, the lead scientist for this study, wonders if the flowers the males feed on are the ones that actually evolved their shape to fit the longer beaks. Either way, rico-guevara gets a kick out of flipping the script on how people perceive hummingbirds: \" i think people initially think of them as beautiful, delicate creatures, but i enjoy revealing their pugnacious attitudes. \" ( want to see a hummingbird up close? strap a feeder to your face. )",

            "Hummingbird behavior hummingbird behavior is quite comical. Why do hummingbirds do what they do? they don't always like to say, but hopefully that questions can be answered here. Society hummingbirds are not very social at all and live very solitary lives, only coming together to mate or grudging share a hummingbird feeder. You will not see a hummingbird flock or migrate in groups. They may swarm a hummingbird feeder to grab a quick snack on their way through town, but they don't fly together. They just like to do their own thing. Hummingbirds divide themselves by territories. Male hummingbirds will aggressively protect their territories. Each territory is chosen based on the abundance of food, nectar, and water. Many male hummingbirds'territories are about the size of a quarter acre. Females will define their territories by the nests they build. Both male and female hummingbirds",

Zeni's hand for fear that it might fall off her body. \" that's what a lawyer for zeni's family alleges occurred at shepherd hills nursing home, where zeni moved in 2010 and died in 2015. Her death was determined to be \" septicemia due to crusted scabies, \" or, as 11alive translates, \" millions of parasitic mites essentially ate her alive over several months or possibly years. \" the cdc explains that scabies is caused by mites burrowing into the skin and laying eggs; the mites can live there for as long as two months. Crusted scabies is a more severe form, but it's treatable. Zeni's family alleges, however, that state health officials never made a visit to the facility following reports of a scabies outbreak at shepherd hills ( they aren't required to by law ), and a forensic pathologist tasked with reviewing zeni's autopsy for 11alive estimated there were hundreds of millions of mites in her body and said the death could possibly be characterized as \" homicide by neglect. \" medical daily explains that many mites could cause an itch so severe that \" non-stop scratching \" can result in sepsis. The nursing home is owned by pruitthealth, which responded to the pending suit against it by denying \" that it is a medical or healthcare provider \" and therefore is not liable. As for zeni, her family says her life had been a dream: the one-time model worked in a naval yard during world war ii and, later, at a chicago tv station.",

Scabies is a skin condition caused by a parasitic mite known as sarcoptes scabiei or the human itch mite.

A family friend tells the washington post that dual citizen siamak namazi, who's based in dubai, was arrested during a visit to tehran earlier this month and is being held on unknown charges. Namazi, an exec at crescent petroleum, is from a prominent iranian family and has been a us citizen since 1993, though tehran does not recognize dual nationality, the post reports. Sources tell the wall street journal that namazi's arrest comes amid a crackdown on iranian businessmen with foreign ties that threaten monopolies held by the revolutionary guards, a powerful branch of iran's military. The crackdown appears to be an attempt to keep foreign companies out of iran following the nuclear deal with western powers, the journal reports. Namazi is at least the fourth iranian-american to be jailed by iranian authorities in recent years — and the first since the nuclear deal was signed in july, reports the new york times.

Earhart and her navigator went missing while on their way from new guinea to howland island in july 1937. The search ran for 16 days and was staffed by nine ships, 66 aircraft, and more than 3,000 sailors and airmen; they found nothing. According to the san gabriel valley tribune, kastner, who enlisted in the military only because he couldn't afford medical school, remembered the search for earhart well and was interviewed for an upcoming book on the pilot prior to his death. His son-in-law told the tribune that kastner was frustrated about the fruitlessness of the search, which was hampered by inclement weather. Kastner served 30 months on the uss lexington before getting married and settling in california, according to his obituary.

The reason? the company extended their battery power with a software maneuver, reports nbc news. The move affected owners of certain base-model teslas. As electrek explains, their cars have batteries capable of 75 kilowatt-hours, but software limits them to 60. The owners of these models, which are no longer sold, can pay thousands of dollars extra to unlock the batteries ' full capacity, but many chose to stick with the lesser version. When tesla got a call from a worried customer, it decided to ramp up all batteries in the evacuation area. While some tesla owners were confused by the sudden change, which expires saturday, the initial response was generally positive. Tesla \" set the example in putting customer safety ahead of profit, \" writes justin bariso at inc. Some, however, were irked to learn that tesla limits the range of vehicles until customers pay up, even though this strategy was communicated to customers. Justin t.

( courtesy of mattel ) for years now, you've heard a familiar refrain about barbie dolls: what kind of message are we sending to girls when the beloved toy comes with body proportions that aren't even realistic for a supermodel? on thursday, mattel announced a major makeover to the doll that is squarely aimed at addressing those concerns. And, to be sure, it's also a bid to boost sales at a pivotal moment for the toymaking giant. Mattel has added three new body types to the line: petite, tall and curvy. The traditional barbie body — with its teeny waist, big bust and outsize head — will remain in the line-up. The company also touted that this year's roster of barbies includes seven skin tones, 22 eye colors and 24 hairstyles, an effort to make the dolls look more diverse. [ new barbie doll honors 'selma'director ava duvernay ] in a video announcing the changes, mattel executives cast the move as an act of progressivism, an acknowledgement that they believe it is simply the right thing to do to have their doll collection better reflect real women. \"this is radical. Because we're saying there isn't this narrow standard of what a beautiful body looks like",

        "summary": "The ex-fiance of modern family actress sofia vergara took to the pages of the new york times today to defend his decision to go to court over the embryos they created together. Florida businessman nick loeb wants custody of the two female embryos, now frozen in a clinic, in order to raise them as his daughters. Vergara, who has a new fiance now, is balking. Here's the nutshell of loeb's argument: \" when we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property? does one person's desire to avoid biological parenthood ( free of any legal obligations ) outweigh another's religious beliefs in the sanctity of life and desire to be a parent? a woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects? \" loeb says he fully intends to have a family of his own in the more traditional manner, \" but that doesn't mean i should let the two lives i have already created be destroyed or sit in a freezer until the end of time. \" given the complex issues involved, including fathers ' rights and whether the embryos have a constitutional right to life, a forbes blog says the case could drag on for years. But at salon, joanna rothkopf thinks that's ridiculous. \" hey nick? \" she writes. \" you can ejaculate literally anywhere. Find another woman as cray-cray as you are to share the sacred duty of parenthood. \" gabrielle bluestone at gawker agrees, writing, \" it's truly hard to tell who deserves more blame in this scenario: \" loeb, for writing the op-ed, \" or the new york times, for publishing it. \"",

To read the article on its face, loeb — desperate to be a dad — would like to implant one of the embryos in a surrogate. But he can't, see, because his ex, a famous actress, won't let him use her eggs now that they've broken up. Weird. In 2013, sofía and i agreed to try to use in vitro fertilization and a surrogate to have children. We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent. The form did not specify — as california law requires — what would happen if we separated. I am asking to have it voided. Still unclear is why the times decided to furnish loeb with a national platform to whine about voluntarily signing a contract that prohibits him from doing exactly what he's trying to do now. It's not even a good argument! he fully admits he agreed to this ahead of time! okay, but maybe there's some sort of legal authority on his side? maybe — if chemo had killed all his sperm. But it didn't. My lawyers have identified 10 other cases in the united states in which a parent tried to have a fertilized, frozen embryo taken to term against the wishes of an opposing parent. In eight of those cases, the parent seeking custody lost. In the other two cases, one in pennsylvania and one inillinois, a woman was awarded custody of fertilized embryos over the man's objections. In both cases, the woman had undergone chemotherapy treatment and the embryos were her last chance to have a biological child; judges ruled that the woman's interest in becoming a parent outweighed the man's interest in not becoming a parent.

But, as the daily beast notes, the times got the idea from stephen colbert. In a late show sketch earlier in the month, colbert asked tom hanks what he would do with a time machine. \" what would anyone do with a time machine? go back in time and hold myself as a baby, \" hanks replied. \" and kill hitler, right? \" asked colbert. \" oh, and kill hitler. Yeah, sure, \" hanks responded. The subsequent \" would you do it? \" question got so much traction that jeb bush recently fielded it and gave an enthusiastic \" hell yeah \" in response. In response to that, colbert circled back to the subject tuesday night on the late show. \" now, i ' m not running for president, but here's what i would do with a time machine: i, too, would travel back to the time of baby hitler. But this is where where me and jeb's time streams start to diverge, because i wouldn't kill young adolf, \" colbert said. \" i would take him from his parents and raise him with love. I would give hitler a safe, supportive home; all the while, i would watch him like a hawk. I wouldn't let him join anything where they have to wear a uniform — no cub scouts, no little league, definitely no marching band. Most importantly, i would teach baby hitler that we do not solve our problems with violence, and then, if he starts getting mouthy as a teenager, i'd stick a knife in his ribs and snap off the handle. And, if that attack fails and the horror of being stabbed by a person he thinks is his father turns him into a monstrous dictator, it's easily fixable: i'd just go back in time and kill baby me.

        "summary": "Late monday, the white house took the unusual step of issuing a preemptive warning against syria, which it claims is preparing to launch a chemical weapons attack. The wall street journal reports the trump administration is basing that assertion on evidence from the same air base that the us hit with cruise missiles in april following syria's last chemical weapons attack. A pentagon spokesperson says evidence at the shayrat air base of a pending chemical weapons attack has become \" more compelling \" in the past 24 hours. Here's what else you need to know: the syrian minister for national reconciliation says the syrian government has no plans to use chemical weapons, which it says it doesn't have anyway, and accuses the us of trying to start a \" diplomatic battle \" against syria at the un, the new york times reports. Syria wasn't alone in denying the trump administration's accusations. According to reuters, russia says the us claims are both wrong and \" unacceptable. \" and iran's foreign minister says the white house's warning is a \" dangerous escalation \" based on a \" fake pretext \" that will only help the islamic state, the ap reports. The new republic argues the us could be \" stumbling into a deeper war in syria. \" with isis nearly defeated in the country, the forces that have been fighting against it will soon turn their attention to fighting for power. Jim mattis says that won't be happening, stars and stripes reports. The secretary of defense says the us will \" avoid mission creep \" by making sure it stays focused and keeps \" moving against isis. \" citing an inside source, the daily beast reports secretary of state rex tillerson issued his own warning to russian minister of foreign affairs sergey lavrov hours before the white house issued its statement. It also reports president trump was minimally involved with the decision to issue the warning, though both jared kushner and steve bannon were consulted. Finally, afp tweets that french president emmanuel macron will join trump in a \" joint response \" if syria carries out another chemical weapons attack.",

Jones leaked audio of his conversations with kelly days before the broadcast. A roundup of coverage: jones failed to provide a straight answer when kelly, who said she would deal with his \" notorious lie, \" pressed him on his sandy hook claims, the ap reports. He claimed to have been playing \" devil's advocate \" when he said the shootings were faked, but also said there was \" cover-up and manipulation \" surrounding the massacre and some of the footage \" looks like a drill. \" the light that kelly promised to shine on jones turned out to be a \" dim bulb at best, \" according to lorraine ali at the los angeles times. She says kelly asked tough questions but failed to push for answers, noting that when kelly asked jones about his claim that the people killed in the concert attack in manchester last month were \" liberal trendies, \" jones delivered a \" senseless word salad of an answer \" that kelly failed to follow up. Jack shafer at politico disagrees, saying kelly gave jones a \" pantsing, \" taking him apart in a \" textbook manner. \" \" short of waterboarding him, i don't know what more kelly could have done to expose jones'dark methods, \" he writes, adding that despite outrage over the interview, dealing straight-on with people like jones is more effective than pretending he doesn't exist. Kelly was \" out of her league \" in the interview, according to don kaplan at the new york daily news. \" sure, she looked tough as she grilled jones, but kelly delivered no news, \" he writes. \" she did not move the story of this monster forward, nor provide anything aside from a shallow profile of a frightening, sweaty, tin-foil-hat-wearing nutjob. \" the interview \" fell flat, \" but it wasn't a disaster and jones didn't run rings around kelly the way some feared he might, maya kosoff writes at vanity fair. \" whether the interview was worth nbc's week of grief is another question, \" she adds.",

Blue sphere inc., a california clothing company, says it has had \" lucky 13 \" trademarked for 20 years — it uses it on its line of vintage-themed gear — but in 2012, swift started putting the phrase on her official merchandise. Now blue sphere is suing the singer for trademark infringement, afp reports. It wants punitive damages, recovery of lost profits, and legal fees — and for swift to be banned from using the term on her merch. Swift says 13, which appears on everything from the fuselage of her private jet to her twitter handle, is her lucky number. \" i paint this on my hand before every show, \" she told mtv in 2009. \" basically, whenever a 13 comes up in my life, it's a good thing. \" an interesting tidbit from the lawsuit picked up by tmz: lucky 13 owner robert kloetzly points out that swift's \" i knew you were trouble \" video \" depicts stylish, attractive, tattooed individuals in provocative situations, \" which is basically the same demographic he targets — meaning her selling \" lucky 13 \" merch could confuse the market.",

        "summary": "Federal prosecutors have made it clear to the girlfriend of crime boss whitey bulger that she has a choice: start talking, or rot in prison. Catherine greig, the mobster's companion during his 16 years on the run, is already serving eight years for assisting him and she has now been indicted for criminal contempt, which could keep the 64-year-old behind bars indefinitely, the boston globe reports. A judge has ordered her to provide information about others who may have helped bulger between 1996 and his arrest in 2011, a period bulger describes as a \" 16-year honeymoon, \" cnn reports. Greig's twin sister tells the globe that catherine \" knows nothing, \" and there \" is no reason for her to talk to anybody because she doesn't know anything. \" she says it is \" nuts \" that some other bulger associates — including a man who got 12 years for 20 murders under a plea deal — may get out of prison before her sister, who's in prison for \" being with someone she loved. \" prosecutors, however, say she needs to face \" substantial consequences \" for failing to comply with the judge's order to testify. Bulger is serving life for various crimes, including 11 murders. ( critics say johnny depp makes a great whitey bulger in black mass. )",

Little sammy is actually one of several children in krainman's embryo adoption group with that nickname. \" we sometimes lovingly call our frozen embryos snowflakes, \" she says. \" it fits them perfectly! each is a tiny, delicate, frozen being, and no two are exactly alike. \" krainman, 33, and her 37-year-old husband kevin — residents of austin, texas — sat down with people to explain why they chose to adopt an embryo that had been created by another couple's ivf cycle and frozen in a storage facility. The process costs about $ 3,500 to $ 12,000 per try, they say: why not adopt the old-fashioned way? \" i believe life begins at conception, \" she says. \" therefore, these embryos are life \" and deserve to \" be loved just as any child deserves. \" what's more, wait times for regular adoptions can drag on, and even successful adoptive parents never get the chance to experience pregnancy. \" i would feel my baby kick, go on late night ice cream runs, and watch my wife give birth to our child, \" says kevin of krainman's pregnancy. What about those who say it goes against god? \" i very much disagree with this, \" says krainman. \" man may put the pieces of science together to form an embryo and to freeze it, but god puts the life and soul into these babies. \" what will they tell sammy? \" as sammy gets older, we will openly answer questions about it, \" she says. \" we don't want it to be a secret. Secrets imply shame and her origins are anything but shameful. \" and krainman isn't alone: another happy mom-to-be writes in the new york times about adopting an embryo, and a couple tells cbs news about their satisfaction with the process: \" you feel like you are adopting babies — [ the embryos ] are yours now, \" the mom says. \" i knew that they were alive going into me. \" ( click to read about a woman who was accidentally impregnated with another couple's embryos. )",

        "summary": "For a long time, scholars have thought that the aztecs had frequent contact with groups in what's now the american southwest. But a new chemical analysis of ancient turquoise artifacts just put a giant hole in that theory. It now appears that the aztecs and another mesoamerican civilization known as the mixtecs mined their own turquoise, rather than trading for it with northerners, reports ars technica. Both civilizations, which lived in what's now central mexico to central america, used turquoise extensively in their cultures, explains a post at phys.org. But because archaeologists have never found turquoise mines in the region, scientists had long concluded that the mineral must have come from the us southwest. In the study in science advances, however, a team at dickinson college says its analysis shows that the turquoise instead comes from mesoamerica. \" i saw the number pop up and i ' m pretty sure i did a dance around the lab, \" geochemist alyson thibodeau tells the new york times. \" not only do they have isotopic signatures that are absolutely consistent with the geology of mesoamerica, but they are completely different from the isotopic signatures of the southwestern turquoise deposits and artifacts that we have seen so far. \" the finding goes beyond where the groups got their gemstones — it calls into question the larger idea that the aztecs and mixtecs were regularly trading and otherwise in contact with cultures in the us southwest before they were conquered in the 1500s. How to explain the lack of mines? just because we haven't found them doesn't mean they didn't exist, says thibodeau. ( another centuries-old aztec mystery appears to have been solved earlier this year. )",

White women are more likely than ethnic minorities to remain childless, though the gap is rapidly narrowing, the ap reports: childlessness among hispanics and african-americans grew three times faster than childlessness among whites in the 1990s. The researchers say social pressure to have children has eased and remaining childless is now seen as an individual choice. And while better-educated women are less likely to have children, the study found that women with a master's degree or higher are likelier to have children now than they were in the early ' 90s ( 24 % of women age 40-44 were childless in 2008, compared to 31 % in 1994 ).

Nadezhda popova, who died in moscow on july 8 at age 91, can claim 852 of the 30,000 missions the women flew in a 4-year span. ( pri's the world shares this amazing counterpoint: us bomber pilots were generally \" rotated out \" of combat after completing 25 missions. ) during that time the \" night witches \" unleashed 23,000 tons of bombs on the nazis, helping push them out of russia. They got their name from the germans, who likened what the new york times calls the \" whooshing \" of their planes to the sound a witch's broomstick might make; the washington post explains they killed their engines right before unloading their bombs to up the surprise factor. And they were good at what they did, so much so that germans spewed rumors that the women relied on pills and injections that gave them cat-like night vision. Popova, who became a \" night witch \" at age 19, was shot down a number of times and, on one occasion, ended up meeting her future husband amid the retreating troops she joined. Said popova in 2010, \" i can still imagine myself as a young girl, up there in my little bomber. And i ask myself, ' nadia, how did you do it? ' \" ( click for another fascinating obituary. )",

He seemed perfect for the job. Alexander was a decorated army intelligence officer and a west point graduate with master's degrees in systems technology and physics. He had run intelligence operations in combat and had held successive senior-level positions, most recently as the director of an army intelligence organization and then as the service's overall chief of intelligence. He was both a soldier and a spy, and he had the heart of a tech geek. Many of his peers thought alexander would make a perfect nsa director. But one prominent person thought otherwise: the prior occupant of that office. Air force gen. Michael hayden had been running the nsa since 1999, through the 9/11 terrorist attacks and into a new era that found the global eavesdropping agency increasingly focused on americans ' communications inside the united states. At times, hayden had found himself swimming in the murkiest depths of the law, overseeing programs that other senior officials in government thought violated the constitution. Now hayden of all people was worried that alexander didn't understand the legal sensitivities of that new mission. \" alexander tended to be a bit of a cowboy: ' let's not worry",

Teva pharmaceuticals'treanda, used to treat leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma, comes in four separate dosage packages, so only 1 % of the drug is typically thrown away. But with 18 of the top 20 cancer drugs sold in only one or two vial sizes, roughly 10 % of the cancer drugs hospitals and doctors buy go to waste, researchers at memorial sloan kettering cancer center report this week in the journal bmj. This means that medicare, private health insurers, and cancer patients alike spend nearly $ 3 billion every year buying drugs that nurses and doctors throw away because of what marketplace calls \" bad packaging \" — where a single vial can hold sometimes more than twice as much drug as a patient has been prescribed. \" drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it, \" co-author dr. Peter bach tells the new york times. \" if we're ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut. \" the problem isn't limited to cancer drugs either, with, as one example, johnson &amp; johnson's remicade for arthritis generating $ 500 million a year in waste. But the study focused on cancer drugs and found that in more tightly-regulated european countries drugs must be sold in differently-sized vials. Co-author dr. Leonard saltz first noticed the waste when he realized the drug keytruda was only sold in 50-milligram vials. \" i thought that was really cynical — and then it got worse, \" he says. Last year merck moved to 100-milligram vials only; it still sells 50-milligram vials in europe. ( a former medicare boss said up to a third of health care spending helps no one. )",

When it was about 100 miles above a remote part of siberia. \" the ship was carrying more than 2 1/2 tons of supplies — including food, fuel and clothes.

More than 150 years later, the fbi is overseeing a dig in a pennsylvania state forest where the famous loot might be buried, reports the ap. The dig is taking place at dents run, about 135 miles northeast of pittsburgh, though no parties involved — the fbi, the state, or the treasure-hunting group finders keepers — are saying much. \" i ' m sorry, but as of right now all we're allowed to say is ' no comment, ' \" a group member tells the washington post. \" we ' ll keep you in mind when/if anything changes. \" finders keepers has long insisted that the gold is there, as detailed in this older post on its website, but it says skeptical state officials have never authorized a dig. That apparently changed last week as the excavation got underway. Various accounts say the union wagon train was carrying 26 or 52 gold bars, which would be worth $ 27 million or $ 55 million, respectively, today. The philadelphia inquirer notes that a civil war sergeant supposedly claimed that he was the lone survivor of an ambush on the wagon train, and the dig site is about 9 miles from where he said the ambush took place. Historians have been skeptical about the story over the years, but finders keepers says it has found artifacts at the site suggesting union soldiers were there. The group also says metal detectors suggest something is buried there. Whether the lost gold is a tall tale or a genuine treasure should be known soon. ( elsewhere, a fortune in gold might be buried in the bay area of california. )",

The guardian notes trump had the reins, speaking more than double the roughly 50 times pence did over the course of 21 minutes — and interrupting him plenty, which didn't go unnoticed on social media. What's being said: at the guardian, bonnie malkin flags \" one of the more bizarre parts of the interview \": when lesley stahl pointed out pence voted for the iraq war. \" i don't care, \" said trump. Stahl pushed trump on the point, and he said pence is \" entitled to mistake every once in a while. \" but as for hillary clinton, who voted the same, \" she's not. \" candace smith of abc news saw pence as seeming \" to preview his own role as a trump-interpreter of sorts — a measured, experienced politician who can frame trump's more controversial views and mold them to be more palatable for a wary audience. \" she provides an example: trump went after nafta, which pence is in favor of. Pence stepped in: \" what i hear donald trump saying is let's... Look at these trade agreements and reconsider them and renegotiate them. \" jenna johnson analyzes trump's habit of interrupting in a washington post piece that outlines four times trump jumped in to finish a sentence for pence. In one instance, trump described how the two have \" very, very good chemistry. \" \" in the interview, it was clear that the two have big differences in policy, but pence was more willing to paper over them, \" observes pamela kruger at fortune. One example: pence previously called trump's proposed temporary muslim immigration ban \" offensive, \" but took a supportive stance in the interview. At politico, matthew nussbaum cites that very exchange as an example of how pence \" demonstrated a willingness to massage past positions so that they better conform with trump's. \"",

Though they've established the evolution, the study's lead author tells usa today that \" it's difficult to say what drove the change. \" the first triceratops skeleton was found in 1887, reports cnn, and was at first thought to be that of a ( presumably very large ) buffalo.

A half-million years before their extinction, they roamed the earth in great numbers, reports upi, which points out that our understanding of the triceratops has been greatly boosted by the fact that so many fossils of the creature can be found in the hell creek formation. \" we went out and looked at where the fossils came from in context of the rock formation, \" the lead author explains. \" the ones found low in the formation look different from the ones found high up. \" ( click to read about how one relative of triceratops had wings on its head. )",

That drone should not have been there, \" canadian transport minister marc garneau said, per the cbc. The incident took place as a skyjet aircraft started its approach to jean lesage international airport. The collision caused only minor damage to the plane, which the post says was carrying six passengers and two crew members, and didn't cause any injuries. But garneau says that if the drone had hit the plane's engine or cockpit, the result could have been \" catastrophic \" — especially since the pilot was getting ready to land, a particularly vulnerable time during a flight. The drone was flying at about 1,500 feet when it hit the plane — far higher than the 300 feet allowed by transport canada's drone rules, which also notes drones must be flown at least 3.4 miles away from airports with departing and landing planes ( the collision took place about 1.9 miles from the airport, per ctv news ). Garneau notes in a statement that transport canada has received nearly 1,600 reports of drone incidents in 2017, with 131 of those \" of aviation safety concern. \" there are interim safety measures on drone usage in place in canada, which will be finalized in 2018. Violating these rules could bring offenders jail time and a fine of up to $ 25,000. \" i would like to remind drone operators that endangering the safety of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and a serious offense, \" garneau says in his statement, adding he's \" extremely relieved \" this incident wasn't as bad as it could've been.",

Npr reports that cardiologist and professor euan ashley responded to his tech-savvy patients ' frequent requests to analyze their wristband data by conducting a study to test the wristbands ' accuracy. He took a look at seven of the most popular fitness tracker models with his colleagues at stanford and compared two metrics, heart rate and calorie burning statistics, with the medical tests doctors utilize. While the heart rate data measured up well to ekg tests ( with most devices being only about 5 % off ), calorie trackers were nowhere near accurate. Compared to indirect calorimetry, a highly sophisticated method of tracking metabolism used in doctor's offices, wristband tracking outputs for calories burned were anywhere from more than 20 % to 93 % inaccurate. And professor of preventative medicine dr. Tim church believes relying on this wristband data can do more harm than good: \" it's just human nature. People are checking these inaccurate counts and they think they've earned a muffin or earned some ice cream and they're sabotaging their weight-loss program. \" the guardian reports that the device with the most inaccurate calorie tracker was pulseon ( getting it wrong 93 % of the time ), while fitbit surge performed the best, but was still off by 27 %.

Outside a brussels court hearing surrounded by extremely heavy security thursday, abdeslam's lawyer said his client had changed his mind about fighting extradition and wants to get out of belgium as soon as possible so he can \" explain himself \" in france, the telegraph reports. Lawyer sven mary — who closed his offices after being attacked last night, per the guardian — says abdeslam has not been cooperating with authorities investigating the brussels attacks and has said he didn't know about them. In other coverage: according to belgian media, suspected paris bomb-maker najim laachraoui, initially thought to have been on the run, was a third suicide bomber. Authorities are still hunting a suspected airport attacker seen in a white jacket and a possible fifth suspect filmed walking with a suicide bomber before the brussels metro attack, the ap reports. The attacks killed at least 31 people and injured hundreds more, but authorities have discovered they could have been even worse, the new york times reports. A suicide belt and two large, undetonated bombs packed with nails were found at the airport. Two more bombs were found at an address from which two suspected attackers took a taxi the morning of the attacks. The financial times reports that authorities in belgium and the netherlands are struggling to explain why ibrahim el bakraoui was not being monitored. On wednesday, turkey said both countries were warned that el bakraoui, who was deported to the netherlands after being arrested at the syrian border, was a dangerous extremist. The washington post takes a closer look at the background of both el bakraoui brothers and finds that they were violent thugs long before they were radicals — just like many others in the latest wave of extremist recruits. The bbc reports on the emerging stories of the dead, injured, and missing from the attacks. The missing include at least four americans.",

While some key details remain unclear, this much is known: police stopped mouhcine fikri and two companions in a vehicle on friday with about $ 11,000 worth of illegal swordfish, a protected species in the country, reports the guardian. Officers summoned a trash compactor to the scene to destroy the fish, and grainy cellphone video shot by a witness shows fikri and his two friends in the back of the truck trying to salvage their fish. At that point, the compactor starts up, and while his two friends managed to jump to safety, fikri ended up crushed to death. Large protests took place over the weekend and on monday, and protesters vow to continue until those responsible are held accountable, reports al jazeera. King mohammed vi has demanded an investigation, and given that the arab spring protests in 2010 started over the death of a fruit vendor, the moroccan protests have become what the new york times calls a \" volatile and potent symbol. \" hashtags such as \" grind the people \" are trending on social media, and rumors are flying: local media reports say one witness heard an officer order the compactor started in order to scare away people beginning to gather around the truck, but the exact circumstances of who started it up and why remain unclear.",

        "summary": "After a complaint from us aviation giant boeing, the department of commerce has proposed slapping a 219 % tariff on the import of c-series jets from canadian-owned bombardier. The move — which still needs approval from the us international trade commission — would be in keeping with president trump's goal of promoting us business. But it also \" threatens to spark a trade war involving the us, canada and the uk, \" reports the financial times. Already, canada and the uk — where bombardier employs 4,000 people at a factory in northern ireland, per the telegraph — have hinted at a boeing boycott. More: boeing's complaint: it argues unfair subsidies from canada and the uk allowed bombardier to sell its c-series jets at below cost in the us, leading to a $ 5.6 billion contract with delta. Bombardier says the complaint is \" absurd \" given that boeing didn't even bid for the contract. Bombardier should be scared: the tariff could sink the delta deal, which represents 20 % of c-series sales so far, and keep the c-series jets out of the world's largest aircraft market. That's especially bad news for bombardier as it's facing more than $ 7 billion in debt and increased competition from germany's siemens ag, per reuters. Nothing personal: boeing argues \" this dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition \" and \" everything to do with maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements. \" er, maybe not: bombardier's c-series regional airliners with fuel-efficient engines will concern both boeing and airbus as they present \" a threat to their duopoly in short-haul passenger jets, \" reports ft. Uk involvement: arguing the tariff undermines britain's relationship with boeing, british prime minister theresa may has blasted \" protectionism creeping in around the world \" despite it being one of the world's \" failed ideologies, \" per the guardian. May will feel the pressure: she wants a free trade deal with the us after brexit, but \" a prime minister betting our economic future on a deregulated trade deal with the us might want to explain how 220 % tariffs are going to boost our exports, \" says labour leader jeremy corbyn.

The moviemakers want more money. In the past, pixar seemed to be different. They resisted sequels, except for the ever-inventive \"toy story \" franchise.

            "' cars 2 ' movie review: it should be obvious — although it shouldn't have to be immutable — that studios and audiences look for different things in sequels. Fans want familiar characters returning in different circumstances. They want favorite catchphrases revived, old jokes given a new twist and maybe a long-standing conflict resolved. The moviemakers want more money. In the past, pixar seemed to be different. They resisted sequels, except for the ever-inventive \"toy story \" franchise. They were the people for whom \"good enough \" rarely seemed to be. Compared with \"finding nemo \" or \"up, \" the first \"cars, \" released in 2006, was an only-average effort. It became, however, the company's biggest merchandise-mover ever. And in the family-film business, isn't selling toys what it's all about? well, it never seemed to be the first thing on pixar's mind, but it's hard to come up with any other reason to make \"cars 2. \" as in the first film, we're in an alternate, auto-driven world where there are no people — just anthropomorphic machines, racing around with big eyes and shiny grins. ( the character designs remain, for pixar, uncomfortably cutesy and broad. ) and, once again, our supposed hero is race car",

He was behind the wheel of a budget box truck whose contents could land him in prison for up to five years: more than 10,000 aluminum cans. The guardian reports that just as seinfeld's kramer and newman once had the bright idea to drive recycled bottles and cans from new york to michigan to cash in on the state's higher bottle deposit, everidge was allegedly making a kentucky-to-michigan run to do something similar. At 10 cents a pop, everidge stood to get $ 1,000 in michigan versus $ 0 in kentucky, which has no bottle deposit; instead, he faces a $ 5,000 fine and prison time for the felony charge, which is specific to those attempting to return more than 10,000 cans, reports the livingston county daily press &amp; argus. Officer clifford lyden, who stopped everidge on april 27, testified on thursday that the michigan man told him the cans were from lexington, ky; and that he didn't pay the deposit on them. ( the deposit cost is simply added to the price of the beverage when purchased. ) but everidge's defense argues that because he was pulled over for speeding, he was merely attempting to attempt to return the bottles, and thus \" caught too early, \" with the charge of \" beverage return of nonrefundable bottles \" not actually applying. Livingston county district judge suzanne geddis determined his case will go to trial. One michigan law professor says everidge is unlikely to do time given the $ 35,000 annual price tag to imprison someone. Michigan's bottle bill mandates a refund higher than any other state, reports the bottle bill resource guide, and the state boasts the highest redemption rate as well: 94.2 % in 2014.",

        "summary": "Britain has voted to leave the european union, but any such split is still years away. Here's a look at what happens next: thursday's vote isn't legally binding, meaning britain must still formally notify the eu of its intention to leave. To do so, it would invoke the never-before-used article 50 of the eu treaty, which in turn sets off a two-year period of negotiations over the exit, explains cnn. But when that two-year clock starts ticking is still unclear. In theory, outgoing prime minister david cameron could inform the eu at a meeting as early as next week. But cameron said friday he thinks it makes more sense for his successor to do so, notes the new york times. That would push back the notification at least a few months. Even after the clock starts ticking, the exit won't necessarily be figured out within two years. A quote from the bbc: \" it's not possible to predict exactly how long it would take, but comparable international trade deals have taken on average between four and nine years. \" the telegraph: \" untying britain from the old membership is the easy bit. Harder would be agreeing [ on ] a new trading relationship, establishing what tariffs and other barriers to entry are permitted, and agreeing on obligations such as free movement.

And there's this: because thursday's vote isn't legally binding, \" there are a few ways it could theoretically be blocked or overturned, \" notes vox.

Researchers from wake forest baptist medical center found that people with less gray matter in certain areas of the brain perceive pain more intensely. The findings might help lead to better ways to diagnose, treat and even prevent pain, they said. Gray matter in the brain processes information, while white matter coordinates communications between different regions of the brain. \"these kinds of structural differences can provide a foundation for the development of better tools for the diagnosis, classification, treatment and even prevention of pain, \" study senior author robert coghill said in a wake forest news release. For the study, which was published online recently in the journal pain, the researchers assessed pain sensitivity in 116 healthy volunteers. They asked the participants to rate the intensity of pain when a small area of skin on their arm or leg was heated to 120 degrees fahrenheit. After this pain test, the participants underwent mri scans to examine their brain structure. People who reported greater pain had less gray matter in brain regions involved in internal thoughts and attention control, the study found. These regions include the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and areas of the posterior parietal cortex. The posterior",

        "summary": "Cows are notorious methane gas producers, belching somewhere between 132 and 264 gallons of gas produced by food fermenting in the rumen ( one of the four parts of their stomachs ) every day. As the washington post reports, that's so significant that ruminant animals — including sheep and goats — actually contribute a quarter of the country's total methane emissions, which is a top greenhouse gas. So the dutch life sciences and materials company dsm has partnered with penn state to develop a powder to add to cow feed that it reports in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences produces a 30 % reduction in methane emissions. Dsm says it's achieved this without harming the animal, its performance ( i.e., milk production ), or how much food it eats. Here's how it works. By feeding 3-nitrooxypropanol ( a small molecule referred to as 3nop ) to dairy cows, it inhibits an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme m reductase that's used by cow gut bacteria to digest grass but produces methane in the process, reports scientific american. It's not the first to help reduce this methane production, but it's the first that appears safe for the animal and the environment. It also helps the cows gain weight, since 7 % of the energy in their food goes toward methane alone. Whether this weight gain improves milk production needs further study.

If adopted, this mitigation practice could lead to a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the ruminant livestock sector. Abstract a quarter of all anthropogenic methane emissions in the united states are from enteric fermentation, primarily from ruminant livestock. This study was undertaken to test the effect of a methane inhibitor,",
            "Know what really stinks? the gas that livestock such as cattle release during digestion. These animals produce a quarter of the anthropogenic methane in the u.s. What doesn't stink is that pennsylvania state university researchers, led by alexander n. Hristrov, have now demonstrated that feeding 3-nitrooxypropanol ( 3nop ) to dairy cows over a 12-week period reduces the animals ' methane emissions by 30 % ( proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Usa2015, doi: 1073/pnas.1504124112 ). 3nop inhibits methyl coenzyme-m reductase, an enzyme used by bacteria in a cow's gut. These symbiotic bacteria produce methane when they help cows digest grass and other fiber-rich foods in the animals'diet. To test the possibility of mitigating this production without disrupting a cow's digestion, hristov and his colleagues mixed additives containing three different concentrations of 3nop as well as a placebo additive into cattle feed.

        "summary": "For more than 50 years, scientists from across the globe have been painstakingly mapping both poles, trying to get an accurate sense of the rock hidden beneath the ice sheets. Now, thanks to satellite data from multiple organizations and \" serendipitous reconnaissance radio-echo sounding data \" over the canyons of antarctica, scientists report in the journal geology that a canyon system lurks beneath the ice in a largely unexplored region of eastern antarctica, and it's so massive it appears to dwarf the grand canyon. A year ago some of the same scientists announced the discovery of another giant chasm beneath the ice in western antarctica, the ellsworth trough, which is 200 miles long and in some places nearly 2 miles deep. The latest finding is in an almost completely unknown region of antarctica called princess elizabeth land — \" in fact, the bed of antarctica is less well known than the surface of mars, \" lead researcher dr. Stewart jamieson says in a press release. Along with the recovery basin, the two regions have been dubbed the \" poles of ignorance. \" this latest survey was prompted by satellite imaging that, \" because the ice is flowing over that landscape, \" as one researcher tells the bbc, hinted at the grand topography beneath. Though it still needs to be confirmed, this canyon system looks to be more than 600 miles long and as deep as half a mile in places. ( the grand canyon, by comparison, is 277 miles long and up to a mile deep. ) the canyons appear to connect to a subglacial lake that's nearly 800 square miles in area, which is 80 times the size of the largest lake in england.

            "Abstract the subglacial landscape of princess elizabeth land ( pel ) in east antarctica is poorly known due to a paucity of ice thickness measurements. This is problematic given its importance for understanding ice sheet dynamics and landscape and climate evolution. To address this issue, we describe the topography beneath the ice sheet by assuming that ice surface expressions in satellite imagery relate to large-scale subglacial features. We find evidence that a large, previously undiscovered subglacial drainage network is hidden beneath the ice sheet in pel. We interpret a discrete feature that is 140 × 20 km in plan form, and multiple narrow sinuous features that extend over a distance of ∼1100 km. We hypothesize that these are tectonically controlled and relate to a large subglacial basin containing a deep-water lake in the interior of pel linked to a series of long, deep canyons. The presence of 1-km-deep canyons is confirmed at a few localities by radio-echo sounding data, and drainage analysis suggests that these canyons will direct subglacial meltwater to the coast between the vestfold hills and the west ice shelf.",

The canyon system is made up of a chain of winding and linear features buried under several kilometres of ice in one of the last unexplored regions of the earth's land surface: princess elizabeth land ( pel ) in east antarctica.

Although not visible to the naked eye, the subglacial landscape can be identified in the surface of the ice sheet. Faint traces of the canyons were observed using satellite imagery and small sections of the canyons were then found using radio-echo sounding data, whereby radio waves are sent through the ice to map the shape of the rock beneath it.

The rules would also prohibit drilling in state parks and on other public land, and establish what the dec called strict rules for drilling in all other areas.

Investigators from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, a nobel peace prize-winning group, said the nerve agent was \" of high purity. \" britain says that means only a state with a sophisticated laboratory could have manufactured it. The watchdog's report does not say who was responsible for the attack, since that was outside the scope of its mission. The opcw's job was to identify the poison, not to trace its origins or assign blame. Britain blames russia for the march 4 poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in the english city of salisbury, per the ap. ( yulia is out of the hospital. ) \" there can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible — only russia has the means, motive and record, \" said uk foreign secretary boris johnson thursday, per rt. Russia denies involvement, calling the new report \" propaganda. \" britain has called for an opcw meeting next week to discuss the results of the organization's report. In a published summary of its findings, the opcw did not name novichok, the type of nerve agent previously cited by british prime minister theresa may. But it confirmed \" the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical that was used in salisbury. \" it said the name and structure of the toxin were included in the full classified report, distributed to 192 member states of the organization. The novichok class of nerve agents was developed in the soviet union.",
