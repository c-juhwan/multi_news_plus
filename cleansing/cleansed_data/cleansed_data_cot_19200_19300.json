        "summary": "This week, the supreme court is considering whether obamacare can require corporations to offer coverage for contraception. Companies like hobby lobby say that mandate violates their right to religious freedom, a claim that has some pundits raising their eyebrows: corporations don't seem too worried about religious values when they consider employee wages or robo-sign foreclosures, writes sally kohn in the daily beast. With the hobby lobby suit, \" corporate america is trying to use religion to achieve new heights of greed and corruption, \" seeking to end any limits to their power. And consider the possible fallout from the case: could corporations use religious beliefs to, for instance, refuse to hire gay people or women who are unmarried and pregnant? hobby lobby argues that \" corporations are entitled to the same religious freedom protections as people, \" write professors naomi lamoreaux and william novak at slate, who have written an amicus brief in the case. In fact, throughout most of american history, \" the corporation was seen as a special and artificial creature of the government. It has never been seen as entitled to the same array of rights guaranteed to citizens. \" the editorial board of the los angeles times points out that \" business corporations are legal entities distinct from the individuals who create them, \" regardless of those individuals'religious beliefs. What's more, the mandate isn't a \" substantial burden \": it \" doesn't require an employer to do anything more than make it possible for a female employee to decide for herself whether to use contraceptives. \" but in the new york post, rich lowry disagrees. \" everyone recognizes that nonprofit corporations have such rights ( to exercise religious freedom ), so what makes for-profit corporations different? \" he asks. \" the truth is that the obama administration wants to bring hobby lobby to heel as a matter of principle. In its pinched view of religion, faith should be limited as much as possible to the pews. \"",

In a well-documented and characteristically fact-laden opinion, brandeis chastised his contemporaries for acting \"as if the privilege of doing business in corporate form were inherent in the citizen. \" such a deferential view, he argued, understated the power of a democracy to hold corporations accountable and encouraged public apathy toward corporate abuses as an \"inescapable price of civilized life...

        "summary": "The rancho feeding corp. Beef recall just potentially got even more disgusting: the federal government is investigating the slaughterhouse for allegedly buying cows with eye cancer — and chopping off their heads so the disease couldn't be detected by inspectors, sources tell the san francisco chronicle. \" because the carcass looked good, ( rancho ) mixed it back in with other beef that it sold under its label, \" a source says. And there's no way rancho would have missed the disease, a cattleman who has worked with rancho for 40 years and saw all his 2013 beef caught up in the recall tells the village voice: \" it's a growth on the eye, this is not a microbial situation. \" the good news, if you want to call it that, is that though such a practice is illegal, experts say eating the meat in question probably won't make you sick, and no recall-related illnesses have been reported. Investigators got their first whiff of the problem in january, when rancho separately recalled more than 40,000 pounds of meat that had not been properly inspected; at that time, investigators reportedly found two infected cattle heads. Private cattle producers who used rancho for custom slaughtering have found themselves caught up in the recall, despite the fact that they produce what the chronicle refers to as \" local, natural, and high-end beef. \" the usda wants to be certain none of the tainted meat somehow mixed with the healthy meat, and says a team will meet with producers who can prove their beef was kept separate; they might get \" relief \" from the recall.",

His current defense team is appealing the sentence partly on the claim that he had an ineffective legal team, the daily journal reports. Prosecutors want to question lindecrantz about her work on the case; as the colorado independent explains, she is a veteran investigator and prosecutors hope her testimony will prove ray's team was competent, thus upholding the death sentence. Since ray's life hinges on the appeal and mennonites oppose violence in any form, she has refused. \" i can't answer your question, \" lindecrantz said more than 70 times as she was questioned monday in a courtroom packed with fellow mennonites supporting her. Arapahoe district judge michelle amico ordered her to answer the questions, leading a teary lindecrantz to reply, \" i'd have no problem saying the truth if death wasn't on the line. I don't believe in killing fellow human beings or participating in that. \" as she sobbed while explaining her religious views and why, as the primary breadwinner for her household, being sent to jail would be devastating, amico said that while the decision was \" excruciatingly difficult, \" lindecrantz must be held in contempt of court, without bail.

            "Facebook changes were critical - future mark zuckerberg says so andy ihnatko ai@andyi.com facebook ceo mark zuckerberg smiles during an announcement at facebook headquarters in palo alto, calif., wednesday, july 6, 2011. ( ap photo/paul sakuma ) updated: it's exciting, and unusual, when a company promises a major announcement and keeps its word. Back in july, facebook announced that they were enhancing their chat services by adding support for skype. You can define that as simply \"the next feature. \" on thursday, they announced something bigger and broader. What's coming up isn't merely facebook's newest features but instead is facebook's whole next step as a service and as a company. They're undertaking two ambitious and fundamental thematic shifts. To users, facebook will no longer be a bench by the side of a river where they sit and watch",

Not just through the camera at the top of our laptop screen, but through the new social wonderful facebook apps that promise us everything from music to video to spotification, which sounds like a horrible medieval disease — as long as we are willing to share them with everyone. I hate the verb \"share. \" i find that \"sharing \" is too often synonymous with \"telling people something they were really better off not knowing. \" and thanks to facebook's innovations, we will be sharing all the time. Everything we read. Everything we watch",

Facebook's f8 expo was as all-singing - with spotify - and all-dancing - with hulu - as we could've hoped, but at its core it was all about me. Timeline may be the natural evolution of each user's profile page, but it's also the perfect stage for our self-obsessed times. Don't just tell people where you are now, but let them scroll back through the years to see how you got there. The concept is enticingly straightforward. You already upload galleries of your adventures, and updates about what you've eaten, where you ate it and who you were sharing ketchup with, and the minutiae of your lovelife. Why not go one step further and make that into an interactive timeline, a permanent record of your past - fleshed"

Kevin mccarthy ( r-calif. ) largely attributed the gop wipeout to historical trends while also repeatedly blaming spending by former new york mayor michael bloomberg as the cause of several republican defeats in close contests. Story continued below and rather than offer any conciliatory words to democratic leaders, mccarthy and his newly appointed leadership team said they intend to retake the house in 2020"

After discovering the poisonous materials, police widened their investigation to include 21 employees of the company who have died since 2000, and may exhume those bodies. Although the deaths were attributed to natural causes at the time, according to cbs, police say they included a \" remarkably high number of heart attacks and cancers \" and could have been caused by heavy metal poisoning.

After the archbishop told the congregation that the blood had changed consistency, showing the saint's love for naples and the pontiff, francis said, \" we can see the saint only half loves us.

Despite the difficulties, the couple's friends say nikki's journey is inspiring them. \" you just have a renewed faith that everything is going to be fine, \" one friend tells wfaa. \" she's going to get back to being her old self, you can already tell nothing's going to stop her.

Hillary clinton mentioned that it was ruled unconstitutional, but donald trump insisted that it wasn't.

It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal, \" he said. But that's not entirely accurate.

            "During monday night's presidential debate, the concept of stop and frisk came up. The practice, once used by police as a method of searching people without arresting them ( which would require probable cause ), was highly controversial. Hillary clinton mentioned that it was ruled unconstitutional, but donald trump insisted that it wasn't. In fact, he cut-off moderator lester holt, and told him \"you're wrong \" when holt asserted that a judge ruled it unconstitutional. \"it went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal, \" he said. But that's not entirely accurate. Trump is wrong about the judge's ruling, but it's complicated. U.s. District court judge shira scheindlin did rule in 2013 that the stop and frisk practice violated the constitution in the landmark case, floyd v. City of new york. But it didn't end there. Judge scheindlin ruled that stop and frisk, in practice, had a discriminatory effect on blacks and hispanics, violating the fourth and fourteenth amendments. \"the equal protection clause's prohibition on selective enforcement means that suspicious blacks and hispanics may not be treated differently by the",

It also succeeded: some 1,500 documents dating from 1959 to 1971, unearthed in 2010, show that 78 % of the sugar industry's recommendations were included in a 1971 request for research proposals on cavity prevention that came from the nih's national institute of dental research, science reports. In fact, the committee that worked on the request was made up almost entirely of sugar industry expert panel members, minus one, according to a press release. Recommendations unfavorable to the sugar industry were omitted. Asking people to limit their sugar intake would have made the most sense, researchers say, but the sugar industry instead funded research on enzymes capable of destroying dental plaque that could be added to food, as well as creating a vaccine that would protect against tooth decay. \" the sugar industry, like the tobacco industry, seeks to protect profits over public health, \" a researcher says.

Reporting in the journal science, researchers from caltech and the china earthquake administration say the paleocanyon is several thousand feet deep in some places and is \" now buried under more than [ 1,600 feet ] of sediments. \" by drilling from several sites along the gorge, they measured two isotopes in the lowest sediment layer to see how long ago it was last exposed to cosmic rays at the earth's surface, reports science magazine. They found that about 2.5 million years ago, one section of the mountain range rose quickly and dammed the river, filling the canyon with sediment and establishing a gorge. This means that a model popularized almost 20 years ago, called tectonic aneurysm, didn't actually play a role in this instance, as it posits that a river can cut into the earth's crust so quickly it heats the crust, weakening nearby mountains and helping massifs rise suddenly. But in this case, one geologist at caltech says, \" we have discovered that the river was able to cut into the plateau way before the uplift happened, and this shows that the tectonic aneurysm model was actually not at work here.

Given the group's massive clout, the story raised a ruckus on capitol hill and prompted advocates of cuts to press legislators to take quick advantage. Aarp itself released a statement calling the story \" misleading \" and denying a policy shift. The statement, however, suggested that aarp would be open to future cuts, notes ben smith of politico, with lines like this: \" it has also been a long held position that any changes would be phased in slowly, over time, and would not affect any current or near term beneficiaries. \" talking points memo's take: \" conversations with insiders suggest the journal story, while mostly on point, underplays a key part of the story. What aarp decided doesn't necessarily constitute a change in policy, but rather a major strategic decision to announce their acceptance of those cuts now... \" the new york times talks to the group's policy chief and concludes that aarp is open to modest cuts as long as they don't affect current recipients. \"you have to look at all the tradeoffs, and what we're trying to do is engage the american public in that debate, \" he says.",

Amber cammack took photos and then posted them on facebook — a last resort, she says, after her attempts to report the alleged abuse went nowhere. She was arrested on tuesday for her troubles.

She was apparently first given a warning on monday, when she was told she faced arrest if she didn't take down the photos. \" when the sheriff himself calls you and threatens you with arrest, that is an extreme chill on your right to freedom of expression, \" her attorney said in a statement. She spent a night in jail and was on thursday joined by not just her attorney but two dozen protesters carrying signs in support of the \" porch pooch. \" the district attorney admits \" the pictures are bad \" but says there's no evidence of animal cruelty; the dog, who was being dog-sat for roughly a week by condo dweller karress buckman, is in good health and back home with its owner.

As the ap reports, anderson visited assange over the weekend at the ecuadorean embassy in london where he's holed up; she brought him a vegan meal, and some are theorizing ( presumably jokingly ) that perhaps the meal killed him.

Officials haven't revealed whether he's a us citizen. It's unknown how he became infected, but it was confirmed that he's not a health worker. Others on the patient's plane won't get sick: the patient in question arrived in the us on sept. 20, but he didn't begin to experience symptoms until sept. 24. That means officials aren't worried about others on the plane. \" ebola doesn't spread till someone gets sick, and he didn't get sick for four days, \" frieden says. Who may be at risk: the patient has been in isolation, and officials are seeking the \" handful \" of people with whom he had close contact beforehand, including family members and community members. The disease only spreads via contact with a patient's bodily fluids; it doesn't travel through the air. Those at risk will have their symptoms checked every day for three weeks. Dallas can handle the patient: the texas health presbyterian hospital says it's \" well prepared \" to take care of him; he won't need to be moved to an isolation unit elsewhere. He ' ll be treated using iv nutrition, hydration, and possibly an experimental drug or a blood transfusion from an ebola survivor, frieden says. This may not be the only traveler with ebola: screening processes in the affected region involve checking passengers for fever, but those without symptoms could slip through. If any are later found to be infected on or after a flight, the cdc will be on the case. How doctors distinguish ebola from the flu: in the beginning they may look the same, but things get bad fast with ebola, explains one doctor, \" from you just got the flu to you're really, really sick, high-grade fever, vomiting, diarrhea. \"",

The 19-year-old is the new face of marc jacobs — and a symbol of the changing face of fashion, in which gender-bending \"femiman \" models are rising to prominence. Pejic, who grew up in serbia and australia, was discovered last year and debuted this year in jean-paul gaultier's paris show.

Pejic says classmates were curious about him while growing up, but he was never bullied — although \"a lot of macho guys did think of me as a girl, \" he tells the daily beast, which meant \"a lot of free drinks. \" he models both male and female clothes, and even when dressing himself he sometimes chooses heels or makeup — but he won't discuss his sexuality. His new-found fame is a sign that \"the line between the sexes is becoming more and more blurred, \" says turkish vogue's editor. \"fashion is all about providing people with choices.

Noaa surveyed the atlantic coast using sound waves and found at least 570 methane \" seeps \" from cape hatteras to nantucket, right where the continental shelf meets the ocean, livescience reports. They found the methane in two forms depending on the seeps'depth — most are between 800 and 2,000 feet, reports the new york times. Shallow seeps are coming from burping microbes, but deeper down it turns into a sludge called methane hydrate that releases the gas when it's warmed, the bbc explains. The find is odd because methane seeps usually occur in \" tectonically active \" spots; the quiet east coast is \" cold, old, and boring, \" says study co-author carolyn ruppel, who adds that \" we're setting the stage for a decade of discovery. \" methane is a greenhouse gas, and the seeps could serve as a lab for studying climate change and its potential effects. The seeps aren't causing environmental concern — one expert says the amount of methane released is \" probably on the order of a feedlot \" and is dissolving in the ocean. In a biological side note, scientists have also found new life near the seeps — chemosynthetic creatures that get energy from chemical reactions and not the sun.

Given that it is, in fact, a black market, it's hard to pin down numbers. But lebanon's look-the-other-way attitude, its convenience for rich patients from gulf states, and the hundreds of thousands of syrians pouring over the border are combining to turn lebanon into what vocative calls the \" go-to country in the region \" for kidneys and other organs. The story includes an interview not only with a young man who recently sold his kidney for $ 5,000 but the \" kidney hunter \" who arranged the sale for his own $ 2,000 payday. That broker alone has arranged about 35 such operations — they take place at a secret clinic that sounds reasonably well-run, given the circumstances — and he says he has plenty of competition. A previous story by der spiegel also reported on the thriving market, and it included this unfortunate line from a different organ broker: \" i ' m currently looking for someone who has an eye for sale. \" ( click to read about how war crimes prosecutors say bashar al-assad is systematically torturing and killing prisoners back home. )",

        "summary": "If you live near the sierra nevada, your chance of running into a bear has apparently spiked: nine have been captured in the area over the last two days, while another was killed by a car. In the fall months, bears can eat up to 25,000 calories a day — equal to 83 mcdonald's cheeseburgers, the ap reports — as they prep for hibernation. But as drought takes a toll for the third consecutive year, drying up streams and reducing berry supplies, many of the animals are braving close run-ins with humans to get their fill. In fact, one of 42 bears captured since july was bold enough to paw through a picnic basket on a busy beach on lake tahoe. Some 97 bears were captured last year; the count was 83 in 2012. Nearly all captured bears are returned to the wild. Of this year's 42, two \" repeat offenders, \" including the beachgoer, have been put down. \" this bear activity is totally predictable because the bears are hungry, we are in an extended drought, and the bears are searching far and wide for food in order to fatten up for winter, \" a rep for the nevada department of wildlife adds, per usa today.",

Among this year's winners: the medicine prize went to japanese scientists who figured out that mice live longer than average ( 27 days versus seven ) after a heart transplant if they listen to opera music, reports the guardian. Physics: the team to accept this award put their brains together and found that it's totally possible for a person to run across a pond — on the moon. Safety engineering: the late gustano pizzo finally got recognition for his 1972 anti-hijacking system, which proposed hijackers be dropped through a plane's trap doors into a package that would drop to the ground ( with parachute, of course ), where the police would be waiting. Archaeology: judges may have simply pitied the researchers who took home this prize. They swallowed a parboiled dead shrew whole, then checked out their own, erm, excretions to see which bones dissolved in the human digestive tract, livescience explains. There was probably no clapping for this award: belarus ' president and state police took home the peace prize for making public applause illegal and arresting a one-armed man for doing it anyway. And oh, the public health award... This one involves a duck-gnawed penis.

It \" practically licks your face like a puppy in its futile desire to be taken seriously as romantic drama, \" but it's actually \" a perfect storm of a hoot. \" the seriousness is a joke, and the \" nested russian-doll narrative \" is tedious, agrees dana stevens at slate. \" for a film that purports to be about the love of literature and the call of the writerly life, the words is remarkably uninterested in playing with either language or ideas. It's solemn and dull to a degree that can't help but breed fantasies of rocky horror-style heckling. \" \" i enjoyed the settings, the periods, and the acting, \" acknowledges roger ebert in the chicago sun-times. \" i can't go so far as to say i cared about the story, particularly after it became clear that its structure was too clever by half. \" the film \" tries too hard to be smart, \" writes betsy sharkey in the los angeles times. \" what saving grace there is comes in the look of things.

California assemblywoman cristina garcia, who chairs the legislative women's caucus, has risen to national prominence with her advocacy for victims of sexual assault and harassment, counting herself as one of the number. But two men who spoke to politico are now making allegations of misconduct against her, including one who says the democrat groped him after the annual assembly softball game in sacramento in 2014. Daniel fierro, then 25 and working for assemblyman ian calderon, says a drunk garcia cornered him while he was cleaning a dugout, stroked his back, squeezed his butt, and tried to touch his crotch before he slipped away. Fierro — who says garcia later \" had to have other people hold her up \" — didn't report the incident for fear of repercussions, though the assembly rules committee launched an investigation after fierro mentioned it to calderon in january. Two coworkers say he also relayed the incident to them. \" i knew that i had had an experience that didn't jibe with what... She was saying, and that kind of hypocrisy was really hard to stomach, \" fierro tells the washington post. An unidentified lobbyist says garcia also cornered him, said she'd \" set a goal for myself to f --- you, \" and tried to grab his crotch at a political fundraiser in 2017, where he claims she'd been drinking heavily. In a statement, garcia says she has \" zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behavior \" and \" will participate fully in any investigation that takes place. \"",

The chemicals group, which is working with maritime technology company kongsberg, plans to introduce the yara birkeland as a manned ship next year before moving to remote operation a year later and full automation in 2020. That would make the vessel \" the world's first fully electric and autonomous container ship, with zero emissions, \" per a release. The idea is that the ship would carry fertilizer from yara's production plant in porsgrunn to the cities of brevik and larvik, saving 40,000 trips taken by diesel trucks each year, reports quartz. The ship will \" reduce noise and dust emissions, improve the safety of local roads, and reduce nox and co2 emissions, \" yara's ceo says. Yara expects carbon dioxide emissions to fall by 678 tons per year, per phys.org. The ship, with a range of 65 nautical miles, would haul 100 containers at a time at 12 to 15 knots, traveling a set route. But it would be able to alter that route if it finds itself in another ship's path, for example, per a youtube video. It \" will set the benchmark for the application of innovative maritime technology for more efficient and environmentally friendly shipping, \" says kongsberg's ceo. Other \" intelligent ships \" are already in the works and are predicted to improve efficiency and safety, including by hindering piracy, reports ieee spectrum.",

( ap photo/jeffrey phelps ) republicans responded to democrat kathy hochul's tuesday victory in a traditionally republican new york congressional district by saying they needed to attack the democrats ' medicare position more forcefully, rather than back off their own plan. \" we need to make it a choice between a do-nothing approach that will ultimately destroy medicare, and life-saving reforms, \" said rep. Tom cole ( r., okla. ). Added rep. Cliff stearns ( r., fla. ): \" it's a wake-up call on how you frame it. It obviously wasn't framed right. \" rep. Paul ryan ( r., wis. ), who authored the medicare plan, said democratic attacks on his plan were effective in tuesday's election to fill an open house seat near buffalo. \" they are shamelessly demagoguing and distorting it, \" mr. Ryan said, adding that republicans would have a better chance to make their case over the next 18 months",
            "Senate republicans on wednesday stood by a gop plan to transform medicare, one day after the party lost a conservative house district in upstate new york amid a strong effort by democrats to make that proposal the central issue. The measure was defeated in the democratic-run senate on wednesday. But the unity among republicans — with only five out of 47 voting against it — served as an important sign that party leaders remain wedded to a deficit-reduction plan that is a loyalty test for many gop voters but is widely unpopular, according to polls. Wednesday's vote underscored the pressure being exerted by the party's tea party base to stick with the plan, sponsored by house budget committee chairman paul ryan ( wis. ), and the calculation by republican officials that they have time before the 2012 election to neutralize any of the democrats ' political advantages. Moreover, in the senate, the gop has some breathing room, with only 10 members up for re­election next year and just one considered vulnerable. Still, signs of unease about ryan's approach remain within the party. Several gop presidential contenders have steered clear of the medicare provision, with both former minnesota governor tim pawlenty and former massachusetts governor mitt romney, a presumed candidate, saying in recent days that they will soon release their own plans.

Allentown mayor ed pawloski is on trial for allegedly accepting over $ 150,000 in campaign donations in exchange for city contracts. His lawyer, jack mcmahon, is trying to show that the scheme was actually carried out by underlings like former allentown finance director garret strathearn and political consultant mike fleck. And that's where the meatballs come in. In wiretap recordings made of phone calls between fleck and strathearn, phrases like \" how i want my meatballs cooked \" and \" needs to go make some meatballs \" are heard frequently, wfmz reports. Mcmahon said it's clear \" meatballs \" refers to bribes. But strathearn and federal prosecutor michelle morgan said that's not the case. Under questioning from morgan, strathearn said he was single at the time and carried tupperware in his car to take home hot meals from friends, the morning call reports. He said he had some of fleck's meatballs at a christmas party, and fleck's wife offered to make more of them. In fact, strathearn said, he was disappointed he only got four meatballs from fleck's wife when he went to pick them up. Things got testy when mcmahon said everyone knows \" it's a payoff. \" \" the meatballs were the meatballs were the meatballs, \" strathearn responded. \" and don't laugh, because that tells me that you don't believe me. \" the judge instructed jurors to ignore the meatball argument.",

On tuesday, the alberta government announced a plan for the creation of three new provincial parks bordering on wood buffalo national park, as well as the creation of a fourth park to the south. The 5,200 square miles of newly protected land will balloon the conservation zone, where logging and oil and gas exploration is banned, to more than 26,000 square miles, roughly the size of west virginia. A rep for the nature conservancy of canada says the \" incredible size \" makes it \" globally significant, \" per the cbc. \" it's really the matrix of forest and wetlands and waters — and we can protect those at a scale that is an opportunity lost in the rest of the world, \" an ncc biologist adds, per the bbc. Alberta's indigenous communities are heavily involved, with education and monitoring agreements for the parks in the works. The tallcree first nation also agreed to relinquish its timber license to establish one of the new parks. \" i could almost see the boreal forest coming down around us on a daily basis, \" chief rupert meneen tells the bbc, which notes the area is home to threatened species like the wood bison, woodland caribou, and peregrine falcons. \" it was important we try to at least leave some of the forest for the future generations. \" the move comes shortly after a study found large swaths of canada's boreal forest are at risk of disappearing by the end of the century as a result of climate change elevating the risk of wildfires, drought, and invasive bugs, reports the national observer.

The cross-state rival pittsburgh penguins tweeted, \" lol ok \" — to which gritty responded, \" sleep with one eye open tonight, bird. \" twitter users created memes with gritty taking the place of horror-movie villains and splicing his head onto other disturbing images.

Sgt. Jonathan frost turned around and pulled guilford over, and the traffic stop ended with the unarmed guilford dead after being shot seven times by frost.

The lawsuit seeks a jury trial. Video of the incident shows guilford and frost arguing over whether frost's brights were on — frost explains that the suv is new and the headlights are brighter than usual, and that he also pulled over several other people who flashed him to explain this; the lawsuit notes that frost stopped two other drivers that day for the same reason, even though it is not illegal to flash your brights at another vehicle, courthouse news reports. Guilford refuses to turn over his license, registration, and insurance information; frost refuses to give guilford his badge number and calls for backup. Frost ultimately pulls guilford from the car and orders him to lie on his stomach, but when guilford won't put his hands behind his back, frost tases him. An altercation ensues that ends with guilford's death; frost sustained facial injuries. Guilford was later found to have thc in his system at the time of the stop, but his brother calls his death \" senseless. \" \" deven was listening to frost's commands, he never swore or used any profane language, \" he says. \" he was confused and he never received any respect in return. \"",

South korean president moon jae-in, who is scheduled to meet north korean leader kim jong un on april 27, said thursday that pyongyang had expressed a will for denuclearization and had not attached any conditions that the us would consider unacceptable, including a troop pullout, the guardian reports. \" all they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against north korea, followed by a guarantee of security, \" he said. North korea has not confirmed that it has dropped the demand for the withdrawal of us troops. Moon said his summit with kim could be a step toward a formal end to the korean war and aid for the north's economy if it gets rid of its nuclear weapons program, though he cautioned that no progress would be made separate from the upcoming us-north korea summit. \" first, the south-north korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the north korea-united states summit, \" he said, per reuters. The april 27 meeting will be only the third meeting of korean leaders since 1953. On friday, the first-ever telephone hotline between the leaders was installed and tested in preparation for the summit, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "Women are generally a lot less likely to kill themselves than men, but female veterans are an exception with shockingly high suicide rates, according to new veterans affairs department research. Among women of all ages who have served in the military, the suicide rate is 28.7 per 100,000 — higher than the rate among male civilians, nearly six times the rate of civilian women, and approaching the 32.1 rate among male veterans, the los angeles times reports. \" it's staggering, \" a northeastern university epidemiologist tells the times. \" we have to come to grips with why the rates are so obscenely high. \" women vets ages 18 to 29 kill themselves at nearly 12 times the rate of civilian women the same age, but the rate was up to eight times higher even among women who served in the 1950s. The study involved data on 173,969 adult suicides in 23 states over 11 years, which included the deaths of 40,571 male vets and 2,637 female vets. The times looks at the 2011 death of 24-year-old veteran katie lynn cesena and finds that her suicide involved two factors that could help explain the high suicide rate: she left the navy after she reported being raped, and she used a gun — a lethal method more common among men, but also prevalent among female veterans. The researchers, whose study is published in psychiatric services, also note that other studies have shown that people who join the military are more likely to have had troubled childhoods and it could be the case that women who signed up were at higher risk of suicide in the first place.",

Zirkle has now come in second three years in a row, the ap reports; she finished a few minutes behind seavey. It was one of the race's tightest finishes ever, the anchorage daily news reports. The race had \" three leaders in three hours \" last night, \" said executive director stan hooley. \" it's very unusual. \" king, however, scratched at 11: 50pm amid heavy winds. Seavey passed zirkle after she paused for several hours at the safety checkpoint during a storm; seavey stayed at the checkpoint for just three minutes. It's the first time in two decades a competitor has lost the lead in the final 77 miles, the daily news notes. Seavey was the race's youngest winner in 2012; his father, mitch, was the oldest as a 53-year-old last year, the ap notes.",

Lee and his colleagues showed participants random pixelated images that were simply \" noise, \" lee says, but 35 % of subjects spotted faces or letters when researchers told them such images were there. The researchers used mri technology to monitor the brain activity of the subjects and determined that the frontal cortex, where expectations are generated, sent signals to the posterior visual cortex, which processes the images a person sees. In other words, as lee puts it, \" believing is seeing, \" and we see what we expect to see. \" what we have shown is that a lot of what we see and perceive is actually determined by biases that already exist in our brains \" before our brains process an image we're seeing, he explains to cbc. That's why, while some people see jesus on their sandwich, others might see buddha. The phenomenon, known as face pareidolia, has been known for centuries. ( some of the images, most famously a toasted cheese sandwich on which the virgin mary was detected, have been sold for large sums of money, the toronto star notes ). But until now, the brain process behind it was a mystery, and people who saw nonexistent images were sometimes thought to be \" crazy, \" lee says.

According to new research from an international team of psychologists and published tuesday in the journal cortex, seeing non-existent faces in inanimate objects is \"perfectly normal \" behaviour. Interactive &#124; map of the human brain the phenomenon, known as 'face pareidolia, ' is due to an interaction between two distinct parts of the brain responsible for visual perception, says kang lee, professor at the dr.

Yes, the selection committee released its official bracket yesterday ( you can download one here ), and that means it's time to identify cinderellas, pick some 5-12 upsets, and/or randomly guess which university you've maybe heard of will defeat which university you've definitely never heard of. We're here to help. Here's what people around the web are saying about the bracket: high seeds are good: for all the much-buzzed-about upsets, it turns out the selection committee knows a thing or two; no. 1 seeds have won five of the past six championships, espn points out, and only once in the past 24 tournaments has a team seeded lower than 4 won it all. But definitely pick some upsets: they ' ll happen, because this isn't march rational outcomes. Usa today suggests picking a 9-seed over an 8-seed, noting that 9-seeds are 58-54 all-time. You could also do worse than picking a 10 over a 7 ( 45-67 ) or a 12 over a 5 ( 38-74 ). Identify some underrated teams: bleacher report suggests villanova ( 9 ), temple ( 9 ), and la salle ( 13 ), all of which the public has largely written off because they're going up against better-hyped foes, but all of which have at least one outstanding star that could put them over the top. Beware gonzaga: the perennial winner of the \" most fun name to say \" award has a no. 1 seed this year, after going undefeated in conference play and winning their conference tournament. But be careful; none of the previous nine teams to pull off that feat won the tournament. Try it blind: the wall street journal has a nifty tool letting you pick the teams based on their perceived strengths at various parts of the game — without seeing their names. What to grumble about: of course, you ' ll also want to be up on the selection committee outrages. Sportsgrid predicts grumbles about miami's lack of a 1-seed, the lack of respect for the pac-12, and the omission of tennessee.

Per the post, this would be the first time russian government officials have had us cybercrimes charges filed against them. What irks us officials most is that the fsb employees implicated in this case work for a division within the agency that's akin to the fbi's own cybercrime unit, which one official tells the post is \" pretty sad. \" if any of the suspects are indeed in russia, there's no extradition treaty that the us can tap into to haul them to the states, but the post notes charges such as these, plus possible sanctions, can still wield a \" deterrent effect \" against future criminality ( and the suspects can still get busted if they visit countries that will ship them to the us ).
