But nigerian energy magnate femi otedola — reported worth: $ 1.8 billion — says the sisters claimed they had evidence of him cheating on his wife and threatened to expose him if he didn't pay them off. They appeared in court dec. 23, the daily dot reports. Private investigators hired by otedola say the matheroos recorded conversations and themselves having sex with wealthy men, then threatened to put the evidence on a website they operated. They allegedly used the website and its associated social media accounts to cyberbully around 275 people \" mostly based in various regions of africa, \" including otedola, his wife, nana, and their daughter dj cuppy. The sisters are also accused of being escorts, and nigerian authorities say they've admitted to having sex with 100 rich nigerian men. The canadian government confirms the matheroos ' arrest.

The upshot of the 50-page gao analysis, per npr: that, based on five years ' worth of tests, \" nearly all \" of its latest weapons systems are a cybersecurity nightmare, with easy-to-guess passwords and known vulnerabilities that were never remedied, among other issues. Just as concerning is that the dod doesn't even know \" the full scale of its weapon system vulnerabilities \" as the tests that were carried out \" were limited in scope and sophistication, \" the gao notes. The tests, conducted from 2012 to 2017, were initially prompted by a request from the senate armed services committee to look into just how secure the pentagon was able to keep its weapons systems. The gao notes the \" widespread examples of weakness \" fell under the umbrella of four cybersecurity categories: \" protect, detect, respond, and recover. \" the results weren't great: in one case, for example, a test hacker guessed an admin password in nine seconds; in another, two testers needed just an hour to gain initial access to a weapons system. And, \" once they gained initial access, test teams were often able to move throughout a system, escalating their privileges until they had taken full or partial control of a system. \" to make matters worse, when vulnerabilities were found, they were often neglected: one test report showed just one vulnerability remedied out of 20 identified. Staffing issues contribute to the problem, as the salaries that cybersecurity aces can command in the private sector far exceed those that the government can pay.

James barton horn jr. Has been on the run since the end of april, when sandra sutton ran to a neighbor's house and said he had been locking her in the box whenever he wasn't home, the kansas city star reports. When police were called, they found the plywood box — 100 inches long, 48 inches wide, and 52 inches tall, according to the ap — and discovered horn had fled. Yesterday, sutton and her 17-year-old son were found shot dead at the home of a family member, and police say horn is a suspect, nbc news reports. The family member's home is in clinton, nearly 50 miles away from horn's home in sedalia. According to the sedalia democrat, sutton told police that her relationship with horn began as consensual but then led to \" you can't leave. \" police warn that horn, 47, is an \" extremely dangerous, violent person, \" and the ap reports that he has a long and disturbing criminal past. Records show that he spent three years in prison in tennessee in the early ' 90s for a kidnapping and rape; at the end of 2011, he finished a 13-year sentence for kidnapping his estranged wife in mississippi. A police spokesman in clinton tells the star that authorities were unaware that sutton was living in the city and she had apparently declined to seek a protection order — though he adds that it may not have helped, because \" he'd done these things and he was on the run. \"",

        "summary": "If you've given up physical activity because you don't have the time or inclination to achieve recommended weekly exercise levels, strap on your walking shoes: a new study in jama internal medicine indicates that something's better than nothing in terms of increasing longevity. Scientists from the national cancer institute looked back at six studies and found individuals who followed the 2008 physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise — or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity workouts — achieved \" substantial \" benefit, while those who doubled that baseline reaped \" additional \" benefit, reuters reports. But researchers also made the significant find that those who exercised even a bit were 20 % less likely to die than those who hunkered down on the couch with their remotes and did nothing. Scientists looked at 661,137 men and women ( ages 21 to 98 ) who provided their own reports on their physical activity levels; 116,686 deaths were reported among these subjects, per the study. Those who met the guidelines saw a 31 % increase in longevity over their nonactive counterparts, while participants who did three to five times the recommended levels did 39 % better than the sedentary, livescience reports. Interestingly, exercise beyond that didn't seem to confer further benefit, but it also didn't appear to be harmful: researchers found no link between those who worked out up to 10 times or more than the guidelines and increased death rate. A university of florida aging specialist writes in the study's accompanying editorial that \" physicians who seek out the segment of the population that performs no leisure-time physical activity could receive the most payback in their patient's health \" if they recommend even a small amount of exercise.

        "summary": "Isis militants have rounded up hundreds of christian hostages after storming through a chain of villages along a strategic river in northeastern syria over the past three days, activists said today. The britain-based syrian observatory for human rights puts the number of abducted christian assyrians at 220, many taken from more than 11 communities in hassakeh province. The province, which borders turkey and iraq, has become the latest battleground in the fight against isis in syria. It is predominantly kurdish but also has populations of arabs and predominantly christian assyrians and armenians. Isis hasn't yet owned the abductions, and the motive isn't clear; reuters and the bbc both speculate that the militants might be looking for a prisoner swap with kurdish forces. \" these were peaceful villages that had nothing to do with the battles, \" says a kurdish official in the area. Isis began abducting the assyrians on monday, when militants attacked a cluster of villages along the khabur river, sending thousands of people fleeing to safer areas. Younan talia, a senior official with the assyrian democratic organization, says isis had raided 33 assyrian villages, picking up as many as 300 people along the way. It was not possible to reconcile the numbers, and the fate of the hostages remains unclear. State-run news agency sana and an assyrian activist group, the assyrian network for human rights in syria, say the group has been moved to the isis-controlled city of shaddadeh, a predominantly arab town south of the city of hassakeh. The observatory, however, says they're still being held in nearby mount abdulaziz.",

        "summary": "The horns and frills of dinosaurs like triceratops and styracosaurus weren't for defending against predators, regulating body temperature, or even attaching fearsome battle helmets, according to a study published this week in proceedings of the royal society b. Rather researchers found the defining features of ceratopsian dinosaurs were actually for attracting mates. \" individuals are advertising their quality or genetic make-up, \" researcher andrew knapp tells the bbc. \" we see that in peacocks too, with their tail feathers. \" business insider reports there are over 70 species of ceratopsian dinosaurs, and their horns and frills vary widely. Researchers behind the recent study had set out to see if the purpose of the horns and frills was to let different species tell each other apart for mating purposes ( previous research had ruled out temperature regulation and defense ). After looking at 350 different traits from 46 ceratopsian species, researchers concluded that wasn't the case. In modern animals, features for species to differentiate between each other are typically subtler and more evolutionary work goes into features used to attract members of the same species. The relatively speedy evolution of horns and frills was also another clue as to their purpose. \" modern computer models have suggested that sexual selection can promote rapid speciation, adaptation, and extinction, \" knapp says in a press release. As for both male and female ceratopsian dinosaurs having horns and frills, knapp says it could \" tell us a lot about how these animals lived. \" for example, they may have been co-parents when it came to raising their young.

            "This is the restoration of the head of nasutoceratops andrey atuchin for decades, researchers have tried to figure out why dinosaurs had such enormous bony frills and fearsome spikes on their heads.

        "summary": "A freak accident left the university of connecticut reeling in october; now, six arrests may have it reeling once more. Jeffny pally was sitting up against a garage bay door at a fire station near her dorm on the storrs campus around 1: 15am when the door opened as fire crews responded to a call. The 19-year-old sophomore fell back and was struck by a chevy tahoe leaving the firehouse. Why she chose to sit in front of the bay remains unknown, but police say they've pieced together what allegedly happened in the hours beforehand. On the evening of oct. 15, pally attended a party at the kappa sigma fraternity that revolved around building a homecoming parade float; now six frat members have been charged with alcohol-related offenses related to pally's death, reports the hartford courant. Pally arrived around 10: 30pm and stayed about two hours, during which witnesses say she had one to five beers; she reportedly drank prior to the party, and her blood alcohol content was.25. Patrick callahan, matthew moll, austin custodio, and dominic godi, all 21, and dylan morose and jonathan polansky, 22, face varied charges tied to allegedly purchasing and transporting the booze and permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. Their arraignment is set for march 8. The 60-year-old shift commander who drove the tahoe told police he did feel a bump as he exited, but assumed what he saw in his rearview mirror was fire equipment. Pally's body was discovered upon the fire crew's return to the station for what wtnh reports was a false alarm sparked after two students allegedly set off a stolen fire extinguisher in a dorm. They face criminal mischief and larceny charges. ( last year, a court ruled that parents could be held responsible for underage drinking. )",

The los angeles times, meanwhile, says an anonymous russian official claims snowden applied for asylum to 15 different countries, but wouldn't say which countries they were. But the russian federal migration service denies that snowden has applied for asylum, according to rt, which notes that a consular employee cannot make comments on behalf of the ministry. A presidential spokesperson also denied it had received the asylum request, ria novosti reports. So for now, the truth remains as elusive as snowden himself.

He is currently recovering in a hospital after being hit by a stray bullet in chicago's austin neighborhood on friday. The boy's great-uncle says the 13-year-old was walking home from playing basketball with friends when he came upon two groups of youths arguing around 8: 30pm, per fox 32 and the chicago tribune. A male then opened fire and zarriel was hit in the lower back, police say. He was listed in critical condition on saturday after an emergency surgery, though authorities say he is slowly improving. \" he was not the intended target, \" an officer tells the new york times. \" he was standing on the sidewalk. \" \" we're all praying he stays strong, \" adds zarriel's school principal, who notes the seventh-grader — with a \" positive energy that's contagious \" — has yet to speak. \" i never think that he would get shot, \" says a friend of zarriel, but \" when it's night time people be shooting out here and i think if i come outside, they start shooting, \" he says. The chicago sun-times reports zarriel is the 71st person shot in austin this year. In his psa interview, he had this advice for those living a life of violence: \" can you please just stop killing people? \" he says. \" handle what you got to handle with your words instead of your fists. \"",

The review concluded that the program was severely lacking in oversight: 26 of the detainees ( nearly 25 percent ) were wrongfully held, and on several occasions senior officials overruled cia interrogators who questioned the tactics being used. The 528-page report by the senate intelligence committee also details disturbing techniques used by cia officials, such as sleep deprivation, \"rectal feeding \" or \"rectal rehydration \" ( you can use your imagination on what these are ), and \"rough takedowns, \" in which \"approximately five cia officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut off his clothes and secure him with mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched. \" but even if you read the 528-page report ( the public version is actually a summary of a classified 6,700-page report ) you still may have missed some of the most illuminating",

The 528-page report by the senate intelligence committee also details disturbing techniques used by cia officials, such as sleep deprivation, \"rectal feeding \" or \"rectal rehydration \" ( you can use your imagination on what these are ), and \"rough takedowns, \" in which \"approximately five cia officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut off his clothes and secure him with mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched. \" but even if you read the 528-page report ( the public version is actually a summary of a classified 6,700-page report ) you still may have missed some of the most illuminating",

And this debate was revived when the film zero dark thirty implied the same point. During these dust-ups, sen. Dianne feinstein ( d-calif. ), the chair of the senate intelligence committee, said her committee's years-long investigation of the cia interrogation program showed that the agency's use of harsh techniques did not lead it to bin laden's hideaway in pakistan. The torture report she released today — that is, the 535-page executive summary of the 6,600-page full report — states bluntly that cia torturing had nothing to do with finding bin laden. A footnote reports that the cia, naturally, takes issues with this and says the committee report \"incorrectly characterizes the intelligence we had. \" that footnote adds, \"this is incorrect. \" here's the blow-by-blow. After the bin laden raid, according to the report, cia officials, in classified briefings to the committee, said that intelligence related to the cia's so-called enhanced interrogation techniques was used to locate the al qaeda chieftain, referred to as ubl in the report. The committee says this \"was inaccurate and incongruent \" with the cia '"

It seems the nova scotia native brought a suitcase filled with halifax's coveted brothers tnt pepperoni to victoria's fairmont empress hotel during a business trip in april 2001. He'd planned to share the meat with his bc friends, per the cbc. But as there was no fridge in his room, burchill put the pepperoni next to an open window to be cooled by the breeze and left. Returning hours later, he tells the times colonist he found \" a tornado of seagull excrement, feathers, pepperoni chunks, and fairly large birds whipping around the room. \" burchill says he eventually chased 30 to 40 seagulls out of the fourth-floor window, dropping a towel and his shoe in the process. After retrieving the shoe, he tried to dry it with a hairdryer, which fell into a sink of water, knocking out power, per the times colonist. That's when he contacted hotel staff, who sent a woman to the room to clean. \" i still remember the look on her face when she opened the door, \" burchill tells the cbc. He wasn't surprised when his employer later received a letter saying he wasn't allowed to return to the hotel. But \" i didn't like the feeling of being banned from somewhere, \" says burchill. During a trip back to victoria over easter weekend, therefore, \" i just apologized. I was forgiven, \" he says. A hotel rep backs up burchill's story, per huffpost. \" it's a really funny story to tell 17 years later, \" she says. ( dude, what's up with canada's birds? )",

            "By the end of this year, it's estimated that 300 physicians will commit suicide. While depression amongst physicians is not new — a few years back, it was named the second-most suicidal occupation — the level of sheer unhappiness amongst physicians is on the rise. Simply put, being a doctor has become a miserable and humiliating undertaking. Indeed, many doctors feel that america has declared war on physicians — and both physicians and patients are the losers. Not surprisingly, many doctors want out. Medical students opt for high-paying specialties so they can retire as quickly as possible. Physician mba programs — that promise doctors a way into management — are flourishing. The website known as the drop-out-club — which hooks doctors up with jobs at hedge funds and venture capital firms — has a solid following. In fact, physicians are so bummed out that 9 out of 10 doctors would discourage anyone from entering the profession. It's hard for anyone outside the profession to understand just how rotten the job has become — and what bad news that is for america's health care system. Perhaps that's why author malcolm gladwell recently implied that to fix the healthcare crisis, the public needs to understand what it's like to be a physician. Imagine, for things to get better for patients, they need to empathize with physicians — that's a tall order in our noxious and decidedly un-empathetic times. After all, the public sees ophthalmologists and radiologists making out like bandits and wonder why they should feel anything but scorn for such doctors — especially when americans haven't gotten a raise in decades. But being a primary care physician is not like being, say, a plastic surgeon — a profession that garners both respect and retirement savings. Given that primary care doctors do the work that no one else is willing to do, being a primary care physician is more like being a janitor — but without the social status or union protections. Unfortunately, things are only getting worse for most doctors, especially those who still accept health insurance. Just processing the insurance forms costs $ 58 for every patient encounter, according to dr. Stephen schimpff, an internist",

The website known as the drop-out-club — which hooks doctors up with jobs at hedge funds and venture capital firms — has a solid following. In fact, physicians are so bummed out that 9 out of 10 doctors would discourage anyone from entering the profession. It's hard for anyone outside the profession to understand just how rotten the job has become — and what bad news that is for america's health care system. Perhaps that's why author malcolm gladwell recently implied that to fix the healthcare crisis, the public needs to understand what it's like to be a physician. Imagine, for things to get better for patients, they need to empathize with physicians — that's a tall order in our noxious and decidedly un-empathetic times. After all, the public sees ophthalmologists and radiologists making out like bandits and wonder why they should feel anything but scorn for such doctors — especially when americans haven't gotten a raise in decades. But being a primary care physician is not like being, say, a plastic surgeon — a profession that garners both respect and retirement savings. Given that primary care doctors do the work that no one else is willing to do, being a primary care physician is more like being a janitor — but without the social status or union protections. Unfortunately, things are only getting worse for most doctors, especially those who still accept health insurance. Just processing the insurance forms costs $ 58 for every patient encounter, according to dr. Stephen schimpff, an internist",

In two small but promising studies, researchers found that people who consumed food with the powder — called inulin-propionate ester, or ipe — gained less weight than their counterparts who went ipe-free, reports quartz. If all goes well in larger studies, the scientists from imperial college london and the university of glasgow say that ipe could someday be added into bread, smoothies, and all manner of foods. \" this is the first time that a food ingredient has been shown to decrease weight gain, \" says one of the lead researchers, as quoted in healthday news. The bbc explains that researchers figured out a way to make sure that ipe, once ingested, goes to the colon instead of being absorbed by the intestine. Once there, it seems to trigger appetite-suppressing hormones. In one of the studies, volunteers ate 14 % less food from a buffet if it contained ipe. Scientists say ipe is essentially a tweak of a naturally occurring process and is therefore safe. ( another way to control your weight? pay attention to the clock. )",

This is the first time the dnc is using a livestream, usa today reports, and it will be chock-full of celebrity guests including marc anthony, elizabeth banks, olivia wilde, and zach braff, among others. Penn — of whom sasha and malia obama are reportedly big fans — already taped an interview with michelle obama at the charlotte arena where the convention kicks off tonight. But mitt romney has a big celeb fan of his own: nicki minaj. Rapdose reports that a new song, \" mercy, \" from lil wayne's latest mixtape, includes minaj rapping the line: \" i ' m a republican voting for mitt romney, you lazy b****es are f***ing up the economy. \"",

            "President obama gets a little help from harold and kumar in a new youtube spot for the democratic national convention. While not explicitly mentioned by name, kal penn ( as kumar ) and john cho ( as harold ) reprise their characters from the stoner film franchise, making cameo appearances in the nearly minute-long video. ( their only other presidential interaction was a bonding session with george w. Bush in harold and kumar escape from guantanamo bay ). The promo, which was uploaded monday, starts off seriously enough, with obama picking up the phone in what appears to be the white house, and calling an unidentified person. \" hey, this is barack. Listen, i need to know if you're on board, \" he says while sitting at a desk. \" ' cause i ' m counting on you. Everybody is. We have to get this right. So there's a lot at stake here. Just remember that i ' m trusting you on this, and i ' ll see you then. \" the camera then pans to a shot of cho and penn sitting on a couch, while watching cartoons and eating junk food. As it turns out, obama was speaking to penn, who takes the entire conversation in stride. Check out the video above to see what happens. Viewers can watch the dnc live on barackobama.com. Penn is slated to host coverage of the event, which will take place in charlotte, n.c., on sept. 6. The actor is a national campaign co-chair for obama, and previously served as an associate director of the white house office of public engagement.

It just would've been tricky to make it a public takeover, because corporations don't know how to value a newspaper's future earnings. And besides, though the markets have been remarkably patient with amazon's continued losses, a money pit like the post would've been harder",
            "Jeff bezos is an investor in business insider, so in the wake of news that he's buying the washington post, folks have been asking me two questions: the answer to the first question is that it's great to have jeff bezos as an investor. Any company that cares about building great products and services and long-term value could not ask for a better backer. He's patient and brilliant and he leads by example: if you ever have a question about how you should do something, you just look at amazon. Unlike the typical financial investor, moreover, jeff bezos really is focused on the long term. Whenever there's an opportunity to reinvest would-be profits today in an exciting project that might pay off tomorrow, jeff bezos will take it. And when he's an investor in your company, you ' ll feel like you should take it, too. So, anyone rooting for the washington post to transform into a successful digital business should be thrilled that jeff bezos is buying it. ( anyone hoping the washington post will never change, meanwhile, should find some other status quo to cling to. The status quo at the post is dying with or without bezos. ) as to the second question, why jeff bezos is buying the washington post... I don '"

A feud with a fan site leaking her songs was enough to push nicki minaj off twitter in 2012. She, too, is back. Alec baldwin has quit twitter a number of times. Most recently, he left after a controversial rant, and said he'd never return. His foundation is still on there, though. Mega-tweeter john mayer briefly quit in 2010. Supposedly, his love of twitter caused jennifer aniston to leave him. Not surprisingly, he's back. Haters and internet trolls, sadly, drove adele off twitter, but she came back ( or at least her official account did ).

Don't let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good. — lauren duca ( @laurenduca ) december 23, 2016 carlson was quick to bring up the tweet above from duca in relation to the trump incident before pivoting to her article in teen vogue titled \"donald trump is gaslighting america. \" this would all be fair game under normal circumstances, but carlson seems to want to call out duca as opposed to debating what was said in her tweets and in the article. To the teen vogue writer's credit, she stood her ground and defended herself against carlson and her position against the trump administration:"

Globally, centenarians are expected to number 3.2 million by 2050, which \"indicates an urgent need to ensure adequate long-term care, \" a study author says. So what can doctors do? emphasize home care when centenarians are ill, and anticipate the sudden infections that lead to a decline in their health, she says.

And sergio canavero — the italian doctor behind the alleged procedure, says he plans to do the same thing next on two brain-dead patients, followed by an \" imminent \" surgery with a living one, the telegraph reports. Per newsweek, canavero described the procedure friday at a vienna press conference, explaining that his team had taken the head off one body and placed it on another, fusing the spine, blood vessels, and nerves. The procedure with a living patient is set to happen in china in december, mainly because the us and europe refuse to host it. Medical experts say there haven't been enough studies or trials, and cite both ethical issues and the potential for \" incredible pain. \" mystery surrounds the living patient at the center of the storm, whose healthy head would be transferred to the disease-free body of a brain-dead patient — technically making this a \" body transplant, \" not a head transplant, usa today notes. That recipient was originally said to be 33-year-old russian valery spiridonov, who suffers from a muscle-wasting disease. But an april release cited by newsweek said a chinese citizen would undergo the procedure, not spiridonov, and the magazine on friday quoted canavero as saying a \" high number \" of people have volunteered. Canavero gives the procedure a 90 % chance of success.

The 46-year-old hanson was arrested by the island's 15-member police force last wednesday after a tip from a local who recognized him from a wanted poster, and he was brought back to the us sunday to face charges of international parental kidnapping, the seattle times reports.

The us attorney's office says jeffrey hanson is a \" known drug abuser. \" he and joanna hanson are divorced, and jeffrey had monthly visitation rights, the times leader reports. Billy had gone on summer visits for the past five years, and one of jeffrey hanson's friends told the fbi the man would abuse his son on those visits, including hitting him to \" toughen \" him up. As for billy, he stayed on the island for a few days while authorities arranged to return him to his mother, and according to the editor of the niue star newspaper, he seemed none the worse for wear. \" i saw him at a barbecue on friday and he did not look stressed, \" the editor says, adding that locals were looking after him and the 9-year-old seemed to be treating the whole thing as an adventure. \" he had a niue t-shirt on and was enjoying himself. \" it's not clear where the boy is now; the fbi said monday that authorities were still working to reunite him with his mom.

Bloomberg thinks that company is nike — the deal outlined in the documents, it notes, \" mirrors \" the decade-long deal nike made with brazil in 1996, a move that \" put nike on the global soccer map. \" the sportswear giant responded that it \" strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery \" and that it \" [ has ] been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate \" in the fifa investigation. Nike did not, however, specifically comment on the bribery allegation. Since getting the brazilian sponsorship, nike's total sales from soccer have skyrocketed from $ 40 million ( in 1994 ) to $ 2.27 billion last year. The company referred to in the indictment agreed to pay $ 160 million over the following decade for the exclusive selling rights to brazilian national team gear ( and the right to outfit the team in its gear, cnnmoney notes ), and in a separate agreement, allegedly also paid $ 40 million — via swiss bank account — to \" an official at a firm that buys and sells marketing rights in brazil, \" bloomberg reports. A \" high-ranking \" fifa and brazilian soccer official received some of that $ 40 million. Cnnmoney says the aforementioned \" official \" and \" firm \" are jose hawila and his traffic group; hawila has pleaded guilty to bribing fifa officials in order to make deals between fifa and would-be sponsors. Though bloomberg and outlets including the washington post frame the $ 40 million as a bribe, cnnmoney notes that the indictment does not specifically frame that payment, or an additional $ 30 million in fees the unnamed company paid traffic group between 1996 and 1999, as illegal. The documents do, however, say hawila and his company used that money to bribe fifa officials. ( click for a meaty fifa corruption guide. )",

Come get me! \" the washington post even posted an article calling the site a \"laughing stock, \" to the delight of conservatives like michelle malkin, who posted some mock attack watch posters on her blog. A parody commercial ( see video ) is also making the rounds. The sight has also garnered serious criticism from jack tapper of abc, who says it appears to be \"seeking to stop criticism, \" not smears. Still the site is something of a hit — obama 2012 boasts that 100,000 people signed up in its first 24 hours.",

( photos: nra annual meeting ) \"that same media is now the reliable poodle-skirted cheerleader for the president that writes the book on exploiting tragedy, \" she said, wearing a t-shirt that said \"women hunt. \" palin insisted that all americans felt \"despair, sadness and absolute anger \" when they saw what happened in connecticut. She said everyone should care more about those getting gunned down every single day on the streets of places like chicago and new york city, but that shouldn't guide public policy. \"now, emotion is a good and a necessary thing.

In the days leading up to the senate's april 17 vote on gun control proposals, the president invited families of newtown victims to fly on air force one to washington and lobby congress. Newtown families also participated in media interviews and appeared in an ad made by mayors against illegal guns, the pro-gun control group co-chaired by new york city mayor michael bloomberg. When the upper chamber ultimately fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass a bipartisan compromise to expand the background check system, some of those family members stood behind the president not long after the vote as he chided capitol hill for what he described as a \" shameful day in washington. \" palin argued the president was practicing the \" politics of emotion \" by"

A union lawyer argued in the letter written last week that a body-camera mandate \" will change several aspects of their job and regularly assigned duties. \" but city manager harry black on monday said he has the right to order cops to wear them and said their presence protects cops \" from frivolous and fraudulent claims. \" cameras are a flashpoint in the city, which wlwt reports has seen three fatal shootings this year involving police and where a white cop last year shot an unarmed black motorist after a traffic stop. University of cincinnati police officer raymond tensing said he had no choice but to open fire after sam dubose, 43, tried to run him over and dragged him with his car. A body cam video of the incident revealed that story to be a lie, prosecutors said. But lawyers for tensing insist it backs up the officer's version. He ' ll stand trial in october. The push to outfit all of the city's cops with cameras has been a year-long effort. Some 700 cameras have been purchased as part of a seven-year contract.

The vote split evenly along party lines, and increases the odds of a government shutdown, the washington post reports.

Now, it's boehner's move once more. Earlier today, president obama said he was \" not at all resigned \" to a shutdown, and urged lawmakers to \" set aside the short-term politics \" and make a deal, the hill reports. The shutdown hits at midnight unless something is done to stop it. Senate republicans have been floating the idea of passing a quick, one-week extension to give the sides more time to negotiate, but harry reid says he strongly opposes it.

Some senior facilities are hosting anti-bullying programs, which at least teach people about the problem. Most senior bullying is about exclusion, rumors, and name-calling rather than physical violence, one expert says, and is perpetrated mainly by women — which highlights the changes in gender disparity as we age. Some seniors apparently bully others to overcome a feeling of lost control that comes with age. But that's little consolation to marsha wetzel of niles, illinois, who sued a senior apartment complex after she was bullied for being lesbian, the chicago tribune reports. \" i'd just go in my room and barricade my door and just pray, \" says wetzel, now 70. \" i just felt like a slug, like i was nothing, like i wasn't even human. \"",

        "summary": "Americans appear to have experienced better mental health during the recent recession than during the years leading up to it. So say researchers out of the university of maryland who crunched data on depression, anxiety, and psychological disorders in a study published this week in plos one. The reason remains unclear, and the researchers say more investigation is needed in a post at eurekaalert. On the one hand, the drop in diagnoses could be because people who are out of work have less access to mental health services. On the other hand, it could be because they're spending more time with family or on leisure activities and are happier as a result. The study used data from the medical expenditure panel survey of 81,313 adults between 2005 and 2011. Both men and women saw better mental health and had lower odds of being diagnosed with depression during the 2007-09 recession, though women were more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety after the recession. Unemployed or low-income women in the northeast and midwest were most likely to be diagnosed with anxiety, which the lead researcher says \" could help policymakers craft targeted responses. \" the researchers think state-by-state analyses using unemployment rates could lead to better policies.

        "summary": "If the math seems unbelievable, that's because it kind of is: a 76-year-old retired marine lost the $ 197,000 washington, dc, home he had paid for in full 20 years ago — and all of the equity he had in it — because of an unpaid $ 134 property tax bill. In the first of a three-part series titled \" homes for the taking, \" the washington post investigates the evolution of a long-running dc lien program. Under it, a lien is slapped on a property belonging to a homeowner who hasn't paid taxes; investors essentially help the city \" collect \" by buying these liens at auction and charging interest. But where those investors were once of the \" mom-and-pop \" variety, they're now \" well-financed, out-of-town companies \" who charge interest for six months and can then foreclose on the property after that mark if the debt hasn't been paid; they can also slap on thousands in legal fees. The post has found 509 such instances of foreclosure ( about 200 homes, the rest commercial real estate, parking lots, and land ) since 2005; in bennie coleman's case, his $ 134 bill grew into a $ 4,999 debt. And many of the victims are \" vulnerable \": coleman is battling dementia; a 95-year-old woman in a nursing home with alzheimer's lost her home over a $ 44.79 debt. \" this is destroying lives, \" says an urban real estate professor.

            "At the district's auctions, no one was watching. A washington post investigation found that during berman's spectacular spending spree in the city, his companies engaged in dozens of rounds of irregular bidding similar to what federal agents had discovered in maryland. All told, six companies, three owned by berman, took turns winning hundreds of liens on real estate worth $ 540 million through unusual back-and-forth patterns of bidding never detected by city government. Of hundreds of participants, only those six companies stood out for bidding that was so irregular that the odds of it happening by chance were less than 1 in 1,000, according to the post's analysis, which was conducted with a team of economists and antitrust experts from boston. Once the liens were won, the companies charted an aggressive course through the district that would shake families for years to come, pressing to foreclose on homes in every ward — often over tax debts of $ 500 or less. The patterns call into question the city's vigilance in policing tax auctions at a time when the industry is under intense scrutiny, with a dozen tax lien purchasers pleading guilty to rigging auctions across the country. \"where is the protection for people? \" said sylvia richins, whose ailing mother's house in northwest washington was targeted for foreclosure by a berman",

        "summary": "Babies born to overweight mothers may be at greater risk of developing cerebral palsy, new research shows. Scientists who followed 1.4 million babies born in sweden between 1997 and 2011 found that more than 3,000 developed the disorder, which the cdc says is the most common childhood motor skills disability. Researchers reported in jama that they while found no significant link to babies ' birth weight and cerebral palsy, they did see an association to maternal weight in full-term deliveries. The association increased as a mother's body mass index increased, per medical xpress. While the risk factor — 2 cases out of 1,000 births — may seem low, babies born to mothers severely obese in early pregnancy were twice at risk, says lead researcher dr. Eduardo villamor, per healthday. The findings are important \" due to the large proportion of women who are overweight or obese worldwide, \" villamor says. In the us, half of all expectant moms are overweight at their first neonatal exam, per medical xpress. A columbia university expert tells healthday that cerebral palsy is 30 % to 40 % genetic, but factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes may trigger a genetic predisposition. Although more research is needed, villamor says losing weight before pregnancy is known to reduce ill effects on children. All the data show that \" it's good to get to a healthy weight before pregnancy, \" an obstetrician tells healthday. ( fish oil during pregnancy may cut babies ' asthma risk. )",

Most of the 1,100 mers cases reported since 2012 have come from the middle east, where 470 have died. All confirmed cases in south korea have been found in patients, visitors, or staff members at five hospitals the government has chosen not to name — despite a poll showing 83 % of people demand they be identified, reuters reports. Test results are pending for 99 suspected carriers, while 1,364 are being monitored for symptoms in isolation, the new york times reports. More than 230 schools were shut down today amid fear of the virus'spread. However, a rep at a crisis management consulting firm says \" a lot of fear we see now is rooted in the distrust of the government \" after its response to the sewol ferry disaster. The outbreak has been traced to a 68-year-old man who returned to the country on may 4 after traveling to qatar, bahrain, the united arab emirates, and saudi arabia. He visited three clinics on may 11 after developing a fever and cough but didn't disclose his trip; he wasn't properly diagnosed until may 20. A doctor, nurse, and 24 people at a hospital the man visited have since tested positive. A 58-year-old woman who had contact with the patient but was treated for asthma and released, died of mers on monday. \" we apologize for the inappropriate initial responses, \" south korea's health minister says. \" we were too relaxed. \" third-generation infections have been reported, meaning the initial patient infected a second patient who infected a third, and \" further cases can be expected, \" the who says, per usa today.

        "summary": "Planning a trip to the moon? you might want to think about heart health first. According to a study published in scientific reports, travel in deep space dramatically raises the risk of cardiovascular disease. Florida state university researchers looked at america's apollo astronauts, who are the only people ever to have gone to deep space, and found that they were four to five times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than other astronauts, nbc news reports. Eight of the 24 apollo astronauts have died, and of the seven deaths looked at, three, including neil armstrong, were from cardiovascular disease. That works out to roughly 45 %, compared with around 10 % among astronauts who either remained in low earth orbit or never went to space at all. The study suggests that leaving the earth's protective magnetosphere, which deflects cosmic radiation, even for short periods can do long-term damage to the cardiovascular system, according to the researchers. They say that since astronauts are selected from some of the most physically fit people around, the link wasn't uncovered until the apollo crews were compared to other astronauts instead of the general public. Former nasa astronaut jeff hoffman says the implications are clear: space travel needs to be fast. \" we can't shield against high-energy cosmic radiation, not with our current mass-limiting capabilities, but it does re-emphasize the importance of getting to mars as quickly as possible, \" he tells the guardian.

The 23-year-old woman had been bitten on the right arm by a small nurse shark that wouldn't let go even after a bystander killed it, the palm beach post reports. A boca raton regional hospital spokesperson tells the ap the woman was treated and released on sunday afternoon, having presumably had the 2-foot shark removed from her arm. Witnesses say before the bite, the shark had been antagonized, possibly by the woman and her companion, who were seen near a submerged rock pile where nurse sharks are known to hang out. People were \" holding the shark by its tail. They were messing with it, \" 11-year-old nate pachter, who had been snorkeling nearby, tells the south florida sun sentinel. The species has a strong bite and large numbers of very sharp teeth, but it is so laid-back it is \" considered the ' couch potato ' of the shark world, \" according to the national park service. \" attacks on humans are rare but not unknown, and a clamping bite typically results from a diver or fisherman antagonizing the shark with hook, spear, net, or hand, \" an nps fact page states. \" the bite reflex is such that it may be some minutes before a quietly re-immersed nurse shark will relax and release its tormentor. \" ( on the other side of the country, countless tiny red crabs are washing up on california's beaches. )",

            "The campaign against photo retouching continues in australia this decade, where marie claire has put supermodel jennifer hawkins naked and unretouched ( groundbreaking! ) on the cover of the february issue. The issue supports the butterfly foundation, an organization that provides support to australians struggling with eating disorders and body-image issues. You may be thinking, since when do eating-disorder groups use essentially fatless 26-year-old supermodels to help average women feel better about their own bodies? but the foundation's general manager, julie parker, notes that the photo shows hawkins's flaws, such as a crease in her waist and dimples on her thighs. ( squint if you can't see them. ) when asked why the foundation did not put forward a more average australian woman, ms parker said magazines had tried that tactic in the past, to no avail. \" the thing is unfortunately it doesn't make the same point, because jennifer sells magazines and she creates awareness. If marie claire had chosen to put on their cover an ordinary women, say myself or a friend of yours, it would not have created the awareness it does. \""

The 17-year-old pakistani activist is certainly worthy, he writes at the website. Just one thing, though: can we please do away with the \" irritatingly smug and condescending \" coverage of her being \" the bravest girl in the world, \" he asks. It's a disservice to her, and it belittles what she's up to these days. The good news is that the poise she has shown on the world stage, along with her willingness to challenge leaders including president obama, suggests that she \" isn't going to let herself be reduced to a cuddly caricature. \" which is the way it should be, observes amy davidson at the new yorker. \" it is past time to stop seeing malala as simply the girl who survived, as a symbol, \" writes davidson. \" she is a girl who leads. \" consider that death threats against the teen have not stopped, but nor have they silenced her. \" the worst insult to malala would be to regard her as nothing more than a child performer for peace, kept in a moment we want to keep hearing about. \" she became the youngest-ever recipient of the nobel peace prize today, but it's as much about her future as her past.

The autonomous nation of anarchist libertarians, or anal, got into the home through an open window on monday. They say they're currently housing 25 or so people who had been sleeping on the street.

Another count found more than 200,000 homes that have been empty for more than half a year. Anal calls that an \" injustice. \" the group says it researched the home before moving in, discovering it was purchased by russian oligarch andrey goncharenko, who has bought four fancy houses in london over the past three years. One squatter tells the telegraph they \" figured the damage caused to him compared to the gains for the homeless community is nothing. \" the squatter says the house could mean the difference between life and death for homeless people during freezing winter weather.

In fact, only 44 countries have ever won a medal of any type in the winter olympics, compared with 147 that have won a medal at the summer olympics.

Usa today has listened to dozens of hours of recordings from 2015-16, and the washington post did a similar deep dive to get a better handle on the views of one of the president's most influential advisers. Both analyses paint a similar picture: he views islam as a violent religion that poses a direct threat to the us and christianity, and he pushes american \" sovereignty \" strongly, hoping to limit immigration and ditch multi-nation trade agreements. Some of the snippets cited: in may, he called president bush's post-9/11 declaration that \" islam is peace \" the \" dumbest \" comments he made during his presidency. In fact, bannon called islam \" the most radical \" religion in the world. In november 2015, when gop rep. Ryan zinke said the us should stop bringing in syrian refugees until they can be better vetted, bannon interjected, \" why even let ' em in? \" vetting is expensive, he said, and the money could be better spent in the us. \" should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the world? \" in december, he said: \"i think that most people in the middle east, at least 50 %, believe in being sharia-compliant. If you're sharia-compliant or want to impose sharia law, the united states is the wrong place for you. \" ( a former nsa lawyer tells usa today that bannon is wrong. ) in criticizing \" progressive plutocrats in silicon valley, \" he said: \" engineering schools are all full of people from south asia, and east asia.... They've come in here to take these jobs. \" in november 2015, when talking about national security, he said: \" but you know what, we're in a war. We're clearly going into, i think, a major shooting war in the middle east again. \" in may, wondering if the nation was ready to follow his lead: \" is that grit still there, that tenacity, that we've seen on the battlefields...

Over two years, irs field office agents repeatedly changed their criteria while sifting through thousands of applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status to select ones for possible closer examination, the findings showed. At one point, the agents chose to screen applications from groups focused on making \" america a better place to live. \" exactly who at the irs made the decisions to start applying extra scrutiny was not clear from the findings, which were",
            "The internal revenue service's scrutiny of conservative groups went beyond those with \" tea party \" or \" patriot \" in their names — as the agency admitted friday — to also include ones worried about government spending, debt or taxes, and even ones that lobbied to \" make america a better place to live, \" according to new details of a government probe. The investigation into the irs's targeting of conservative groups has revealed that high-ranking irs officials knew as early as 2011 of the practice. John mckinnon reports. The investigation also revealed that a high-ranking irs official knew as early as mid-2011 that conservative groups were being inappropriately targeted — nearly a year before then-irs commissioner douglas shulman told a congressional committee the agency wasn't targeting conservative groups. Enlarge image close associated press tax-exempt groups organized under section 501( c ) ( 4 ) of the internal revenue code are allowed",
            "At various points over the past two years, internal revenue service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with \"tea party \" or \"patriot \" in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate americans about the u.s. Constitution, according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency's inspector general. The documents, obtained by the washington post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings, show that the irs field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that \"criticize how the country is being run \" and those that were involved in educating americans \"on the constitution and bill of rights. \" the staffers in the cincinnati field office were making high-level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the irs assigned all applications to that unit.

The campaign describes the 1968 medical deferment, which trump says was for bone spurs in his heels, as \" minor \" and \" short-term, \" but it appears to have kept him out of the war during the crucial 18 months before he drew a high draft number in december 1969, reports politico, which notes that the biggest question is whether trump got the deferment by bringing a letter from his family doctor citing the bone spur problem. Plenty of people of military age poorer than trump with \" no doctor but health issues bigger than bone spurs \" were drafted, politico notes. The trump campaign, asked whether there was a doctor's letter, responded only with a general campaign statement that notes trump's role in creating the \" vietnam war memorial in lower manhattan, for which he contributed a tremendous sum of money. \" trump has been condemned by nearly all his gop rivals, but in a usa today op-ed, he sidesteps the vietnam issue and continues to attack mccain, accusing him of abandoning veterans and saying he has \" failed the state of arizona and the country. \" he also blasts his gop rivals as \" failed politicians or people who would be unable to succeed in the private sector. \"",

The three-man eastern new york correctional facility team was declared the winner on sept. 18 after debating for an hour with harvard's team, which won the national title this year, the ap reports. In a facebook post, the harvard undergraduates said they were proud to lose to the \" phenomenally intelligent and articulate team \" of inmates. The prison team — which wasn't allowed to use the internet for research — made the case against allowing undocumented children into public schools, a position with which they personally disagreed. The three inmates, who are all serving time in napanoch, new york, for violent crimes, have been studying as part of an initiative led by nearby bard college. Before last month's harvard debate, they had already scored victories against west point and a university of vermont team, reports the wall street journal, which notes that very few of the inmates who've earned degrees under the nearly 15-year-old bard program have ended up back behind bars. \" debating has changed our lives and this confirmed how powerful a tool education and debating can be, \" the president of the harvard college debating union tells boston.com.

        "summary": "\" we want google to end its illegal behavior, \" says eu antitrust chief margrethe vestager, per the guardian, and the regulator hopes a record $ 5.06 billion fine will compel it to do so. Described by the wall street journal as the eu's \" sharpest rebuke yet \" to the power wielded by the upper echelon of tech companies, the bloc on wednesday imposed the fine and ordered google to stop pushing its apps in a way that stymies competitors. It has 90 days to comply or parent company alphabet could be hit with additional fines of up to 5 % of its average daily turnover. Google says it will appeal. The journal explains that all but about 20 % of all smartphones run on the android operating system, and the allegation was that google used that dominance as leverage to push its own apps. The verge outlines the three alleged practices the regulator viewed as illegal and detrimental to competitors, two of which are allegedly still active: that google stipulated that android device manufacturers could only incorporate access to google's play store if it shipped those devices with the google search app and chrome browser pre-installed, and that it barred manufacturers from using \" forked \" versions of android. Bloomberg offers a very clear primer on the issue, starting with how android became so dominant in the first place and recapping the record fine the eu hit google with last year. The bbc notes paying the fine wouldn't be a massive blow to alphabet should it have to pay it; its cash holdings at the end of q1 were a hair over $ 100 billion.",

But when he tried to spread the wealth locally, offering $ 14,000 to the prosser school district and the boys and girls club, his donation was refused, the ap reports. The school district — whose superintendent has been a vocal opponent of marijuana legalization in washington — said no because it \" would send an inconsistent message to … students, \" as the yakima herald-republic puts it. The district also says there's more pot now in its schools since legalization.

        "summary": "A lawsuit filed tuesday claims the fcc broke federal law when it voted to repeal net neutrality rules in a move labeled \" arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion, \" reuters reports. As promised, a lawsuit filed by 21 state attorneys general, all democrats, argues the fcc will allow internet service providers \" to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online, \" new york attorney general eric t. Schneiderman says, per the new york times. \" every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider, \" adds california ag xavier becerra. Their comments were echoed by nonprofit mozilla and the open technology institute, which filed separate suits claiming the repeal would increase internet fees for entrepreneurs. Public interest groups free press and public knowledge also filed motions tuesday to protect obama-era rules barring isps from throttling traffic, though legal challenges are technically prohibited until the fcc's new rules are entered into the federal registry; that's expected to happen in the near future. In the meantime, senate democrats aren't giving up hope of blocking the fcc action. All 49 democrats, plus republican sen. Susan collins of maine, have endorsed legislation to prevent the repeal of net neutrality rules, reports the hill. That means democrats need one more gop vote to move the legislation to the house. It's unlikely to pass the house, and it would surely face president trump's veto even if it did, reuters notes. Still, democrats hope their efforts will win favor among young voters ahead of the midterm elections, reports the ap.",

But a source with ties to the duggars told the magazine last week \" divorce is not even something that will be discussed, \" and another source close to the family previously said anna \" doesn't get mad \" because \" it's not godly for a woman. \"",
