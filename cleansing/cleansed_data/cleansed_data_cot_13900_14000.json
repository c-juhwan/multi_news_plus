The sun sentinel in august 2015 took a look back at the deadly storm on its 80th anniversary, opening with this ominous line: it \" was so powerful that it sand-blasted clothing off of people who got caught in its vicious winds. \" usa today echoes that, more gruesomely: \" some people were literally sandblasted to death. \" in 2014, the miami herald reported 423 bodies were found in the immediate wake of the storm; 259 of those who died were wwi veterans who were constructing the overseas highway through the keys and were living in government camps. Some islands were only connected via railroad bridges at the time, explained the herald, and though a train was sent to evacuate the veterans, it ended up getting caught up in the storm surge. The railroad never resumed operation. The hurricane was one of only three category 5 storms to have hit the us in recorded history, the others being hurricane camille in 1969 and hurricane andrew in 1992. But usa today notes another storm reigns as the deadliest: a 1900 hurricane that ravaged galveston, texas, and killed as many as 8,000. ( here's how to keep tabs on irma. )",

Australian researchers gave people from various age groups a series of decisions to make on hypothetical wagers, and those older than 65 fared worse than everyone else, including the young whippersnappers aged 12 to 17, reports the los angeles times. And this isn't about dementia — everybody in the study was healthy and understood the questions — or about betting prowess. Many of the questions boiled down to simple logic. The seniors were more likely to make \" irrational \" decisions, such as forgoing a guaranteed win of $ 5 for a riskier choice to win the same amount. Seniors were also far more inconsistent in their decision-making, being too cautious in some situations and too risky in others. So what is the best age group? a separate study by the brooking institute finds that middle-aged people tend to pay lower prices for a range of financial products — mortgage rates, bank fees, credit cards, auto loans, etc. — than older or younger people. In fact, the perfect age in terms of that seems to be 53, reports medical daily. \"middle-aged adults may be at a decision-making sweet spot, \" say the authors. \" they have substantial practical experience and have not yet suffered significant declines in fluid intelligence. \"",

Vanity fair described the casting process as a game \" rather disturbing in its realism, \" in which cambodian kids were asked to snatch money off a table ( after thinking of something they needed it for ), then asked to create a lie about why they'd needed the money after being \" captured. \" the actress eventually tapped to play ung reportedly became \" overwhelmed with emotion \" during her own audition, noting she'd been thinking of her grandfather's death and her family's inability to pay for his funeral. All of which had people railing against jolie for her \" emotionally abusive and cruel \" casting methods, per the bbc. But jolie says, via a statement to variety, that the audition was simply an improv exercise based on a scene from the film and that real money wasn't used. \" i am upset, \" she says, adding: \" i would be outraged myself if this had happened, \" referring to the \" false and upsetting \" prospect of real cash being ripped away from kids. She also notes \" every measure was taken to ensure the safety, comfort, and well-being of the children on the film \" and to \" make sure that no one was in any way hurt by participating in the re-creation of such a painful part of their country's history. \" producer rithy panh also issued his own statement, noting that guardians, tutors, doctors, and therapists were all on the set to help kids along during the filmmaking process.",

Zoo authorities say that after southern white rhino wallis came to the zoo from south africa in november 2015, evidence including a wound near her heart that wouldn't heal led them to believe the 5-year-old female might have been shot at some point, the los angeles times reports. With the help of an extremely powerful metal detector brought in by the san diego fire-rescue bomb squad, the zoo has confirmed that there was metal inside the 3,000-pound animal. Keepers were preparing wallis for exploratory surgery when they discovered that a bullet fragment had worked its way back to the wound, so they called zoo veterinarian dr. Jim oosterhuis over to remove it. \" i reached into the wound with my leatherman tool, grasped the object, made a quick jerking motion, and out popped the bullet fragment with jagged edges, \" oosterhuis says in a zoo press release. \" it feels great to know that we finally have found what we believe to be the source of her infection. By having the fragment work itself out, it eliminated the need for surgery. \" he believes poachers were aiming for a heart or lung shot, but \" she turned toward them and the shot came in at a shallow angle and bounced off a rib. \" wallis was brought to the zoo as part of a program to bring the northern white rhino back from the edge of extinction.

Photograph: ron english/news 3 an american couple have scooped $ 2.4m ( £ 1.45m ) after winning the most anticipated jackpot in las vegas slot machines. Walter and linda misco from new hampshire had been playing the lion's share machine for just five minutes when they watched the three green emblems line up horizontally on the jackpot pay line on friday night, the mgm grand casino said in a statement. \" we've waited over 20 years for this! our famous lion's share finally hit for $ 2.4 million, \" the casino said. The machine had attracted queues of punters for two decades due to its mouthwatering jackpot, which accumulated over 20 years of parsimony. The lion's share was the most popular slot of 1,900 at the mgm grand, and was played almost once every five seconds each day.

        "summary": "In an unprecedented snub, us figure skating has left the third place finisher at saturday's us figure skating championships off its olympic roster — in favor of a fourth-place finisher who described her own performance as \" embarrassing. \" why? because that fourth-place finisher was ashley wagner, winner of the 2012 and 2013 national championships, and, coincidentally enough, one of the athletes nbc has been most heavily promoting ahead of the sochi games, the new york times reports. Indeed, philip hersh at the la times writes that there \" was little doubt \" she'd get the nod yesterday, despite a \" dismal \" free skate. Wagner fell twice in that free skate, and neither her short nor long programs contained a triple-triple combination, the minimum required to medal in sochi. She was selected over mirai nagasu, the only skater with what hersh calls an \" essentially clean \" free skate, and the only one with olympic experience. Until now, the us has always taken its top championship finishers, except in cases of injury. But committee rules actually allow it to consider a skater's body of work, and nagasu finished seventh at the past two championships. Wagner will join first-place finisher gracie gold and polina edmunds on the us team; the times sees gold as a bronze contender in sochi. Hersh notes no one named \" gold \" has ever won an olympic medal.",

Equality minister marlene schiappa on monday announced that 15 had been selected after consulting in part with doctors and legal experts. The bbc explains the new limit will brand sex with anyone under 15 as rape; under current law, prosecutors have to prove the child was forced into sex. The washington post elaborates, reporting that with rape charges difficult to prove, many defendants faced a lesser charge of sexual abuse of a minor, which was punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to roughly $ 90,000. Rape convictions carry heftier punishments. A firestorm erupted after two men — one 30, one 28 — were recently accused of having sex with 11-year-olds. The first man was acquitted of rape, with the court stating there wasn't evidence the girl had been threatened or violently forced. In the second case, the initial charges were not rape but sexual relations with a minor; the family protested, reports the afp, and the charges were subsequently upgraded. The government is expected to approve the new age limit as soon as next week, per the post.",

        "summary": "The fbi hasn't ruled out any motive — including terrorism — in friday's mass shooting at a florida airport. George l. Piro, special agent in charge of the fbi's miami office, says the agency will track the movements of alleged gunman esteban santiago, 26, in what is expected toe be \" a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation, \" the sun-sentinel reports. Santiago, an iraq veteran who reportedly told the fbi's anchorage field office in november that the government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch isis videos, was taken into custody after five people were killed and eight others injured at fort lauderdale-hollywood international airport. A round-up of developments: officials tell the new york times that it is too early to tell whether santiago's actions were inspired by terrorist groups, though he is believed to have viewed extremist material online. Florida gov. Rick scott visited the airport friday evening and condemned what he called a \" senseless act of evil. \" \" whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law, \" scott said, per the guardian. \" the state of florida, the citizens of florida, law enforcement, will not tolerate evil acts. \" when asked why he had contacted donald trump instead of president obama for help from the federal government, scott said this \" isn't time to be political. \" cnn looks at the background of santiago, who allegedly starting firing after he picked up the gun he had declared in his checked baggage on his flight from alaska to florida. He was deployed to iraq with the puerto rico national guard from april 23, 2010, to feb. 19, 2011, authorities say. He later joined the alaska army national guard, but was discharged on aug. 16, 2016 for unsatisfactory performance. An aunt who lives in new jersey tells northjersey.com that santiago was happy after his son was born in september last year but his mental condition deteriorated afterward. \" like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind, \" the aunt says. \" he said he saw things. \" the aunt tells cnn that santiago returned from iraq a changed man who sometimes seemed lost. He \" talked about all the destruction and the killing of children. He had visions all the time, \" she says. The times reports that he served with the 130th engineer battalion, which cleared roads of ieds in iraq. His record suggests he wasn't in combat, though two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks. Santiago was charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend last january",

But odds are we've already experienced a phenomenom called \" emotional hangover. \" that's the name neuroscientists have given to that heartsick feeling that trails painful experiences or the euphoria we feel after a happy occurrence. Now a new study shows that emotional episodes can have a long-term effect on the brain and can shape how we remember future experiences, forbes reports. \" ' emotion ' is a state of mind, \" lead author lila davachi says in a news release. \" these findings make clear that our cognition is highly influenced by preceding experiences and, specifically, that emotional brain states can persist for long periods of time. \" for the study, researchers showed one group of participants emotional images followed by neutral images, and reversed the order for another group. Writing in the journal nature neuroscience, the authors say those who saw the emotional pictures first were more likely to recall the images that followed. \" we see that memory for non-emotional experiences is better if they are encountered after an emotional event, \" says davachi. Brain scans backed up the findings. While it is known that certain regions of the brain — the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial temporal lobe — are linked to emotional memory, the study found these regions were stimulated longer than previously thought, per the international business times. One takeaway, says davachi, is that the study suggests emotion helps shape how we \" see the world. \" ( this ice cream is made for hangovers. )",

        "summary": "Parents in australia who don't have their children immunized by jan. 1 will soon find themselves embroiled in what the country calls its \" no jab, no pay \" laws — meaning if they don't take their kids for vaccinations by then, they ' ll lose childcare benefits, rebates, and a federal tax benefit, yahoo australia reports. The legislation passed the country's senate on monday, leaving only exemptions for medical reasons, meaning that parents who opt out of vaccination for philosophical or religious reasons would miss out on welfare payments that could total up to $ 15,000 australian ( nearly $ 11,000 us ) per year, abc news australia reports. The paper notes that close to 40,000 aussie kids under the age of 7 haven't been immunized due to parental objections, while the sydney morning herald cites a stat from australia's health department that says 1.8 % of the country's kids were registered as conscientious objectors in 2014, up from 0.2 % in 1999. The new laws will save about $ 500 million over four years, the herald notes. There's some back-and-forth over timing, with at least one aussie leader noting the changes should be delayed until 2018 to get data systems up to speed; another lawmaker, though, says parents would have at least two weeks to remedy the situation before payments are nixed, per yahoo. One legislator in particular wants to go even further and take away most welfare for all parents and their \" little blighters. \" \" the government is not your parent or your spouse — get over it, \" liberatarian sen. David leyonhjelm said monday, grumbling \" the least they can do is immunize their bundles of dribble and sputum so they don't make the rest of us sick, \" per yahoo. Leyonhjelm also thanked \" the childless people of australia \" for their productivity and for subsidizing benefits, per the sydney morning herald — which he says is like having people in \" wheelchairs pay for other people's running shoes, \" yahoo notes.",

Coworkers figured it was meant ironically. Snowden didn't fool nsa colleagues into giving him passwords, as one report stated, or create ssh keys to gain access without authorization. He was simply given access to the nsa's system. Why? \" that kid was a genius among geniuses, \" the staffer said. \" nsa is full of smart people, but anybody who sat in a meeting with ed will tell you he was in a class of his own … i've never seen anything like it. \" the nsa was so impressed by a backup system snowden made before joining the agency, officials implemented it to break codes. They also offered him a position on an elite hacking team, which he turned down. Two fascinating details: snowden kept a copy of the constitution and used it in arguments over nsa activities that he considered violations.

Still, many in the medical field cite a lack of sufficient research and too much overlap with currently described disorders, from anorexia to obsessive compulsive disorder, to warrant its own classification, reports the washington post. \" the dietary obsessions that people get into with anorexia often lead into these kinds of concerns with proper nutrition and healthy eating, \" says the director of an eating disorders program. \" there's a great deal of overlap. \" still, while he says \" we treat people based on research, \" he concedes it isn't necessarily a bad thing for people to self-identify with orthorexia and seek to obsess a little less. Which is exactly what former vegan blogger jordan younger did — revealing on her wildly-popular instagram page that she had become so anxious about the food she ate it was making her sick, reports broadly. Once she went public, she says, \" a flood of people came forward saying they identified with me. \" karin kratina, a 30-year veteran therapist focusing on eating disorders, says the rise in orthorexic patients is \" serious \" and that the problem is \" we have moralized eating, weight, food, and exercise. Food has become presented — more and more — as the answer. \" the issue is not without precedent. People can, for instance, exercise themselves right into the grave. But for whatever the reason, eating healthily in moderation is for some easier said than done. ( is healthy eating a privilege of the rich? )",

Sam graves, chairman of the house small business committee, said in a statement, adding that, \"if small firms failed to provide services this frequently, they would be fired. \" john arensmeyer, chief executive of small business majority, a lobbying group, said the federal marketplace still offers competitive prices for employers willing to enroll through the available channels — but he acknowledged the importance of a functioning web site. \"it's disappointing that the online portion of the federal small business marketplace through healthcare.gov will be delayed and it's important it get",

Not just started with her doing that to me. \" but when it comes to the accusations against him, kelly is less forthcoming: he won't confirm whether he and aaliyah were married or in a sexual relationship ( because she's no longer here to speak for herself ) and he won't confirm whether it's him in the 2002 sex tape that got him put on trial for child porn ( his lawyers have advised him not to say anything about it, all these years later ). He does offer two unequivocal \" absolutely not \" answers — once when asked whether he enjoys urinating on a woman as part of sex, as the man in the aforementioned sex tape is shown doing, and once when insisting, \" do i like to sleep with underage girls? absolutely not. \" circling back to his comment about child molestation being a \" generational curse, \" kelly insists he managed to break the curse in his own life.

Cory booker of new jersey showed just how dramatic the brett kavanaugh hearings became thursday morning as he and fellow democrats continued to complain about withheld or off-limits documents. Booker drew big headlines with an early statement that, in the name of transparency, he was going to release kavanaugh documents deemed \" committee classified. \" that set off a debate on whether he could theoretically be expelled from the senate for doing so — a debate that \" fizzled \" later when it emerged that the documents he made public actually had been authorized for release, notes npr. The details: the beef, explained: booker thinks republicans are keeping way too many documents off limits in the hearing, especially ones that have nothing to do with national security. He called the vetting process by a lawyer for george w. Bush ( kavanaugh used to work in the bush white house ) a \" bit of a sham \" and vowed to circumvent it, per the ap the documents: booker and fellow democratic sen. Mazie hirono each posted documents online ( here and here ) thursday morning. Turns out, those posted documents weren't classified after all — they had been authorized for release about 4am eastern, reports the washington post. However, it's possible that booker did, in fact, violate senate rules wednesday night when he talked about those \" committee confidential \" emails. Expulsion? on thursday, booker vowed to \" knowingly violate \" senate rules in posting the documents. As tweeted by white house press official rah shah ( before the status of the documents was clear ), senate rules state that any senator who divulges \" the secret or confidential business of the senate \" can be expelled. Still, only 15 senators have been expelled in history, and none since the civil war, notes heavy.com. It requires a two-thirds majority vote, meaning 15 democrats would have to vote against booker.",

She'd been on her way home from the mall after buying clothes for her approaching high school graduation. He'd already had two duis — his first when he was 17 — and was driving on a suspended license when he killed caitlin, reports the chicago tribune. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit and he had marijuana in his system. Now, after serving five years in prison and two years of probation, police say 34-year-old stitt was found unconscious up against his steering wheel just before midnight saturday after allegedly crashing into two parked cars 4 miles from his home. No one's been reported injured. Stitt was arrested when he failed a field sobriety test and charged with felony aggravated dui, and palatine police say he's being held on $ 75,000 bail and due back in court dec. 15. As of late last night, he was still in custody. \" i obviously am disappointed and the family is disappointed, \" caitlin's stepfather tells the daily herald. \" this stirs up a whole new set of feelings that had been kind of under the surface for quite some time. I feel bad for a lot of people.... This is bad for his family just like it's bad for our family. \" if he's convicted, stitt could be sentenced to up to five years in prison. ( in nearby wisconsin, a drunk 13-year-old was caught driving her mom's car. )",

And a 2009 defamation act made the act punishable with a $ 30,000 fine, according to the washington post. But that could change. The country is holding a referendum this fall to determine if the blasphemy passage should be deleted from the constitution, reports the new york times. The law is not enforced, although a constitutional law scholar said prosecution could occur in an \"egregious case, \" per the times. And in fact, a few have run afoul of it, including stephen fry, an actor who was reported to the police after saying on tv, \"why should i respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain? \" the investigation was eventually dropped, but it sparked outrage and drew attention to the 2009 law, which defines blasphemy as a \"matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion, \" per the irish times. In countries where blasphemy is punished harshly, ireland's law is held up as admirable. \"we became a western poster boy for islamic states and their oppressive practices, \" michael nugent, a spokesman for an atheism advocacy group, told the new york times. \"it's never a good look when pakistan, where people are killed for blasphemy, is speaking approvingly of your laws. \" voters will also weigh in on language regarding women. Critics would be happy to see a section deleted that says, \"the state shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. \" the passage is \"very patriarchal, \" said one critic. \"it never did women any good. \"",

Republican paul ryan of the house and democrat patty murray of the senate announced the $ 85 billion package this evening, with votes in both chambers expected by week's end. As expected, the word \" modest \" is turning up in most accounts. The deal restores about $ 63 billion in cuts to military and domestic programs that had been mandated by the sequester, an amount that would be offset by cuts and fees elsewhere. For example, air travelers can expect to pay $ 5 more for a round-trip flight thanks to an increased security fee, reports ap. Also, federal workers will have to pay more toward their own pensions. Democrats lost one of their key battles — the extension of long-term unemployment benefits — though they promised to keep pressing the issue. Republicans, on the other hand, didn't get any changes in medicare and social security, notes the washington post, which has a breakdown of what's in the measure. Despite ryan's involvement, conservatives were chafing at the roll-back of sequester cuts, reports the new york times. \"the american people demanded, and were promised, reasonable spending limits, \" says the president of americans for prosperity. \"politicians choosing to go back on their promise will be held accountable for their actions. \" as the hill notes: \" the big question is whether that package will be accepted in the house. \"",

A warehouse near los angeles was full of some 20,000 rats, snakes, and other reptiles who faced long-term mistreatment; many were dead and maggot-ridden, and the rest had to be euthanized, the press-enterprise reports.

Cleanup efforts cost the city of lake elsinore some $ 94,000. Animal rights groups, including peta, had been investigating the company; peta used an undercover informant who shot video of employees. Investigators and activists reported shocking cruelty: animals were starved and dehydrated, and \" some were literally eating each other alive \"; workers fired bb guns at animals; video shows employees swinging a rat by its tail; animals were slammed into objects and thrown in trash cans; snakes were transported in deli cups.

The study tracked 89,000 women aged 24 to 43 and concluded that women who ate the most red meat had a 22 % higher risk of developing the cancer, the bbc reports. \" replacing red meat with a combination of legumes, poultry, nuts, and fish may reduce the risk of breast cancer, \" they wrote, though other experts say that dozens of other studies have failed to establish any connection between breast cancer and diet. \" diet is notoriously difficult to measure, \" a cancer expert at oxford university tells the guardian. \" the most reliable measure of meat consumption is whether or not people are vegetarian. Vegetarians do not have lower risks of breast cancer than non-vegetarians, further supporting other evidence that meat consumption is unlikely to play a major role in breast cancer. \" the harvard researchers, however, say most other studies have looked at diet in midlife or later, not in young adulthood — and an american cancer society expert tells the ap that the connection is plausible because \" breasts are still developing and are more susceptible to carcinogens before women have their first full-term pregnancy. \"",

But terre des hommes never actually accepted any money, cnet reports, and it didn't have to do any hacking to identify the users — they offered up their skype handles, social media profiles, and even pictures and phone numbers to sweetie, and terre des hommes turned that information over to interpol, though it's not clear anyone will actually be prosecuted.

Short's body, found in a vacant lot in los angeles in 1947, was sliced in two in what is known as a hemicorporectomy, taught while george hodel was in medical school ( the guardian details other gruesome details of the crime ). George died in 1999 and was never charged with the crime, but police records show he was a suspect, and steve details other potential clues he has uncovered: a handwriting expert found that letters the killer sent to police bore a resemblance to his dad's scrawl. Receipts also showed george hodel bought bags of concrete just before short's murder; bags of the same size and brand were found near short's body.

As he went through his father's possessions, steve found a photo album tucked away in a box. It was small enough to fit in his palm and bound in wood. Feeling like a voyeur, he perused it. It was filled with the usual pictures – his mom, dad and brothers – as well as portraits of the family taken by the world-famous surrealist artist man ray, a family friend. But towards the back, something caught his eye: two pictures of a young woman, her eyes cast downward, with curly, deep-black hair. Steve still doesn't know why he had the idea, but as he looked at the images, he thought to himself: \"my god, that looks like the black dahlia. \" the black dahlia, of course, is the nickname given to elizabeth short after her grisly death on 15 january 1947. The 22-year-old aspiring actor was living in los angeles when her corpse was found maimed"

Boaters off long island and connecticut have been capturing images of belugas, humpbacks, and at least one minke starting in may, when three belugas were seen near fairfield, conn. But while the creatures provide perfect photo ops ( especially breaching humpbacks ), noaa warns people to keep their distance, the ap notes. Under the marine mammal protection act, only one boat can come within 300 feet of a whale, and even then only for 15 minutes, nbc connecticut reports; it also must reduce speed and tell other boats about the sighting. ( an \" ocean etiquette \" guide by noaa fisheries offers more tips. ) the biggest question, though, has yet to be definitively answered: why did the whales return to the sound after such a long break? experts believe baitfish-harvesting restrictions and less rainfall ( which reduces polluted runoff from entering the waters ) may have drawn the whales back, per the ap. The whale expert cited in the hour adds that a whale who's hurt or sick may also sometimes enter strange waters. Whatever the reasons, local boaters are thrilled. \" i was having heart palpitations i was so excited, \" one tells the ap, while another says he was double-teamed off stamford, conn.: \" i know for certain that there was more than one whale because the breaching one started to scare me and breached behind the boat while the other whale was in front.

        "summary": "A newly discovered plant from the philippines has an unusual appetite — for nickel. In a press release on the find, researchers explain rinorea niccolifera is a nickel hyperaccumulator, meaning it can absorb up to 18,000 parts per million of the metal in its leaves. That's a \" normally toxic concentration \" as much as 1,000 times the amount most plants are able to tolerate. If the ability sounds rare, that's because it is: among the plant species that live in nickel-heavy soil, at most 1 % can soak up so much nickel without being poisoned. That translates into roughly 450 plant species planet-wide. And the plant's unique ability may take it beyond the philippines. As a co-author of the report explains, \" hyperacccumulator plants have great potentials for the development of green technologies. \" those technologies include using it to decontaminate soil ( plants of this type have done so since the 1990s ) or harvesting nickel from its plant shoots in a process known as phytomining. The plant is native to luzon island and, according to the paper published in phytokeys, it is already endangered, having a fragmented habitat of only about 193 square miles. Ironically, mining activities are one of the main threats to its existence. Hyperaccumulation is thought to have evolved as a defense response, making plants less palatable to the animals that might feed on it, according to a 2011 paper published in plant science.

            "The term \"hyperaccumulator \" describes a number of plants that belong to distantly related families, but share the ability to grow on metalliferous soils and to accumulate extraordinarily high amounts of heavy metals in the aerial organs, far in excess of the levels found in the majority of species, without suffering phytotoxic effects. Three basic hallmarks distinguish hyperaccumulators from related non-hyperaccumulating taxa: a strongly enhanced rate of heavy metal uptake, a faster root-to-shoot translocation and a greater ability to detoxify and sequester heavy metals in leaves. An interesting breakthrough that has emerged from comparative physiological and molecular analyses of hyperaccumulators and related non-hyperaccumulators is that most key steps of hyperaccumulation rely on different regulation and expression of genes found in both kinds of plants. In particular, a determinant role in driving the uptake, translocation to leaves and, finally, sequestration in vacuoles or cell walls of great amounts of heavy metals, is played in hyperaccumulators by constitutive overexpression of genes encoding transmembrane transporters, such as members of zip, hma, mate, ysl and mtp families.

Ben carson is fifth with 10 % and jeb bush is last with just 4 %.

In warning signs for trump, his support has dropped sharply among women and \" traditional values \" conservatives, the journal notes.

Dunn notes it's \" never easy \" to endure the bad press like that the juicero has received after the bloomberg report, but he adds the company is \" learning, listening, and improving \" and wants to keep helping \" people on their journey to health. \" and that press has indeed been brutal, with forbes calling it a \" non-product \" that needs to be \" squeezed out of existence, \" quartz saying startup firms like this are \" incapable of seeing their own absurdities, \" and men's health sniffing that it knew the juicer was useless a month back — which is why it crushed the device with a ford raptor. Still, dunn points to the \" mediocre \" and possibly messy results one would get by extracting juice with one's hands. But in comments to gizmodo, one of bloomberg's squeezers counters that, saying she \" simply applied light pressure to the bag and the juice poured out. \"",

Since 2008, the vault has sat on a norwegian island in the svalbard archipelago, 800 miles from the north pole where the soil is always frozen. It's a place so cold that reuters explains that in the event of power failure the crop seeds within the vault would be preserved for at least 200 years. That makes it an ideal location to house and safeguard the seeds in the event of catastrophe, and the first catastrophe of sorts has apparently occurred: syria's civil war. There are other gene banks around the world, one being in aleppo. It's located at the headquarters of the international center for agricultural research in dry areas ( icarda ) — which itself in 2012 moved from aleppo to beirut due to the conflict. Cary fowler, the creator of the svalbard vault, last month told australia's abc news that \" we don't think that seed collection has been lost, \" but icarda has certainly lost its ability to get the seeds to farmers or scientists who request them. He said the plan was to \" re-establish that gene bank center now in two locations: in morocco and lebanon. \" the local reports that since 2008, icarda was able to send samples of 87 % of its seeds to svalbard and other banks. It's now asking for some 116,000 samples that include wheat, barley, and grasses that thrive in dry areas. The transfer will occur once the paperwork is done. While the news may sound negative, slate points out the vault is working \" exactly how [ it's ] supposed to work.

Researchers have conducted the process using a tube that goes through the nose and into the small intestine, but now, they may have a simpler solution, the los angeles times reports: frozen poop pills. Subjects in an earlier study received relatives ' fresh stool samples, packed into capsules; 31 of 32 patients were treated successfully, researchers say. But when a patient needs immediate treatment, stool samples aren't always available — so in new research, scientists tried freezing the stuff. It was screened for disease and kept for a month before being placed in capsules; each held 1.6 grams of poop. The results: 90 % of subjects experienced \" clinical resolution of diarrhea. \" it would have been great if the pills could have been colored, like tylenol, says a researcher; instead, they have to be acid-resistant, and acid-resistant pills are always transparent, npr reports.

The internet has demonized jennifer connell for suing sean tarala after he accidentally broke her wrist while in an excited state at his eighth-birthday party in 2011. But per the ap, her attorneys say state law gave her no choice but to file the $ 127,000 complaint, dismissed tuesday in a connecticut court. The law firm representing connell notes the insurance company for her nephew's parents was only going to give her $ 1 for medical bills and that suing was her only option. Her lawyers said she's already had two surgeries and needs a third, the boston herald reports. \" from the start, this was a case … about one thing: getting medical bills paid by homeowner's insurance, \" an emailed statement from the attorneys reads, per the paper. \" our client was never looking for money from her nephew or his family. \" that claim is backed up by a uconn law professor, who tells the herald that \" in connecticut and most states, if you have a claim against someone for negligence, you sue that individual, not the insurance company. \" but a bridgeport jury took just 25 minutes to deny jennifer connell's claim, the new york daily news reports, and she left the courtroom immediately after the verdict; sean wasn't there for the ruling. The daily news reports that connell's lawyers noted during closing arguments that \" she is not here enjoying a moment of this \" and pointed out \" sean should have known better. We have rules for children. He was not careful. He was unsafe. \" sean's lawyer dismissed that claim. \" kids will be kids, \" he told the jury. \" he was an 8-year-old boy being an 8-year-old boy … sean was not negligent. \" the jurors agreed with sean's defense team, with one saying, \" we just couldn't find the little boy liable for what happened, \" per cbs new york.

An intriguing study in plos one finds that women who were especially stressed during the storm gave birth to kids whose immune cells have telltale signs of their mothers'trouble, reports raw story. The storm was brutal, leaving people without power for more than a month. Researchers at the time surveyed expectant moms to gauge their \" objective \" distress, measuring things such as how many days they went without electricity. Then they tracked down their kids more than a decade later and found that moms who were in the most distress bore children whose dna had specific markers as a result. The genes affected are related to immune function and sugar metabolism. Toronto's globe and mail has a nice explanation of what's going on, with help from suzanne king of mcgill university. It involves \" epigenetics, \" as opposed to genetics: \" an individual's genetics are like a musical score, and what's written comes from the mother and father.... Although nothing can change what's written on the page, environmental factors act as an orchestral conductor might, amplifying some aspects and tempering others, leaving markings, or methylation of the dna. \" this isn't necessarily a bad thing. A pregnant woman in a famine, for instance, might \" amplify \" traits that would give her child a better chance of surviving — traits that could then backfire in terms of health if the famine goes away. It's not clear what, if any, health effects the canadian kids will see as a result, explains a post at mcgill university. But given the genes affected, they might have a greater risk of developing asthma, diabetes, or obesity. ( you can blame your coffee craving on dna, too. )",

Levine's accuser, now middle-aged, contacted the police in lake forest, ill., in october 2016 to report that he'd had sexual contact with the conductor when he was under age 18; he alleges some of his encounters with levine took place there in the mid-1980s. Levine served as music director at the ravinia festival, outside chicago, from 1973 to 1993. Met officials said they learned of the police report last year, and \" at the time, mr. Levine said that the charges were completely false, and we relied upon the further investigation of the police. We need to determine if these charges are true and, if they are, take appropriate action. \" the accuser, whose name is being withheld by the ap, contacted reporters from several news organizations and posted a handful of items on social media accusing levine of abusing him when he was young. The lake forest department assigned a detective who spent at least seven months investigating the allegations, according to a redacted copy of her reports. The accuser, who at the time was hoping for a career in music, told police the conductor told him he wanted to \"to see if you can be raised special like me, \" reports the new york times. Levine had invited him to audition for him in new york and then encouraged him to engage in sexual \" experimentation. \" he also said that his relationship with levine extended well into adulthood and that the composer gave him money over the years when he was having financial problems, amounting to more than $ 50,000.",

One thing is clear: it's not a move aimed at courting the gop establishment. A roundup of coverage: in a lengthy profile of bannon and breitbart itself, vanity fair's ken stern describes the conservative organization as \" trump before trump. \" he predicts that bannon's real goal is \" cementing an american nationalist movement, \" not securing victory for trump — and that if the \" outraged and xenophobic tone of breitbart is any guide, we are in for a final three months of the campaign that will put the rest to shame. \" \" steve is a fighter. He loves the fight. He loves the scrum, \" andrew marcus, who directed a documentary on breitbart, says in a new york times profile of the 62-year-old former goldman sachs banker. Bannon's past includes a stint in the navy, a sarah palin documentary — and a seinfeld deal that made him a fortune. Ben shapiro, who described breitbart as \" trump's pravda \" when he quit the organization in march, doesn't mince his words at the daily wire. He calls the \" legitimately sinister \" bannon a \" vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies \" — and a \" smarter version of trump. \" he accuses bannon of, among other things, openly embracing the white supremacist movement. The daily beast reports that the \" alt right \" movement — better known as white supremacists — is rejoicing at the appointment of bannon. Clinton spokesman robby mook slammed the trump campaign for handing the reins to somebody who \" peddles divisive, at times racist, anti-muslim, anti-semitic conspiracy theories, \" politico reports. He said the move signals that trump is about to \" double down on his most small, nasty, and divisive instincts. \" the hill spoke to republicans on capitol hill and found that many of them are \" apoplectic \" at the hire. \" breitbart has no credibility outside of the most extreme conservative wing of our party, \" one house member says. \" this would seem to signal that trump is ready to go double-barrel against all of washington, republicans and democrats alike. \" gop strategist john feehery, however, says that while breitbart is \" nuts, \" bannon is somebody who could bring some \" much-needed discipline \" to trump's campaign.

Suddenly, one of the barn workers appeared with unsettling news: the latch on the stall of a prized grand-prix-level show jumper had been tampered with, and the horse was nowhere to be found. Within a half-hour, there were signs of an unusual crime, then a brutal discovery: the horse had been led from its stall and taken far from the barn, where it was carved up so professionally that the authorities are investigating it as a case of animal cruelty carried out by an expert butcher for meat. \"he had been filleted, \" ms.

Here's what you need to know about the spacex founder's plan for the future of humanity: vox calls tuesday's announcement musk's \" most impassioned and detailed case for space colonization yet \" and takes readers through his step-by-step process for getting people to mars. Musk estimates that with current methods, it would cost $ 10 billion to get a single person to mars, engadget reports. He hopes to get that down to $ 200,000 through reusable spaceship parts and in-orbit refueling. As for how to fund his plan to colonize mars, musk referred to a south park joke with a slide that started with the first step of \" steal underpants \" and ended with a final step of \" profit, \" according to the verge. \" it would be an incredible adventure, \" the atlantic quotes musk on his reason for doing this. \" life needs to be more than solving problems every day. You need to wake up and be inspired. \" the wall street journal reports musk has placed himself in direct competition with nasa, which hopes to send astronauts to mars around 2035. Musk says he may be able to do it within the next decade. His timetable also calls for a permanent colony on mars within the next 50 to 150 years, according to cnn. In terms of the nitty-gritty of a colony on the red planet, cnet reports musk says he's working on martian toilets and a potentially nuclear-powered sewage system. The independent isn't taking an exactly sunny view of musk's announcement, writing: \" [ he ] plans to send people to die on mars so that his private space company can colonize it. \" musk himself admits that \" the risk of fatality will be very high \" in the beginning. And mars is indeed just the beginning. Musk revealed hopes to one day send people to saturn's moons titan and enceladus, jupiter's moon europa, and beyond, gizmodo reports.",

        "summary": "The giants of the home shopping world are merging. Qvc is acquiring hsn ( which birthed home shopping as the home shopping network in 1977 ) in an all-stock transaction valued at more than $ 2 billion, the wall street journal reports. The longtime rivals are joining forces against a bigger rival: online shopping. Both qvc and hsn have seen declining sales in recent quarters, though together they still have about 23 million active customers. Interestingly, after the merger the combined company will be the third-biggest e-commerce company in north america, following amazon and walmart. ( qvc bought online retailer zulily in 2015. ) but the company will also operate five cable tv channels in the us. Hsn will remain headquartered in st. Petersburg, fla. ( qvc is in west chester, pa. ) and operate as an independent brand, per qvc's ceo. The deal is expected to be completed in the last three months of the year. Together, the companies sell 4,200 brands, but hsn is stronger in electronics, fitness, and health ( it's known for the miracle mop, among other things ) while qvc is more successful in fashion and beauty — it helped to launch bareminerals, among other beauty lines. Cnnmoney notes that qvc's parent company, liberty interactive corp., already owns nearly 40 % of hsn. Liberty will spin off its cable operations after the merger and rename itself qvc group.",

Hall couldn't take him because he was on probation for dui, so the boy went to live with hall's mother before eventually returning to his dad's custody.

Weeks after the murder, duram's african grey parrot, bud, could be heard repeating the phrase \" don't f --- ing shoot. \" bud would also talk to himself in two distinct voices in what the owner of a michigan exotic bird store says is \"definitely an argument between a man and a woman. \" according to mlive, duram, 45, was shot five times while clad only in his underwear.

Glenna's daughter from another marriage told fox 17 her mother and duram were frequently talking trash to each other. Family members recall glenna frequently talking about killing duram or simply waiting for him to die, only sometimes seeming to be joking. The couple had money and gambling issues, and duram required special care after suffering a brain injury in a car crash. But with more than a year having passed with no charges filed, duram's family is getting fed up. They have video of bud reenacting what they say are the final moments of duram's life, and they want police to listen to what the parrot has to say. \"that bird picks up everything and anything, and it's got the filthiest mouth around, \" duram's mother tells wood.

Passenger-side airbag inflators are at risk of exploding and blasting out plastic pieces, the ap reports, while a rep for japanese airbag maker takata warns reuters that driver-side airbags may fail to inflate. Takata launched the recall; it includes some non-japanese automakers, a rep said. There haven't been any known injuries. Toyota is recalling 1.73 million vehicles worldwide; 580,000 of those are in north america. The company will swap the problematic inflators with working ones. Corolla, tundra, and lexus sc models made between 2000 and 2004 are among those affected. Meanwhile, honda is recalling some 1.14 million vehicles, including civic and odyssey models; nissan is recalling some 480,000; and mazda is calling back 45,500. Takata puts the total recall figure lower, at 2 million, reuters notes.",

            "Tokyo/detroit four japanese automakers, including toyota motor corp and nissan motor co, are recalling 3.4 million vehicles sold around the world because airbags supplied by takata corp are at risk of catching fire or injuring passengers. The move announced on thursday is the largest recall ever for airbags made by takata, the world's second-largest supplier of airbags and seatbelts. Shares of takata, which first learned of the issue in october 2011, tumbled almost 10 percent in tokyo trading. The recall, also including vehicles from honda motor co ltd and mazda motor corp, is the largest since toyota pulled back more than 7 million vehicles in october to repair faulty power window switches. The scale of the recent safety actions underscores the risk of huge global supply chain problems as automakers increasingly rely on a handful of suppliers for common or similar parts to cut costs, analysts have said. Toyota, honda and nissan said there were no reports of injuries or deaths because of the defective airbags, which affect more than 1.3 million vehicles in the united states. Airbags are flexible fabric envelopes that inflate rapidly to cushion occupants in an accident. They were rolled out broadly in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, and are now required in most developed countries, with many vehicles offering multiple airbags. However, u.s. Requirements were changed in the late 1990s to lower the explosive force of airbag deployment after injuries caused by early generations of the technology. In the current takata recall, the airbag for the front passenger seat may not inflate correctly because of a manufacturing defect in the propellant used in the airbag inflator, the companies said. As a result, there is a risk of fires starting or of passengers being injured by metal fragments shooting up toward the windshield or down into the passenger foot well. The recall covers some of the top-selling japanese cars, including toyota's camry and corolla",
            "Toyota, honda and nissan are recalling more than 2 million vehicles globally for an identical problem with air bags on the passenger side whose inflator may burst, sending plastic pieces flying. No injuries have been reported related to the problem. The recall for air bags made by japan's takata corp. Affects other automakers, including non-japanese manufacturers, takata spokesman akiko watanabe said thursday. She declined to give details. Toyota motor corp. Is recalling 1.7 million vehicles with some 580,000 in north america, 490,000 in europe and 320,000 in japan. Affected models include the corolla, tundra, lexus sc, produced between november 2000, and march 2004. Honda motor co. Is recalling 1.1 million vehicles.

        "summary": "\" hopefully we're going to have a wonderful day, and a wonderful vote, \" said president trump thursday morning. His wish was granted: the house voted 217-213 to pass an updated version of the american health care act, the gop's obamacare replacement. The wall street journal reports 216 votes were needed and paints the measure's future in the senate as uncertain. Here's how it went down and what's next: quote of the day: house speaker paul ryan was the last republican to speak before voting began, and here was his big quote: \" a lot of us have been waiting seven years to cast this vote. Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this very vote. \" song of the day: democratic representatives were overheard singing \" nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey, goodbye \" after the vote, presumably about 2018, tweeted cnn chief national security correspondent jim sciutto, who added \" republicans carting beer into the capitol. \" wasting no time: democratic senators began the day by tweeting their opposition. Over the course of 11 tweets, sen. Sherrod brown of ohio catalogued a list of pre-existing conditions that could cause americans to pay more for their insurance. \" aids/hiv, acid reflux, acne, add, addiction, alzheimer's/dementia, anemia, aneurysm, angioplasty... \" sen. Jeff merkley of oregon took a similar but shorter approach, tweeting: \" know anyone w/ cancer, old sports injury, bad back, diabetes? gop voting to make their care way more expensive - if they can get it at all. \" where we go from here: as for what's next, the washington post sees three paths: it could die in the senate; the senate could change it so extremely that the house then doesn't approve it; or the \" ultimate path to victory \" in which the senate passes a version and the two houses manage to come to a compromise. But it's going to be a tough slog, and that's due to \" reconciliation. \" what? npr explains: senate republicans ( there are 52 of them ) won't be able to woo enough democrats to hit the 60-vote threshold, so they ' ll have to go the \" reconciliation \" route, which lets a bill pass with a majority plus one. \" but there's a catch — it has to be tied to the budget. \" any policy that doesn't have a fiscal impact can't be included.

Museum owner john cambridge says two employees conducted the heist over a few days, taking more than $ 40,000 worth of lizards and insects. \" i ' m not sure there's ever been a larger live-insect heist, \" cambridge tells cnn. \" our insurance doesn't cover this.

Before fleeing, the pair stabbed their uniforms into a wall using kitchen knives. Police have found the suspects, searched their homes, and returned a few creatures — including a colorful mexican fireleg tarantula — but the highly venomous six-eyed sand spider is among many kidnapped critters still missing, the new york times reports.

During his rookie year with the miramar police department in 2013, lee coel, 28, was accused of excessive force on two occasions before investigators determined he had violated department policy; he says he was cleared of the excessive force claims but still forced to resign. Then earlier this year, coel was sued after setting a police dog on a man riding a bicycle at night without a light; the man had ignored coel's commands. A disturbing video shows the cyclist screaming during the attack, which lasted almost two minutes, reports the miami herald. The cyclist was seriously injured and needed surgery. \" what he did to my client is criminal. The dog ate part of his armpit muscle. He should have been fired immediately, \" the cyclist's lawyer says, though an outside expert found the use of force was justified. In the latest incident, police say coel fatally shot mary knowlton at a citizen police academy session attended by 34 others, including knowlton's husband of more than 50 years. Punta gorda chief tom lewis says officers were unaware coel's gun housed live rounds, instead of blanks. A witness describes seeing \" anxiety and panic and horror \" on coel's face as knowlton fell after three shots were fired, reports nbc news. Knowlton's son, 50, says his mom would want him to forgive coel, per the news-press, but adds, \" i don't know if i can ever get over this. \"",

        "summary": "Kraft has won a sweet victory in its 4-month-long battle to take over cadbury, according to sources who expect a deal to be announced today, barring last-minute complications. The british chocolate maker's board has agreed to accept kraft's improved offer of roughly $ 19 billion in cash and stock in a buyout that will create a food industry behemoth with sales of over $ 50 billion a year, insiders tell the new york times. The decision to stop fighting kraft's takeover attempt was taken with \" a heavy heart, \" a source at cadbury tells the guardian, but the board was left with little choice after shareholders indicated they would accept the higher offer. The takeover bid was strongly opposed by unions, who fear cost-cutting and massive job losses will result, and by british politicians who worry that the foreign takeover will dent national pride.",

            "Kraft foods has reached a tentative deal for a friendly takeover of cadbury of britain, agreeing in principle to pay about $ 19 billion in cash and stock for the confectioner, people briefed on the matter said on monday. Barring any last-minute complications — these people cautioned that the talks could still fall apart — the deal would create a global food giant that would unite kraft and its oreo cookies and ritz crackers with cadbury and its trident gum and dairy milk chocolates. Together, the two companies would have more than $ 50 billion in revenue and a big presence in markets globally. Over the last decade, food companies have sought to gain scale by combining with each other, most recently with mars buying the wm. Wrigley jr. Company in 2008 for $ 23 billion. The tentative deal for cadbury would end a four-month battle for control of the british candy maker, one in which cadbury executives accused kraft of showing \"contempt \" with an undervalued offer. Under the terms of the proposal, kraft will pay 840 pence ( $ 13.70 ) for each cadbury share, while cadbury will pay out a special dividend of 10 pence a share. The offer is about a 5 percent premium over cadbury's closing share price of 807.5 pence on monday. The majority of the increase was in the cash component, which was raised",
            "Cadbury will accept defeat in its battle to stay independent today by recommending a £ 12bn takeover from us rival kraft that threatens to reignite a fierce debate about the vulnerability of british industry. The 186-year-old chocolate maker decided to throw in the towel late last night after a large foreign shareholder joined hedge funds in indicating it would accept an improved offer from kraft, and the prospect of a rival bid from hershey faded. Cadbury's board, led by chairman roger carr, will announce its decision to recommend the revised 850p-a-share bid to all shareholders through a ­statement to the stock exchange this morning, according to sources close to the company. Although a board recommendation is not binding, it is highly unusual for a ­company to resist a hostile takeover once its management has capitulated. The confectionery giant joins a list of british industrial names to have fallen to foreign takeovers in similar circumstances in recent years. More than 50 ­leading companies have gone, including baa, boots, cazenove, corus, ici, jaguar land rover, p&o, pilkington and scottish power. Until now cadbury had fought a public campaign to preserve its independence, attracting support from lord mandelson, the business secretary, who warned kraft to expect \" huge opposition \" from the ­government if it wanted to make a \" fast buck \" by buying cadbury.
