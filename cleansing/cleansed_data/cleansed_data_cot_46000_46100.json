And that's what happened here. \" but he's far from the only one: magic johnson, the target of sterling's alleged rant, has responded thusly, according to the la times: \" i will never again set foot in staples center when the clippers are playing. I know where i ' m not wanted. \" further, \" something has to be done, and if that means him losing the team, then that has to happen. The league has to come down hard and make a statement. \" meanwhile, deadspin has released an extended version of the tape, which now runs 15 minutes. Elsewhere in reaction: sacramento mayor and nbpa chairman kevin johnson: \" the reported comments made by clippers owner donald sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable. There needs to be an immediate investigation and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken. \" lebron james: \" if the reports are true, it's unacceptable. It's unacceptable in our league. It doesn't matter if you're white, black, hispanic, whatever, all across the races. There is no room for donald sterling in our league. \" and an interesting statement from clippers president andy roeser: \" we have heard the tape on tmz. We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape — who we believe released it to tmz — is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $ 1.8 million, who told mr. Sterling that she would ' get even. ' \" furthermore: \" it is the antithesis of who ( sterling ) is, what he believes and how he has lived his life. He feels terrible that such sentiments are being attributed to him and apologizes to anyone who might have been hurt by them. \"",

The villages are some 1,300 years old, dating from between 200 ad and 700 ad, abc news reports. Archaeologists discovered homes dug into the ground known as pit-houses, built in sand dunes. Their floors and walls were lined with sandstone, archaeology reports. Such accommodations exist elsewhere in the park; in these villages, however, they're clustered together, park archaeologist bill reitze says. Each village has \" probably more than 50 structures, \" he notes, as western digs reports. The sites appear to be from a cultural era known as the basketmaker period. Teams have also found tools and weapons made from petrified wood, shells, and ceramics, abc notes. The findings come as the park doubles in size following an expansion enacted by congress a decade ago. \" there are not a lot of national parks that have the opportunity to get bigger like this to protect sites and produce future research, \" reitze notes. \" because the park is doubling in size, we are finding something every day. \" ( another fascinating recent archaeological discovery: the remains of a mysterious \" witch girl \" found in italy. )",

And 11 of them — black, white, gray, blue, green, yellow, red, purple, brown, pink, and orange — all overlap with the basic colors americans can describe in one word. But in japan, a 12th color, \" mizu, \" which means water, has emerged as a basic color as distinct from blue as green is. Among americans asked to name basic colors using just one word, \" light blue \" didn't come up as a color at all because we just don't have a single-word name for it, with the very rare exception of someone using \" sky, \" scientists report in a eureka alert news release. Italians, however, do have their own word for the \" mizu \" color — \" celeste, \" reports ifl science. And americans do have a single word for other colors, like \" lavender, \" for which the japanese do not. Researchers are investigating why certain color descriptions vary so dramatically while others are so consistent across cultures, and report on their findings in the journal of vision. While the case of light blue was a notable difference, it's only a recent one, given \" mizu \" was not a basic color name in japan 30 years ago. \" what's really interesting is there are remarkable similarities in color descriptions amongst people who live thousands of miles apart, and there can be differences between next-door neighbors, \" one researcher says.

And, last week he finally did just that, the dallas morning news reports. The strange history of the marker started on the fourth anniversary of the kennedy assassination, when some oklahoma teens swiped it from a fort worth cemetery as a prank. Cbs dfw reports the marker was returned to oswald's mother, who put a more discreet marker on his grave and stashed the original in her crawlspace. Card's father eventually bought the oswald home. After changing hands within the family, a distant relative eventually sold the marker to illinois ' historic auto attractions in 2011 for $ 45,000. Cbs reports card went to court to prove his relative didn't have the right to sell the marker, and on july 19 the parties settled out of court. Last week, card and a friend drove the 140-pound granite marker back to texas all the way from roscoe, ill. — a distance of more than 900 miles. \" you touch it, and it's like you're reaching 6 feet down and right into oswald's coffin, \" he told the morning news. Card tells cbs he'd like to give the marker to the museum housed in the building from which oswald allegedly fired, but he may have a private showing of it in his bar first. At the moment, he claims that oswald's grave marker is \" in an undisclosed location guarded by the hounds from hell. \"",

        "summary": "One of florida's richest women is donating big time to keep medical marijuana out of the state. The trust of carol jenkins barnett, daughter of the founder of the publix supermarket chain, has donated $ 800,000 to the drug free florida group, which is fighting a legalization measure on the ballot this november, the miami new times reports. Amendment 2 would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for what it calls \" debilitating medical conditions, \" including cancer, hiv, epilepsy, and ptsd, reports the saintpetersblog. A similar amendment failed in 2014 — with barnett's trust donating $ 540,000 to defeat it — and the only floridians who now have access to medical marijuana are children with severe epilepsy, who are prescribed a low-thc version, and terminal cancer patients allowed to use marijuana under an \" experimental drugs \" program, reports the miami herald. Barnett, 59, has early onset alzheimer's and resigned from the company's board last month.

Scientists sent the remote-controlled submarines underwater for eight months and uncovered roughly 63,000 square miles with little to no oxygen in waters that link the persian gulf to the arabian sea. \" our research shows that the situation is actually worse than feared — and that the area of dead zone is vast and growing, \" research leader bastien queste says in a statement. \" the ocean is suffocating. Of course all fish, marine plants and other animals need oxygen, so they can't survive there. \" such dead zones can happen naturally, the cbc notes, but they're becoming bigger and more common, mostly due to wastewater and chemical fertilizers. The run-off feeds algae blooms that suck up much-needed underwater oxygen. They also clog the gills of fish, which drain more oxygen when the fish decay and die. Climate change plays a role too, queste says, because \" warmer waters hold less oxygen. \" the weather network explains that warmer water floats on top of colder water, so the layers can't mix and allow oxygen from the air to reach down below. The latest find only adds to alarming data that the number of coastline dead zones has gone from 50 to 500 since 1950. Large dead zones are also hard to fix, and queste doesn't sound too optimistic. \" it's a real environmental problem, with dire consequences for humans too who rely on the oceans for food and employment, \" he says.

Around the world there are more than 400 current dead zones in oceans and lakes, where water contains so little oxygen that aquatic life can't survive. Dead zones form when aquatic organisms consume dissolved oxygen faster than it can be supplied.

Advertisement a few days ago, helicopters descended on the 3,500-person town to install three huge rectangular mirrors on the face of the mountains that pin rjukan in on either side. Technically, these are heliostatic mirrors, which are controlled by a central computer that tilts their positioning to reflect the sun onto a specific, static location. ( it's more common to find them on solar farms, for example. ) the \" hot spot, \" in this case, is a 2,000-square-foot circle on the town square — soon to be converted into an ice rink ( apparently, the reflected light still won't be terribly warm ). When rjukan begins to fall into shadow roughly a month from now, the mirrors will begin their first tests. \" the project will result in a permanent installation which, with the help of the 300 square foot mirrors, will redirect the sun down into the valley, \" explained town reps. \" the"

        "summary": "Adult women can choose to have their labia reshaped as part of a \" vaginal rejuvenation \" surgery, in which the muscles of the vagina are tightened. Now teenage girls apparently want in on the action, too. Doctors say they're increasingly getting requests from young girls to have their labia trimmed — sometimes to relieve discomfort or a risk of infection, but more often because they're unhappy with the way it looks, reports the new york times. Some 400 girls 18 or under had labiaplasty last year; that's an 80 % increase over 2014, according to the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery ( that count doesn't include operations performed by gynecologists ). Why the jump? experts cite the preponderance of young girls who shave or wax their pubic hair, thereby making the flesh there more visible. What they see might not jibe with their often-skewed expectations regarding size, shape, and color. And when it comes to those characteristics, there's a huge range of what's \" normal, \" reports health. It cites a study that found length can range from three-quarters of an inch to nearly 4 inches, and width from a quarter of an inch to 2 inches. Teens might also feel self-conscious in tight clothing, per healthday. \" this age group may be under particular stress regarding these issues because of societal conceptions of the ideal female body, \" the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists explains in new guidelines for adolescent labiaplasty. A recent study showed many british women were worried their genitals weren't normal, per the huffington post, and even comedian nikki glaser debated labiaplasty as a youth.

Most are black men convicted of drug crimes who got caught up in mandatory sentencing laws because of prior convictions, says the report. It also has plenty of cases like timothy lee's, the now 53-year-old who got busted for stealing that jacket in 1996, reports the guardian. Another lifer got put away for siphoning gas.

Director of national intelligence james clapper confirmed the surveillance in a letter responding to questioning from sen. Ron wyden, an oregon democrat. The agency spied on the actual contents of communications without a warrant — not just \" metadata \" such as call times and phone numbers. \" this is unacceptable. It raises serious constitutional questions, and poses a real threat to the privacy rights of law-abiding americans, \" wyden and sen. Mark udall, a colorado democrat, said in a statement. \" if a government agency thinks that a particular american is engaged in terrorism or espionage, the fourth amendment requires that the government secure a warrant or emergency authorization before monitoring his or her communications, \" the senators said. \" this fact should be beyond dispute. \" section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act gives the nsa broad power to listen in on phone calls and access emails. But the law covers only non-americans located outside of the united states. Advertisement the agency sometimes collects americans ' information as it scoops up vast amounts of data on foreigners. In his letter to wyden, clapper revealed that the nsa has searched through that database specifically looking for americans ' communications",

        "summary": "Nearly two centuries later, researchers believe they have identified the pathogen that led to ireland's deadly potato famine. To make their discovery, british, german, and american scientists sequenced dna from samples of dried potato leaves collected between 120 and 170 years ago, reports physorg. They identified the particular strain of phytophthora infestans in samples dating to 1845, the year the pathogen arrived in ireland, then compared the genetic information to that of today's plants, the bbc reports. As physorg explains, researchers had previously believed us-1, today's major pathogen, was the culprit. Instead, they found that a new strain, dubbed herb-1, triggered the outbreak. Scientists believe herb-1 appeared at the beginning of the 19th century and wasn't replaced by us-1 until the 20th century, when new potato varieties were planted. ( \" we can't be sure but most likely [ herb-1 has ] gone extinct, \" says one scientist. ) besides solving a 168-year-old mystery, the find has big implications: it marks the first time the genome of a plant pathogen has been decoded using dried, preserved plant specimens, and paves the way for similar research in the future.",

Now scientists are reporting in the journal msystems that, thanks to an analysis of 2,200 people participating in the american gut project, they've found that people with migraines tend to have more oral bacteria that process nitrates, reports refinery29. This means that people suffering from migraines could be creating more nitric oxide, which has been linked to migraines, as they process those nitrates. Scientists next plan to study the diets of people with migraines to look for links between nitric oxide levels in their blood and migraines, which would help confirm that nitrate-processing oral bacteria are behind the headaches. If that's true, we could eventually see a \" magical probiotic mouthwash \" that helps reshape oral bacteria to prevent migraines, reports the guardian. In the meantime, researchers say, people who suspect that nitrates are behind their migraines should try to avoid them when possible — which could be difficult, considering they're also present in leafy greens.

Trump and house speaker paul ryan had been unable to persuade enough house republicans to change their minds on the american health care act. The ap reports that the demise of the american health care act, and the damage to trump's presidency, had democrats \" literally jumping for joy, \" with house minority leader nancy pelosi doing a victory leap outside the capitol. A roundup of coverage: the white house has been blaming democrats and ryan for the defeat, but the buck stops with trump, who promised during his campaign that his skill as a dealmaker would change washington, but then played chicken with house republicans and blinked at the last minute, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. \" trump wanted this deal, pushed for this deal, called his own party's bluff on this deal and then walked away when it appeared as though the deal wouldn't come together, \" he writes. Politico looks back at mistakes made on the road to the failure of the ahca, including trump's lukewarm attitude to the legislation after it was first introduced. The new york times reports that trump was furious at lunchtime friday when ryan arrived at the white house to tell him the ahca could not pass. Trump demanded the vote go ahead, broadcast live on tv, but ryan argued that broadcasting the bill's defeat would damage republicans who supported the bill as well as opponents. By midafternoon, trump agreed to pull the bill, insiders say — and though he remained furious at the house freedom caucus, he did not criticize them publicly. The hill lists winners and losers from the ahca battle, with trump and ryan topping the list of losers. The winners include nancy pelosi and barack obama, while the verdict is mixed for the house freedom caucus: the hardline conservatives demonstrated their power, but they also defied a republican president popular with grassroots voters, and preserved a law those voters hate. Politico describes trump as \" overmatched, outmaneuvered, and empty-handed \" after his first confrontation with rebellious lawmakers. His ability to work with congressional republicans to implement other parts of his agenda is now in doubt. The gop \" is still operating as an opposition party, \" says josh holmes, a former chief of staff to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. \" if they can't break the fever...

China's communist party on tuesday made a rare constitutional move that elevates xi to the status of mao zedong and sets the stage for him to rule indefinitely. Specifically, the party enshrined xi's ideology, dubbed \" xi jinping thought on socialism with chinese characteristics in a new era, \" into the constitution, meaning it will be taught in schools from now on, reports the guardian. He is only the third chinese leader to receive the honor, after mao and deng xioping, notes the washington post. Technically, xi is only formally beginning his second five-year term as party secretary, but the move and the accolades he has received all week seemingly guarantee his long-term status. \" the amendment of the party constitution effectively confirms xi jinping's aspiration to be the mao zedong of the 21st century — that means a top leader with no constraints on tenure or retirement age, \" says an expert at the chinese university of hong kong. So what is xi jinping thought? the bbc explains that while it smacks of \" vague rhetoric, \" it contains 14 principles that xi has long espoused, including a call for \" complete and deep reform \" and a pledge of \" harmonious living between man and nature. \" carrie gracie of the bbc writes that the \" new era \" part of xi's ideology is significant. This would be modern china's third. The first was mao \" uniting a country devastated by civil war, \" the second was deng making the nation rich, and \" this new era is about even more unity and wealth at the same time as making china disciplined at home and strong abroad. \" ( xi spoke for more than 3 hours last week.

Organization of american states secretary general luis almagro, one of the summit's organizers, told me that an encounter between the two presidents will be \"inevitable. \" trump and castro will be in the same room several times during the 34-country summit, in which leaders from across the hemisphere will be meeting without aides and have several coffee breaks. A senior administration official told mcclatchy newspapers that trump has been advised to avoid a handshake with castro. White house officials don't want a trump-castro picture to steal the show at the summit, as the picture of former president obama and castro did at the previous summit three years ago. U.s. Officials fear that a trump-castro picture would send the wrong signal on u.s.-cuba relations. Trump promised in a fiery speech to cuban exiles in miami last year to reverse obama's opening to cuba. Trump has taken some minor steps in that direction, although he has not downgraded diplomatic relations or limited u.s. Flights and cruises to the island. Sign up never miss a local story.

It called for limiting immigration growth to 0.2 % of the population each year in order to protect the country's beauty against overcrowding, afp reports. That would have meant cutting the number of immigrants from about 80,000 per year to 16,000, the bbc notes, in a country where some 23 % of the population is foreign. The rejection by 74 % of voters comes as little surprise following polls on the matter. All the country's political parties opposed it, afp notes, citing xenophobia and economic concerns. But in switzerland, if supporters of a movement get enough signatures, the country must hold a referendum on the matter, the bbc reports. And immigration wasn't the only issue the country voted on today, the ap reports.

Mcmullen, 43, called 911 at 5: 42am on june 29 last year and said daughter kailee jo mcmullen, 22, had been \" playing with a wheel-gun \" that went off when he tried to take it from her.

Kailee, a former high school cheerleader, worked as an emt. Her father was arrested and charged with first-degree murder a few days after her death. The oklahoman reports that according to an affidavit for a search warrant, officers responding to the 911 call found large amounts of blood and evidence that somebody had tried to clean it up. Officers said that after they took photos of mcmullen, he got on the ground and began covering himself with dirt. Police, who describe mcmullen as a \" very controlling father, \" say he was accused of sexually abusing kailee in 2009 but wasn't charged.

Franks told the cleveland county judge that mcmullen said his daughter had a revolver pointed at her face, her thumb on the trigger and arm extended away from her body, the detective testified. Mcmullen said the gun \"went pop \" when he tried to take the gun from her, the detective said. The victim had a single entry wound to the side of her nose and \"stippling \" marks on her face from gunpowder residue associated with the blast. The detective said he tested the firearm used in the shooting and compared stippling patterns from various distances up to two feet away.

Jacob was on the way back from the store with his friend and brother in 1989 when they were accosted by a masked man with a gun. The man had the other boys run into the woods and is believed to have kidnapped jacob. Heinrich says he had nothing to do with jacob's disappearance, but dna evidence tied him to the sexual assault of another boy around the same time and place. The statute of limitations has passed on that crime, so no charges were filed, but heinrich became a person of interest in jacob's disappearance due to similarities in the incidents. In the wake of his disappearance, jacob's family created the jacob wetterling resource center for families of lost children. \"we are in deep grief, \" the star tribune quotes a statement from the center. \" we didn't want jacob's story to end this way. \"",

        "summary": "As beethoven went deaf, he may have started listening to his heart. In a new study published in perspectives in biology and medicine, a cardiologist, an internal medical specialist, and a musicologist point out that three of the german composer's works exhibit \" rhythmic shifts and punctuations \" that weren't typical of music during his time but that closely resemble various forms of heart arrhythmia. Although the los angeles times notes that beethoven's heart was found \" structurally sound \" in an autopsy, no one knows for sure what medical conditions he suffered from. The study analyzed beethoven's piano sonata in e flat major, the string quartet no. 13 in b flat major, and the piano sonata no. 12 in a flat major. In the first sonata, researchers noticed a \" distinctive ' galloping ' rhythm \" in one section, and another section evoking irregular heartbeats both slow and fast; in the string quartet, the \" shortness of breath \" evoked is like a \" short paroxysm of an atrial tachyarrhythmia \"; and in the second sonata, a \" repetitive run of notes … ' bears some resemblance to rapid tachyarrhythmia. ' \" in what co-author zachary goldberger acknowledges is \" entirely speculative, \" they theorize as beethoven went deaf, he may have become more \" attuned \" to his heartbeat, though they admit \" similar rhythmic intricacies \" are present in other musicians ' compositions. \" while these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest beethoven's genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time, \" goldberger says, per medical news today.

Another man died while trying to push a stuck car out of a drift.

While it's not illegal for women to drive in saudi arabia, cultural custom dictates that women not operate a vehicle, and unofficial religious police enforce the custom. Additionally, women will not be issued driver's licenses. So while it's not illegal for them to drive, one requires a license to operate a vehicle, which women can't get. Al farid claims to have suffered a medical emergency, and instead of waiting around for a man to refuse to ask for directions drive her, decided to take matters ( and the steering wheel ) into her own hands. Enroute to the hospital, al farid was pulled over, explained her situation and allowed to continue on to be seen by a doctor. Then, once given the medical okay,",

The officers reportedly allowed her to continue driving.

        "summary": "A word that has been dogging secretary of state rex tillerson: absence. Absence from the spotlight, from a high-profile human rights event friday, and from the press, though that's set to change, somewhat, as of monday. A rep for the state department attempted to answer the question of where, exactly, tillerson has been, noting 32 phone calls with representatives of foreign countries and 15 in-person meetings on us soil with \" foreign interlocutors \" ( plus two trips abroad ), per politico. The latest: the state department has historically held a daily press briefing on each business day; under tillerson, there have been none. That's set to change monday, though the approach has been tweaked: there won't be briefings on fridays, and two of the weekly briefings will be conducted over the phone. Politico's take on the lack of briefings thus far: \" the long silence has irritated american diplomats who have watched other foreign ministry spokesmen... Try to seize control of narratives without state being able to respond. \" another absence that irritated and confused some: tillerson didn't attend friday's release of the department's annual report on human rights around the world. Cnn reports that for decades the secretary has given the introduction at the high-profile event, and points out that during two exceptions under george w. Bush, the secretary was on a trip abroad; that wasn't true of tillerson. He's also been absent from president trump's first three summit meetings with his foreign counterparts: canada's justin trudeau, japan's shinzo abe and israel's benjamin netanyahu, though tillerson has met with netanyahu. Just security sees this as \" very odd... Especially for someone who has no foreign policy experience and most likely does not have prior relationships with these leaders.

        "summary": "Money cannot buy happiness, but most people would choose it anyway, says a new study of more than 2,600 people published in the american economic review. For example, if the choice is between a job that pays $ 80,000 a year and lets you get seven and a half hours of sleep a night, and a job that pays $ 140,000 a year but allows for just six hours'sleep, most people pick the higher-paying job. Other questions asked about salary versus living close to friends, going home for thanksgiving versus saving for a vacation, and similar choices. It's not just about greed, though. Often, people say that more money will mean more family happiness, even if their own happiness is diminished. Status, purpose, and health all also factored into decision-making, often beating out happiness. \" we found that people make trade-offs between happiness and other things, \" says one of the paper's authors, according to livescience. \"people treat happiness as a commodity and are willing to make tradeoffs. \"",

        "summary": "The woman once saluted as the \" fastest nun in the west \" is on the path to beatification. The cause of sister blandina segale's sainthood has officially been declared open; it's the first time such a cause has been opened in the history of new mexico's roman catholic church, archbishop michael sheehan tells the albuquerque journal. Sister segale isn't exactly your typical candidate, though. The italian-born nun was known for \" calming mobs of armed men \" after she moved to the us and joined the sisters of charity of cincinnati. In fact, before traveling to santa fe, she was even said to have befriended billy the kid in colorado. When one of her students reportedly told segale a member of billy's gang had been shot by an outlaw, she cared for the man, even as four doctors apparently refused. When billy came to town bent on scalping the doctors, segale talked him out of it, received his thanks, and later visited him in jail, the new mexican reports. On another occasion when he met the nun in a stagecoach — terrifying her traveling mates — he simply bowed before riding away. Segale also set up numerous schools and hospitals, worked with the poor and sick, and advocated on behalf of hispanics and native americans, the ap reports. But her canonization process could take years — or even generations. The vatican must investigate the nun's work and monitor any apparent \" miracles \" that may be related. \" we hope and pray the process goes quickly, \" sheehan said. ( in terms of billy the kid, this may be just the second photo of him ever found. )",

Legend has it that sister blandina segale, among her many good deeds, once treated a friend of billy the kid's who had been shot. Billy, the story goes, never forgot. Sometime later, sister segale was riding in a stagecoach that billy was planning to ambush and rob. But when he looked in the carriage window and saw the good nun, he simply tipped his hat, spurred his steed and rode off toward the horizon. \"there was nothing bland about sister blandina, \" said the most rev.

        "summary": "Donald trump may have woken up what pollsters call a \" sleeping giant \" — and it's not planning on voting for him. As the campaigns enter their final day, the washington post reports that there are signs that the latino voter turnout is set to break records, and much of the turnout, especially among first-time voters, is motivated by dislike of trump. The turnout boost could be enough to swing the vote for hillary clinton in states including nevada and florida, and democrats are closely tracking increased turnout in states like arizona and texas, politico reports. In other developments: the new york times, in a look inside the trump campaign during its final weeks, reports that after the fbi announced it was investigating new clinton emails, trump's advisers finally managed to get him to stop tweeting without their approval. They warned him that he \" risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff, \" insiders say. He now apparently has to dictate his tweets instead of sending them himself. Cnet reports that at a rally in florida sunday, president obama mocked trump for having control of his twitter account taken away. \" now, if somebody can't handle a twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes, \" obama quipped. Reuters reports that this election is on course to attract more gambling dollars than any other political event in history, with most of the betting taking place outside the us. British betting firms say people who bet on brexit are now betting on a trump win. The miami herald reports that early voting records were shattered in the state sunday, especially in its two most populous counties. According to the hill, clinton supporters smell victory after the fbi's announcement sunday that its latest review of clinton emails uncovered no cause for criminal charges. \" she's got it, \" a close friend of clinton's says, predicting an electoral college victory with 310 to 320 votes, well over the 270 needed. Politico forecasts that the democrats have a better-than-even chance of gaining a slender majority in the senate, though the republicans appear likely to retain control of the house. The ap looks ahead to election night and singles out 10 counties in battleground states where early results will say a lot about whether certain clinton and trump strategies worked.",

Protesters tossed him in with the trash, even with police nearby, and threw a car tire and water on him. He was eventually able to escape. Nbc news notes zhuravsky \" has a history of authorizing bills placing restrictions on anti-government protests. \" the deal, meanwhile, lowers trade tariffs between europe and ukraine, requires ukrainian goods to meet european regulatory standards, and forces the kiev government to undertake major political and economic reforms. \" after world war ii, not a single nation has paid such a high price for their right to be european, \" president petro poroshenko said. \" can you tell me, who now after this will be brave enough to shut the doors to europe in front of ukraine? \" earlier yesterday, the parliament also approved laws granting temporary self-rule to rebellious, pro-russian regions in the east, as well as amnesty for many of those involved in the fighting.

As a teenager living in a green bay suburb in 1932, she was raped by a boy, sent to a home for pregnant girls, and forced to give up the child for adoption. \" in those days, it was such an embarrassment, \" the 99-year-old tells the chicago tribune. \" it was a lonesome time. \" she never hoped to see her daughter again, but a phone call she received in her monroe, wis., home last month brought tears of joy. \" hello, mother, \" said her long-lost daughter, 83-year-old dorien hammann, on the line. The way it happened is an astonishing testament to how modern attitudes and technology have revolutionized adoption reunions. As for wagner, she admits to thinking of her daughter every day but says she only told the true story to her now-deceased husband, richard. \" everything is so open now, but years ago, \" experiences like hers were \" taboo, \" says wagner. Meanwhile, hammann was raised by a civil engineer and homemaker in a milwaukee suburb and told about her adoption — but never felt the need to reconnect. Then states began revealing adoption records after research in the 1980s and ' 90s showed that adoption reunions were often positive experiences. Eventually hammann's daughter-in-law googled names from the adoption document, contacted wagner, and a reunion was in the works. It turned out to be a happy one, with mom and daughter talking and comparing similarities for hours. \" i thanked her for giving me up because i did have such a good home, \" says hammann. But not everyone is so happy: in canada, unwed mothers who were forced to give up their children for adoption decades ago are demanding that the government acknowledge their trauma, the globe &amp; mail reports.",

Several of the women met with politicians on parliament hill on tuesday to ask for an inquiry into the postwar treatment of pregnant unmarried women in canada. They are being joined in their request by indigenous leaders who say that, after the closing of the indian residential schools, many aboriginal children were removed from their families and adopted by non-aboriginal families in a practice known as the sixties scoop. \"we need an inquiry to allow the voices of the victims to be heard, to allow the stories and the accounts of what took place to come out, \" said valerie andrews, the executive director of a group called origins canada, which supports people who were separated by adoption. \"there were illegal, unethical and human-rights abuses in adoption policy and practice, \" said ms. Andrews whose own son was taken from her and placed for adoption when she was 17. An inquiry, she said, \"would allow for the acknowledgment and validation of those women who suffered through this, and continue to suffer through this. Some people don't even believe us that these things took place because they are so horrendous. \""

Danny bible, accused of at least four slayings and nine rapes, had sought to delay the execution by arguing that he was too sick with parkinson's and other ailments for a lethal injection to work properly, reports cnn. Instead, the 66-year-old asked to be killed by gas or a firing squad, neither of which is offered in texas and thus would have required action by state lawmakers, who aren't even in session, reports the ap. His appeal made it to the supreme court, which declined to stop the execution about an hour before it took place. Bible was pronounced dead 15 minutes after the injection began, with a public information officer for the texas department of criminal justice saying that he breathed heavily for about two minutes and muttered words that sounded like \" burning \" and \" hurts. \" authorities say bible killed three women and the 4-month-old son of one of his victims and raped others, including young family members. The victims included 20-year-old inez denton, the cousin of bible's friend, who was killed with an ice pick in 1979. The case went unsolved for decades until bible confessed to it and others after being arrested in florida in 1999 for a separate rape. \" danny paul bible is as vile and evil a person who has ever drawn breath, \" says the brother of one victim. \" we are glad to have witnessed him draw his last breath. \"",
