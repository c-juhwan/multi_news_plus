            "According to sources who have been reliable in the past, apple currently plans to hold their ipad 3 announcement on wednesday, march 7, 2012. Along with the 2048x1536 retina display, the ipad 3 will feature a quad-core apple a6 system-on-a-chip, and possibly 4g lte networking. The march 7 date fits with what allthingsd reported last week, about the next ipad event being scheduled for the first week of march, and wednesday is a traditional day for apple to hold these types of events. Whether apple would simply improve and optimize the current dual-core arm cortex a9 processor found in the apple a5 soc, or go quad-core has been a lingering question, with 9to5mac finding code references to quad-core but the verge hearing otherwise. However, it sounds like they're going quad-core. 4g lte networking has been another mystery surrounding the ipad 3, with a compatible qualcomm chipset becoming available, but international lte coverage is still slim, and in some cases a year or more away. It sounds like apple has 4g lte lined up for iphone 5 this october, but we're still not certain if the ipad 3 will get it earlier. Verizon is going to want ios devices that go faster than 2-3mbps, of course, especially with at&t offering hspa 14.4, and potentially faster, models. Apple could release a 4g lte variant model, targeted at verizon, at&t, rogers, bell, and other carriers that have rolled out enough support to see demand, or they could wait and debut it in the next iphone instead.

After trump's five big wins on tuesday night, all eyes — except possibly those of john kasich — are on indiana, which votes next tuesday. With 54 delegates at stake, awarded on a winner-take-all basis statewide and by congressional district, experts predict that a trump victory in the state will all but seal the nomination for him. A roundup of coverage: ted cruz can be expected to \" pull out all the stops \" over the next week in a bid to regain momentum, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. He notes that cruz, bafflingly, is getting \" something of a pass from the party \" for finishing third behind kasich in many races, including four out of tuesday's five primaries. Cruz came in second place in pennsylvania. At fivethirtyeight, nate silver notes that \" something has changed for the better \" for trump in the last few weeks, putting him ahead of the necessary targets on the road to 1,237 delegates. Indiana has gone from a must-win for trump to a must-win for his opponents, silver writes — but a trump loss will mean he is \" back to fighting tooth-and-nail for every uncommitted delegate \" in a volatile race. Indiana hasn't mattered this much to the gop race in 40 years, and voters are receiving a lot more attention than they're used to, reports the indianapolis star. \" five states voted tuesday, but there's five times as much drama in indiana, \" cook political report analyst david wasserman says. Counting indiana, trump is now two states from the nomination, according to the new york times, which looks at the delegate math — and at why it will be tough for cruz and kasich to coordinate anti-trump efforts in california.

James's palace, when a guest told the duke of edinburgh he was sorry to hear he would be standing down, the 95-year-old replied, \" i can't stand up much, \" reuters reports. Philip's off-the-cuff quips and remarks — often seen as gaffes — have been the subject of much media attention in the wake of the announcement. That, and other coverage: the bbc has a timeline of some of philip's biggest gaffes. In 1986, for example, he told a group of british students visiting china, \" if you stay here much longer you ' ll all be slitty-eyed. \" the guardian has its own list of philip's \" clangers, \" including the time he asked an indigenous australian entrepreneur, \" do you still throw spears at each other? but philip was also known for being humorous — the telegraph calls him \" by far the funniest \" royal, and takes a look at philip in his own words via nuggets from a book about him. The telegraph also looks back at how philip wooed queen elizabeth. One adorable detail? during their courtship, elizabeth often listened to \" people will say we're in love \" from the musical oklahoma! speaking of the queen, the times of london says that many have long wondered how she ' ll fare without him by her side at royal engagements. Its take on the matter here. One uk politician is being criticized for using philip's resignation to promote a campaign about pension inequality. The independent has the story. Brits are responding with quips of their own; one twitter user joked that the queen \" trolled the entire world \" by calling an emergency meeting of the royal household staff, making the situation seem more dire than it turned out to be. The washington post has a roundup of reactions. One brit, though, is calling for an end to the monarchy. Despite his often xenophobic gaffes, \" this man has continued to be allowed to at least partly represent britain for more than 50 years. If there were ever a moment to question our own complacency as a nation, this is it, \" writes sirena bergman in the independent.",

Walt disney coo tom staggs, widely seen as the heir apparent to ceo bob iger, unexpectedly announced his resignation on monday. Sources tell the wall street journal that the 55-year-old staggs, who had been rising through the disney ranks since 1990, quit after learning that the board had broadened its search for iger's successor, suggesting he was unlikely to get the job when the ceo retires in june 2018. Insiders say that disney, which faces major technological challenges in the years ahead, may now look outside the company for a ceo for the first time since the 1980s. One name in the frame is facebook coo sheryl sandberg, per reuters. Other possible candidates include 21st century fox executive vice chairman chase carey and cbs chief leslie moonves, variety reports. There's also a chance that disney could choose another internal candidate — or that iger, who will be 67 in 2018, could be persuaded to stay on for a few years. \" internally this sets up a horse race, but i ' m not sure who the horses are, \" says media analyst tom vogel.",

Compare that to france, which agreed to take in 24,000 over the next two years, while munich alone registered about 7,000 by yesterday and germany figures it can embrace some 800,000. Another tidbit in cameron's press conference today: britain assassinated two of its citizens last month by raf drone strike in syria; both were said to be members of the islamic state, the guardian reports. \" it was necessary and proportionate for the individual self-defence of the uk, \" says cameron.

Not over griffey's qualifications — 630 home runs, 10 straight gold gloves, not a whiff of steroid scandal, and, yes, even a candy bar made his selection a no-brainer. Instead, it's over the three sportswriters who voted against him. Griffey received 437 of 440 votes for a 99.3 percentage that surpassed tom seaver's as the highest ever. The votes are cast by sportswriters, and so far the trio who voted against griffey have yet to come forward. \" these are civilized times, right? \" writes phil rogers at mlb.com. \" it would probably be the wrong thing to do a freedom of information request and find the names of the junior griffey three. \" the nay votes amount to \" an egregious oversight for which three as-yet-anonymous voters will have to answer — to themselves, if no one else, \" writes larry stone at the seattle times.

Some speculate the shutterings are due to residual effects from the recession or competition from illegal escorts, but daniel hernandez writes for the guardian that it could be something else entirely: a failure to \" innovate \" and offer polished customer service. What hernandez calls \" the survival of the freakiest \" could mean anything from theatrical sex sessions and workspaces ( e.g., rooms set up to play naked wii ) to \" skill-sharing seminars \" ( e.g., a sex worker teaching colleagues how to use a prostate massager ). Examples of fornication frontrunners include the famous moonlite bunny ranch and what hernandez calls the \" yankee stadium of sex work \": sheri's ranch, which hernandez notes boasts \" a madam who sounded like she attended stanford business school. \" sheri's attracts a diverse clientele — blue collar, middle class, one percenters — and is said to offer stellar service ( one 58-year-old client, a virgin, raves about sheri's in a blog post ). The \" courtesans \" correspond with clients about scripts and costumes, often dressing up in cheerleader get-ups or as fictional characters like princess leia or wonder woman. The food seems good, too: in a four-star yelp review, customers gush about sheri's tasty burgers and wraps.

The vote got off to a violent start when a mob of 200 secessionists armed with machetes ambushed and killed five police officers in the coastal city of mombasa, the ap reports. Another police officer was killed in a separate attack by the same group; a police official said seven people died in that attack. Officials have warned that criminals plan to disguise themselves as police to disrupt voting in some areas, and there are fears of attacks from somali militants. Kenyans are also choosing members of parliament, senators, and 47 county governors, but all eyes are on the presidential contest dominated by prime minister raila odinga and deputy prime minister uhuru kenyatta, the bbc reports. There is a long history of tension between the two candidates'tribes, and kenyatta is facing a trial at the international criminal court for his role in 2007's violence.

        "summary": "Just five prosecutors representing less than 0.2 % of us counties are responsible for 14 % of all people currently on death row and 5 % of people sentenced to death in the past 40 years. That's according to a recently released report from harvard law school's fair punishment project. The report — subtitled \" how overzealous personalities drive the death penalty \" — found the death penalty was more about prosecutors cultivating an \" over-aggressive \" and \" reckless \" style than the actual crimes, the huffington post reports. And, according to the guardian, that leads to a \" highly arbitrary \" use of the death penalty. The five prosecutors, who have sentenced a total of 440 people to death, are joe britt in north carolina, bob macy in oklahoma, lynne abraham in pennsylvania, johnny holmes in texas, and donnie myers in south carolina. Only myers is still serving as a prosecutor. All five prosecutors seem to relish securing the death penalty. Myer has an electric chair paperweight. Macy, who got a 16-year-old sentenced to death, saw it as his \" patriotic duty. \" abraham says she's never doubted one of her death sentences, despite two of them later being exonerated. And that leads to another problem: the \" illegal or unethical behavior \" that seems to go hand-in-hand with a passion for the death penalty. Misconduct was found in a third of macy's 54 death sentences, and three of them were exonerated. Britt was found to have committed misconduct in more than a third of his 38 death sentences and had two developmentally disabled teens exonerated. Myers was found to have a 46 % misconduct rate, often for excluding jurors on the basis of race. He once referred to a black defendant as \" king kong \" and a \" beast of burden. \" read the full report here.",

Days before the closing, the woods received a letter from someone calling himself \" the watcher. \" it was the first such letter they had received and andrea woods didn't find it threatening. But within two weeks of buying the house, the broadduses had received three letters from \" the watcher \" claiming the house was under his ownership and control. Disturbed, they never moved in, and the house is currently occupied by renters and back on the market for $ 1.125 million. The broadduses ultimately sued the woods and the woods countersued, but a judge has now thrown out both suits, nj.com reports. In her ruling wednesday, superior court judge camille m. Kenny threw out the remaining three counts in the broadduses'suit against the woods, fraud counts involving allegations that the woods intentionally kept the letter they had received from \" the watcher \" from their buyers. The judge said that there's no evidence the woods purposely hid the letter, and that if she sustained the complaint, it would create \" uncertainty in real estate law \" as to whether future sellers would be required to disclose one-time issues not related to the house itself, like a loud party neighbors once threw.

British authorities said sunday that bethan davies and robert jesty had been freed after gunmen ambushed their vehicle in virunga national park on friday, reports the bbc. During the ambush, the gunmen killed rachel masika baraka, who was one of 26 female rangers at the park. She is believed to be the first female ranger killed at virunga, which reuters explains is located in a still-volatile region near uganda and rwanda but remains a draw for tourists worldwide because of its endangered mountain gorillas and active volcano. She is the eighth park ranger overall killed in this year alone. The details of how the hostages were freed remain murky, but ransom negotiations had been underway. The gunmen took the british pair on foot, along with their driver, who was eventually freed before the brits. \" one of them said to me 'i will leave you here, if ( they ) find you, tell them we need $ 200,000 and if they keep on chasing us, we will kill these two, ' \" the injured driver tells the telegraph. The kidnappers later reduced their demand to $ 30,000, according to another story in the telegraph. British foreign secretary boris johnson announced the release but did not say whether any ransom was paid. \" i pay tribute to the help of the drc authorities and congolese institute of nature conservation, \" johnson tweeted. \" my thoughts with the family of the ranger tragically killed during the kidnapping. \"",

Trump and republicans have attacked the fbi and justice department for relying partly on a dossier written by former british spy christopher steele, partly financed by democrats, in the application to the foreign intelligence surveillance court. \"as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of 'justice ' and fbi misled the courts, \" trump said in a twitter message early sunday. \"witch hunt rigged, a scam! \" in another tweet, trump said, \"looking more &amp; more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon ( surveillance ). \" rubio disagrees but democrats have said other information besides the steele report was used to obtain renewals of the warrant on page, and republican senator marco",
            "Washington ( cnn ) carter page on sunday called the accusations against him detailed in the foreign surveillance warrant application released by the fbi \" so ridiculous. \" \" you talk about misleading the courts, it's just so misleading, \" page said about the warrant application in an interview on cnn's \" state of the union with jake tapper. \" \" it's literally a complete joke, \" he told tapper. On saturday, the fbi released a redacted version of the warrant application on page, a trump campaign foreign policy adviser, after news organizations and advocacy groups sued for its disclosure. Tapper asked page about being a past adviser to russia, to which page said the term adviser was \" way over the top. \" \" i sat in on some meetings, \" page said. However, when tapper pressed him about his previous reference to himself as an informal adviser to the kremlin, page downplayed his earlier remarks, responding, \" informal, having some conversations with people, i mean, this is really nothing and just an attempt to distract from the real crimes shown in this misleading document. \" the release of the document is noteworthy as it marks the first public",

        "summary": "A san jose cop died last night, apparently at the hands of a suicidal gunman, the san francisco chronicle reports, in the california city's first fatal shooting of an officer in 14 years. Michael johnson, a field training officer reportedly engaged to be married, was responding to a call that suspect scott dunham was drunk and threatening to kill himself. As officers surrounded the apartment where dunham was holed up, a man on the balcony opened fire shortly after 7pm; johnson was struck and died on the scene. Police gained entrance to the apartment a few hours later using explosives, and a robotic camera found dunham's body on the balcony around 3: 30am, the san jose mercury news reports. San jose's last officer to die in the line of duty, jeffrey fontana in 2001, was said to have been in the same police academy class as johnson. Dunham's wife — who had earlier fled the apartment after he reportedly said she would die if \" she didn't leave, \" per the chronicle — had informed police that the 57-year-old had access to weapons, including a rifle, and might harm himself or others, the los angeles times reports. Dunham reportedly suffered one gunshot wound, police say, though it's not clear yet if it was self-inflicted or if he was injured by police gunfire, the mercury news notes. \" this is san jose's darkest hour, \" mayor sam liccardo said last night, per the times. Tragedy also struck law enforcement last night in wisconsin, per the fond du lac reporter: a state trooper was shot and killed during a gunfire exchange with a bank robbery suspect.",

Galganov was planning to stay at the hostel the evening of sept. 28, and security footage shows him leaving a bus station that morning in the direction of the hostel. He later sent a friend a snapchat from the hostel. There is no record of him registering at the entry point of the trail he was planning to hike, and no other hikers or guides on the popular trail have reported sightings of him.

A full 1,000-page charge sheet will be filed thursday, reports the hindustan times. Those arrested include the driver of the bus in which the savage attack took place and a juvenile, along with four adult males. Police say the victim and her boyfriend had just left a movie theater in new delhi on dec. 16 when the bus — a school bus of some sort with tinted windows — pulled up and offered them a ride, reports asiaone and the times of india. Police say the suspects, who had been drinking heavily as they took joyrides around the city, then robbed and attacked the couple before dumping them off the bus. The woman's condition deteriorated at the hospital, and doctors had to remove her intestines because her injuries were so severe. She had been a physiotherapy student. Protesters say police routinely shrug their shoulders at violence against women and were gathering again today to mourn the victim, reports ap. \" as a woman, and mother, i understand how protesters feel, \" said sonia gandhi, president of the ruling congress party. \" today we pledge that the victim will get justice. \"",

Yes, humans should apparently fear the creatures'teeth as well as their zapping ability. The 33-year-old local man was surfing at waikiki beach on saturday when he felt a pain in his left foot. He reached shore, where bystanders had to use towels to stop the bleeding before paramedics arrived, reports the honolulu star-advertiser. Though a rep for hawaii's department of land and natural resources says he's never heard of an eel attack in the state, officials found no sign of a shark and say the man's injuries are consistent with an eel bite, rather than a shark bite, per khon2. Though eels frequent hawaii's coral reefs, officials are waiting to interview the man before coming to any concrete conclusions, according to the ap. In the meantime, the ocean safety group isn't ruling out other options, noting barracudas have also been spotted near waikiki recently. Hours before the attack, another man was injured off oahu's lanikai beach, though officials suspect a tiger shark was the culprit in that case. Witnesses say the 44-year-old was swimming with a friend 50 to 100 yards from shore when he was bitten. \" both legs, just above the ankle, were just hanging on, \" one bystander tells hawaii news now.

        "summary": "The ongoing debate over what prompted the decline of easter island's native polynesian inhabitants, known as rapa nui, is being clarified by scientists digging for answers in the soil. Writing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, an international team of researchers explain that they examined agricultural soil chemistry and land use trends to get a better picture of any shrinking and swelling in population numbers. While some have argued the rapa nui's collapse occurred only after the europeans first arrived in 1722, the researchers found \" evidence of some communities being abandoned prior to european contact, \" explains uc santa barbara's oliver chadwick in a press release. To gauge population trends, the researchers reviewed six agriculture sites on the 63-square-mile island. At each one, they measured how much water had penetrated the surface of obsidian spear points, which told them how long the obsidian had been exposed and thus how old the spear points were. They determined that a very dry area of the island located in a volcano's \" rain shadow \" and a very wet area that featured a low nutrient supply were given up prior to 1722. But the area that balanced a moderate level of rain and a healthy nutrient supply maintained a \" robust population \" even after the europeans arrived — bringing with them smallpox, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Chadwick views the pullback as a reaction to the people's inability to \" maintain the food resources necessary to keep the statue builders in business. So we see the story as one of pushing against constraints and having to pull back rather than one of violent collapse. \" ( tooth plaque has revealed more about how the rapa nui lived. )",

In the study — published wednesday in the journal of the american heart association — researchers exposed rats to both types of smoke for one minute, which worsened the ability of the rats ' blood vessels to widen and made the transportation of blood more difficult. It took the rats 90 minutes to recover from the effects of the pot smoke — three times longer than with the tobacco smoke. \" these temporary problems can turn into long-term problems if exposures occur often enough and may increase the chances of developing hardened and clogged arteries, \" the study's author, matthew springer, says in a press release. Springer says this study could correct the current public perception that secondhand marijuana smoke is somehow less harmful than secondhand tobacco smoke. \"we in public health have been telling the public to avoid secondhand tobacco smoke for years, but we don't tell them to avoid secondhand marijuana smoke, because until now we haven't had evidence that it can be harmful, \" he says. The results from the study indicate it's the actual smoke that's hurting the cardiovascular system, not active ingredients like nicotine or thc. \" the broader message in the study may be a no-brainer, \" forbes concludes. \" perhaps breathing in anything burning is just not very good for our hearts. \" ( marijuana could be an effective treatment for alzheimer's. )",

Without mentioning gingrich by name, romney manages to convey that he \" is a family man, \" while gingrich, \" well, isn't, \" writes chris cillizza in the washington post. Of course, it may not matter — as cillizza points out, gingrich's previously stormy personal life hasn't appeared to sway voters.

            "The story most often told about christopher cockerell is that he invented the hovercraft by experimenting with a device made from two empty cans and a vacuum cleaner. Some accounts say one of the cans had contained cat food and the other coffee. Some maintain that both were coffee cans. In other versions a pair of kitchen scales is mentioned. Sir christopher ( as he later became ) seems not to have clarified these technical points. He was content for this homely story to become part of inventors ' folklore, unencumbered by too much detail. Everything was stacked against becoming an inventor, he once said. People did not really want new ideas, even when they offered a better way of doing something.

        "summary": "You can start believing in magic again, because not only are fanged deer real, it turns out unicorns are, too. Well, sort of. In august, a hunter shot an elderly roe deer bearing a single, centered antler in the forests of slovenia, reports national geographic. It's not uncommon to find deer with just a \" spike \" — what a remaining antler is called after one is lost; even an injury to a buck's hind leg can cause an abnormality. But in this case, both antlers had fused into one, giving a unicorn-like appearance. This was a first for scientist boštjan pokorny, who confirmed the roe deer's fantastical and \" untypical \" deformity, which national geographic notes was probably caused by an injury sustained as the antlers were forming, which is an annual occurrence. The roe deer lived to be quite old and was a little pudgy, leading pokorny to infer his unusual deformity didn't hold him back in life. Meanwhile, on another continent, another hunter also recently bagged a \" unicorn deer. \" kulr reports amy calkins shot what she thought was her first buck in washington state in mid-october — except it turned out to be a doe with a single antler. Calkins posted photos on facebook of the deer and its four teats, and she says she later learned that a hormone imbalance caused the unusual growth. Mississippi state university's deer lab notes that it's \" difficult to identify the particular cause of a particular buck's ( or doe's ) abnormality without a detailed dissection or necropsy. \" it's unclear if one occurred in this case.

            "Antlers antler abnormalities while most bucks develop normal antlers, on occasion a hunter will run across a buck with antlers that a deer biologist might refer to as developmental abnormalities. Developmental abnormalities range from antlers that never leave the velvet stage all the way to antlers that are found on a doe's head instead of on a buck's. The wide variety of developmental abnormalties makes it difficult to identify the particular cause of a particular buck's ( or doe's ) abnormality without a detailed dissection or necropsy. There are just too many potentially confounding and overlapping circumstances in the wild for biologists to nail down a specific cause based only on a description or photo. We do know that most abnormalities are caused by injuries such as damage to a buck's pedicle, damage to the antler during the velvet stage, or even an injury to a buck's hind leg. Damage to the antler pedicle or the skull's frontal bone is the most common cause of antler malformation. Injuries to the pedicle and frontal bone may cause abnormal conformation and asymmetry. A presumptive injury caused ( a ) asymmetry and growth of accessory antler ( arrow ) and ( b ) asymmetry similar to the one on left, lack of a burr and malformed pedicle indicative of recovery from trauma ( arrow; note the difference",

Recently diagnosed with metastatic cancer ( meaning simply that it has spread ) after his parents grew concerned about a droopy eyelid and large lump on his hip, vinny's docs have yet to identify the exact type. Vinny's grandparents set up a gofundme page to help the family survive what will surely be large medical bills, all while vinny's father is a combat veteran and his mother is six months pregnant. Some 2,000 people have so far donated more than $ 75,000, and the parents admitted in their own update this week that while they appreciate the \" extraordinary \" support, \" this is all new to us as a family and we don't want to lie to you we are a little uncomfortable — we're just a blue collar family who enjoys bbq's with friends, and fart jokes. \" vinny, meanwhile, is taking it all in stride, though at boing boing, xeni jardin issues a note of caution: \" we don't have to make this child a hero, or a fighter, or someone who's ' battling ' and ' got this. ' cancer patients don't have to be superheroes.

A un article on the study broke down the numbers: those 5,000 dives captured more than 3,400 pieces of garbage. While rubber, metal, and cloth were spotted, 33 % of debris found was plastic, and 89 % of it was from single-use products that, as the name suggests, are used once then tossed. At depths of 20,000 feet or greater, plastic became more dominant, making up more than half the garbage, with nearly all of it being single-use. And the plastic wasn't exclusively found in lifeless areas. \" deep-sea organisms were observed in the 17 % of plastic debris images, which include entanglement of plastic bags, \" per the study, which cites sea anemones, ray-finned fish, and brittle stars seen attached on plastics. \" entanglement of plastic bags [ was ] detected even in the cold seep communities and its negative impact on these rare ecosystems is [ concerning ], \" continues the study published in marine policy.

Now comes the latest bid from the obama camp, the \"life of julia \" infographic that hit the web late last week. The graphic shows a theoretical woman at various stages of her life, and compares her lot under obama's policies and romney's, with predictable results. At 3, julia is eligible for head start funds, unless those theoretical romney budget cuts take hold! at 27, her health care plan pays for her birth control, unless romney moves forward with that obamacare repeal! at 42, she qualifies for a small business administration loan, unless that \"romney/ryan \" budget shrinks the pot! continue reading below conservatives, naturally, have railed against julia's \"cradle-to-grave government dependence. \" the heritage foundation released an alternative graphic, in which julia takes advantage of school choice, offsets her small-business expenditures with a flatter tax, and works at a catholic school, content in the knowledge that her employer doesn't have to pay for contraception. But the recoil against julia isn't a matter of ideology: you don't have to be hiding under the bedcovers, quivering in fear of european-style socialism, to know that life can't be reduced to a series of events loosely bound to government policy.

            "Ok, it's time for the presidential campaigns to stop talking about women. Seriously: it isn't helping. Last month, it was mitt romney's fuzzy-math suggestion that women lost more jobs than men in the recession. Now comes the latest bid from the obama camp, the \"life of julia \" infographic that hit the web late last week. The graphic shows a theoretical woman at various stages of her life, and compares her lot under obama's policies and romney's, with predictable results. At 3, julia is eligible for head start funds, unless those theoretical romney budget cuts take hold! at 27, her health care plan pays for her birth control, unless romney moves forward with that obamacare repeal! at 42, she qualifies for a small business administration loan, unless that \"romney/ryan \" budget shrinks the pot! continue reading below conservatives, naturally, have railed against julia's \"cradle-to-grave government dependence. \" the heritage foundation released an alternative graphic, in which julia takes advantage of school choice, offsets her small-business expenditures with a flatter tax, and works at a catholic school, content in the knowledge that her employer doesn't have to pay for contraception. But the recoil against julia isn't a matter of ideology: you don't have to be hiding under the bedcovers, quivering in fear of european-style socialism, to know that life can't be reduced to a series of events loosely bound to government policy. On msnbc, advertising impresario donny deutsch, a self-described progressive, said the graphic made him feel \"weak. \" on the gaming website ign, someone posted a faux infographic, filled with absurd predictions of obama v. Romney futures. In college, this julia gets gender reassignment surgery under obama's \"college is a confusing time \" health plan. And under romney, fundamentalist preachers ban dancing in her town. Continue reading below that is, perhaps, the biggest problem with julia: she's far too easy to mock. The choices the campaign has made for julia's life are meant to be universal, but amount to a milquetoast quasi-urban east coast fantasy existence. Her career choice is \"web designer. \" ( creative but",

But charles krauthammer thinks that victory came at a price. \" no one has misled? \" he writes in the washington post. \" his un ambassador went on not one but five morning shows to spin a confection \" that the consulate was sacked by a mob angry over a video. Krauthammer says obama and his team have been \" dancing for months \" on chris stevens ' grave by pressing the mob/video narrative, when in reality the embassy was stormed in an outright terror attack. \" unfortunately for obama, there is one more debate, \" and it's entirely on foreign policy. \" romney will be ready. \" for krauthammer's full column, click here.

The group, which describes the term as \" demeaning and damaging, \" says it hopes the california law will put more pressure on the washington redskins to change their name. The move affects high schools in madera county, calaveras county, tulare county, and merced county, where opponents say the name has been used for generations and shouldn't be considered offensive, the merced sun-star reports. The state will provide funds to help the schools buy things like new uniforms and signs, reports the san francisco chronicle. Brown approved the \" redskins \" bill but vetoed a measure banning public parks and buildings from being named after confederate figures, saying the issue is \" quintessentially for local decision makers, \" reports the la times.

        "summary": "Brooke preston was leaving west palm beach, fla., to return to pennsylvania, where she grew up. The 21-year-old had moved out of the house she shared with randy herman jr., 24, and went there saturday morning to say goodbye. She hugged herman, and then herman, who also grew up in pennsylvania and reportedly went to high school with preston, gave her a t-shirt commemorating a mutual friend who had died. Then, police say, he stabbed her a dozen times with a hunting knife. \" herman told me that all he could remember after giving preston the t-shirt was blood, \" a detective wrote in the arrest report. Preston died, and herman, who drove her car to a nearby park after the alleged murder and called 911 from there, has been charged with first-degree murder, the palm beach post reports. A friend says preston had spent part of friday night at the house with herman — there is no indication they were romantically linked — but left because he was intoxicated and acting oddly. She returned the next morning to get her things, then went to breakfast and returned again later to say goodbye. She was moving back home to be with her boyfriend, wnep reports. Herman allegedly told police that since he and preston were the only ones in the home at the time, he must have stabbed her; police say they found him covered in blood and found preston's body covered with a blanket. Herman's father was accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend in 2015; two months later, he fatally shot himself. A gofundme campaign for preston's family has raised more than $ 10,000 so far.",

The researchers say that scans of a very ill man in colombia revealed what \" looked like cancer, but the tumors were composed of cells that were not human, \" npr reports. The tumors had come from the man's resident tapeworm, which had developed cancer and somehow spread the disease to its host, according to the scientists, whose study published in the new england journal of medicine describes the \" invasion of human tissue by abnormal, proliferating, genetically altered tapeworm cells \" as a \" novel disease mechanism. \" the man died 72 hours after researchers pinpointed the cause of the tumors, live science reports. The colombian man had hiv, which meant the tapeworm's growth in his body was not halted the way it would have been by a healthy immune system, live science notes. A cdc pathologist tells the washington post that it took dozens of tests to reveal the cause of the illness, and finding tapeworm dna in the tumors was a huge surprise. \" this is the first time we've seen parasite-derived cancer cells spreading within an individual, \" he says. \" this is a very unusual, very unique illness. \" the post notes that the study raises questions about what other parasites dwelling in the human body can develop — and spread — cancer.

According to usa today, a national weather service gauge outside houston measured 49.32 inches of rain — the most ever from a tropical storm or hurricane in the continental us. And with tropical storm harvey still dumping water, things aren't likely to get better anytime soon. The levee at columbia lakes south of houston breached tuesday, and brazoria county officials weren't mincing words in a tweet: \" get out now!! \" meanwhile, the brazos river 30 miles outside houston measured nearly 52 feet tuesday and is expected to reach 59 feet by thursday — easily a record.

        "summary": "Taking a bike ride can offer various health benefits, but along with those pros come the cons: notably, the risk of being seriously hurt in an accident. Uc san francisco researchers say such incidences have risen steadily for adults since the late 1990s, with more visits to the er and hospital and more of the accompanying costs for medical care, per a new study in the injury prevention journal. Between 1997 and 2013, there were about 3.8 million non-fatal bicycle injuries and nearly 10,000 deaths, with a press release noting that the total outlay for all associated medical costs until the end of the study hit $ 237 billion — a figure about twice that of the costs linked to all other occupational illnesses during the same time. In 2013 alone, the costs for bike accidents hovered close to $ 24.5 billion. That's also about a 137 % spike over the course of the study for non-fatal accidents, and 23 % for fatal ones. Men seem to have the most trouble behind the handlebars, racking up 75 % of the total costs, and riders 45 and over are also faltering: while they accounted for only about 26 % of total costs in 1997, by 2013 that figure had jumped to 54 %. Scientists think the older set is seeing an increase in injuries simply because more older people are taking to their schwinns, but they theorize worsening injuries overall could be from people bike-commuting more often. \" to me, it clearly makes a strong case for investment in safer cycling infrastructure, \" says study co-author benjamin breyer, who adds that european cities, with more bike riders yet fewer accidents, seem to have figured out a way to minimize the hurt.

            "Bicycle use has skyrocketed in popularity, but it's also led to more accidents, with medical costs from non-fatal bike crashes climbing steadily by $ 789 million annually, according to a new study by uc san francisco. Over a 17-year period, medical costs of bicycle injuries to adults in the united states, both fatal and non-fatal, amounted to $ 237 billion, the study found. In 2013 alone, total costs from bicycle accidents exceeded $ 24.4 billion, the researchers reported. That is approximately double the medical and other various costs involved for all occupational illnesses over the same time period. There were 3.8 million non-fatal adult bicycle injuries and nearly 9,839 deaths that were reported during the study period from 1997 to 2013. Men accounted for three-quarters of the total costs.

The new york times reports the 26-year-old canadian beauty queen has rubbed china the wrong way because she uses her platform to speak out against the country's human rights abuses. \"i don't care about all this — the hair, the dresses, \" lin tells the boston globe. \"i just want to get to that stage and be the voice for people who are silenced. \" but now family and friends say lin is the one being silenced, threatened with being booted from the 2016 miss world pageant — funded largely by chinese companies despite being held in the us this year — if she continues to speak her mind. Moments after lin gave the globe the above quote, pageant officials broke up the interview. And sources tell the hollywood reporter that miss world has turned down requests from the ap, times, and reuters to interview lin. After a state department official requested to meet with lin, miss world reportedly insisted on a pageant chaperone. Lin, also an actor, is the star of the bleeding edge, a film about china harvesting organs from members of a banned religious group that is premiering in the us on wednesday. Organizers of the premiere say miss world is banning her from attending. The head of the miss world pageant denies any sort of \" gag order \" on lin, saying she's free to attend events and speak with anyone she wishes.",

Per courthouse news service, kimberly kriege brought her truck to a livingston carwash on sept. 30, 2013, and made a gruesome discovery on the bay floor: part of a human face. That face belonged to 81-year-old elgie bedford, an alaskan man traveling to texas to visit his kids and grandkids and who had apparently been the victim of a hit-and-run on interstate 90. And it's a somewhat complicated tale: after hitting bedford with a truck he drove for crst expedited, 45-year-old david welk \" left the body on the highway \" and drove away, kriege's suit claims. But it wasn't welk who was responsible for kriege's find at the carwash. That was said to be the fault of 31-year-old wryan young, who allegedly was driving one of the other cars that ran over bedford's body lying on the road after welk hit him. Young drove her pickup truck to the carwash and \" left a large portion of bedford's face on the car wash floor, \" kriege's complaint continues. Kriege, who's seeking payment for the \" intensive psychological counseling \" she received, as well as damages for lost income, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress, says finding \" a large recognizable part of a human face \" was severely emotionally traumatizing. The charges against young were dismissed in 2014, per courthouse news, while welk was found guilty in october that year for \" knowingly being involved in an accident of a deceased person or another person, \" per ktmf. He received a six-year deferred sentence in january 2015. ( if you can stomach it, read about another horrifying lawsuit. )",

Simpson — who was famously acquitted in 1995 in the slayings of his ex-wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman — has been serving out a nine-to-33-year sentence for his role in a 2007 incident that unfolded in a las vegas hotel room. He and armed associates allegedly confronted memorabilia dealers bruce fromong and alfred beardsley and took pieces of simpson's memorabilia from them. Simpson was convicted on charges including kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. The former college and pro football star said at his sentencing that he was trying to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been stolen from him, and claimed that he was unaware his associates were carrying guns. Simpson's lawyers in the nevada case argued that the crime did not justify the time.

But in 2013, long after her parents'deaths, byrd came across her unsealed adoption documents and made a life-altering find at the age of 70. \" on every single paper it said that i was white, \" she tells people — as were her biological parents, earl and daisy beagle, and the other children they had. Byrd went into foster care at age 2 after earl left the family and daisy suffered a bad injury, and she was subsequently adopted, per people. Byrd says no one ever batted an eye at her skin color because her adoptive mom was a light-skinned black woman. Naturally, the realization she's not black was a shocker for byrd, now 72 — and for her husband of 36 years, trancle, she tells people. \" [ he ] went to bed one night with a black woman and woke up the next morning with a white one, \" she says, but \" i still feel black and that's not going to change. … when you're dead and gone in the cemetery, the tombstone doesn't say what race you were. \" three surviving white biological sisters with whom she's since reunited also don't care about her skin color, with one telling the magazine, \" she could have been purple as far as i care. It's just so fun to have her now in my life. \" and for those who may be tempted to draw comparisons between herself and rachel dolezal, byrd has one thing to say. \" she upsets me so much because i don't understand why she or anyone needs to lie about their race or their ethnic group, \" she notes. \" i did not know i was born white.

A big advantage, too, at 58 % to 34 %, the christian science monitor reports. Veterans are an important part of the republican base; they voted for john mccain over obama 54 % to 44 % in 2008, and there are large numbers of veterans in closely-watched states including florida, pennsylvania, virginia, and north carolina. But the percentage of veterans in the us is dwindling: they currently make up 13 % of the electorate, but as the older veterans die and that proportion decreases, the democrats could ultimately get a boost. Gallup suggests two reasons veterans may prefer the gop: \" men who serve in the military may become socialized into a more conservative orientation to politics as a result of their service, \" writes the editor-in-chief. \" additionally, men who in the last decades have chosen to enlist in the military may have a more republican orientation to begin with. \" assuming romney clinches the nomination, this will be the first presidential election since world war ii in which neither the republican nor the democratic candidate is a veteran.",

Neely and his wife believe they were some sort of agency royalty who used taxpayer funds to bankroll their lavish lifestyle, \" rep. Elijah cummings said earlier this week. Deborah neely was along during the now-infamous las vegas trip that kicked off the scandal, but she also accompanied her husband on a 17-day trip to hawaii, guam, and the mariana islands ( it's not clear if the gsa paid her way on that trip ). Beforehand, she wrote in an email to jeff of the trip, \" it's yo birfday. … we gonna pawty like iz yo birfday! \" that trip — as well as four others jeff neely took, for a total of 44 days — occurred after the inspector general had already warned top officials to stop the trips, the ap reports. The excessive travel isn't the end of the story: brian miller is also investigating kickbacks and bribery, and has recommended criminal prosecutions.

The nfl has upheld its decision to bench tom brady for four games over underinflated footballs, meaning backup garoppolo will be in the spotlight.
