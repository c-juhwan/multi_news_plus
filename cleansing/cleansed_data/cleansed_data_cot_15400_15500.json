        "summary": "Normally, an elementary school adding an after-school program isn't cause for national headlines. Things are little different when the program is called the after school satan club. The portland chapter of the satanic temple has just been approved to establish the club at sacramento elementary school in portland, the oregonian reports. Despite the name, cbs clarifies that the satanic temple's focus is on teaching science and critical reasoning, not devil-worship, the idea being to counter christian after-school groups springing up around the nation. The after school satan club will run once monthly, on wednesdays, at the same time the evangelical christian good news club meets at the school. The satanic temple itself isn't quite what its name suggests, explained the washington post in a previous story. It \" doesn't espouse a belief in the existence of a supernatural being that other religions identify solemnly as satan, or lucifer, or beelzebub, \" but it's fond of offering \" tongue-in-cheek \" support of the devil to make a point about the separation of church and state. The temple has been expanding into after-school programming specifically to counter the increasing influence of religious after-school programs like the good news club, which were given the go-ahead by the supreme court in 2001. The after school satan club ultimately hopes to establish a chapter in every school where the good news club has a presence, fox news reports.",

On monday, a federal jury ruled in favor of elliot williams ' estate in a wrongful death lawsuit over the incident, ordering tulsa county to pay $ 10.2 million in damages and former sheriff stanley glanz to pay $ 250,000, krmg reports. The attorney for williams ' estate says he believes this may be \" one of the worst civil rights violations in us history \" — and the final 51 hours of it were caught on the tulsa county jail's surveillance system. The difficult-to-watch video shows williams on the floor of his cell as his cries for help are ignored and food and water are placed just out of his reach. In an extensive look at the case last year, the daily beast explained what happened. Williams, who had a history of mental illness, was arrested in a hotel lobby oct. 21, 2011, after hotel staff called police saying he appeared to be having a mental breakdown. On oct. 22, in the jail's booking area, he was slammed to the floor by an officer who said he landed on williams'shoulders and head. After that incident, williams started screaming and having difficulty standing; investigators were concerned he may have broken his neck but offered no medical treatment, even as williams insisted he was paralyzed. Officers told williams ' parents he was faking his injuries, despite the fact that he stopped eating and drinking, urinated and defecated on himself, and had a seizure. He died oct. 27 of complications from the neck injury and dehydration. Charges had not yet been filed against him when he died, fox 23 reports.

By the end of the 2004 season, mlb had presided over a trade that set the expos'successors back several years, helped short-circuit a last-gasp playoff run, ended baseball for good in montreal, and reminded us why a sports franchise in league hands is a catastrophe waiting to happen. On february 14, 2002, mlb bought the expos for $ 120 million. From the beginning, this wasn't some benevolent stewardship, meant to steer the team through choppy waters. Rather, the stated goal was to assassinate ( \"contract \" was the slightly less repugnant term the league used ) the expos, as well as the minnesota twins. There have been many theories as to whether or not the threat was real, and what mlb hoped to achieve. It may have been a way for owners to gain leverage with a new collective bargaining agreement drawing nigh.

Per bbc, us investigators have determined the country is behind the march 4 poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia skripal, who were found unconscious on a bench in salisbury, england. The british government revealed earlier that the nerve agent novichok, a type developed in cold war-era russia, was used in the attack that failed to kill the skripals. They pulled through after weeks in a hospital. \" the government of the russian federation has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law, \" us state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement. Nauert said the sanctions will go into effect later this month. Russia has forcefully denied they were behind the poisonings. However, the us was among some 20 countries who took a unified stance with the uk against the kremlin by expelling russian diplomats. Per the ap, the us alone kicked out 60 officials the trump administration referred to as spies for the russian government. The us also shut down russia's consulate in seattle. In the months since, two other cases of nerve agent poisoning made headlines not far from where the skripals were discovered near death. In late june, dawn sturgess and her partner, charles rowley, fell ill 10 miles from salisbury in the town of amesbury after police believe the couple accidentally came into contact with a bottle containing novichok. While rowley survived, sturgess was not as lucky.",

Bryan mason's 7-year-old son, hank, was in tears. Mason and holly reeves, his fiancee and sparky's original owner, decided they were going to go all out. \" sparky, \" mason wrote in an e-mail, \" is family. As i plan to marry holly, i want her to know what kind of commitment i have to her. As i try to help hank grow into a man, i want to lead by example. This is what a man does. A man cries, and keeps taping things to light posts until somebody calls. \" latest news videos so it's a familiar story: dog lost, flyers printed up, owners search areas where their pet might be. But mason took this dog search to a new level. He used an interactive google map, a facebook page, some workers from the personal errand service taskrabbit, and 6 1/2 gallons of urine.

Neighbors describe ramos, who joined the nypd three years ago, as a \" wonderful man \" who took pride in his job but always looked forward to spending time with his two sons. Liu, a seven-year veteran of the force, would have celebrated his three-month wedding anniversary yesterday; the times recounts a brooklyn reception attended by 300 people. His widow is described as \" in bed, inconsolable. \" a friend says that when liu was in the police academy, he said, \" i know that being a cop is dangerous, but i must do it. If i don't do it and you don't do it, then who is going to do it? \" more: ramos'two children — a 13-year-old boy and a son who's in college — will have their education paid for by a foundation that late yankees owner george steinbrenner set up 32 years ago, the new york daily news reports. The yankee silver shield foundation has funded the educations of thousands of children of nypd, fire department, and port authority employees who were killed while on the job, as well as that of hundreds of children who lost a parent in the 9/11 attacks. Brinsley's mother has told investigators she was afraid of her son and she hadn't seen him in a month. Police say she believes the 28-year-old, who shot himself, had undiagnosed mental problems, although they are still trying to determine whether he had a mental illness, fox reports. Court records show that brinsley, whose criminal history includes at least 19 arrests, dropped out of school in the 10th grade, failed to complete court-ordered drug and alcohol abuse evaluations, and had a history of making threats. A friend of the gunman's tells the new york daily news that brinsley was a \" god-fearing \" man and he was shocked to hear about the killings. He says brinsley, who had two daughters, \" didn't have a stable place to live, \" but would spend time at his mother's place in brooklyn, with friends in atlanta, and with a girlfriend in baltimore. The friend says brinsley was a muslim who also used the names isaiah and moses. Before shooting the nypd officers, brinsley shot the baltimore girlfriend, who remains in critical but stable condition; police are waiting to speak to her, reports the baltimore sun. Investigators say they have not uncovered any gang affiliations",

It specifically cites the availability of captain america: civil war, currently in theaters. The department plans to seek the extradition of the 30-year-old, who faces charges related to copyright infringement and money laundering.

A syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk publicly to the media, said the target of the attack appeared to be a bus carrying policemen. Syrian tv showed angry men carrying the remains of a human being and also showed a damaged bus that had blood on its seats as well as riot police helmets. \" this is a criminal terrorist act",
            "Advertisement continue reading the main story beirut, lebanon — the syrian government said thursday that it had released more than 500 prisoners who were not involved in \"terrorist \" acts. A human rights group said, meanwhile, that it had compiled evidence that thousands of other detainees were languishing in government prisons and secret detention centers where, the group said, torture was routine. The group, avaaz, also said that its researchers had gathered the names of at least 617 people who had died under torture in government installations since the beginning of the uprising against syria's president, bashar al-assad. The group's estimate of the number of the detainees — 37,000 — was more than double the tally provided by the local coordination committees, another activist group, which said thursday that it had documented the cases of more than 16,000 detainees. With journalists rarely allowed to travel around syria freely since the unrest started, it was impossible to confirm either report. Arab league observers currently in syria are supposed to monitor promises by the government to release political prisoners. The observers, however, are not allowed to visit military sites, where rights groups believe that the government has transferred hundreds of detainees to hide them from the observers. Photo the syrian state news agency said thursday that the government had released almost 4,000 prisoners since nov. 5,"

Authors neil howe and william strauss, who are given credit for coming up with the term \" millennials \" in their 1991 book generations, originally had individuals in this demographic as being born between 1982 and 2000; subsequent deviations had the millennial generation starting as early as 1978 and ending as early as 1994.

Knox, 22, was jailed along with her former boyfriend raffaele sollecito, 25, for 26 and 25 years respectively last december, for the brutal sex murder of meredith kercher, 21. Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with knox and two other women and the court heard how she was killed for refusing to take part in a drug fuelled orgy. Appeal: prosecutors want the 26 year and 25 year sentences handed to amanda knox and former boyfriend raffaele sollecito extended prosecutors giuliano mignini and manuela comodi had called for the maximum life sentence against the two describing them as cold and calculated killers, but the court gave them a lower term due to their young age and clean record. Today mr mignini deposited a 13 page file outlining his request for an increased sentence and said: \" in their post verdict report the judges said this was a murder for purely casual reasons and if that is the case then this is a crime that calls for the maximum penalty of life. \"",
            "The italian prosecutors who sent american college student amanda knox to prison for 26 years filed an appeal of the case today, asking the court for a tougher sentence. The appeal came just days before knox's lawyers are expected to file their own appeal of her conviction for murdering british roommate meredith kercher in 2007. The prosecution did not specify the sentence it wants imposed on knox, but by arguing that the court should have considered an aggravating circumstance in handing out knox's punishment, a life sentence would be almost automatic. Knox's family told abc new today they are \" quite disappointed in the decision of the prosecution's office to pursue an appeal against amanda and... To ask for life in prison. \" \" from all outward appearances, it seems like more of a harassment, \" said a member of the knox family. Theodore simon, a lawyer for knox, said her appeal will be filed shortly and it \" will profoundly address the wrongfulness of her conviction and recognize the futility of the prosecution's appeal. \" knox was convicted along with her former boyfriend raffaele sollecito on dec. 5, 2009.

Adam had no apparent signs of trauma and hadn't been sick when he died, leading investigators to originally believe he died of sudden infant death syndrome, people reports. But a toxicology report found elevated levels of benadryl in adam's system. The fda warns against giving the medication to children under 2 years old as there is a high risk of overdose.

In 1964, a jury found robert dowlut guilty of killing his girlfriend's mother in south bend, indiana. \" he said he wanted to marry his girlfriend, \" said a police detective, but the girl's mother, anna yocum, was against it, \" and he didn't like mrs. Yocum. \" police said dowlut, a polite 17-year-old on army leave, had confessed to the crime and led them to the buried murder weapon. The gun matched a bullet in the yocum killing and another from a nearby pawnshop robbery where the owner had been shot and wounded. What's more, dowlut had been convicted of armed robbery in 1962. Pleading not guilty, dowlut was sentenced to life in indiana state prison for second-degree murder. But the indiana supreme court overturned the ruling in 1968, saying dowlut had the right to not incriminate himself ( and reveal the gun's location ) during police questioning — during which dowlut says he was threatened and refused a lawyer. Freed on all charges, he went back to the army, got college and law degrees, joined the nra, and rose to become its general counsel as the nonprofit morphed into an aggressive, powerful interest group. Dowlut has argued against the idea that \" average joe \" gun owners perpetrate \" a significant share of serious violence, \" but the detective who interrogated dowlut claims the teenager made this remark: \" he leaned back in his chair and he said, ' well, you know, sergeant, it's just like a person is two people. ' and i said, ' what do you mean by that? ' and he said, ' well, if one part of me can love and the other part can kill.

Now it's under fire for putting up a \" handful \" of staff and visitors in private afghan villas, as well as shelling out for private bodyguards and fine dining — running up a taxpayer tab of around $ 150 million, usa today reports. In a letter to defense secretary ash carter, the special inspector general for afghanistan's reconstruction questioned the task force for business stability and operations ' need for \" western-style hotel accommodations \" that included flat-screen tvs ( of at least 27 inches ), food service of at least three stars, and private security services. \" if [ task force ] employees had instead lived at [ dod ] facilities in afghanistan, where housing, security, and food service are routinely provided at little or no extra charge to dod organizations, it appears the taxpayers would have saved tens of millions of dollars, \" ig john sopko wrote. The tfbso was formed in 2006 to help boost economic development in iraq, eventually stretching to include afghanistan in 2009, mother jones notes; the unit shuttered in march. The bill, which usa today notes made up 20 % of the task force's budget, took care of \" no more than five to 10 \" staff members and could have been significantly reduced via other alternatives: sopko says putting up a staff of 10 at the us embassy in afghanistan in 2014 would have cost about $ 1.8 million, while a stay at a local military base would have cost next to nothing. Sopko implicates ex-tfbso chief paul brinkley for the excesses and being uncooperative with sigar; brinkley denies ever being contacted by sigar. Sopko's letter, which bloomberg notes is his second attempt to get an accounting, has also requested names of those who holed up in the villas, per usa today. ( check out sopko's full letter. )",

The driver said he fell asleep at the wheel, but when lieberman sued for the phone records, \" i saw texting throughout the drive and near the collision, \" he says. Since it can be time-consuming and expensive to subpoena records from a phone company or get a search warrant for a phone, police don't always do it. But things could soon change. A new bill proposed by lieberman, which npr calls \" the most aggressive in the country, \" would allow ny officers to review drivers ' phones after an accident to see if they were texting.

        "summary": "The co-author of a new study estimates that 25 % of our planet's mammals practice infanticide — and she thinks she knows why. Elise huchard and dieter lukas studied 260 species; in about 45 % of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies — though not their own — so the mom is available for mating. In the case of chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the \" most detailed to date \" on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But mom has a jerry springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the telegraph reports. After all, \" males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own, \" lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: the researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too. Huchard and lukas will be studying them next. ( a study claims human monogamy is tied to infanticide. )",

Washington predators such as leopards and cheetahs are not the biggest mortal threat to baby chacma baboons, large and aggressive monkeys that live across southern africa. That threat comes from adult males of their own species. \" up to 50 percent of the infants might be killed by males in these populations, a massive impact more important than disease or predation, \" university of cambridge behavioral ecologist dieter lukas said. This behavior is not limited to these baboons. Scientists on thursday unveiled the most detailed study to date of infanticide by adult males among the world's mammals, a practice documented in numerous species including many primates. The researchers studied 260 species including 119 that practice infanticide and 141 that do not, looking for patterns that may explain a behavior seen in very few non-mammals. \" it is a sexual strategy, \" said behavioral ecologist elise huchard of the national center for scientific research's center for evolutionary and functional ecology in france, who with lukas conducted the study published in the journal science.

Many primates practice infanticide including chimpanzees, gorillas, baboons and langurs while others do not, including orangutans, bonobos and mouse lemurs. The researchers said females of some species use strategic promiscuity to stop males from killing their babies.

Two years later, persian king darius i put an end to the revolt and, according to kaper's theory, practiced some spin control. He made up the story about the sandstorm because he figured it would be better for people to think that natural elements, not a military foes, were responsible. Kaper says he pieced all this together based on inscriptions of ancient temple blocks unearthed in the dachla oasis, reports sci-news.

Somewhere in the middle of the desert the army was overwhelmed by a sandstorm and destroyed. Although many scientists regard the story as a myth, amateur as well as professional archaeologists have searched for the remains of the persian soldiers for many decades. Prof kaper never believed this story. \"some expect to find an entire army, fully equipped. However, experience has long shown that you cannot die from a sandstorm",
            "Around 524 bc, a persian army of 50,000 strong disappeared in the egyptian desert in what is one of the greatest archaeological mysteries of all time. Now, an egyptologist has finally solved this vanishing act. Leiden professor olaf kaper made this accidental discovery while conducting his decade-long excavation in amheida, in the dachla oasis of egypt. He unearthed ancient temple blocks detailing a full list of titles of petubastis iii, an egyptian rebel leader, and let the puzzle pieces \" fall into place. \" it turns out that the army's disappearance was really just a cover-up. According to the writings of anchient greek historian herodotus, king cambyses led his persian troops into the desert near thebes ( modern-day luxor ) and never returned. Supposedly, they were swallowed by sand dunes, but this myth has long been debated. Egyptologist kaper, for one, never believed it. \" since",

Police tell whyy that his wife of 25 years had sent gerardot emails and text messages suggesting she would kill chapman, a former delaware state senate candidate who was living separately from her husband, former newark city councilman luke chapman. Mark gerardot reportedly showed up at the home when chapman failed to meet him for dinner. The pair are believed to have met while gerardot was working as creative director at the university of delaware, where chapman worked as director of digital communications until recently.

Luckily, no one was hurt, and the plane's progress was stopped quickly thanks to an faa-mandated safety system installed at laguardia, mashable reports. Emas, or the engineered materials arrested system, is designed for airports in tight areas, where geography does not allow for a safety zone at the end of a runway. As this video shows, the system relies on huge, crushable panels that are placed on the ground at the end of the runway. When the plane runs over the panels, they break down and the resulting crushed material dramatically slows the aircraft. You can see the tracks pence's plane tore through the emas system in this tweet by wabc-tv reporter josh einiger. Prior to thursday, the system had been used 10 times, says the faa. \" we're fine, \" pence told cnn friday morning. \" it was about 10 seconds of uncertainty last night, but we're just so grateful to the pilots and to the first responders on the scene and ( that ) everybody came off the plane safely. \" the fbi said it would investigate the incident, reports ap.",

        "summary": "Home is where the heart is, and maybe soon for some south florida teachers, where the whiteboard is. Miami-dade county has worked up a rough draft of plans for apartments on school properties in an effort to make housing for teachers more affordable and the commute obviously easier, per the miami herald. So far the initial blueprint worked up by the county's school system and its housing division includes a proposal for a new-construction, multi-level middle school with one floor dedicated to residential units, as well as an entire apartment complex that could contain up to 300 units and be set next to an existing elementary school. County teachers would get first dibs on the apartments ( followed by school system employees, then possibly the general public ), though teachers at the particular schools where the apartments are located wouldn't be guaranteed a vacancy. Michael liu, the county's housing director, calls it an \" exciting idea, \" adding \" land is at a premium [ and ] difficult to come by, especially in the urban core. \" it becomes even harder for teachers with a large gap between paychecks and housing they can afford; miami comes in 47th out of the nation's 50 largest real-estate markets in terms of affordability. Construction dive notes other school districts around the country that have seen housing geared toward teachers pop up, including a recent push in san francisco to keep hundreds of its teachers local, per a 2016 article in usa today. For those worried about contact between apartment-dwellers and students, the miami school system's facilities chief says the building designs would ensure interactions during school hours don't happen, with different entrances and elevators for students and residents in the proposed brickell middle school.",

Among them is leonard gotshalk, a former atlanta falcons offensive tackle who was accused in 2010 by federal prosecutors of using kickbacks to boost tech-company stock prices. Three days later, the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca received a $ 3,055 wire transfer from gotshalk to pay for an offshore company. Per the international consortium of investigative journalists, it's a case of the firm failing to vet unscrupulous clients. Similar clients include a connecticut financier who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and six americans accused of running a $ 100 million ponzi scheme. Seems mossack fonseca ran a high-volume business that didn't spend time scrutinizing clients. The law firm incorporated over 100,000 offshore entities between 2005 and 2015, handing over client-vetting responsibility to law firms and banks that brought in business. Firm co-founder ramón fonseca has told the ap that \" as a policy we prefer not to have american clients \"; he didn't say why, but the papers suggest a desire to duck us authorities. The firm rarely accepted us clients in order to \" avoid further attempts by american authorities to attack the partnership, \" wrote a us-based rep for the firm in a 2014 email. \" american clients were purged, no more have been sought, no marketing in the us takes place. \" ( the mysterious panama papers source has finally spoken out. )",

Al.com reports that how he paid for all of this is now being called into question due to some ethics disclosure paperwork he recently filed with the state, in which he noted he has received more than $ 750,000 in \" compensation \" over the past three years from a \" food provisions \" account — namely, funds offered by federal, state, and municipal governments to feed prisoners in the etowah county jail. And entrekin says it's completely legal, based on an antiquated state law passed before world war ii that apparently allows sheriffs to keep \" excess \" funds meant to feed prisoners. Al.com says the state law is \" likely \" being exploited by other alabama sheriffs as well. However, other counties that end up with a surplus give the money to the county government so it can be put to use elsewhere instead of lining the sheriffs ' pockets. \" i believe the funds belong to the taxpayers and any excess funds should go toward things that benefit the taxpayer, \" the police chief of rainbow city, who used to work under the former etowah county sheriff, says. \" there's been a tremendous amount of money left over that shouldn't be used as a bonus check. \" two advocacy groups filed suit in january against 49 alabama sheriffs who won't show financials around their prison feeding programs. In etowah county's case, al.com is also probing county contracts awarded to companies that have donated to entrekin campaigns. Meanwhile, entrekin says he's \" getting beat up \" for sticking to the law and that attacks against him are \" politically motivated, \" the gadsden times reports.",

        "summary": "Police actions in the immediate aftermath of the shooting of michael brown were a long way from normal, according to grand jury transcripts, which reveal that officer darren wilson drove himself back to the station by himself, cleaned the blood off himself, and checked his own gun into evidence, all of which runs against justice department advice on how to handle evidence and crime scenes. Wilson's actions were \" very, very bad from an investigative perspective, \" a former police chief who runs a consulting firm tells the washington post. His bloodied hands were never photographed because \" a photographer wasn't available, \" per one investigator. One agent testified wilson was worried about the \" biohazard \" presented by someone else's blood. One of wilson's lawyers says \" it was getting sticky and gross. \" an investigator with the medical examiner's office also failed to take measurements at the scene of the shooting. ( what he told the grand jury: \" it was self-explanatory what happened. \" ) more: gov. Jay nixon has rejected calls for special prosecutors to present the case to another grand jury. The director of washington university's juvenile law and justice clinic said yesterday that a special prosecutor should be brought in, as the grand jury transcripts indicate the \" prosecution quite unusually adopted a defense stance, injecting the idea of justified homicide into the process well before wilson testified, \" reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. Police have identified a ferguson man killed during the unrest that followed the grand jury decision as deandre joshua, 20. Investigators believe he was shot in the head before he was set on fire, reports the new york daily news. It's not clear whether his death was linked to the rioting, although one of the people mourning the man on facebook was dorian johnson, who was with brown when he was shot by wilson. Ferguson was a lot calmer last night as light snow fell and the number of protesters dwindled, the ap reports. National guard troops were posted at intersections, and although a group of 100 protesters blocked traffic at one point, there were no major confrontations. But in los angeles, around 130 people were arrested after what the lapd says was \" dangerous \" behavior, including hitting vehicles and running through intersections, reports the la times.",

So say researchers at st. Andrews university after pushing stinky gym shirts into the noses of people who were told the garments belonged to either their own college or a nearby one. Reporting in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, they find that people are far less tolerant when the stench comes from outsiders, which they say has implications for not just social exclusion but even prejudice and discrimination. \" we are looking at what makes group cohesion possible, \" social psychologist stephen reicher tells the guardian. \" in many ways, disgust is the social ordering emotion. It's the emotion that keeps people apart, and if you want people to come together, you have to attenuate disgust. \" to put it to the test, the scientists stuffed t-shirts that had been worn at the gym into sealed bags, and the shirts \" are pretty revolting, i tell you, \" reicher adds. They measured disgust by asking directly in the first study. In the second recording, they inquired how long it took for students to wash their hands, and how much soap they used when they did; students were quicker and more thorough when they thought the shirts came from students of a different college. \" it helps us to understand how group behavior becomes possible, \" says another social psychologist. \" essentially, it frees people to cooperate with each other, and to work together effectively. \" little did the participants know that all the shirts belonged to one research assistant, who put them through especially sweaty one-hour workouts, notes ars technica.

Look no further than the one in the indian ocean in 2004 that killed more than 230,000 people after being triggered by a powerful earthquake, notes a post at phys.org. But what if tsunamis could be drained of their power before they reach land? a mathematician at cardiff university in wales is looking at just that possibility, and he reports in the journal heliyon that firing acoustic-gravity waves at a tsunami could do the trick by reducing the killer wave's energy and size while it's still far out at sea. Agws are naturally occurring, deep-ocean sound waves that can stretch for hundreds of miles and move at the speed of sound. \" up until now, little attention has been paid to trying to mitigate tsunamis and the potential of acoustic-gravity waves remains largely unexplored, \" says cardiff's usama kadri. But as he acknowledges, this is easier said than done, and kadri does not propose a precise method for generating and dispensing the agws, reports r&d magazine. The trick is \" developing some sort of underwater cannon — or modulator — capable of generating agw frequency blasts, \" explains upi. Like tsunamis, agws also can be generated by earthquakes, and kadri has shown that they can be used as an early warning system against tsunamis. He suggests it might be possible to manipulate one of these quake-generated agws as a force against a threatening tsunami, essentially fighting nature with nature.

Researchers from cardiff university in wales have proposed firing deep-ocean sound waves at the oncoming mass of water to stop the tsunamis dead in its tracks. Usama kadri, ph.d., a professor from cardiff university's school of mathematics, proposed that acoustic-gravity waves ( agws ) — naturally occurring sound waves that move through the deep ocean at the speed of sound and can travel thousands of meters below the surface — could be effective against tsunamis that are triggered by earthquakes, landslides and other violent geological events. According to kadri, it may be possible to engineer these waves so they can be fired at an incoming tsunami and react with the wave in a way that reduces its amplitude or height and causes its energy to be dissipated over a large area. However, this concept needs to",
            "Researchers suggest acoustic waves could be used to weaken or stop tsunamis. Photo by willyam bradberry/shutterstock jan. 25 ( upi ) -- new research suggests acoustic-gravity waves, or agws, could be used as a defense against deadly tsunamis. Acoustic-gravity waves are sound waves that can travel for several miles beneath the surface of the ocean. Tsunamis are massive waves produced by earthquakes, landslides or other major geological phenomena. Scientists at cardiff university theorized the power of acoustic-gravity waves could be harnessed and directed at an oncoming tsunami wave, reducing its amplitude and thus diminishing the magnitude of the damage. Researchers described the strategy in the journal heliyon.

            "Scientists are working to fight against the devastating impacts of tsunamis by turning the destructive wave against itself. Researchers from cardiff university in wales have proposed firing deep-ocean sound waves at the oncoming mass of water to stop the tsunamis dead in its tracks. Usama kadri, ph.d., a professor from cardiff university's school of mathematics, proposed that acoustic-gravity waves ( agws ) — naturally occurring sound waves that move through the deep ocean at the speed of sound and can travel thousands of meters below the surface — could be effective against tsunamis that are triggered by earthquakes, landslides and other violent geological events. According to kadri, it may be possible to engineer these waves so they can be fired at an incoming tsunami and react with the wave in a way that reduces its amplitude or height and causes its energy to be dissipated over a large area. However, this concept needs to",
            "Researchers suggest acoustic waves could be used to weaken or stop tsunamis. Photo by willyam bradberry/shutterstock jan. 25 ( upi ) -- new research suggests acoustic-gravity waves, or agws, could be used as a defense against deadly tsunamis. Acoustic-gravity waves are sound waves that can travel for several miles beneath the surface of the ocean. Tsunamis are massive waves produced by earthquakes, landslides or other major geological phenomena. Scientists at cardiff university theorized the power of acoustic-gravity waves could be harnessed and directed at an oncoming tsunami wave, reducing its amplitude and thus diminishing the magnitude of the damage. Researchers described the strategy in the journal heliyon. A single blast of agws, which can stretch several thousand feet, could shorten the height of a wave and spread its power out over a greater area. A series of agws fired in succession could dissipate the wave's power and momentum entirely. \"",

While mexico officially refuses to interfere in the election, mexican diplomats in the us are helping mexican permanent residents fast-track to us citizenship by hosting free workshops at consulates across the country, bloomberg reports. These newly minted citizens have the right to vote but aren't pressed to do so, says laura espinosa, deputy consul in mexico's consulate in las vegas. \" those who use this to vote, that's up to each individual, \" she says. \" we don't have any opinion on that, because that would be totally interfering in internal affairs of the country. \" a consulate spokesman in chicago stresses that while the consulate there hosted such an event, it's community organizations that actually dole out advice. More than 2.6 million legal mexican permanent residents in the us are eligible to become citizens, and naturalization is especially high in colorado, nevada, and virginia, per the new americans campaign. But the movement isn't limited to people of mexican origin: several latino immigration and labor groups are also coming together under a \" stand up to hate \" campaign to promote naturalization of immigrants and inspire voting, nbc news reports. \" i've had my residency papers for 19 years, but one of the main reasons i ' m becoming a citizen now is because i want to vote against donald trump, \" says a cuban exile at a miami workshop. \" he offends me because he is insulting all hispanics and what he is doing is wrong. \" ( john oliver offers an alternative to trump's wall. )",

        "summary": "The colorado floods have now killed eight people, and at least 648 more are still unaccounted for, nbc news reports. The latest death was an 83-year-old man who was swept three miles downstream when the ground collapsed underneath him in the town of idaho springs yesterday afternoon, the denver post reports. One pocket of good news: yesterday's improved weather allowed for more rescues, with helicopters evacuating at least 250 people from areas in larimer county that had been cut off by the flood, the post reports. And the national weather service is forecasting no more rain this week, the wall street journal reports. \" the worst is over, \" says an national weather service employee. With at least 1,500 homes destroyed and nearly 18,000 more damaged — numbers which are expected to rise — this bit of news is particularly distressing: usa today reports that only 22,000 homes and businesses have flood insurance, according to fema, meaning thousands of homeowners lack coverage. One expert estimates that just 10 % to 25 % of people in areas at high risk of flood are covered. Colorado's richest oil field is currently underwater, and thousands of wells and operating sites have been hit by the floods, leading to concerns about environmental contamination. \" the scale is unprecedented, \" the executive director of the state's department of natural resources tells the denver post. Adds a former bp chemist, \" to have something this inland, this level of flooding in an area with high oil and gas development, it's new territory. \"",

        "summary": "A live bacteria spray meant to restore skin with healthy microbes erased by obsessive cleaning has at least one weighty endorsement: it's used daily by a guy who hasn't showered in more than 12 years, per cbs boston. David whitlock — a chemical engineer who manages not to scare away friends and neighbors — helped found massachusetts company aobiome in 2013 after making a surprise discovery about dirt. Soon after a date asked him why her horse rolled in the stuff, whitlock discovered that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( aob ) in dirt converts sweat's urea and ammonia into good bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties. He also guessed aob lived on the skin of our ancestors before cleaning products were invented, and he began covering his body with a mixture of aob and water. Not only did his skin look and smell fine, but whitlock says the mixture did wonders for his mental health, reports bloomberg. Now on the market for $ 49, the odorless mother dirt ao+ mist — to be used twice a day — makes no health claims, per beta boston. Clients, including a new york times writer, say it clears up acne and eczema and eliminates the need for deodorants and moisturizers, but \" we need to do clinical trials, \" whitlock says. \" my biggest fear is the fda shutting us down if they think we're making false claims. \" a rep says promoting a bacteria-based product — that isn't harmful even if ingested — is difficult when \" we live in a world with purell on every corner. \" but humans have \" confused clean with sterile. \" the company recently released $ 15 live-bacteria shower gel and shampoo and is working to get fda approval for bacteria treatments of skin conditions and wounds. In the meantime, whitlock hopes to see his spray take off: \" i would like a billion people a day to use this, \" he says. ( your beard could probably use a dousing. )",

He adds he later received a text from phan-gillis saying she was extending her stay in china to deal with a personal matter, per the houston chronicle. Her husband only learned she had been detained when he called the us consulate in china 11 days later. China's ministry of foreign affairs says phan-gillis, 55, was investigated for \" activities harmful to chinese national security. \" a houston attorney helping the couple says phan-gillis ' lawyers in china were told she was accused of stealing state secrets — a claim her husband denies. \" my wife isn't a spy or a thief, \" he says. \" she is a hardworking businesswoman who spends huge amounts of time on nonprofit activities in houston and china. \" gillis says his wife, who has now been moved to a detention center in nanning, visits china several times a year as president of the houston shenzhen sister city association and is involved in training chinese nurses. While american consular officers in guangzhou have visited phan-gillis on a monthly basis, gillis says he hopes senior officials will press chinese president xi jinping for her release as he visits the us this week. \" i really don't want to be disruptive, \" gillis, 53, says. \" i just want to get my wife back. \" a state department rep tells the times \" we continue to monitor her case closely. \"",

        "summary": "It's a year-old startup that wasn't yet profitable. Now jet.com enters the books as the largest-ever e-commerce startup acquisition. Walmart announced monday that it would purchase the site for $ 3.3 billion, with all but $ 300 million of that in cash; the rest takes the form of walmart shares, reports the wall street journal. The move is a major salvo in walmart's battle against amazon. How the deal — which will preserve jet.com but beef up walmart.com using its software — is being framed: walmart has quite a hill to climb. Though walmart.com launched in 2000 to amazon.com's 1994, walmart's online sales amounted to $ 14 billion in 2015, to amazon's $ 107 billion, notes the journal. Including brick-and-mortar sales, though, brings walmart's revenue to $ 482 billion. In a year, jet.com reached a run-rate of $ 1 billion in revenue. But at business insider, hayley peterson delves into three reasons — customer base, distribution center potential, and jet.com's shipping prowess — why the acquisition could become a \" nightmare \" for amazon, proclaiming \" everyone is underestimating walmart's ability to crush amazon. \" at reuters, jennifer saba writes of some of the things that are holding walmart back, among them, amazon's move into walmart's turf with expanded fresh-food delivery. Techcrunch has some interesting details on jet.com founder marc lore, whose prior business, quidsi, was scooped up by, yes, amazon for $ 545 million. Lore could walk away with $ 750 million from the jet.com deal; he ' ll remain at the helm.

Dr. Anjali ramkissoon, a fourth-year neurology resident at jackson health system, has been placed on administrative leave, per a statement, and an internal investigation \" will determine if any disciplinary action will be taken, up to, and including termination. \" the person who recorded the incident and put the video on youtube says his group actually called for the uber ride, but the woman since identified as ramkissoon tried to \" hijack \" it and jumped in the backseat when the car arrived. The driver didn't want to take her and told her to get out of the car, and things quickly got heated; the video poster says the woman grabbed the driver's keys. As the video opens, a young woman can be seen berating the driver, slapping him, and kneeing him in the groin, at which point he pushes her away and she falls to the ground. But it's far from over: she jumps into his car's passenger seat and continues berating him, yelling at him to \" get the f --- in the car you piece of s ---, \" among other things, as he appears to call the police. The woman starts throwing things, including lots of papers and an iphone, out of the car before finally apparently tiring of the whole ordeal, exiting the car, and walking away. The video poster says she was already in another taxi, about to leave, when police arrived; wsvn reports that the uber driver declined to press charges. But the video poster says the woman was cuffed after trying to leave the scene, attempted to kick some of the police officers, and was ultimately placed in the police car. At that point she started crying and apologizing, and the video poster says the driver accepted a \" cash settlement \" instead of pressing charges.

Frankenstein for a mate, and the creature promises that he and his female counterpart would then go live in some remote corner of south america and never bother humans. The doctor initially agrees, then changes his mind. Good thing: as two scientists point out in a perfect-for-halloween study in bioscience, if dr. Frankenstein had allowed his creature to do so, it would have doomed mankind under a principle of biology known as competitive exclusion, reports nature world news. They're especially impressed because shelley seemed to have a handle on this more than a century before it was formally defined. In the book, shelley voices the doctor's rationale: \" a race of devils would be propagated upon earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror, \" per the christian science monitor. He was spot on, write nathaniel dominy of dartmouth and justin yeakel of the university of california, merced. \" we calculated that a founding population of two creatures could drive us to extinction in as little as 4,000 years, \" says dominy. They crunched a slew of factors including population densities and competitive advantages of the creatures vs. Humans. The monster's request to go to south america was key — it was relatively sparsely populated at the time, which would have allowed his descendants to thrive.

The catch is that these theoretical diamonds are so deep in the ground and so tiny that they're virtually impossible to get, meaning this discovery isn't going to make them any cheaper. These gems would be about 100 miles below the surface of the earth, or about 10 times deeper than typical mining operations, according to a university press release. And you'd need a microscope to spot them because they'd be measured in microns, not carats. Still, the study adds to a growing body of research showing that diamonds aren't the rarities we think them to be. \" the more people look, the more they're finding diamonds in different rock types, \" says the co-author of the study in nature communications. \" i think everybody would agree there's more and more environments of diamond formation being discovered. \" until now, scientists knew of two basic ways diamonds were created — in \" complex chemical reactions called redox reactions ( reduction and oxidation ) involving the loss and gain of electrons as different kinds of fluids move through rock, \" explains the washington post. The johns hopkins team has found a third way, one that suggests diamonds are formed as water moves through rock formations and becomes more acidic. Like the other two processes, this one requires intense pressure and temperatures, the latter at or near 2,000 degrees fahrenheit. Though cheaper prices won't result, researchers say the finding will help them better understand fluid movements in the earth's interior.

Furthermore, in the same reacting chemical system, diamond dissolution can be driven by changes in fluid chemistry at almost constant redox states. For example, it can be seen in figs 1b and 2c that diamond is predicted to partially dissolve during the interval of ( −0.25<logξ<+0.1 ) because of small fluctuations in solution chemistry associated with the disappearance of the mg-rich carbonate solid solution.

        "summary": "A 27-year-old woman is pressing the british government to intervene after she says she was sent home from work for not wearing heels. Nicola thorp says she arrived at her temp job at london finance company pricewaterhousecoopers in december and was told she had to wear shoes with a 2- to 4-inch heel. \" i was expected to do a nine-hour shift on my feet escorting clients to meeting rooms, ' \" she tells the bbc. \" i said, ' if you can give me a reason as to why wearing flats would impair me to do my job today, then fair enough, ' but they couldn't. \" thorp — who says she was laughed at when she complained that men didn't have to follow the same rule — notes she was sent home without pay when she refused to change her shoes. A rep for the british trades union congress says the case \" reeks of sexism, \" per a separate bbc story. Pwc says it doesn't have a dress code, but outsourcing firm portico — which handles its reception services — does. Portico says thorp signed its \" appearance guidelines \" but showed up with \" inappropriate footwear \" anyway. Thorp has now created a petition demanding that \" sexist \" dress codes requiring women to wear high heels be outlawed. \" the only way i can defend my right to wear flat shoes at work is if i want to identify with my employer as a male, \" thorp tells the telegraph. The petition has more than 30,000 signatures, meaning the british government has to respond. If the number hits 100,000, that guarantees a debate in parliament. Meanwhile, portico says it has \" taken on board the comments regarding footwear and will be reviewing our guidelines. \" ( in the us, a female student was kicked out of her prom because she chose not to wear a formal dress. )",

The congressman also made his statement knowing patrice tierney had pleaded guilty in her own case to being \"willfully blind \" to some of the more obvious signs of her brother's alleged return to crime. \"there is no evidence that this court or the probation office was ever told the nature of what the business was in antigua, or what was happening in massachusetts, \" judge patti b. Saris told jurors last november as the document was introduced into evidence during the trial of robert eremian's brother daniel. In a private sidebar conversation with attorneys in the case, including one representing patrice tierney, the judge was even more blunt. \"[ w ] hat i ' m not going to let happen, especially with the entire press corps out there,",

But her father says the family is essentially blameless. The man, identified only by his last name, lau, tells cbc news that his daughter and her grandparents, residents of vancouver, weren't feeding bread crumbs to sea lions in richmond as has been suggested. Rather, \" there was somebody beside them that was trying to feed them, \" says lau, who was \" disturbed \" by the reaction to the viral video. He says his daughter simply \" went to the front to try to see the sea lions, to get a closer look, \" and ended up a bit too close. \" she has taken that lesson in a hard way, \" he says. Thankfully, her grandfather didn't hesitate to jump into the water after the sea lion bit her dress and pulled her in, lau says. \" if he had one- or two-second doubt about that, my girl could have been gone by then. That reaction makes him a hero. \" officials at the vancouver aquarium previously warned the girl would need antibiotics if the sea lion broke skin; lau says she suffered a shallow wound to her lower body and was immediately taken to a hospital, where she received antibiotics. Lau adds that family members have spoken with aquarium officials about further treatment. The aquarium confirmed to ctv news that it was in touch with the family regarding treatment of a \" superficial wound. \" ( this baby sea lion made headlines for wandering into a seafood restaurant. )",

A belfast high court ruled to let the 14-year-old's suit go forward against facebook, which allegedly allowed her pic to be continually reposted for more than a year on a \" shame page \" by a man ( whom she's also suing ) seeking revenge, per the guardian. The teen is seeking damages for negligence, misuse of private info, and violation of the data protection act, amounting to child abuse, her attorneys say. The main beef: that facebook uses a special microsoft technology called photodna that tags and flags child exploitation materials so they won't repeatedly show up — yet the offending pic was re-added often to the site between november 2014 and january 2016, per cnnmoney. Facebook, which hasn't offered an explanation as to why its software didn't pick up on this photo, argues that it did take down the picture each time it was notified about it, and it's trying to fall back on european rules that would shield it from having to keep an eye on all of the material that ends up on the site — a virtually impossible task, if you ask facebook. But it's how the site's been deciding what stays and what goes that has some in a tizzy. \" facebook has the tools to remove images promptly and block them, but it is not consistent, \" a media law expert tells cnn, comparing it with the vietnam war photo that has since been uncensored on the site.

Now she blames the toy for a fire that destroyed her home. Just five days before thanksgiving, jessica's 12-year-old son opened the box containing one of this year's most sought-after items. It was a hoverboard, one of the futuristic skateboards that are powered by lithium batteries, allowing riders to move without effort, steering with their feet. Although jessica had heard of injuries caused by people falling off hoverboards, she says she had never heard that a hoverboard might catch fire. But just one day after using it, jessica's son was charging the battery -- using the charger that came with the hoverboard --- when jessica says she saw flames shooting from both ends. \" it was like fireworks, \" she says, \" the middle part of the board -- just ' poof.

        "summary": "The five-second rule is off by about five seconds in many cases, and not in the direction you hoped. That's what rutgers researchers say in a new study debunking the classic kitchen rule, which declares it safe to eat food off the floor if scooped up in a flash. \" we decided to look into this because the practice is so widespread, \" despite little research to back it up, donald schaffner tells rutgers today. After dropping watermelon, bread, bread with butter, and gummy candy on stainless steel, tile, wood, and carpeted surfaces crawling with salmonella-like bacteria about 2,500 times — and leaving the food untouched for one, five, 30, or 300 seconds — schaffner and his team found that food could become contaminated \" instantaneously, \" they report in applied and environmental microbiology. The longer food sat on the surface, the more bacteria was usually transferred. But in certain cases, contamination occurred immediately, schaffner says. That's because bacteria \" move with the moisture, and the wetter the food, the higher the risk of transfer. \" watermelon, for example, was contaminated most often, and gummy candy least often. To sum up, \" the five-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food, \" schaffner says. If you are going to eat food off the floor, carpet is your best bet, since it was least likely to transfer bacteria, say researchers — who point out a 2005 mythbusters episode found no differences between food left on the floor for two or six seconds, per ctv news.
