        "summary": "Go hug a tree — it could be lowering your mortality rate, at least if you're a woman. In a study published in the environmental health perspectives journal, scientists analyzed questionnaires that more than 108,000 women took between 2000 and 2008 and determined that those subjects who resided in areas with the most vegetation ( as determined by satellite imagery, per the new york times ) had a 34 % lower rate of mortality linked to respiratory disease, and a 13 % lower rate of cancer mortality, than those who lived in the most barren areas. The overall mortality rate overall was lowered by 12 % for ladies surrounded by the most greenery as compared to the least. Lead author peter james says the four main factors of green-heavy areas that may be linked to reduced mortality rates include cleaner air, people engaging in more physical activity, more social interaction, and better mental health, such as lower rates of depression. James says the \" strong associations \" between greenery and reduced mortality \" surprised \" his team, per a press release. Even more surprising: \" evidence that a large proportion [ nearly 30 % ] of the benefit from high levels of vegetation seems to be connected with improved mental health. \" but a bunch of leafy branches didn't seem to have an effect on deaths from a variety of other health issues, including heart attacks, diabetes, and stroke. You don't even have to move out of the big city to possibly reap these benefits. The associations were present in both urban and rural locations, james tells the times. \" any increased vegetation — more street trees, for example — seems to decrease mortality rates. \" ( climbing a tree is also good for your brain. )",

Following the oct. 20, 2003, stunt, jones said depression was what led him to attempt the stunt — which he immediately had second thoughts about, and which left him with broken ribs and a bruised spine.

There are five new \" reactions \" buttons joining the like symbol, techcrunch reports: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, all accessible when you hover over the like button. Users will now see a count for the most popular reactions chosen for each post on their news feeds ( click on any one of the icons to get the total count for all reactions ). In two blog posts announcing wednesday's rollout, a facebook product manager explains how to use the different reactions and how the tool will help the site \" learn how the different reactions should be weighted differently by news feed to do a better job of showing everyone the stories they most want to see. \" she notes they researched for a year or so to see which reactions people would most use, checking out surveys, comments, and virtual stickers to find the most common emotions. Those emotions had to resonate with people around the globe: usa today notes the five reactions were universally understood, and a sixth — a \" yay \" — was dumped because it wasn't. Techcrunch — which points out facebook basically copied the emotions concept from the path sharing site — notes that \" standardizing emotions \" could prove helpful when communicating across languages. For instance, a user may know enough of a foreign language to read a post but not be able to write a fluent comment in response. These new reactions would therefore allow users to give more nuanced feedback on posts where a generic like doesn't feel right — the sad reaction seems more appropriate in response to a death, for instance.

What's turning heads: asians are buying most of the properties and transforming arcadia, calif., into what some call the \" chinese beverly hills, \" the la times reports. In fact, the city of 56,000 has become 60 % asian and more pricey than an upscale enclave inhabited by justin bieber and the kardashians. What's up? local architects are building houses designed to attract chinese money, mixing notions of feng shui with basic necessities of chinese living ( like having a separate wok kitchen where things get \" oily and messy, \" says an arcadia architect ). Among features attracting chinese buyers: houses facing south, which some believe have better light and air flow. Even better, chinese buyers are avoiding killer real estate prices in beijing and shanghai, gaining access to excellent schools, and parking their money where china's government can't touch it, businessweek reports ( the magazine notes that wealthy chinese are doing this in other us cities, but more so in arcadia ). While the city is benefiting from all this money, there may be a downside: a letter to the times complains that rising home prices are making houses \" unaffordable for young families \" and says new buyers don't live in their houses \" for most of the year. \"",

Marijuana is already sold legally in six western states, but the long-awaited opening of recreational outlets in the east was hailed as major milestone for the cannabis industry in the us, with massachusetts viewed as a potential $ 1.5 billion-a-year market. A celebratory atmosphere ruled outside the shops, with buyers undaunted by the grim weather. Cheers went up when the stores opened at 8am sharp. There were no immediate reports of product shortages at the stores, something that has plagued the initial start of recreational pot sales in some other states. Massachusetts'top marijuana regulator said the crowds appeared orderly and praised operators for doing a thorough job of preparing for the first sales.

        "summary": "A high-security laboratory in louisiana recently leaked deadly bacteria, infecting four animals and apparently a federal investigator — but officials say there's no public health risk, usa today reports. The probe began after two monkey-like animals at the tulane national primate research center were infected last year by a bacterium and had to be euthanized. Problem is, scientists were analyzing the burkholderia pseudomallei bacterium in a lab that's billed as highly secure about a 5-minute drive away. \" the fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning, \" says a biosafety expert. He notes that \" human error, \" including poorly sterilized gloves, coats, and shoes, can cause such leaks. But the center's director, andrew lackner, says that \" we're taking this extraordinarily seriously. It's very disturbing to us. \" the investigation itself had issues. A usda investigator fell ill 24 hours after visiting the site and tested positive for the bacteria, but may have been exposed during her international travels. And according to one study, the epa ordered too few soil samples in the center's huge field cages, where some 4,000 animals live in an outdoor breeding colony. The 39 samples did, however, come back negative. If the bacteria escapes, abc news reports that it can cause a disease called melioidosis that's common in southeast asia and australia. It leads to various unpleasant symptoms and can be fatal; several countries have considered using it as a bioweapon. For now, research at the louisiana lab is suspended but animal testing will go on as the investigation continues. ( read about two labs closed after a \" dangerous gaffe. \" )",

        "summary": "In the first weeks of 2016, 29 sperm whales were found stranded and dead off the coasts of britain, france, the netherlands, and germany, the bbc reports. The whales had been generally healthy, and scientists were confounded as to what had caused them to enter the dangerously shallow waters of the north sea. Now a study published last month in the international journal of astrobiology has a possible answer: two massive solar storms in the final days of 2015 screwed with earth's magnetic field and affected the sperm whales ' ability to navigate. Or, as gizmodo puts it: \" the sun could have broken the whales ' gps. \" researchers say sperm whales use earth's magnetic field to navigate. They say the field usually creates a \" geomagnetic mountain chain \" that prevents the whales from entering the north sea. But the solar storms could have caused that mountain chain to disappear and sent the whales in the wrong direction. \" they do not realize that the sun is changing the geomagnetic environment for a short time, \" study author klaus henrich vanselow says. Researchers say measuring stations noticed changes in earth's magnetic field from solar storms just prior to the stranded whales appearing. Vanselow's research will be very hard to prove, but other scientists say it's a \" valid hypothesis \" and \" credible theory. \" ( these whales are rarely seen, but scientists managed to spot two. )",

        "summary": "The centerpiece of president obama's state of the union address tonight will be what some are calling a \" robin hood \" tax plan to benefit the middle class at the expense of wall street and the wealthiest 1 % — and while the proposals have little chance of making it intact through a gop-controlled congress, analysts see the president's penultimate sotu address as his best chance to stay relevant through 2016. The white house feels it has momentum on its side after the executive actions that followed the midterms, and in a bid to frame the 2016 election, obama will try to cast gop republicans as \" sheriffs of nottingham \" defending the rich, writes justin sink at the hill. The gop has already declared the president's proposals dead on arrival, he notes, but the white house plans to keep rolling out new plans after the speech in an effort to force republicans to engage. With so much of the agenda revealed in advance — including free community college and paid sick leave — why bother watching the speech? the president's tone will be an important clue as to how he plans to deal with the gop majority, where there's plenty of room for cooperation on issues like international trade deals and the fight against isis, writes russell berman at the atlantic. Obama will use the speech to \" effectively declare victory over the economic hard times that dominated his first six years in office \" and move on to issues like economic inequality, writes peter baker at the new york times, who notes that the address at this stage of a presidency often marks a \" final chance to move past difficulties \" like ronald reagan's iran-contra scandal, bill clinton's impeachment, and george w. Bush's terrible year in iraq and midterm thumping. Politico surveyed political strategists about what surprises could lie ahead tonight, and they split largely along party lines, with gop media consultant rick wilson predicting \" trillions in new spending on soft, focus-group-friendly giveaways and boondoggles, \" while former white house aide stephanie cutter expects obama to \" speak more forcefully than he has during any other state of the union about the enormous economic growth and high job numbers the country is experiencing. \" this sotu aims to be the most tech-savvy such address, reports vox. The white house will live-stream the speech here, but it ' ll also post info boxes to a grid explaining obama's proposals. \" you ' ll be able to answer questions and respond to prompts, share feedback, discover related material, and see and share social media content, \" says a white house official.

        "summary": "For more than 50 years, scientists have been gathering foxes from the russian wilderness and breeding them, picking the most human-friendly to mate to domesticate the supposedly untamable animals, much as dogs once were, phys.org reports. And it looks like the project the bbc says was started by dmitry belyae and his intern, lyudmila trut, has been a success: by the fourth generation of foxes, the animals were acting much like socialized dogs, wagging their tails and seeking human contact, and they'd physically changed, too, with droopier ears, shorter legs and snouts, and higher serotonin levels, which may have dampened aggressiveness. In the late 1950s belyae and trut set out to domesticate a species from the ground up — in a country that live science notes banned the study of genetics in 1948, with severe punishments for those who flouted the law. In the beginning, the researchers pretended they were breeding foxes for their fur ( and they did kill for fur those foxes that weren't docile enough to continue mating for their real experiment ). What's interesting is that the foxes on the farm weren't \" tamed, \" per se, which is learned behavior not passed down to the next generation, popular science explained in 2013. Rather, a 2009 paper by trut ( belyae died in 1985, and trut, now in her 80s, has been running the project since ) notes that the meticulously selective breeding led to the neurological and endocrinal changes the foxes underwent, per discover. Now that the foxes have been domesticated, trut's next task is to isolate the genes that are altered during this process. Read the bbc story for a fascinating look at the experiment, which as of last month involved 340 foxes. ( our house cats, meanwhile, aren't too far-removed from their wild relatives. )",

Still, the results aren't so bad, argues one of the study's co-authors. \"the takeaway is that patients will definitely appear younger after aging facial surgery on average, \" he says. \"there's a range — the highest level was a patient who looked 9.4 years younger. \" but an unimpressed michigan plastic surgeon won't be citing the results: \"removing three years is more in the territory of spa treatments, not plastic surgery. \" previous research has pegged the benefit at 7 years, and livescience thinks the difference might be explained by the fact that this study included people who had less extensive work done.",

Seven of the men will face felonies, reports the ap. The catch? all have since returned to turkey, and the chances of their extradition are slim to none. But the men would face arrest if they ever tried to return to the us.

The times, which did a detailed analysis of video of the melee, reports that yildirim can be seen kicking a female protester multiple times. He is being held without bail in newark, and a public defender said wednesday in court that he was receiving death threats over the incident. Turkey's official line on the violence is that it was the protesters who provoked erdogan supporters at the scene and set off the fracas, but video of the day doesn't support that. All this is playing amid strained ties between the us and nato ally turkey. ( another video from the scene shows erdogan himself watching it unfold. )",

Jeff sessions, president-elect donald trump's attorney general nominee, is scheduled for tuesday, and in a letter to the senate judiciary committee made public monday, trump critic and gold star father khizr khan spoke out against sessions. \" thirty years ago, a bipartisan group of senators rejected mr. Sessions ' nomination to be a federal judge. His record since then does not give us any reason to believe that those senators were in error, \" the letter reads, per cnn. Sessions has been accused of calling the naacp and the aclu \" un-american, \" joking about the kkk, and calling a black assistant us attorney who worked for him \" boy, \" among other things. That's just the beginning of the controversy swirling around sessions: speaking of 30 years ago, npr looks at the 1986 hearings related to sessions ' nomination as a federal judge, noting that there are two accounts of those hearings — both of them true. One of the reasons sessions failed to become a federal judge: the \" voter fraud case [ he ] lost and can't escape, \" which the new york times delves into. In the 1980s, sessions \" played a crucial role in ensuring that the lynching of 19-year-old michael donald by two members of the ku klux klan was investigated and punished \" as the us attorney for the southern district of alabama, the atlantic notes. But the \" real story \" is much more complicated than it would seem. Usa today notes that a group of black pastors rallied for sessions monday, insisting he's not a racist.

An indian bride filed charges in bangalore this month, claiming that not only was her husband cheating on her, but that he violated a colonial-era law that bans \" carnal intercourse against the order of nature with a man, woman, or animal, \" the new york times reports. The activity in question was her husband having sexual relations with another man — and she had the footage to prove it. The woman knew something was wrong right after their nuptials last november, one india reports: her husband, a software engineer, wouldn't touch her; when she complained to his parents, they became \" hostile, \" the times notes. The wife suspected either impotence ( he refused to see a doctor ) or adultery. The camera she set up in their home recorded him having a sexual encounter with a man — a violation of section 377 of the indian penal code. He was arrested. Not many people have been prosecuted under this 1861 law, but conviction could mean life in jail; meanwhile, a \" lighter \" charge of simple adultery would only result in a max of five years in jail, india's telegraph reports. This case has reinvigorated the debate not only about the continued stigma against homosexuality ( a lower court in 2009 legalized gay sex by striking down the colonial-era law; last december the supreme court reinstated it ), but also about arranged marriage itself. \" had [ the arrested man ] been comfortable enough to talk about his sexuality, he probably would not have been forced into a marriage like this, \" an activist tells the times.

            "This weekend's announcement by the former governor of montana, brian schweitzer, that he would not seek that state's democratic nomination for senate represents the latest in a series of favorable developments for republicans as they seek control of the chamber. The g.o.p.'s task will not be easy: the party holds 46 seats in the senate, and the number will very probably be cut to 45 after a special election in new jersey later this year. That means that they would need to win a net of six contests from democrats in order to control 51 seats and overcome vice president joseph r. Biden jr.'s tiebreaking vote. Two years ago at this time, republicans faced what seemed to be a promising environment and could have won the senate by gaining a net of three seats from democrats and winning the presidency. Instead, mitt romney lost to president obama, and the g.o.p. Lost a net of two senate seats. But montana along with west virginia and south dakota — two other red states where an incumbent democrat has retired and where the democrats have not identified a strong candidate to replace them – gives republicans a running start.

Syria has been secretly killing up to 50 people at a time, mostly civilian opponents of the regime, in mass hangings at the prison, executing up to 13,000 people between 2011 and 2015, according to the report. It notes that there's every reason to believe that the executions continue to this day. The executions are in addition to the estimated tens of thousands of deaths in prisons across syria since the beginning of the civil war that were due to torture or inhumane conditions, the guardian reports. The only legal process inmates go through before they're executed is a one- or two-minute hearing at a \" military field court, \" according to amnesty, which spoke to 84 witnesses, including former guards, in the course of its investigation. A portion of the report: \" throughout this process, [ the prisoners ] remain blindfolded.

Mariah ), or buckets of spicy fried chicken -- no thighs, lot of wings ( ms. Minaj ). Okay now granted, many times the reason for these \" huh?! \" requests is to make sure the venue reads the actual rider.

        "summary": "Centuries ago, coastal irish communities discovered that they could harvest carraigín moss, a type of seaweed, from the rocky waters at carrigan head and cook it with milk to produce a thickener. Named after the area, carrageenan — the soluble fiber derived from seaweed — has since gained global popularity as an emulsifier in a wide range of foods, including ice creams, infant formulas, meats, and more, reports food safety magazine. But since a handful of studies suggested that the ingredient may cause intestinal inflammation in lab animals, hundreds of people blame it as the source of their health woes that range from digestive problems to migraines. Now a committee that proposes rules for the organic food industry has voted to ban it from organic foods, reports npr. The cornucopia institute, which has been calling for carrageenan's ban, says the national organic standards board's vote is a \" big win for consumers \" who want to remove the \" dangerous additive. \" meanwhile other scientists have come forward to say they cannot replicate the lab results being cited, while the world health organization, fda, and european commission all say they still believe carrageenan to be safe. The un's food and agriculture organization notes that global carrageenan production jumped five-fold between 2000 and 2010, while npr reports that the \" carrageenan backlash \" in the us is already being felt by producers. If the us department of agriculture adopts the recommendation, the ban on carrageenan in organic foods in the us could be in place within two years. ( some research suggests organic foods aren't more nutritious. )",

But in a new twist, documents reveal that lewis bennett requested such a letter just four days after his new wife, isabella hellmann, went missing and the day after the coast guard called off its search, reports abc news. The couple from delray beach, fla., had married three months earlier and were celebrating their marriage by sailing the caribbean. Bennett reported their boat capsized on may 15. He says he'd been sleeping below the night of the 14th when he awoke to the sound of the boat hitting something and found the boat was taking on water; when he couldn't find his 41-year-old wife, he says he jumped into a life raft and sent out a distress call. The coast guard found bennett on the 15th, and called off the search for hellmann on the 18th — after spending 138 hours searching nearly 5,000 square nautical miles. The coast guard and fbi list it as a missing person's case with no mention of foul play, but hellmann's sister, adriana difeo, has been vocal about suspecting otherwise. Difeo tried to become hellmann's conservator to protect the couple's delray beach condo and pay off her debts, but has no standing given that hellmann had no will. Bennett, as hellmann's husband and father of their 9-month-old daughter, is the only person with standing, reports the palm beach post. Bennett has since taken his daughter to the uk to \" seek the comfort \" of friends and family, according to a facebook account he since deleted. ( one lost-at-sea case has taken a turn. )",

Last march, neil moore was housed in england's wandsworth prison — the same facility that once housed julian assange and allowed ronnie \" great train robber \" biggs to escape 50 years ago, npr notes — when he came up with his plan: using the phone he wasn't supposed to have, moore created a fake web domain that resembled that of london's royal courts of justice. He then emailed an order from a supposed bail clerk to wandsworth detailing the ok for his own release, the bbc reports. He was set free on march 10, 2014, and his mia status wasn't discovered for three days. What moore pulled off is a variation of online fraud called \" typosquatting, \" in which a fake website looks like a legit one, save for a misplaced letter or two in the url, nbc notes. \" a lot of criminal ingenuity harbors in the mind of mr. Moore, \" one of the case's prosecutors said, per the bbc. Moore's self-imposed freedom didn't last long: his lawyer told the press association he turned himself in a few days after he fled, nbc notes; he pleaded guilty to fraud and escape from lawful custody and is due for sentencing april 20. Apparently, online impersonation isn't moore's only talent: his original fraud charges arose, among other things, from accusations that he pretended to be a woman, reports the bbc.

The bipartisan bill by florida reps.

        "summary": "Four hundred miles beneath the united states, there appears to be enough water to fill all our oceans — almost three times. Researchers have for the first time discovered direct evidence of the water, which exists as a fourth form: not liquid, not ice, not vapor, but hydrogen and oxygen molecules trapped in a mineral called ringwoodite found in the transition zone, which sits between the upper and lower mantles, usa today reports. Their findings follow up on the discovery, announced in march, of a water-rich sample of ringwoodite from the transition zone that was brought to the surface via a brazilian volcano. That find \" showed us at least one place there is water, but it didn't tell us how expansive the water would be, \" explains steve jacobsen, one of the lead researchers. By analyzing how seismic waves moved at various depths, they found that \" water is everywhere beneath north america, \" new scientist reports. To measure all of the united states took eight years, and the team wants to next determine whether the water-rich minerals extend around the whole planet, though doing so is reliant on the availability of seismometers in other regions. \" scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades, \" jacobsen says, according to the guardian; its existence was first theorized in 1987. The discovery could change our understanding of how the oceans formed: while some scientists have theorized the oceans ' water came from a comet or asteroid, these findings suggest the oceans actually hail from water deep inside the planet that oozed out of rocks and was driven to the surface by geological activity in earth's early days. The underground \" reservoir \" could hold three-quarters of the earth's water. ( click for more on the ringwoodite found in a \" hell diamond \" in brazil. )",

The indian express reports doctors in india pulled a live cockroach out of a woman's nose this week after it was discovered hanging out on her skull. The 42-year-old woman started suffering pain and a \" tingling, crawling sensation \" tuesday night. According to the times of india, she thought it was a cold at first. Instead it was — as gizmodo describes it — a \" living nightmare. \" it wasn't until the third hospital the woman visited wednesday that doctors used a nasal endoscopy to find the source of the woman's discomfort: a large and very much alive cockroach resting on her skull in between her eyes. Apparently, the cockroach had crawled up the woman's nose while she was sleeping and got stuck, unable to go any further or turn around the way it came, the deccan chronicle reports. Doctors initially tried to suction the cockroach out, but as one doctor put it: \" it didn't seem to want to come out. \" they eventually had to use forceps to de-roach the woman's nasal passage. Video of the procedure can be found here for readers with the stomach for it. Shockingly, the cockroach, which had been inside the woman for nearly 12 hours, was still kicking after doctors removed it. Doctors say the roach could have put holes in the woman's brain had it traveled any further or caused a serious infection if it died. ( this man had something wedged in his nose for 44 years. )",

Some 94 % of samples taken from places like congress and trump tower tested positive, while globally speaking, 84 % of samples contained plastics. Lebanon and india follow the us, while countries in europe have the lowest contamination, though it is still above 70 %. \" we have enough data from looking at wildlife, and the impacts that it's having on wildlife, to be concerned, \" a microplastic expert in new york tells the guardian. \" if it's impacting [ wildlife ], then how do we think that it's not going to somehow impact us? \" microplastics are defined as being shorter than 5mm long, which is roughly the length of a sesame seed. Sometimes they are produced as micro beads in toothpaste and scrubs, but they also result from degrading plastic waste and have been found all over the world in everything from fish, honey, and beer to the very air we breathe — both indoors and outdoors. Americans who drink six pints ( about 96 ounces ) a day could be ingesting 4,000 plastic particles a year; shellfish consumers, meanwhile, could be ingesting 11,000 a year from just that source, per phys.org.

Abc news reports experts expect to see widespread outbreaks of sea lice this summer, especially in the gulf of mexico. Sea lice are incredibly tiny jellyfish larvae that are invisible in the water. They get stuck between swimmers'skin and bathing suits or hair and start stinging. That leads to seabather's eruption — aka pika-pika or ocean itch, according to cnn. The itchy rash can last for two weeks. Ktrk reports it can also cause chills, nausea, and fever. Authorities say the best way to avoid the rash is to wear as little clothing as possible while swimming. If you do get stung — you likely won't notice until a few hours later when the itching starts — rub the area with sand or a credit card's edge, then rinse with hot water. Swimmers in areas where sea lice are present should take off their swimsuits before showering and rinse them with vinegar or rubbing alcohol.

The idea isn't as random as it might seem; the iconic rapper hails from portsmouth, buzzfeed reports. Virginia resident nathan coflin came up with the idea to replace the confederate statue — built in the late 1800s to memorialize the area's confederate dead — with a statue of elliott, and his change.org petition soon drummed up quite a bit of attention. \" together we can put white supremacy down, flip it and reverse it, \" coflin writes. Twitter got behind that idea, with users hailing the petition as \" the most important petition you will ever sign, \" among other things. Elliott herself has weighed in, saying she's humbled by the support for the idea. Coflin, 27, tells the washington post, \" unfortunately history is kind of a mixed bag of bad and good. I wanna show we can honor the positivity that's happening today in portsmouth and i think no one better suits that than missy elliott. \" the petition will be sent to the portsmouth city council, along with the city's mayor and vice mayor, for consideration.

Another four centuries after that, writer bram stoker was inspired by legends about vlad to write dracula. Romania is home to about 6,000 brown bears, accounting for approximately 60 % of europe's bear population.

        "summary": "Female wwii pilots are once again allowed to have their ashes buried with honors at arlington national cemetery thanks to legislation passed by congress this week, the los angeles times reports. More than 1,000 women flew noncombat and training missions as part of the women airforce service pilots program to free up male pilots to fight in the war. Thirty-eight of them died during their service. After years of pressure — the army didn't even pay for the funeral of a wasp who died during a training mission because she was considered a civilian volunteer — the wasp were finally recognized as war veterans in 1977, according to npr. And the ap reports that in 2002 they were finally deemed eligible for burial at arlington. But the army reversed that decision last year citing dwindling space. \"these amazing women who helped win world war ii deserve access to arlington, \" the times quotes california rep. Susan davis as saying. \" it is an injustice that they are being denied. \" arizona rep. Martha mcsally, who introduced the new legislation, said the army's reversal was based on sexism. Mcsally's bill had the support of lawmakers from both parties and will now go to president obama for signing. It's a turn of events surely welcomed by the family of elaine harmon, a wasp who wanted to be buried in arlington when she died last year. Her ashes are currently sitting in her daughter's closet. \" its a great honor to be buried at arlington, \" 94-year-old wasp nell bright tells npr. \" i think that the wasp deserve to have that honor. \"",
