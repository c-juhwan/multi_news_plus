        "summary": "In may, vladimir putin helped release three rare siberian tigers into the wilds of russia's remote eastern amur region. Now, after reports last week that one of them had crossed over into china ( the new york times called it a \" territory grab \" ), beijing is confirming the presence of the female, dubbed kuzya, and says it's removing traps and setting up cameras. Russia isn't being terribly cagey in warning china to take good care of the tiger, with the environmental minister issuing a statement saying he \" hopes our chinese colleagues will ensure that the fate of the predator follows the framework of international cooperation. \" china appears to be eager to help; usa today notes that though the region in which kuzya has been spotted is teeming with prey, a chinese official says, \" if necessary, we can release cattle into the region to feed it. \" a second of those three tigers putin released has been spotted near the border with china. ( meanwhile, the vlad turned 62 last week — with an exhibit of himself as hercules. )",

Given the increasingly close relations between moscow and beijing, united against what both countries see as a growing challenge from the west, it appears chinese officials are taking no chances with kuzya's safety.

Francis'statement thursday is consistent with his stance since becoming pope, the guardian reports. Still, proponents of allowing women to become priests had gotten a glimmer of hope after francis ordered a study of ordaining women as deacons, according to the new york times. After standing behind the ban on female priests, francis noted that women do \" many other things better than men \" and are important for the \" feminine dimension of the church. \" while those who support allowing women to become priests are left hoping a future pope disagrees with francis, the roman catholic church is continuing to deal with a shortage of priests around the world.",

Archaeologists excavating a 2,000-year-old cemetery near the nile river in sudan say that among many artifacts, they found a box decorated with eyes likely thought to protect the deceased from the evil eye. The so-called \" udjat \" eyes were \" a well-known tradition in egypt, \" says sudanese archaeologist mahmoud bashir. \" it had a kind of ritual role to [ protect ] from the evil eye. \" ( the evil eye — a look that someone gives a person or thing that causes it harm — dates back to ancient roman and greek texts as well as the bible, where it is written in proverbs 23: 6, \" eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats, \" notes another livescience article. ) other tomb findings offer insights into the kush kingdom, which thrived in sudan and covered a wide area bordering on roman-dominated egypt. Archaeologists discovered jugs that once held sorghum-made beer; seven attached bowls, possibly used like we might use a \" party tray \" today; and a ring bearing the image of a god — likely amun, who bore horns in the kush religious culture. They also found a man with a thumb ring, which was used for drawing back the bowstring in archery. The tombs, described in an online book, were found by villagers digging a ditch in 2002 near the modern-day town of dangeil. Livescience has photos here.

Because, according to austrian researchers, he's probably not, the local reports. It has long been held that members of columbus ' crew during his first voyage to the americas in the late 15th century contracted syphilis from the natives and brought the sexually transmitted disease back to europe. After all, the local notes, the first recorded outbreak of syphilis occurred in naples in 1495, just a couple years after columbus returned from the new world. However, findings published this month in the journal of biological and clinical anthropology indicate otherwise. Researchers from the medical university of vienna found evidence of congenital syphilis in skeletons in austria that date back as early as 1320 — more than 170 years before columbus sailed the ocean blue. Congenital syphilis is a form of the disease passed from mother to child. Teeth from the skeletons, exhumed at st. Pölten, austria, show evidence of the disease, including hutchinson's teeth ( widely spaced incisors with central notches ) and mulberry molars ( excess enamel on the molars ). Further study will be done to confirm the findings, per a press release. Syphilis — which, according to the mayo clinic, can cause organ damage and even death if left untreated — is still thriving today. Some 36 million people have the disease worldwide, the telegraph reports, and in the us, cases of syphilis ( along with chlamydia and gonorrhea ) have risen nationally for the first time in nearly a decade, according to upi.

Senator john edwards described him on monday as a manipulative politician who refused to let his affair or his mistress ' pregnancy sideline his presidential ambitions. But edwards'defense asked jurors to \" follow the money, \" saying the nearly $ 1 million in illegal campaign funds he is accused of secretly accepting as he sought the 2008 democratic nomination instead went to a former campaign aide who used the money to pay for his $ 1.5 million house.

The two-time presidential hopeful was the democrats ' vice-presidential nominee in 2004.

Diet soda in general is taking a beating, the wall street journal reports: coke zero's volume dropped 2 %, diet pepsi fell 5.2 %, and diet mountain dew slid 3 %. Fortune frames their predicament thusly: health-conscious consumers are favoring juices and flavored waters that are free of ingredients like aspartame, a sugar substitute that a september 2014 study found may actually raise your blood sugar. To wit, the washington post reports that in the last decade, diet coke's sales have sunk by nearly 30 %; diet pepsi has fared worse. And while volumes of all nonalcoholic drink were up 1.7 %, soda consumption as a whole fell for the 10th consecutive year, with a 0.9 % drop in volume last year. That category includes bottled water, which beverage marketing corp. Says took a big jump in volume last year: up 7.3 %. That bolsters the industry tracker's prediction that by as soon as late next year, bottled water volumes could overtake soda volumes.

On any given day, \" market guards or police officials could ask me to follow them to an empty room, \" says another woman who describes being sexually assaulted many times. \" things like this happen in broad daylight, \" adds a former police officer and victim, per cnn. She says 90 % of the women she knew were victims of sexual assault, perpetrated by government officials, prison guards, and prosecutors. Even in the military, officials \" demand sexual favors, \" she says. In a sign of just how normalized the abuse is, only one victim said she went to police. North korea has laws against rape and sex with subordinates, but \" when the perpetrator is an official, even if the case comes to the police, it will be ignored, \" the ex-police officer says. \" they are untouchable. \" north korea's government last year told a un committee that only a handful of rape convictions occur each year in the country of 25 million, including five in 2015. One woman says a military commander who assaulted some 30 women was only discharged from service — but so were his victims. \" it was considered that … they had actively taken part, \" she says. Per reuters, north korea is \" strongly rejecting \" the allegations as \" unfounded and fictitious. \" ( defecting isn't easy. )",

A bump fire stock, also known as a bump stock, is a device that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly, similar to automatic weapons. Twelve of them were found on firearms recovered from the gunman's las vegas hotel room. Gun control legislation has failed to make any progress in congress after each mass shooting, and the las vegas massacre appears to be no different. After the massacre, lawmakers first responded by saying they, including house speaker paul ryan, didn't even know what a bump stock was.",

The average american workweek in september was 34.4 hours — an increase of 0.1 hour that one analyst says is a good sign for the economy. But a report by upwork and the freelancers union released this week found that america's freelancers work an average of 36 hours per week. There are 55 million self-identified freelancers in the us — an increase of 2 million in just two years — representing 35 % of the american workforce. And that's not counting the 13.5 million people who do part-time freelance work in addition to their full-time jobs, according to huffington post. Forbes reports freelancers earned $ 1 trillion total in the past year. So despite the increasing importance of freelancers to the economy, why do politicians from both parties continue to focus on traditional full-time employment? \" as a political constituency, freelancers are neglected, and their role in pushing our economy forward is rarely discussed, \" the heads of the freelancers union and upwork write for huffpo. \" it's time for that to change. \" while freelancers may have greeter flexibility in their work — and 54 % say they make more money freelancing than they did working a traditional job — they also lack many of the benefits given to full-time workers, including affordable health insurance.

In other words, whoever said money can't buy happiness was lying, reports complex. Researchers at the university of british columbia set out to gauge how happy a material purchase — be it a sweater or a coffee maker — made a person feel in the weeks after they got the item home. After asking shoppers to record how they felt about an item up to five times per day, researchers found material purchases delivered repeated bursts of happiness for weeks, while experiential purchases brought only a brief dose of pleasure. The happiness that came from a visit to the spa, a sporting event, or a weekend getaway was more intense, though, and people tended to view such purchases more favorably when asked their thoughts about six weeks after christmas. \" the decision of whether to buy a material thing or a life experience may therefore boil down to what kind of happiness one desires, \" a researcher explains in a release. He breaks the study down like this: \" consider a holiday shopper deciding between tickets to a concert or a new couch in the living room. The concert will provide an intense thrill for one spectacular night, but then it will end, \" he says. \" in contrast, the new couch will never provide a thrilling moment to match the concert, but will keep the owner snug and comfortable each day throughout the winter months. \" ( certain smells may make you spend more than planned. )",

Per the ap, press secretary sarah huckabee sanders announced on monday that pompeo would travel to north korea this week. The trip to pyongyang will be pompeo's second as top us diplomat and the first by a senior us official since trump's historic meeting with kim jong un in singapore last month.

Pompeo last visited pyongyang in may ahead of the trump-kim summit and traveled there secretly in early april while he was director of the cia. The announcement of pompeo's trip comes at the heels of news that satellite images have revealed that north korea is continuing to expand a missile-manufacturing plant in the city of hamhung, the wall street journal reports. The plant produces solid-fuel missiles, which can be launched with little warning, suggesting that pyongyang is pressing ahead with weapons programs despite a recent moratorium on testing, analysts say. Intelligence sources tell the washington post that north korea is preparing to conceal its nuclear weapons instead of giving up its entire stockpile. On sunday, trump's national security adviser john bolton told cbs ' face the nation the us has a plan that would lead to the dismantling of north korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs in just one year.

        "summary": "Democrats need to take the right lesson from friday's dramatic rescue of the affordable care act: you can be grateful for sen. John mccain's vote, but he's not your hero. The atlantic reports mccain is a man of principle, but those principles are \" process, decorum, and senate traditions. \" it may seem \" silly \" to put process over the actual policies being voted on, but that's what mccain does, and he did it again friday, valuing process ahead of party or ideology. \" we must now return to the correct way of legislating, \" he said in a statement. But he also said: \"from the beginning, i have believed that obamacare should be repealed and replaced. \" here's what else you need to know about friday's health care vote: vox argues there's another reason mccain isn't the hero of the aca's preservation: republican senators lisa murkowski and susan collins have opposed every gop health care bill for weeks, standing up to threats of violence from republicans in the house, shaming tweets from president trump, and more. Sen. Amy klobuchar made sure that was recognized when she interrupted sen. Chuck schumer's praising of mccain to ask, \"can you also not forget the two women senators who were there from the beginning? \" roll call reports. In addition to mccain, murkowski, and collins, the washington post gives credit to five democratic senators from trump-supporting red states, especially sen. Joe manchin, whose west virginia went for trump in 2016 by 42 points, who never wavered in their opposition to the gop health care bills. In its list of five lessons to learn from friday's vote, the new york times argues it was proof that both trump and bullying were ineffective this time. Trump sicced his 34 million twitter followers on murkowski and had interior secretary ryan zinke threaten the alaskan economy. \" it wasn't a subtle move, \" and it didn't work. The zinke move, especially, was miscalculated, the washington post reports. Murkowski is the chair of the senate committee that oversees the department of the interior and immediately demonstrated her power by delaying action desired by zinke. The los angeles times posits friday's vote could herald a new split in the senate: rather than democrats vs. Republicans, it will be senators willing to reach across the aisle vs. Those who aren't. \" maybe this is what had to happen for there to be bipartisanship, \" republican sen. Bill cassidy said after the vote. \" we ' ll see. \"",

The malaysian islamic development department, a religious government body, said it adopted the ruling after complaints from muslim tourists. Director sirajuddin suhaimee said the name might cause \" confusion \". \" in islam, dogs are considered unclean and the name cannot be related to halal certification, \" he said. Malaysian halal food guidelines say \" halal food and halal artificial flavour shall not be named or synonymously named after non-halal products such as ham, bak kut teh, bacon, beer, rum and others that might create confusion, \" local media said.

            "Halal food certification in australia has become a contentious issue. Recently, a western australian cafe received hateful and anti-islamic messages after its owners tried to explain halal on facebook. A south australian company stopped certifying its yoghurt in november 2014 after it was targeted by a social media campaign. And on tuesday, independent senator jacqui lambie threatened to introduce a private senator's bill to close what she claims are \"legal loopholes \" that: … could allow financing of terrorists and australia's enemies through halal money. Lambie is not the first to raise the issue in federal parliament. Wa liberal mp luke simpkins claimed that halal is converting unwitting consumers to islam. Lnp mp george christensen linked halal certification to religious extremism. Activist groups are telling consumers to boycott halal products.

But to hear one white house adviser tell it, actions in this case speak louder than words, politico reports.

In the past two weeks, several women have accused moore of pursuing sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties, including one woman who was 14 at the time and another who claims the former alabama state supreme court judge sexually assaulted her. And though trump has not spoken about his support for moore or the women's allegations, according to short, \"if he did not believe that the women's accusations were credible, he would be down campaigning for roy moore. \" on cnn's state of the union, meanwhile, republican sen.

The #laughingwhileblack hashtag has emerged on twitter to support the women, while a yelp reviewer who says she witnessed the women being escorted off says, \" i'd like to believe it wasn't a racially motivated act, but given the fact that other, non-black guests were behaving in the same way and not removed, i can only conclude that it was discrimination.

Over time, patients grow a second skeleton and become like human mannequins, trapped in frozen bodies. Very little is known about what the future holds for jarvis, but his mum lara boniface, 40, is fighting for all the answers she can get. \"we don't know when it's going to start, when he will have a flare up and we still want to raise a normal strong little boy. I don't want to put him in a bubble and turn him into someone who's scared all the time. \" boy has body of 110 year-old 14 year-old ali hussain suffers from the rare disease, progeria, which makes his body age eight times faster than normal.

Jarvis, 3, suffers from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, which has been dubbed \"human mannequin disease. \" the disorder causes muscle tissue and connective tissue to gradually be replaced by bone, forming bone outside the skeleton and restricting movement. Whenever jarvis falls, he runs the risk of his joints seizing uncontrollably and triggering abnormal bone growth. Jarvis is one of 13 people in australia diagnosed with the condition. According to the national institutes of health ( nih ), the rare disorder is believed to occur in only about one in two million people worldwide.

Researchers studied information on the hometowns of political leaders in 126 countries, as well as satellite data that showed nighttime light intensity. \"our results suggest that being the leader's birthplace increases nighttime light intensity and regional gdp by around 4 % and 1 %, respectively, \" one scientist who worked on the study says in a monash university press release. Mobuto, for example, lavished his hometown of gdabolite with a palace, a first-class airport, and the finest water, electricity, and medical services when he took power in 1965. The satellite images during that time period showed \"extremely high levels \" of light intensity there — which then petered out after mobutu died in exile in 1997. The scientists note that this correlation mostly seems to occur in countries with weak political structures and poorly educated citizens.",

A doj release reports that 33-year-old gerardo \" gary \" adan cazarez valenzuela, who used to be the cash vault services manager at an anchorage keybank, will appear in court thursday in the last frontier. He stands accused of strolling into the bank on the night of july 29, 2011, filling three large boxes with $ 4.3 million in cash, and fleeing, all in about 20 minutes'time. A sworn affidavit from an fbi special agent cited in the new york times reveals the intricacies of cazarez's alleged getaway route: he drove home to stuff the cash into suitcases and other bags, took a charter plane to seattle, then took a taxi to meet his girlfriend. After acquiring an ak-47 and another gun, as well as ammo, per the affidavit, cazarez bought a ford fusion, and the two drove to tijuana, mexico. They then ditched the car and hopped on a bus bound for sonora, mexico — and that's when they were busted with the weapons and $ 3.8 million in cash after being randomly flagged for inspection at a checkpoint. Meanwhile, back in anchorage, it took bank officials an entire day to get the vault door open when cazarez was a no-show for work. Cazarez was charged and convicted in mexico for money laundering and illegal possession of firearms and served out that sentence before being shipped back to the us. The ap notes cazarez's girlfriend wasn't charged. If convicted, cazarez could see up to 30 years behind bars and be hit with a fine up to $ 1 million.",

Some coverage: the basics: trump called for all child-care expenses to be tax-deductible. He also wants to abolish the estate tax, put a 15 % cap on business income tax, reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, and put a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. In addition, he reiterated his call to abolish or overhaul trade agreements.

Key quote: \"the city of detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.

About that child-care proposal: \" it wasn't clear how such a tax break might be structured and whether it would be available to tens of millions of families that don't pay income taxes because they have lower incomes.

Video of the incident went viral on world star hip hop, showing valle lying naked on a table as men douse her in ketchup and water. Now, two weeks later, valle has been arrested on charges of indecent exposure, lewd and lascivious behavior, and disorderly conduct. And police are looking for one of the men in the video, who could face his own charges for touching her. As for valle, she seems unfazed — and even seems to confess to the incident on instagram ( where, yes, she appears to still be naked ). \"that shit was fun now that i remember it, \" valle says, looking into the camera. \"take me to jail but it was fun, and everybody looked like they were having fun. \" a video posted by live love laugh ( @angelicvalle ) on oct 20, 2015 at 1: 13pm"

The appeals are obvious: juices tend to be stripped of fiber and loaded with sugar, and soups can be more dense, filling, and warm, not to mention tasty given the commonly added spices such as turmeric and cumin. So was this a passing fad? apparently not. Tech times is declaring soup to be a diet trend of 2017 that will likely replace juice cleanses. The los angeles times, meanwhile, offers up a round-up of new souping companies cropping up nationwide, some of which also offer bone broth options, popular in fasts and cleanses. The typical daily caloric intake from souping cleanses hovers around 1,200. Not everyone is thrilled. One dietician wrote in the huffington post in april that while soups are a better component to a meal than juices, they're both insufficient alone and trick people into thinking they need to buy bottled products to get their organs to cleanse their bodies: \" encouraging that low of a calorie intake anytime is a big red flag in my book. I ' m not a fan of starving people — ever. \" she adds that our lungs, kidneys, liver, and skin are \" wondrous organs that detox naturally when we don't resort to unhealthy behaviors. \" for its part, the times also reported in april that while juices can be very healthy and americans should eat more vegetables, chewing is important, and there is no good science behind the detox trends.

According to a un scientific report approved by 124 nations, the coming extinction of pollinators such as butterflies and bees could undermine hundreds of billions in world food crops. \" we are in a period of decline and there are going to be increasing consequences, \" says lead report author simon potts. With one in six vertebrate pollinators ( like hummingbirds ) and two in five invertebrate pollinators ( like bees ) going extinct, the report says, $ 235 billion to $ 577 billion in world food crops are at risk. Some 35 % of world crop production depends on pollinators, the new york times reports. What's behind the extinctions? experts point to climate change, pesticides that harm or kill pollinators, and farmers that fill every acre without patches for cover crops and wildflowers that feed pollinators. On the bright side, experts say, that makes some fixes easy: stop using harmful pesticides and start planting things for pollinators ( in england, the government pays farmers to plant wildflowers in hedgerows ). \" there are relatively simple, relatively inexpensive mechanisms for turning the trend around for native pollinators, \" a report co-author tells the ap. One unknown for pollinators is the effect of genetically modified crops, which can be resistant to pesticides or insects. \" that's a very clear knowledge gap, \" says potts. \" we're brutally honest with the science. \" ( bees, meanwhile, are surprisingly lethal for humans. )",

Many pollinator species are threatened with extinction, including some 16 percent of vertebrates like birds and bats, according to the document. Hummingbirds and some 2,000 avian species that feed on nectar spread pollen as they move from flower to flower.

Yet 2 out of 5 species of invertebrate pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, are on the path toward extinction, said the first-of-its-kind report. Pollinators with backbones, such as hummingbirds and bats, are only slightly better off, with 1 in 6 species facing extinction. \" we are in a period of decline and there are going to be increasing"

        "summary": "Investigators still don't know what caused the fatal crash involving former star pitcher roy halladay in his recreational plane off the coast of florida on tuesday. Halladay, who was the lone occupant, had issued no mayday call prior to the crash, reports sports illustrated. The 40-year-old had been flying a $ 389,000 aircraft called the icon a5, designed to take off and land on water. Usa today found a since-deleted promotional video for icon aviation on youtube in which halladay's wife says she opposed the idea of him getting his pilot's license. \" hard. I fought hard, \" says brandy halladay. Her husband adds, \" she's fought me the whole way. \" halladay, however, got his license in 2016 and had become an ambassador of sorts for the a5, tweeting often about his flights and once comparing the sensation of flying low over the water to \" flying a fighter jet. \" a post at popular mechanics explains that the two-seater icon a5 is \" meant to make flying more accessible to everyone by simplifying the controls and gauges, and by trying to make the plane stall- and spin-resistant. \" the company website touts its safety parachute. The plane is sometimes called a \" jet ski with wings, \" because owners can easily fold up the wings and tow it on a trailer, per the ap. \" it's really a plaything, \" says the editor of flying magazine. The story also quotes an aviation expert voicing concerns about inexperienced pilots flying low over the water. Halladay had been piloting one of only about 20 a5s in existence. In may, the aircraft's lead designer was killed when he flew too low into a canyon, a crash the ntsb blamed on human error. Icon, meanwhile, says it is \" devastated \" by halladay's crash and will help in the investigation.

        "summary": "Scientists have found a new clue that parkinson's disease may get its start not in the brain but in the gut — maybe in the appendix. People who had their appendix removed early in life had a lower risk of getting the tremor-inducing brain disease decades later, researchers report. Why? a peek at surgically removed appendix tissue shows this tiny organ, often considered useless, seems to be a storage depot for an abnormal protein — one that, if it somehow makes its way into the brain, becomes a hallmark of parkinson's, per the ap. The big surprise, per studies published in the journal science translational medicine: lots of people may harbor clumps of that worrisome protein in their appendix, both young and old, and people with healthy brains as well as those with parkinson's. For years, scientists have hypothesized about what might cause the gut-parkinson's connection. One main theory: maybe bad \" alpha-synuclein \" proteins can travel from nerve fibers in the gi tract up the vagus nerve, which connects the body's major organs to the brain. Abnormal alpha-synuclein is toxic to brain cells involved with movement. But don't look for a surgeon just yet. \" we're not saying to go out and get an appendectomy, \" stresses neuroscientist viviane labrie of michigan's van andel institute. After all, there are plenty of people who have no appendix, yet still develop parkinson's. Still, the findings promise to re-energize related research. \" this is a great piece of the puzzle, \" a parkinson's specialist not tied to the study says. \" it's a fundamental clue. \" ( the appendix may have once been more useful. )",

A rep for the bristol county da's office praised the decision, noting \" we can now focus our efforts on preparing for the upcoming trial. \" prosecutors allege carter pushed roy to commit suicide so she'd get sympathy, but her attorney released new text messages hours after the judge's decision, noting she tried to dissuade roy from taking his life throughout june 2014. \" let's get better and fight this together, \" reads one, per the boston herald. \" i ' m scared for you that you aren't gonna get better and you ' ll become suicidal again...

        "summary": "An effort to loosen fannie mae and freddie mac's grip on the mortgage market will come at a price: pricier mortgages. The two announced late monday that, at the insistence of the federal housing finance agency, they will increase their fees to borrowers without impeccable credit ( designated as those with scores of 680 to 760 out of 850 ) or those making a down payment of less than 20 %. The wall street journal provides an example: a borrower making a 10 % down payment and carrying a credit score of 735 would currently pay 0.75 % of the loan amount in fees on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. In 2014, that would rise to 2 %, a fee that the journal calculates would raise the mortgage rate some 0.4 percentage points. And even those making a down payment of more than 20 % will see the fees rise if they're in the so-so credit zone. The changes go live in march, but may start showing up earlier. The reason for the move: to make it more competitive for private investors, who \" target a higher rate of return \" and charge higher fees, to back mortgages. Fannie and freddie back about two-thirds of america's mortgages, and a fhfa official says even the new rates will be lower than private ones. The journal pairs that with some gloomy responses, such as this from lewis ranieri, credited with co-inventing the mortgage-backed security. He thinks the private sector isn't in a position to lend more yet, so \" you're just making housing less affordable. \" meanwhile, daily finance provides a brief respite from the gloom, reporting that, as they do each holiday season, fannie and freddie won't evict residents of foreclosed single-family homes between today and jan. 3 — a move that could affect as many as 11,000 families.",

            "This christmas holiday, a number of families will be allowed to stay in their homes for a short while longer. Mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac have both announced a two-week moratorium on evictions over the christmas and new year's holiday. Though the gesture seems benevolent and considerate, does it really mean that much? a brief respite from dec. 18 through jan. 3, residents of foreclosed single-family homes and two- to four-unit dwellings will be allowed to stay without disturbance from fannie mae or freddie mac. The moratorium will only stand for actual evictions, as other administrative functions and proceedings will continue during the two-week period. In addition, the local eviction companies will be allowed to continue their administrative duties to prepare for the eviction at the end of the break. By looking at the most recent data from both freddie mac and fannie mae, the firms have foreclosed on an average of 58,000 homes per quarter. The two-week moratorium may give up to 11,000 families nationwide the time they need to reach out to friends and family to make new living arrangements. Nothing new the moratorium is not a new occurrence for the mortgage giants. Each year they announce the same respite for beleaguered families. Though the families appreciate the gesture, investors shouldn't view the event as a real kindness that would cost the companies anything. Since the administrative and procedural steps will continue on schedule, the only difference to freddie and fannie will be the physical acquisition of the foreclosed property. Though fannie and freddie wouldn't be able to sell the foreclosed property before the eviction, that would possibly pose a slight delay for the firms, but the christmas holiday is historically a slow time for property sales -- giving the gses very little downside for offering the moratorium. Season of giving announcing the moratorium has given both fannie mae and freddie mac the opportunity to give some advice to troubled homeowners. Both firms have expressed their desire that borrowers who find themselves in trouble should seek help as soon as possible. Terry edwards, chief operating officer for fannie mae, said, \" we encourage any homeowner who is having difficulty making their mortgage payment to reach out for help right away. Fannie mae"

The creature from 95 million years ago, now believed to be the first swimming dinosaur ever found, was first discovered around a century ago, but the only previously known fossil was destroyed by wwii bombing in germany, the bbc reports. In a study published in science, researchers say the new find in morocco has revealed features like paddle-shaped feet, dense bones like those found in penguins, conical teeth, and crocodile-like nostrils that all point to a semi-aquatic lifestyle. The creature also had a huge sail along its back, but researchers believe it was mostly for display, national geographic reports. \" the animal we are resurrecting today is so bizarre, it is going to force dinosaur experts to rethink many things they thought they knew about dinosaurs, \" says chicago university palaeontologist nizar ibrahim. At more than 50 feet from nose to tail, spinosaurus is the biggest predatory dinosaur ever found, and it had plenty to eat, including crocodile-like creatures and other dinosaurs as well as sharks, in the huge river and wetland system that once covered what is now north africa, reports the guardian.

            ">>> good evening. Just a week after hurricane irene came ashore on the atlantic coast, another massive storm is brewing this time in the gulf of mexico. Tropical storm lee is not packing high winds or pushing a dangerous storm surge. What it is bringing is rain. Lots of rain. And days of rain. Enough rain that new orleans rez residents are wondering if all the money put into flood protection after katrina will keep them safe. >> reporter: another rain squall blowing through the french quarter. Take a look at what we're looking at tonight, it's the 12th storm of the season, there's your satellite radar composite. Plenty of heavy rain, but the storm is kind of lopsided. Most of the rain is on the east side. Only 2 miles an hour to the north. So there's going to be a stretch of very heavy rain across parts of the gulf coast. It's been raining here in mississippi since yesterday. Governors have announced some states of emergency, seven counties in mississippi, the entire state of louisiana. Residents here went through katrina, so they take tropical weather very seriously. They are prepping, even as we roll through this afternoon, there's been some sandbagging, but it hasn't been a serious"

In the study, researchers genetically engineered mice to produce four proteins that revert cells back to their embryonic state, the san diego union-tribune reports. They then created an on/off switch for the proteins to keep cells from permanently reverting to their embryonic state and becoming useless. After six weeks of treatment, mice genetically engineered to have the rapid-aging disease progeria lived 30 % longer. Mice without progeria had better functioning hearts, pancreases, and muscles, as well as improved healing of wounds, following treatment. Basically, they seemed younger. The study's results were described by outside experts as \" exciting \" and \" huge. \" while similar treatments for humans are likely at least a decade away, researchers believe they could be used to slow down the body's internal clock and control at least some aspects of aging. They won't, however, \" lead to immortality, \" says izpisua belmonte ( meanwhile, optimistic women may live longer. )",

            "The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body's cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock's hands are always set back to zero at conception: however old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. Advertisement continue reading the main story ten years ago, the japanese biologist shinya yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka's method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. Scientists next began to wonder if the four yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. But at the salk institute, juan carlos izpisua belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has"

After white house talks with nguyen xuan phuc, trump hailed more than a dozen new deals worth a total of around $ 8 billion, including sales of general electric and caterpillar equipment to vietnam, reports reuters. Vietnam \" just made a very large order in the united states — and we appreciate that — for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the united states and great, great equipment for vietnam, \" trump said. Phuc and trump also discussed the transfer of a coast guard cutter to vietnam. Vietnam considered trump's withdrawal of the us from the trans-pacific partnership trade pact to be a major economic setback, though trade experts tell the wall street journal that phuc, who wants to reduce his country's reliance on china, now hopes to replace the tpp with a bilateral us trade deal. The new york times notes that as with other recent meetings with authoritarian leaders, trump didn't publicly address human rights concerns, but press secretary sean spicer noted the president likes to bring issues like that up privately. After the meeting, phuc told reporters that the us and vietnam had \" undergone significant upheavals in history, but today we have been able to become comprehensive partners. \"",

Vietnam runs a nearly $ 32 billion trade surplus with the united states, a growing gap that the united states trade representative, robert lighthizer, lamented on tuesday.

Far more dangerous than tobacco. \" and with good reason: reports of accidental liquid nicotine poisonings rose 300 % from 2012 to 1,351 cases last year, with 2014's figure expected to be double that. The victims, many children under the age of four, can experience vomiting and seizures after being exposed to even a modest amount orally or through the skin. The minneapolis star tribune notes that the bottles often convey their flavors with potentially enticing photos of fruits or chocolate, which could attract youngsters; teens, on the flip side, may be combining it with energy drinks to get high, per fox news insider. \" it's not a matter of if a child will be seriously poisoned or killed. It's a matter of when, \" says a director with california's poison control system. \" this is one of the most potent naturally occurring toxins we have. One tablespoon could kill an adult. \" and it's an unregulated toxin ( bottles, for instance, don't have to be childproof ), sold legally to anyone with a reusable e-cigarette. That \" reusable \" part may be a factor in the rise of poisonings; the times points out that at their introduction, e-cigarettes were largely disposable. Now they're more commonly reusable devices that owners fill with the e-liquid, a mix of nicotine, flavorings, and solvents, and the ceo of one e-cigarette franchise predicts as much as 2 million liters of the liquid will be sold in the us this year. Most contain nicotine levels in the 1.8 % to 2.4 % range, which would be unlikely to kill; but liquids at deadly concentrations — say, 7.2 % — are simple to obtain online.",

Catholic church: rose calls bannon a \" good catholic \" and challenges him about his own church's criticism of trump's move to end protection for young immigrants. Bannon says the church has been \" terrible \" on the issue because it has an \" economic interest in unlimited immigration. \" that is, it needs \" illegal aliens to fill the churches. \" he says he respects the church on religious doctrine, but \" this is about the sovereignty of a nation, and in that regard, they're just another guy with an opinion. \" see the transcript here.",

        "summary": "As they survey the shattered landscape of american politics, democrats looking for the way forward have realized something: donald trump is closer to their party than to traditional republicans on issues including infrastructure spending and paid maternity leave. The new york times reports that after last week's defeat, democrats face \" a profound decision \" on whether to work with trump on issues where they have common ground — and try to win back working-class white voters in the process — or do all they can to block him in the hope of winning back the house in 2018. Congressional republicans are already preparing initiatives that align with some trump promises. In other coverage: the ap reports that a spokesman for trump's transition team says officials joining the new administration will be required to quit any lobbying roles — and they will have to pledge that they won't return to lobbying the government for five years after leaving government. The washington post takes a look at the different associates and factions jostling for influence as trump assembles his team. Art of the deal ghostwriter tony schwartz says things are following a familiar pattern: \" trump sees himself as the straw that stirs the drink, \" he says. \" he has almost no interest in the details of how things happen, but he has an intense interest in being the decision-maker. \" politico looks ahead to the 2018 midterms and finds that the senate map is a brutal one for democrats. Winning back the chamber could be almost impossible for the party, and there is a real chance that the republicans could end up with a filibuster-proof majority. The guardian reports that the president-elect appears to be feuding with the media again — especially the new york times. In tweets early wednesday, trump denied reports of chaos in the transition team and failure to speak to foreign leaders, saying he has taken calls from many of them and the times is \" just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. \" the los angeles times reports that trump met with new york city mayor bill de blasio on wednesday. The mayor, one of trump's fiercest critics, told reporters afterward that he let him know \" more had to be done to show that this country can heal, that people be respected \" and warned that the city would not cooperate with plans to deport immigrants.",

But in the case of justin bieber's arrest, mom pattie mallette might need to be worried for herself, too, reports tmz. It seems that bieber told cops he had taken prescription drugs for anxiety, but he wasn't sure what kind because his mother gives them to him. What's unclear is whether that means his mom gives him her own meds, which is illegal, or whether she simply handles her son's meds. Bieber left jail in miami beach after about an hour on $ 2,500 bond, and radar reports that he didn't seem all that worried about the charges, both before and after his release. It quotes one source as saying that he was \" giggling like a teenage girl \" while locked up. \" he appeared to be still under the influence, \" says another. The los angeles times, meanwhile, notes another headache for bieber's lawyers: he hasn't had a valid driver's license anywhere for at least six months.",

        "summary": "A species of african ant lives a life so fierce that it's become expert at wartime triage. In fact, the behavior exhibited by matabele ants marks the first time that non-humans have been observed \" systematically nursing their wounded back to health, \" per national geographic. Researchers lay it out in a new study in the proceedings of the royal society b: the ants regularly raid termite colonies, and many of the ant soldiers end up with injured or even lost limbs in the process. At that point, the wounded ants send out pheromones that amount to a call for help, explains the guardian. They go still as other ants carry them back to the colony, where the triage takes place. Other ants take turns intensely licking the wounds, with remarkable success — 90 % of injured ants who received this care survived, while 80 % of those blocked from receiving help in the study died. \" we don't know yet if the ants are just cleaning the wound and removing debris, as we do with our wounds to prevent infection, or if they are also applying antimicrobial substances with their saliva, \" says lead researcher erik frank of switzerland's university of lausanne, per new scientist. One intriguing find: ants who were grievously wounded — those who lost multiple limbs, for example — didn't send out calls for help on the battlefield, perhaps knowing it would be futile, or didn't assume the correct leg-tuck position to be transported back to the colony when \" medic \" ants did arrive. Only those with lesser injuries were helped. And a funny find: the researchers say lightly injured ants sometimes behaved \" more injured \" than they actually were, maybe in an attempt to get a lift home. But once passed by, they picked themselves up and followed the pack home. ( behold the world of mutant ants. )",
