Public policy polling has romney winning 45 % of the vote to santorum's 30 % ( it puts newt gingrich at 12 % and ron paul at 10 % ), noting the former massachusetts governor is dominating the electorate's \" swing \" group — those who call themselves \" somewhat conservative. \" but read this morning's papers, and you ' ll find a much gloomier take on the situation, with many saying romney's effort in the state hasn't been convincing. \" he's not overwhelming, that's the problem through the whole damn primary, \" former house gop leader bob michel tells politico. Former republican gov. Jim edgar hasn't backed romney, despite being a fellow pro-business moderate. \" it seems like he can get about 33 % and just about hovers there, \" edgar says. The wall street journal reports romney is \" locked in a dogfight, \" citing a recent shift to the right in the state. The new york times echoes that take, noting a growing conservative bloc and writing that \" illinois is not shaping up to be the effortless romp some had presumed. \"",

That's because the land beneath her northwest indiana home was sold for $ 43 at a tax sale a few years ago — a sale pittman didn't know about, the chicago tribune reports. Now, the new owner is charging pittman, who is blind, $ 300 a month to stay in the house after filing for her eviction. \" my income with a pension and social security is $ 1,000. Tell me where i ' m going to find a place to rent, \" pittman says, per abc 7. The story behind the sale is convoluted: pittman's family bought the home in the 1970s or 1980s, she says, after renting for years from a local church. But the family didn't buy the land, instead paying $ 10 a year to the town to rent it. ( and that's the amount pittman had been paying, before being charged the $ 300 rent. ) they thought the town had taken over the land, but the church apparently still owned it — yet the church didn't pay taxes on the property, which were levied beginning in 2005 due to a change in state law regarding non-for-profits and vacant land. \" so in 2009, the land went to a county commissioner sale \" without pittman's knowledge, says the lake county treasurer. The church, however, \" just ignored it. They never called the county to say, ' hey, we don't want this property, ' or at the very least, they never called this lady. \" pittman's attorney says prospects are grim, wgn-tv reports.",

And a startup in spain has just learned that at least in the world of wine, rule-breaking is rather frowned upon. Last year, gïk challenged spain's wine establishment by rolling out a neon-blue wine, reports the new york times. The color comes from the addition of two natural ingredients, indigo dye and anthocyanin, which is found in grape skin, and the powers-that-be were none too pleased. Because blue is not among 17 types of wine products recognized, regulators fined the company and ordered it to remove the words \" blue wine \" from its labels, per the local. Gïk has already sold more than 120,000 bottles of blue wine, more than half to countries outside of the eu, like brazil and japan, and it's poised to break into the us market. One of its founders admits to the bbc: \" to be honest, we're not wine people, we're entrepreneurs. \" while the spanish wine federation's director says it's a \" laudable corporate initiative, \" he adds, \" you have to respect the rules of the game. \" gïk, which suspended production for two months, is now shipping its drink with new labels that say it is \" 99 percent wine and 1 percent grape must. \" but even if it can't be shelved with wine, the daily meal notes it won't be hard to find. \" that blue bottle is a pretty distinctive color. \" and at least gïk doesn't have to change its tagline: \" gïk is not about wine.

The ap notes that federal law already mandates that immigrants prove they won't be a \" public charge, \" though use of public assistance wasn't a disqualifier; the trump administration, vis a vis homeland security chief kirstjen nielsen, frames the move as \" ( implementing ) a law passed by congress intended to promote immigrant self-sufficiency. \" the proposal — which includes medicare part d prescription drugs, medicaid with some exceptions for emergency services, and disability services related to education, food stamps, and section 8 housing vouchers — was predictably unpopular among immigration activists. Fwd.us president todd schulte called it \" a backdoor, administrative end-run to substantially reduce legal immigration, \" while marielena hincapié of the national immigration law center accused the trump administration of prioritizing \" money over family unity by ensuring that only the wealthiest can afford to build a future in this country. \" the ap notes that the move comes seven weeks before the midterm elections, and could galvanize voters on both sides of trump's immigration crackdown.",

Douglas mata and his team, which included an expert on physician mental health, examined 17,560 doctors in the early stages of their career using data from 54 studies conducted over the past five decades. They found that almost 5,000 residents, or 29 %, showed signs of depression, per afp; individual studies put the rate at between 20 % and 43 %, according to a release. Not all of these residents would qualify for diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, but \" you can have significant symptoms that are just as debilitating even if you don't meet all the criteria, \" a researcher tells the washington post. An editorial accompanying the study notes \" these findings could be easily construed as describing a depression endemic. \" why are residents depressed? the authors note doctors must complete grueling training during internship and residency periods after medical school. They face long hours, high stress and responsibility, get little sleep, and spend \" 40 % to 50 % of their time \" doing secretarial work, mata says. \" it's not rewarding. \" overall, researchers say depression rates have increased over the past 50 years, which is \" surprising and important, especially in light of reforms that have been implemented over the years with the intent of improving the mental health of residents. \" this could be due to shorter patient turnaround periods and advertising that prompts patients to ask for drugs they don't need.

She says she weighed \" between 240 and 300 \" pounds at the time, although she has lost weight since. \" the problem i have with southwest is not that they want me to purchase two seats, \" she writes in her blog. \" it's that sometimes they want that, and other times they don't. I don't know about you, but i fly a lot. And paying double because a gate agent may or may not have something against overweight people is not realistic — nor should it be necessary. \"",

        "summary": "Think pluto is far from us? it's a hop, skip, and a jump away compared to what may be the most distant object in our solar system, which is \" three times farther than pluto is from the sun, \" astronomer scott sheppard explains. Sheppard and his colleagues used the hawaii-based subaru telescope to search for ( and take photos of ) far-off objects circling the sun, and the dwarf planet v774104 was identified in mid-october, reports npr. A computer program created to highlight photos that possibly contained a moving object pointed sheppard to a traveling speck of light. \" when this popped up on the screen, my eyes opened up, \" he says. V774104 appears to be 9.6 billion miles from the sun, reports the bbc, outpacing the previous record-holder for distance, a dwarf planet called eris, which at its most distant is 9 billion miles from the sun. How did a planet smaller than our own moon get so far away? sheppard has two theories: that it hails from another star system or was booted out of our solar system. \" if a large planet formed in our solar system and got tossed out, it could pull objects out with it as it was leaving our solar system, \" he says. To know for sure, sheppard will need to study v774104's orbit. If the planet moves inward, the latter theory is most likely, reports new scientist. If it moves outward, v774104 would become the third known member of the inner oort cloud. Currently, 2012 vp113 and sedna \" are the only object[ s ] in the known solar system whose orbits cannot be explained by things in the known solar system, \" an expert says. We ' ll have to wait and see if v774104 is \" just a gee-whiz record holder or something super cool, \" he adds. \" i've got my fingers crossed for super cool. \" ( eris may be more like mercury than pluto. )",

Anything i say will come off as an attempt to steal a little girl's thunder, but it's unethical for her and her father to continue to claim the discovery of lionfish in estuaries as her own. \" whatever the elder arrington's involvement on that paper, the central florida aquarium society notes that his author listing on jud's paper shows that \" he was clearly aware that lionfish were found in low salinity parts of the estuary years before the science fair project was carried out, \" though he reportedly didn't have anything to do with jud's actual research.

Obama also intends to allow states to opt out of his fix, cnn reports, and washington state has already announced that it will, according to the ap.

Among the evidence to that end, per the report: a loss of radio communications, a long spell in which there was no \" en route maneuvering, \" and a \" steadily maintained \" cruise altitude. \" given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence, \" the report reads. The new search will begin in august after the underwater surface has been mapped; it ' ll take up to a year to cover an area of 23,000 square miles, according to the telegraph. \" this area has never been comprehensively mapped, \" truss says, but it \" is the best available and most likely place where the aircraft is resting. \" the chief commissioner of the australian transport safety bureau says there is a small chance the mapping operation now under way could discover the wreckage.

Putin was expected to visit with veterans and give a nationally televised speech. In eastern ukraine, meanwhile, where pro-russia separatists have decided to go ahead with a referendum on autonomy on sunday despite putin's request to delay it, public gatherings have been discouraged but a low-key ceremony to mark the nazi defeat is planned in kiev.",

            "( cnn ) two of florida's top republicans on thursday distanced themselves from president donald trump's false claim that hurricane maria did not kill nearly 3,000 people in puerto rico last year, despite an estimate accepted by the island's government. Both florida gov. Rick scott, who is running for senate in the state, and former rep. Ron desantis, who is running to succeed scott, issued statements affirming their belief in the death count. Puerto ricans are a key potential voting bloc in florida's closely contested elections. Following the 2017 hurricane, thousands of puerto ricans were estimated to have moved to the state.",

Adam kwasman, an arizona state rep and tea party member who's vying for a republican congressional seat, joined an immigration-related protest tuesday in the town of oracle. He was there to protest against a local academy that plans on housing central american immigrant children who've come unaccompanied across the border, but instead he got himself involved in a pretty significant mix-up, reports the los angeles times. As a bus rolled up to the scene, kwasman tweeted, \"bus coming in. This is not compassion. This is the abrogation of the rule of law. \" ( the tweet, which was accompanied by a photo of said bus, has since been deleted, but you can view a screen shot of it on politwoops. ) except, er, the bus didn't contain the immigrant children he thought it did. Kwasman also told 12 news kpnx that he could see \"the fear \" on the kids ' faces... But the bus was filled with ymca summer campers from a nearby school district, and according to one 12 news staffer who spotted them, they were actually laughing and taking pictures of the protest with their cellphones. When a 12 news reporter confronted kwasman and said, \"you know that was a bus with ymca kids? \" kwasman replied, \" they were sad, too, \" before ultimately apologizing. He continued his apology on twitter later that afternoon, posting, \"i apologize for the confusion. That was my error \" and \"last tweet not the bus of illegal immigrant children. Thank god. \" the times notes that the oracle protest was partly inspired by a july 1 protest in california that forced three buses of undocumented immigrants to turn around.",

Rationing her 34 bottles of water and snacks, including ramen she cooked on her dashboard, vanhecke made a \" help \" sign with rocks and stayed with her car, which allowed her to keep her cellphone charged. On march 17, she went in search of a cell signal, which she found 11 miles away. Her call to 911 cut out after 43 seconds, but it was enough time for dispatchers to pick up her general location.

Ad age reports that a dos equis ad will be the farewell promo for jonathan goldsmith, aka the most interesting man in the world. The beer brand will send the character, played by the 77-year-old goldsmith since 2006, on a one-way trip to mars and swap in a new, still-unnamed actor when the campaign starts up again in the fall. The new campaign — which the brand notes it's trying to make more contemporary and align with its sponsorship of the college football playoff — will have \" elements that are very, very recognizable, that are super iconic to us, but it will have a very fresh take on things, \" says andrew katz, dos equis ' vp of marketing. Ad age notes goldsmith's success in the role flouted traditional beer promos, which tended to use young guys living the high life. Young men wouldn't \" see him as a threat or as a reminder of accomplishments they hadn't achieved yet \" because he was \" someone to work toward, vs. A mirror of themselves, \" an ex-brand director says. That tack led to what the magazine says is \" widely viewed as one of the best ad campaigns of the 21st century, \" which doubled dos equis sales between 2006 and 2011.

After he didn't show up for a date, blackmon was told that her boyfriend had a gun and was being chased by police, al.com reports. She turned up at a gas station to find the two officers pointing tasers at mcpherson.

He tells al.com that he set up the stunt to show people that police can work with the community for a good cause. Video of the proposal has been viewed more than 10 million times online. \" i really wanted to bring the bike life and the police together, \" mcpherson says. \" i can't believe i actually pulled this off. \" the ap reports that some are condemning the stunt as reckless, though police say it was approved up the chain of command, the tasers were unloaded, and no guns were involved. \" at no time was he placed in any danger or anyone on the scene, \" a police spokesman says.

Jim davis received a phone call monday morning from a man claiming to be an irs agent, according to kktv. The caller said davis owed thousands of dollars in back taxes and threatened him with immediate arrest if he didn't pay up. Scared, davis went to the bank, where he was informed it was likely a scam. Despite more calls from multiple numbers — including one showing up as the el paso county sheriff's office — davis refused to pay up, koaa reports. Then things took an unusual turn. The perpetrators combined the typical phone scam with the practice of swatting, which consumerist explains as calling 911 to report an \" armed and dangerous criminal \" at a target's home, leading to an armed police raid. The scammers made two 911 calls while posing as davis: one claiming an armed man was inside the house and another claiming multiple armed men were outside the house. Davis ' 20-year-old daughter amber was home alone when a dozen police cars surrounded the house. A nearby school was even locked down. \" i was scared for my family's life, \" davis tells kktv. Unable to be sure if he was talking to scammers or actual officers on the phone, he rushed home to check on his daughter. Police quickly realized it was a scam.

        "summary": "A unanimous supreme court ruled monday that states can count everyone, not just eligible voters, in deciding how to draw electoral districts, turning back a challenge from texas voters that could have dramatically altered district boundaries and disproportionately affected the nation's latino population, reports the ap. The decision is generally a win for democrats, notes the new york times. The court ruled that the challenged state senate districting map, using total population, complied with the principle of \" one person, one vote, \" the requirement laid out by the supreme court in 1964 that districts be roughly equal in population. The issue, though, was what population to consider: everyone or just eligible voters. The challengers said the districts had vastly different numbers when looking at eligible voters, in violation of the constitution. \" jurisdictions, we hold, may design state and local legislative districts with equal total populations; they are not obliged to equalize voter populations, \" justice ruth bader ginsburg said, summarizing her opinion for the court. Ginsburg said that \" history, our decisions, and settled practice in all 50 states and countless local jurisdictions point in the same direction. \" two rural texas voters challenged the use of total population in drawing state senate districts because they said it inflates the voting power of city dwellers. In texas and other states with large immigrant populations, urban districts include many more people who are too young, not citizens, or otherwise ineligible to vote. The court stopped short of saying that states must use total population. It also didn't rule on whether states are free to use a different measure, as texas asked.",

Trump, the editors write, is \" alone in modern presidential history in his willingness to summon demons of bigotry and intolerance in service to himself. \" wall street journal: don't make this about trump, the editors write. In the wake of the violence, democrats seem to have a sole mission of using the \" ' white supremacist ' cudgel against trump — as if that is the end of the story. \" the editorial does fault trump for failing to respond as a \" unifying leader, \" but it says the focus on his words is a \" cop-out because it lets everyone duck the deeper and growing problem of identity politics on the right and left. \" washington post: it takes a here's-what-trump-should-have said approach and writes him a full statement. \" under whatever labels and using whatever code words — 'heritage, \"tradition, \"nationalism ' — the idea that whites or any other ethnic, national or racial group is superior to another is not acceptable, \" it reads in part. \" americans should not excuse, and i as president will not countenance, fringe elements in our society who peddle such anti-american ideas. \" new york post: the paper normally quick to take the president's side thinks he blew it. Trump faulted \" many sides \" for the violence, but \" ' many sides'didn't drive a car into a crowd, an evident act of terrorism, \" the editorial declares.

The band, playing in support of musicians on call at the rock and roll hall of fame, was loudly booed throughout its performance — apparently by design, mic reports. The boos rained down after singer stephan jenkins promoted acceptance and tolerance and asked \" who here believes in science? \" \"you can boo all you want, \" billboard quotes jenkins as saying to the crowd. In a statement, third eye blind said it knew a lot of republican national convention attendees would be in the audience. \"we... Repudiate every last stitch of the rnc platform and the grotesque that is their nominee, \" the band says in its statement. The trolling didn't stop with the between-song banter. Instead of playing its hits — like 1997's \" semi-charmed life \" — third eye blind mostly stuck with deep cuts, such as \" non-dairy creamer \" from 2009, cnn reports. That song includes the phrase \" two gay republicans \" repeatedly, and criticizes the iraq war. The one hit the band did play was 1998's \" jumper, \" which is about jenkins ' gay friend who committed suicide. \"to love this song is to take into your heart the message and to actually have a feeling to arrive and move forward and not live your life in fear and imposing that fear on other people, \" he told the crowd. Upset audience members took to twitter to express their disappointment, but they could have seen it coming: third eye blind turned down an offer to perform at a gop event during the 2012 rnc, calling it a \" party dedicated to exclusions. \"",

        "summary": "Unlike many states that subsidize alternative energy sources, in 2012 wyoming became the first state to tax wind power. In the four years since, it hasn't even collected $ 15 million in revenue — perhaps partly due to the lack of major wind projects constructed since the tax was enacted, reports the los angeles times. But now the state known for loose regulations and lack of taxes, is discussing raising its wind tax higher — just as construction is set to begin on a massive wind project that would power upward of 1 million homes throughout california and the southwest. Called the chokecherry and sierra madre wind energy project, it's expected to cost $ 5 billion and produce up to 3,000 megawatts of power from its base in, well, carbon county. \" the benefits of wind are disproportionately on the west coast, and the [ social ] costs of wind are disproportionately in wyoming, \" says one state senator and economist on the state's revenue committee. \" i think it's just kind of a fair trade. \" the ceo of the power company of wyoming, which is planning the wind farm, says legislators are flirting with \" taxing this project out of existence. \" meanwhile, gov. Matt mead, who hasn't publicly taken sides, says wyoming has \" prided itself on being very business-friendly, including fewer regulations and low taxes. \" the casper star tribune notes that opposition to a hike in wind tax is growing as people worry about stifling development. Local leaders support the project but not taxing it more, with the county planning director saying if wyoming can finally sort out its tax policy, \" that might be the shining light out of this. \" ( on windy days, denmark's turbines cover more than 100 % of its energy needs. )",

            "General motors hq in detroit. The us government is divesting itself of partial ownership in the automaker after it bailed it out. But gm shares will have to nearly triple for taxpayers to break even. Jeff kowalsky the good news for shareholders is that general motors shares are on a rise, gaining more than 25 percent in value so far this year – and closing at $ 37.43 on wednesday. But that's not good enough for u.s. Taxpayers who received 61 percent of gm's equity in exchange for a $ 50 billion bailout linked to the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy. While the increase is likely to benefit the u.s. Treasury as it continues selling down its stake in the detroit automaker, the latest report by a special federal watchdog cautions that gm shares would have to nearly triple – to $ 95.51 a share – for the government to break even. \"there's no question that treasury, the taxpayers, are going to lose money on the gm investment, \" special inspector general christy romero told the associated press. Gm received $ 49.5 billion to complete its restructuring, a bailout initiated by former president george w. Bush in 2008 and completed by his successor, barack obama, in 2009 as the carmaker exited a managed bankruptcy. The white house also approved a bailout for gm's crosstown rival,",

The percentage of 12- to 17-year-olds using pot dipped in the state from 20.81 % in 2013-2014 to 18.35 % in 2014-2015, reports the national survey on drug use and health. The washington post reports the roughly 12 % drop mirrored a decline in teen pot use in other states including washington, the other state to legalize recreational use in 2014. Still, more rocky mountain state teens are toking up than in other states, a trend the gazette says began before legalization. \" it's hard to be enthusiastic about data that shows that colorado is essentially tied with alaska for the highest youth marijuana use rate in the nation, \" says henny lasley of anti-pot group smart colorado. The findings are in stark contrast to usage among coloradans age 26 and up, which jumped to 19.91 % from 16.80 % before legalization. Pot critics say usage by young adults whose brains are still developing is more dangerous; studies show teens are at greater risk of becoming addicted than adults. What accounts for the drop in teen pot use? the post notes the reasons could be numerous, including research that shows a growing disapproval among young people toward drug use. This month, colorado topped $ 1 billion in legal pot sales, per the cannabist. ( long-term pot use may bring memory problems. )",

        "summary": "As far as discoveries go, this is a somewhat terrifying one, assuming one has a healthy respect for crocodiles on the ground: they can climb and perch in trees. And they can really climb, with researchers spotting them more than a dozen feet from the ground. While anecdotal reports have placed the reptiles in trees in mississippi, colombia, and along the nile, only three references to such behavior appear in scientific literature. And so researchers set out to determine whether it was a regular practice, observing crocodilians ( which includes crocs and alligators ) on three continents: australia, africa, and north america. What they found, as reported in herpetology notes: four species were identified as able to climb trees, and were spotted, in once case, as high as 13 feet above the ground — and as far as 16 feet down a branch. Getting there meant scaling \" a completely vertical bank and then [ walking ] amongst the branches to reach the end of the tree, \" wrote the team, led by university of tennessee researcher vladimir dinets. Another wild observation, per wired: along the nile, crocodiles were seen in the trees as often as some birds were. The crocodiles were observed climbing trees ( and, in one case in australia, trying to climb a chain-link fence ) during day and night, typically in \" areas where there were few places to bask on the ground, implying that the individuals needed alternatives for regulating their body temperature, \" they wrote, per e! science news. Smaller crocs could go higher and further than their larger counterparts, and all were somewhat skittish: when approached, they jumped or fell into the water.

        "summary": "Chinese warships weren't just exploring international waters when they ventured close to alaska on tuesday. The five ships came within 12 nautical miles of the coast, the pentagon says, meaning they penetrated us territorial waters, reports the wall street journal. China says its ships sailed to the bering sea in a \" routine arrangement... Not aimed at any particular country and target \" after participating in joint exercises with russia. The pentagon says the ships kept to international law as per the principle of \" innocent passage. \" but the venture is interesting because beijing opposes any us navy presence in chinese waters or the international waters just beyond. \" these operations are a big step forward for us interests in that beijing now has no basis to object to similar passage through china's territorial sea by the us, for instance in vicinity of china's islands in the south china sea, \" says an expert at the us naval war college. He adds china's operations near alaska \" are also a big step forward in that china's blue-water navy has announced its arrival as a global force. \" indeed, before 2006, china's ships rarely left their own shores. They've since been used off libya and indonesia and in exercises in hawaii.

Two scientists with the us geological survey looked at the region's biggest quakes between 1900 and 1935 and found that we humans might be more to blame than natural fault lines, reports the los angeles times. The reason? oil production. In the bulletin of the seismological society of america, researchers susan hough and morgan page show that big quakes of that era often occurred near oil wells not long after production started, reports scientific american. That includes the magnitude 6.4 long beach quake of 1933 that killed 120 people, though the study merely shows a link, not proof the drilling was to blame. \"it was kind of more of a wild west industry back a hundred years ago, and the technology wasn't as sophisticated, \" says hough. \"people would just pump oil, and in some cases the ground would subside — fairly dramatically. \" the scientists say their study shouldn't be used in the modern debate over fracking, which involves an entirely different process. They also note that today's oil-drilling practices are safer, including the use of water to replace oil, and thus their results \" do not necessarily imply a high likelihood of induced earthquakes at the present time, \" per npr. The lat sees good and bad news: the study suggests the region isn't as prone to natural quakes as believed, but it also suggests that humans play a greater role in inducing them than thought.

So says donald trump in an interview with msnbc's chris matthews scheduled to air wednesday evening, bloomberg reports. During the interview, trump proclaimed himself pro-life multiple times but attempted to dodge questions about what that means in terms of the law, according to nbc news. He eventually said women — but not men — would need to be punished, though he was unable to specify what that punishment would be. He also acknowledged that a ban on abortions would just send women to \" illegal places \" to get them, but \" you have to ban it \" regardless. Huffington post reports there was an immediate outcry over trump's comments, with hillary clinton calling them \" horrific and telling \" and bernie sanders saying they were \" shameful. \" but the idea of punishing women was even too far for many pro-life republicans, who usually seek to punish the doctors providing abortions. Following the backlash, trump did a complete 180 on his previous comments. If abortion is made illegal, \" the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman, \" cbs news quotes a statement from trump.

Turns out, those who believed the story were right. In a dig in the southeastern city of alamogordo, crews found hundreds of copies of the game. The dig drew some 200 locals and fans, the ap reports. It will appear in an upcoming documentary by filmmaker zak penn. The 1983 game was rushed out after the et film was released, cnet reports, and the hurry showed. The game sold more than a million copies, but it was soon recognized as horrendous; its failure is considered one reason for the temporary decline of the industry, the ap notes. The embarrassed atari, it seems, somehow got rid of millions of cartridges — but their whereabouts was uncertain. A city official, however, said the games were in the landfill, as did a 1983 new york times article. Now, after delays in the search process, it seems the official was right. Here's the first copy found, via the dallas morning news.",

Sure enough, 92-year-old henry hit gold: $ 912,000 in safety deposit boxes and bank accounts in several states. Some safety deposit boxes contained notes in a rare shorthand pointing henry to other hidden assets. Why the secrecy? \" he was kind of a mathematical genius as well as being an eccentric, \" says one of louis ' newphews. Louis generated news in 1936 for his eye-popping, 56-mile round-trip commute to college in springfield, mass., then got drafted into the air force in world war ii.

        "summary": "Wall street gave mcdonald's a little kick today after the global fast-food giant posted some of its worst numbers in over a decade, usa today reports. The problem, oddly, may be that its food is too fast. First, the numbers: the company's november sales fell by 4.5 % domestically and 2.2 % globally at stores in business for at least 13 months, prompting its stock to sink almost 4 % today. The domestic fall is its worst in same-store sales in more than 10 years; the global slide is worse than the 1.7 % analysts expected. Now, the food: the tumble comes a day after mcdonald's announced a plan to widen its program to customize burgers, which currently exists at just four southern california locations. By next year, customers at 2,000 us locations should be able to choose higher-quality burgers at \" tablet-like kiosks \" and add gourmet toppings like grilled vegetables, eggs, and smoked bacon — all part of an attempt to attract younger customers who like customizing their meals at places like five guys, panera, and chipotle, entrepreneur and the financial post report. But the cost with a drink and fries will rise to about $ 8.29, and such burgers take longer to cook, making them impractical at drive-thrus, where mcdonald's conducts up to 70 % of its sales. All of this puts \" intense pressure \" on ceo don thompson to \" right the ship, \" reports usa today. \" we haven't been changing at the same rate as our customers ' eating-out expectations, \" says thompson.",

Officer timothy loehmann, a trainee, shot tamir moments after arriving in response to the call. Police said the boy was pulling out what was later found to be a toy gun when he was shot. In december, a grand jury declined to indict loehmann or his trainer, officer frank garmback, in tamir's death. The grand jury concluded the shooting was a \" perfect storm of human error, mistakes and communications \" but not a criminal act, prosecutor tim mcginty said at the time. The family said dispatchers should have told officers about a 911 caller's statements that the gun tamir had was likely a toy, that officers approached the scene too aggressively and loehmann fired too quickly, and that they failed to help the boy after he was shot.

According to terms of the settlement, the city acknowledges no fault in tamir's death, which came after a 911 caller told of someone in a city park brandishing what appeared to be a toy gun. Officer timothy loehmann, a trainee, shot tamir moments after arriving in response to the call. Police said the boy was pulling out what was later found to be a toy gun when he was shot. In december, a grand jury declined to indict loehmann or his trainer, officer frank garmback, in tamir's death. The grand jury concluded the shooting was a \" perfect storm of human error, mistakes and communications \" but not a criminal act, prosecutor tim mcginty said at the time. The family said dispatchers should have told officers about a 911 caller's statements that the gun tamir had was likely a toy, that officers approached the scene too aggressively and loehmann fired too quickly, and that they failed to help the boy after he was shot.

Aspirin is already recommended for people with a history of heart trouble, and the us preventive services task force now says a daily dose will help prevent people at risk from developing heart problems, as well as help cut their risk of colorectal cancer, reports the new york times. The panel defined people at risk as those 50 to 69 with more than a 10 % risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years, which can be calculated here. Long-term use of aspirin can, however, trigger potentially fatal bleeding in the stomach or the brain, and the nation's health experts are fiercely debating the wisdom of the task force's advice. The fda said last year that it doesn't believe evidence supports the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic tells the washington post. He says it's an \" incredible paradox \" that two arms of government are giving conflicting advice — and he sides with the fda. Meanwhile, the chief of cardiology at georgetown university tells nbc news that he hopes the advice will at least make more people aware of the benefits and risks of aspirin, helping the right people to start taking it and the wrong people, including those at higher risk of bleeding, to stop.

State attorneys general will now seek damages on behalf of consumers in a subsequent trial. When apple entered the e-book market in 2010, amazon had a flat e-book rate of $ 9.99. Apple allowed publishers to set higher prices for best sellers and new releases, capping them at $ 12.99 and $ 14.99 respectively. But those prices became the new industry standard, and the judge said this left amazon with little choice but to raise prices, too, lest the publishers withhold their titles, reports the new york times. One damning piece of evidence was an email from steve jobs during contract negotiations, saying, \" i can live with this, as long as they move amazon to the agent model too for new releases for the first year. If they don't, i ' m not sure we can be competitive. \" apple's lawyers argued the message was a draft, but the judge said it showed jobs knew publishers were unhappy with amazon's pricing, and that its own pricing would push amazon's up. Apple says it will appeal, adds mashable, with a rep saying, \" we've done nothing wrong. \"",

Mcmahon also yesterday asserted that police did not intentionally burn down the cabin; rather, the \" pyrotechnic-type \" tear gas rounds ( known as \" burners \" ) intended to flush him out likely started the blaze, reports usa today. In other dorner developments: jim and karen reynolds insist that it wasn't two maids who alerted the police to dorner's location; it was them, and they have the harrowing tale to prove it. The couple tell the los angeles times that they went to their condo on tuesday to clean and found dorner, with a \" big gun \" inside. Karen tried to run but he grabbed them, took them to a bedroom, secured their arms and legs with zip ties, stuffed towels in their mouths, and covered their heads with pillowcases. He repeatedly said he did not intend to hurt the couple before he drove off in their purple nissan. But as the ap reports, a series of gaffes did dorner in. Notable among them: karen reynolds was able to access her cellphone on a nearby table and dial 911 just two minutes after they heard dorner leave. More mishaps: after his first two killings, dorner apparently tried to steal a boat in san diego and flee to mexico, but the navy veteran tangled a rope in the outboard motor and couldn't start it. Then he fled to the big bear lake resort area, where his truck axle broke, stranding him just ahead of a heavy snowstorm.",
