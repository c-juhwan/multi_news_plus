The tenants, it turned out, had about 80 dead animals in various states of decay inside and outside the house in laurens county, reports wspa and wyff. Those animals included dogs, cats, deer, chickens, ferrets — you name it. Some were stashed in the refrigerator or freezer ( the power had been shut off ), some wrapped in plastic, and some were just left where they died. Rebecca keith, 58, and daughters amanda, 33, and sara, 31, were charged with animal cruelty and failure to bury animals properly. The women say they loved the animals and always meant to bury them, but never got around to it. \" i guess you could say they're like family, \" says amanda keith. \" we didn't want to leave them behind. We've already had to leave so many behind. \"",

        "summary": "The earth hums, and scientists have for the first time recorded the sound in the ocean. Using seismometers in the indian ocean, researchers picked up on the sound that is way, way too low for mere human ears to hear, reports live science. No recording is available, but a columbia university scientist not involved with the study in geophysical research letters gives national geographic a rough description: \" it's like taking a piano and slamming all the keys at the same time, \" says spahr webb. \" except they're not nice harmonics. They're oddball frequencies. \" and ultra-low ones: specifically, the hum is between 2.9 and 4.5 millihertz, and humans can only begin hearing things at about 20 hertz, or roughly 10,000 times higher. While scientists have long known about the hum, and have previously recorded it on land, the new research could shed more light on the earth's interior, and perhaps even help map distant planets, reports the washington post. The leading theory is that the hum is caused by waves interacting with each other at the bottom of the ocean, which results in vibrations being sent down into the earth's crust. The process, however, is complex and not fully understood. For instance, \" sometimes a wave on a shallow coast somewhere ripples over the rough sea floor and adds its own frequencies to the hum, \" per the post. Whatever the exact reason, one thing is clear: the low drone is a constant one. Read more speculation about the hum here.",

Wolf calls garland a \" gift that should not be squandered \" and says, \" if i were the republicans, my main concern right now would be that barack obama would withdraw garland's nomination today. \" he might not be wrong to worry. The huffington post cites polling that shows trump would lose 47 % to 40 % to clinton in november while being the \" least popular major party nominee in modern history. \" and a more liberal, clinton-nominated justice would be a \" tectonic shift of power on the court. \" but not everyone agrees. A former redstate editor says senate republicans confirming garland would send a message to voters that they've given up hope, politico reports. Meanwhile, mitch mcconnell still refuses to hear garland's nomination. \" republicans continue to believe that the american people should have a voice in this decision and the next president should make the nomination, \" a mcconnell spokesperson tells nbc news.",

The conservative wing of the party, angry with trump's record and principles, is up in arms at gop officials for coming around to the brash businessman. Some elected officials and party members on tuesday made clear they would rather disown the gop -- one even burned his registration card -- than vote for the real estate tycoon. Some conservatives are even urging the gop to cut its losses and confirm garland, a mostly middle-of-the-road u.s.

Trump had taken a largely nonconfrontational approach to the investigation, providing tens of thousands of pages of emails, notes, memos and other documents as part of an effort to show he has nothing to hide and to hasten the end of the investigation. As recently as december, mr. Trump said he believed mr. Mueller would treat him fairly. And mr. Trump has repeatedly said in public and in private that he wanted to sit with mr. Mueller for an interview. After the search warrant, mr. Trump now is convinced that his initial belief that mr. Mueller is simply out to destroy his presidency was correct. Sarah huckabee sanders, the white house press secretary, criticized mr. Mueller's investigation on wednesday for going beyond its mandate to look into russia's meddling in the 2016 election and into the ties between mr. Trump's campaign and russia. \"the president certainly has been clear that he has very deep concern about the direction that the special counsel and other investigations have taken, \" ms. Sanders said in response to a question about a report that mr. Trump came close to firing mr. Mueller in december. \"this investigation started off as russian collusion, of which there was none. \" it is not clear what role, if any, mr. Cohen played regarding the \"access hollywood \" tape, which was made public a month before the election on one of the more memorable days of the campaign.

        "summary": "Chemotherapy is \" not pretty, \" a breast cancer survivor tells the ap — so a new study on women with early-stage breast cancer is encouraging, claiming a gene test can parse out patients who may be able to skip chemo because it won't ultimately provide much, if any, benefit. The study in the new england journal of medicine showed that patients with breast cancer that hadn't spread to the lymph nodes and who qualified as \" low risk \" after taking a 21-gene test responded well to just taking hormone-blocking drugs and opting out of chemo, which can come with significant side effects. Per a press release, the patients who only received hormone therapy had a 98 % survival rate after five years, with less than a 2 % chance the cancer had spread. \" we knew these patients were going to do well, but we didn't dream they would do this well, \" says lead author joseph sparano, per the wall street journal. The trial involved 10,253 women with early-stage breast cancer, per the release. After taking the oncotype dx gene test — sold by genomic health since 2004 and covered by many insurers, per the ap — 17 % were classified as a high risk for cancer recurrence, 67 % as intermediate risk, and 16 % as low risk. The high-risk group received chemo and hormone therapy, and the intermediate group hormone therapy by itself or with chemo ( results from those two groups aren't out yet ). But results for the low-risk group were significant enough to be publicized. A memorial sloan kettering doctor not involved in the study is impressed, telling the ap \" there is really no chance that chemotherapy could make [ those numbers ] better \" and that genetic testing could help refocus chemo efforts on high-risk patients who need it instead of making those who don't go through the grueling process. ( chemo doesn't have to translate to baldness, either. )",

An oklahoma inmate was scheduled to die tuesday night, but his death caught the state by surprise. Clayton lockett didn't die from lethal injection, he died from a massive heart attack nearly 45 minutes after the drugs were first administered. The execution was stopped midway through when officials said the drugs did not properly make it into lockett's blood stream. 4/29/2014 related story: oklahoma men scheduled for state's first double execution in almost 80 years \" after conferring with the warden and unknown how much drugs had went into him, it was my decision to stop the execution, \" said"

They ' ll surely push mitt romney past the 600 delegate mark ( does that make it \" halftime \"? ), and they represent rick santorum's last chance to win a midwestern state, politico reports. Here's what you need to know: wisconsin is what matters: it doesn't award very many more delegates than maryland, but maryland is guaranteed to go blue in november, whereas wisconsin is a swing state, abc news points out. Romney's the favorite … polls show he could sweep both states; indeed, wisconsin conservative radio host charlie sykes is asking if romney can win by double digits.... And a conservative darling? in wisconsin romney has support from \" the entire conservative infrastructure of the state, \" sykes says, including paul ryan and ron johnson. This could be a chance for him to finally score well with self-proclaimed \" very conservative \" voters. Bought and paid for: of course, romney has spent handsomely to secure his lead; he and his allies have poured $ 3.1 million into wisconsin tv ads, about four times what santorum and co. Have spent. Scott walker is watching to see how strong turnout is. Turnout is expected to be the key to his june 5 recall election, so today's primary represents a sort of early test for the gop machine. No one bothered polling dc but everyone pretty much assumes romney will win. Both because he's the establishment favorite, and because, well, santorum didn't get his name on the ballot. Newt gingrich is still here: though you'd be forgiven if you didn't notice — his campaign is \" near-suspended, \" traveling and spending very selectively, according to politico.

        "summary": "After leaving a celebration of the couple's pending nuptials, a bride-to-be fatally stabbed her fiance over a potential wedding guest, according to police. Jacqueline souza, 31, called 911 from a home in colorado springs shortly after midnight saturday, soon after leaving a local bar. When authorities arrived, they found a bloody steak knife on a kitchen table near souza's 33-year-old fiance, brandon watkins, who was unresponsive on the floor, per kktv. He was pronounced dead at the scene, reports krdo. Souza then admitted the couple had been fighting about whether to extend a wedding invite to a woman with whom watkins had an affair, police say. Watkins was all for the idea, but souza, suspecting the affair was ongoing, apparently wasn't a fan. Still, she initially denied any involvement in her fiance's death. First, police say souza claimed to have returned from the bathroom to find watkins with a knife sticking out of his chest, per the colorado springs gazette. Claiming a sliding glass door was ajar, souza raised the possibility of an intruder, then said watkins might have stabbed himself, police say. Finally, she allegedly said watkins had grabbed her by the throat and held a knife to her face after she accused him of cheating with multiple women. Police say souza claimed she pushed watkins in the chest and he fell into the knife. Despite that, authorities found a bruise \" roughly the size of the butt end or finger grip portion of a steak knife \" on souza's right hand. She has since been charged with second-degree murder. A neighbor tells kktv: \" to find out that kind of emotion could lead to that result, it's sad. \" the couple planned to wed in las vegas.",

A sample of reactions on today's talk shows, as per politico: mike rogers: \" the no. 1 way that al-qaeda raises money is by ransom — kidnapping and ransom. We have now set a price. If you negotiate here, you've sent a message to every al-qaeda group in the world that there is some value now in that hostage in a way that they didn't have before. \" ted cruz: \" i do not think the way to deal with terrorists is through releasing other violent terrorists. It's not the only way. We can go in and use military force, as needed, to rescue our fallen compatriots. \" and further, \" the idea that we're now making trades... Says the reason why the us has had the policy for decades of not negotiating with terrorists is because once you start doing it, every other terrorist has an incentive to capture more soldiers. \" john mccain: \" it is disturbing that these individuals would have the ability to re-enter the fight, and they are big, high-level people, possibly responsibly for the deaths of thousands. \" he said that while \" we're all grateful \" for bergdahl's release, the five detainees are the \" hardest of the hardcore. \" rep. Adam kinzinger: the illinois republican, who is an iraq and afghanistan veteran, says, \" the release of five mid- to high-level taliban is shocking to me, especially not coming to congress.

            "While waiting to clock in each morning, workers at some amazon.com warehouses get a steady stream of company-provided reading: the stories of co-workers fired for theft. In an effort to discourage stealing, amazon has put up flatscreen tvs that display examples of alleged on-the-job theft, say 11 of the company's current and former warehouse workers and antitheft staff. The alleged offenders aren't identified by name. Each is represented by a black silhouette stamped with the word \"terminated \" and accompanied by details such as when they stole, what they stole, how much it was worth, and how they got caught — changing an outbound package's address, for example, or stuffing merchandise in their socks. Some of the silhouettes are marked \"arrested. \" theft is a persistent concern for amazon, with warehouses full of small but valuable items and a workforce with high turnover and low pay. Workers interviewed for this story say the range of thefts posted on the screens is as varied as the company's sprawling catalog: dvds, an ipad, jewelry, a lighter, makeup, a microwave, phone cases, pop rocks, video games. Several recall a post about an employee fired for stealing a co-worker's lunch. The digital bulletin boards also occasionally display information about firings related to workplace violence. There are cheerier",
            "Amazon is so concerned about employee thefts in its warehouses that it has a flatscreen tv to shame people caught stealing. According to a report by bloomberg's josh eidelson and spencer soper, the flatscreen tvs are in place to discourage employees from stealing at its warehouses, where customer orders get packaged and shipped out. The tvs don't reveal the names of the accused, but share the details of what they tried to steal and how they got caught, along with a declaration that they have been \" terminated. \" the stolen items range in variety from dvds and jewelry to makeup and even a coworker's lunch, it said. Warehouse theft is a major concern for the retail industry with some reports suggesting it costs over $ 18 billion for the whole industry. Amazon employs over 90,000 employs across 50 fulfillment centers, and typically sees higher turnover in its warehouses. In order to tighten its security, amazon has security checkpoint lines at its warehouses that require employees to walk through metal detectors and get screened as they leave the building.

        "summary": "Rosemarie koczy's drawings displayed at the guggenheim and the world holocaust remembrance center are haunting — not at all surprising given that koczy described them as \" burials for those i saw die \" in concentration camps as a child. And yet the authenticity of that statement, and of the german-born american artist's greater tale of holocaust survival, is now being called into question. Archivists in recklinghausen, germany, where the late koczy was born in 1939, say they've uncovered documents showing koczy's family was roman catholic, not jewish, per the new york times. Koczy's surname is also missing from records of residents taken to camps. What's more, a concentration camp in which koczy said she was held was actually \" exclusively for men, \" archivist matthias kordes tells deutsche welle. Even koczy's claim that her grandfather's jewelry shop was destroyed during 1938's night of broken glass was false, says kordes. \" her life, i ' m sorry, it's a fake, \" he tells the times. Koczy, who died in 2007 at age 68, was apparently no stranger to such claims. \" i have been told, ' you are lying! ' \" she wrote in a 2009 memoir, which suggested even her siblings rejected her story. But \" i knew my experience of the camps, \" koczy wrote. \" these were not lies. \" koczy's widower — who says koczy's family converted to roman catholicism in the hope of protecting themselves — argues the same to the times. Koczy was \" so terrified that people would think she was faking, \" he says. But \" to the end of her life, rosemarie would wake up screaming about the camps, the german boots crushing her. \" ( more than 1 million holocaust victims are \" missing. \" )",

        "summary": "Ebola survivor dr. Ian crozier was released from atlanta's emory university hospital in october when his blood showed no sign of the virus. His ebola troubles weren't over, though. Two months later, he developed inflammation, searing pain, and high blood pressure in his left eye; he could soon see only the movement of a doctor's fingers. One day, his blue iris suddenly turned green. When a doctor drained fluid from the eye, it tested positive for ebola, though crozier's tears and surrounding tissue were clear of it, meaning those who came in casual contact with him weren't in danger, the ap reports. How surprised were doctors? shocked. The one who drew the fluid hadn't even donned a protective mask when he did so. With treatment from an unnamed experimental antiviral drug and a steroid injection, crozier began to regain sight in his eye. Even more remarkable, however, is that his iris changed back to blue — a reversal so rare that a professor of ophthalmology at harvard medical school tells the new york times he's never seen such a thing happen in his 40-year career. Doctors say the case is basically a mystery. Though ebola can remain in semen for months after it leaves a person's blood, doctors weren't aware it could lurk in other body fluids, though other ebola survivors have reported eye problems. One doctor at a clinic in liberia says about 40 % of survivors there have reported eye pain, inflammation, blurred vision, and blind spots, the new york times reports. Experts say the virus may linger in the eye because, like testicles, it is \" immune-privileged, \" meaning it's mostly blocked off from the immune system as a way to ward against vision-damaging inflammation, explains the times. This can also allow viruses to replicate unhindered. Read more on the fascinating color-change mystery at the times.",

Ksbw notes that although the exact reasons for the tree's demise aren't known, the trail surrounding the tree had been flooded, and the tree's root system didn't dive very deep — only about 2 to 4 feet into the ground. \" this iconic … tree … enchanted many visitors, \" the calaveras big trees association said on its facebook page, showing pictures of the fallen tree taken by park volunteer jim allday. \" the storm was just too much for it. \" allday's wife, joan, tells ksbw the tree was \" barely alive \" before it fell and had been tilting to one side for a few years.",

        "summary": "In 1984, glenn ford, who is black, was wrongfully convicted by an all-white jury in the murder of an elderly white man in louisiana. He spent the next three decades on death row — but yesterday afternoon, he was finally set free, the atlantic reports. During the case, ford had cooperated with police, offering the names of a pair of brothers, the robinsons, who may have been involved. But marvella brown, the girlfriend of one of those brothers, said ford was with the robinsons the day isadore rozeman was killed — and that ford had had a gun. All three were charged with murder before a trial that was full of holes. Prosecutors acted to keep blacks off the jury; ford's lawyers weren't qualified for his case; a coroner testified without having examined the body; and brown told the court she'd \" lied \" about her story. Ford was convicted anyway. Last year, after years of failed appeal efforts, prosecutors say they learned through a \" confidential informant \" that ford \" was neither present at, nor a participant in, the robbery and murder \" of rozeman. Ford said, upon leaving jail: \" it feels good. \" but \" i can't go back and do anything i should have been doing when i was 35, 38, 40. \" he's 64 now, and is the 144th person to be exonerated from death row in 40 years, the guardian reports. His plan? \" go get something to eat, \" he tells wafb. Meanwhile, another exonerated man once on death row has filed a complaint against his prosecutor.",

        "summary": "President trump is expected to tell the world at 3pm eastern whether the us will remain in the paris climate accord or become just the third nation to reject it. A slew of reports on wednesday suggested that trump is poised to have the us withdraw, though most accounts hedge their bets with a it's-not-final-until-trump-announces caveat. Also in play: it's not as simple as yay or nay; trump could take one of a handful of complicated options. Among them: formal withdrawal: if trump opts to officially withdraw, it wouldn't take effect until 2020, explains cnn. The pact stipulates that nations can't request withdrawal until november 2019, at which point they must give one-year notice. Faster route: to get out quicker, trump could exit the underlying united nations framework convention on climate change, notes npr. That, too, requires one-year notice, but that notice can be given at any time — meaning the us could be out in 2018. One complicating factor: unlike the paris accord, the unfccc treaty was approved by the senate, and senators would likely want to weigh in. Compromise: politico notes that ivanka trump's camp has been floating a middle ground of sorts: \" staying in the deal while drastically scaling back the obama administration's non-binding carbon cleanup promises. \" to the senate: the new york times reports that trump could take a less direct route to withdrawal by sending the pact to the senate to be ratified as a treaty. ( president obama signed into effect through an executive order, and it was never formally ratified by congress. ) the chances of it being ratified with the necessary two-thirds vote are pretty much non-existent.",

        "summary": "Work-life balance is the american worker's goal, but for japanese employees, work and life may be one and the same. The washington post takes a look at japan's toil-til-you-drop culture, where 12-hour days are typical and there's even a word ( \" karoshi \" ) that means \" death by overwork. \" it's not a metaphor, either: stats from japan's labor ministry show nearly 200 karoshi deaths — including suicides, heart attacks, and strokes, the latter two often symptoms of stress and lack of sleep, the post notes — in 2015, though some say they may have numbered in the thousands. Victims tend to be in their 20s and male, though more women are succumbing to the trend: the labor ministry says work-related suicides among women rose 39 % over the last four years, per the international business times; the health care, social services, shipping, and construction industries see the most cases. \" it's... Not rare in japan for people in their early 30s to have heart attacks, \" says hiroshi kawahito, a victims ' advocacy group lawyer who himself has \" cut back \" to 60 hours a week at age 66. It's an issue with financial repercussions for the government, which offers compensation to families of those officially deemed karoshi victims; there was a record high of 2,310 karoshi claims in the year ending in march, per government calculations ( though only about one-third of claims are usually accepted ). The problem is complicated by the fact that workers in japan tend to stick with one company for the long haul, making it hard to resist a company's overworked culture, and the country's aging population means fewer people in the workforce and greater workloads for those who keep punching a time clock. The government has passed legislation to cut working hours ( kawahito claims those efforts are mostly propaganda, per reuters ) and encourages vacation time. But one kansai university professor says destroying karoshi will take more than a few simple rule changes. \" long working hours are the root of all evil in japan, \" he notes. \" people are so busy they don't even have the time to complain. \" ( long workdays could lead to a risky habit. )",

        "summary": "\" it's all in the pan-bang, \" baker-blogger sarah kieffer says of her unusual chocolate chip cookies. The minnesota baker's not-so-secret recipe had already been circulating on instagram when the new york times tested it out, and after the times covered it, it went viral. Kieffer detailed her technique after food writer julia moskin became intrigued by the attention the funny-looking cookies — \" as wide as a salad plate and flat as a flounder \" — were getting online. She assumed the \" mutant \" cookies copied by food blogs were a \" cry for help, \" and she sought out the creator. Kieffer didn't hold back, revealing how she makes the unusual ringed edges by opening the oven after the cookies have slightly risen and giving the baking sheet a good slam on the rack or on the top of the oven. She repeats the whack a few times more during the baking process, sending ripples fanning out from the center. The result is a distinct soft-crunchy texture that moskin proclaims to be \" a leap forward in cookie technology. \" kieffer says she has no idea what inspired her to try the pan-bang. \" i can't imagine a better chocolate chip cookie, \" says kieffer, whose cookie glamour shots have scored more than 2,000 likes. \" i still can't believe it, \" kieffer tells the star tribune. \" it's so exciting. \" kieffer has other tips: she uses chopped chocolate rather than chips, and she chills her dough balls. Briefly freezing the dough helps it keep its shape, and it keeps \" the centers gooey, and the edges crispy, \" she says. But kieffer knows her time in the cookie limelight is limited. \" you never know what someone else will think of, \" she tells the times. Get the recipe here. ( chocolate chips were the key to these \" perfect \" cookies. )",

Four cops opened fire on vassell in brooklyn on wednesday after 911 calls came in saying a man was pointing a silver firearm at people; after vassell was shot, it was revealed the supposed gun was really a metal pipe with a showerhead attached, per npr. The nypd released transcripts thursday from the 911 calls, as well as security camera footage from the crown heights neighborhood where the shooting took place. In the video, vassell approaches several people on the street — including what appears to be an adult with a child — and aims what many believed to be a firearm at them. \" he looks like he's crazy, but he's pointing something at people that looks like a gun and he's like popping it as if … he's pulling the trigger, \" one 911 transcript reads. The city's medical examiner found vassell was shot nine times; nypd chief terence monahan says his officers fired 10 times. That, along with the fact that vassell was known to local cops to be mentally ill — his father tells the new york times his son had bipolar disorder — has residents especially upset. Witnesses say the police seemed to start firing right away upon confronting vassell; monahan says the officers fired after vassell took a \" two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers. \" the times notes while there were local beat cops who'd previously dealt with vassell and knew of his mental illness, the officers who responded wednesday to this more urgent call were reportedly not familiar with him — \" a hole in the neighborhood policing model, \" per a columbia professor.

Despite the buzz around the ipad mini, apple's shares have fallen 20 % since their september peak, from $ 700 a share down to $ 558, the new york times reports.

Case in point: foxconn yesterday admitted that it can't keep up with demand for the ipad mini, reports the afp. \" we can't really fulfill apple's requests, \" says its chairman. \" our shipments are insufficient. \" add that to the recent management shakeup, a report that android's market share had jumped from 57.5 % to 75 %, and the always looming worries that apple, already the market's most valuable company, is running out of room to grow and people to sell gadgets to, and you've got plenty of food for bears. \" it has just been wave after wave of bad news, \" one analyst says.

            "Autumn is traditionally the time of year when people start snapping up apple products. It's also when investors, in anticipation of another blockbuster holiday season from the company, do the same with apple shares. But this year, even though apple's iphones and ipads don't seem to have lost any of their allure for holiday shoppers, its stock seems headed straight for the discount rack. On wednesday, apple's shares slid 3.8 percent. They outpaced a broader decline in the stock market set off by investors ' uncertainty about how the outcome of the presidential election will affect taxes and consumer demand for the types of products apple sells. During the campaign, president obama proposed increasing capital gains tax rates for people earning over $ 250,000 to 20 percent from the existing rate of 15 percent, and his re-election tuesday night may have prompted some investors to unload shares in anticipation of a broader sell-off in stocks ahead of a tax increase, analysts said. Owners of apple shares would have good reason to fear higher taxes on capital gains. Apple shares have appreciated mightily since 2005 when they were about $ 35 apiece; they began this year at $ 411 and peaked at more than $ 700 in late september. The drop on wednesday only added to what has been a grim few weeks for apple shares"

Google employees were told about the firings in an email from ceo sundar pichai hours after the new york times reported that the company had protected three senior executives accused of sexual misconduct over the last decade, the ap reports. Sources told the times that one the execs was android software creator andy rubin, who was accused of coercing an employee into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 2013.

Pichai — who called the times story \" difficult to read \" and did not dispute the allegations — told employees the company is \" dead serious about making sure we provide a safe and inclusive workplace \" and has taken an \" increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct \" in recent years, cnbc reports. He said 13 of the 48 people fired for misconduct were senior managers or above. In a statement issued after the times report, rubin claimed the \" false allegations \" were part of a \" smear campaign \" from his ex-wife.

The principle is this: the naloxene will kick in only if the pill is crushed, a common method among addicts. If the pill is swallowed whole, the naloxene remains dormant. That still leaves plenty of opportunity for abuse of the drug, the fda acknowledges, because taking pills whole is actually the most common method among addicts.

        "summary": "The concept of temptation, and avoiding it, is something all roman catholics are made to confront throughout their liturgical lives. But pope francis is now saying if you feel that irresistible pull toward that which you shouldn't do, don't blame god for it. Specifically, per reuters, the pontiff is taking issue with one line in the lord's prayer, aka the \" our father \" — the part in which worshipers implore god to \" lead us not into temptation. \" \" it is not a good translation, because it speaks of a god who induces temptation, \" the 80-year-old francis told italian broadcaster tv2000 on wednesday, per the guardian. \" i am the one who falls. It's not him pushing me into temptation to then see how i have fallen. A father doesn't do that, a father helps you to get up immediately, \" he continued, blaming satan instead for any transgressions. It's entirely possible something was lost in translation somewhere along the prayer's evolutionary timeline, as reuters points out the original aramaic was translated to ancient greek, then to latin, and finally to english. And the telegraph notes translation errors and plain old typos have occurred over the years in related religious documents, such as the bible ( one famous one: leaving the word \" not \" out of the seventh commandment, leading it to read \" thou shalt commit adultery \" ). Francis pointed out that the catholic church in france has been using an alternative phrase in the lord's prayer, and it's one he's pushing for: \" do not let us fall into temptation. \"",

In those cases, involving a shih tzu mix and a havanese, the dogs were attacked right outside their own homes. And in each case, the owl showed no fear when the owners approached after realizing what was happening. One woman recalls calling to a friend inside the house for help. \" he came up from the basement and went out and was flapping and yelling and the owl did not move, \" she says. \" he finally kicked it off her and it landed and he picked it up and threw it but it flew away. \" in the other case, the owl flew away only after the owner began pelting it with snow. Both dogs had an eye removed because of damage from the birds'talons. The attacks follow a third last month in which an owner of a shih tzu mix stopped an attack in her yard, per a separate cbc story. \" it looked at me, and it blinked a couple of times, and i was just so surprised, \" says the owner, referring to the owl.

The 7-year-old was left alone on a forest road in hokkaido as punishment for throwing rocks, and police are now considering investigating his parents for psychological abuse and have contacted child welfare authorities, according to the guardian, which cites reports in japanese media. Sources say yamato has told investigators that after he was left by the side of the road, he cried so much he lost his sense of direction and ended up following an unpaved mountain path to a military training area, where a soldier found him in a hut on friday morning. Sources tell the japan times that the boy has told investigators he stayed in the hut because he was frightened of the forest and thought somebody would find him there eventually. Experts say yamato is lucky to have survived and note that the area where he was found wasn't searched for a long time because searchers believed the small boy would not have followed a path uphill or away from the paved road. Yamato, who was suffering slightly from hypothermia when he was found, is still in a hospital recovering from his ordeal and it will probably be a few days before he's released, reports reuters.

His father, takayuki tanooka, said he had again apologised to his son for his actions, which attracted widespread criticism on social media. \"i said to him, 'dad made you go though such a hard time. I am sorry ', \" tanooka, 44, said in an interview with the tbs network that was broadcast on monday. \"and then, my son said, 'you are a good dad. I forgive you ', \" tanooka added, struggling",
            "Yamato tanooka, the 7-year-old boy found friday in a hut at a self-defense forces training facility in southwest hokkaido six days after he went missing, has said that he lost his sense of direction because he cried so much after his father ordered him to get out of the car. He apparently headed in the opposite direction of the car, sources familiar with the case said sunday. Because he was scared of the mountains, he continued to walk along the road until he reached the sdf training facility where he was later found. The door was unlocked so he went inside to sleep and avoid the cold outside, he was quoted as telling his father and others. Tanooka told his father he did not see anyone during the six days he was missing. According to other sources, the boy said he stayed at the shelter because he thought someone would eventually find him. After six days of drinking only water and eating no food, his lost 2 kg, before his ordeal, he weighed 22 kg, sources said. Also on sunday, police said they notified the hakodate child consultation center about the incident on friday as the boy may have been psychologically abused. The latest case also showed how hard it is to predict"

            "( credit: reddit ) by john dodge chicago ( cbs ) — in history books and televised documentaries, we see abraham lincoln as a blurred, distant figure in black and white. With advances to photo technology, colorizing historic black and white photos seems to change the view of history. In color, one can look into the president's eyes, notice the wrinkled facial features contrasted with skin tone and the flecks of gray on his beard. This photo of lincoln was colorized and posted online by reddit user named klassixx. \"the color, when added convincingly, removes that degree of separation we might have from a black and white photo, hopefully bringing us a little bit closer to the time the photo was taken, and the reality of it all, \" klassixx wrote. Here is a colorized photo of chicago gangster al capone done by zuzahin. A viewer is drawn to his steely gray eyes and a gold pocket watch chain that stands out in front of a charcoal suit. There is this photograph of kansas city chiefs quarterback len dawson smoking and drinking a fresca during halftime of the 1967 super bowl. The color draws attention to the green glass bottle of soda, the orange glow on the cigarette tip, the layers of athletic socks. The spartan atmosphere of the locker room is also more noticeable."

Vice reports the document raises a number of possible questions senators could ask comey, including: \" were these one-on-one conversations with trump appropriate, in your view? \" and, \" what was the president's mood when he asked you not to look into flynn's conversations with the russian ambassador? \" vice also hopes at least one senator is interested in how the food was during comey's dinner with trump. Here's what else you need to know about the comey transcript: first, the senate has the full transcript of comey's prepared remarks here. Cnn highlights the top lines from the comey's prepared testimony, including: \" [ trump ] said he had nothing to do with russia, had not been involved with hookers in russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in russia. \" fox news also runs down what it sees as the transcript's highlights, including trump springing a surprise one-on-one dinner on comey and telling him: \" i need loyalty; i expect loyalty. \" comey called it \" very awkward. \" comey's testimony includes three things that specifically hurt trump and one thing that may actually help him, namely that comey actually did tell trump he wasn't personally under investigation, the los angeles times reports. The hill quotes norm eisen, obama's white house ethics lawyer, who says comey's prepared remarks are \" the equivalent of the nixon tapes \" and read \" like trial testimony. \" jennifer rubin at the washington post looks at the important questions raised by the transcript, including what made comey start documenting his meetings with trump, something he didn't do with obama, and whether he believed he was going to be fired if he didn't drop the investigation into michael flynn.

        "summary": "Improved conditions and higher pay are among the ten demands being made by prisoners participating in a nationwide strike that kicked off tuesday and is planned to continue until sept. 9. According to the guardian, the strike, organized by jailhouse lawyers speak, calls for work stoppages by prisoners ( many get paid pennies an hour for their prison jobs, prompting comparisons to slavery ), hunger strikes, sit-ins, and withholding money from the \" prison industrialized complex \" through things like not shopping at prison commissaries and not making collect phone calls. With prisoners in 17 states from coast to coast reportedly planning to participate in the strike, it \" certainly has the potential … to be one of the largest prison strikes that the country has ever seen, \" lauren-brooke eisen of new york university law school tells vox. But, she adds, strikers ' \" demands are rarely met. \" in a statement, the organizers call for solidarity among prisoners, asking them to \" stop the violence against each other. Regardless of race, class or label, we are one. And yes, we are by our very interest a class. \" this strike is partly motivated by a 2016 prison strike, npr reports, as well as being a reaction to a deadly prison riot in south carolina earlier this year. The aug. 21 start date is significant because that is the day in 1971 that black activist george jackson was killed in san quentin state prison, the washington post reports. Sept. 9, the planned last day of the strike, is the anniversary of the attica prison riot, also in 1971.",

Wastewater treatment plants? yes, researchers think that human waste contains enough gold and other valuable metals to make a mining operation pay off, reports livescience. Scientists with the usgs spent eight years analyzing treated solid waste to detect minute metal particles, which come from an array of products, including shampoos and detergents. \" the gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit, \" says lead researcher kathleen smith. They also found silver, platinum, vanadium, and copper, the latter two with potential applications for cellphones and computers. Extracting metals of all kinds would have a bonus, says the research team at eurekalert. Not only could valuable metals be sold or put to use, \" nuisance metals \" could be eliminated from the waste, allowing more of it to be used as fertilizer. One idea is to use the same chemicals that leach metals out of rock to leach them from the waste. The practice is controversial at traditional mining sites because of environmental concerns, but \" in the controlled setting of a sewage plant, the chemicals could be used liberally without the ecological risks, \" notes the guardian. A previous study found that a city with 1 million people flushes about $ 13 million worth of metals away every year.",

About 143 million of those live in the lower 48 states. At some point, some 28 million, mostly on the west coast, will likely experience strong shaking that could cause moderate to extensive damage, according to a study from fema, the usgs, and the california geological survey, which cites \" both the movement of the population to higher risk areas on the west coast and a change in hazard assessments, \" a study author explains in a press release. \" we've always been told that we should be prepared. But this study puts some teeth into the recommendation, \" a seismologist says, per the ap. As the research avoided areas where oil and gas drilling has spawned small tremors, the number of people at risk could be even higher, a usgs researcher adds. The average annual cost of earthquakes in the lower 48 is about $ 4.5 billion, with 80 % of losses incurred in california, oregon, and washington. \" while the west coast may carry the larger burden of potential losses and the greatest threat from the strongest shaking, this report shows that the threat from earthquakes is widespread, \" the researcher says.

Authorities think moore called in the threat to take attention away from the home, allowing him an escape route; instead, when they traced the number to the house, officers arrested him as planned. Along with the unrelated charge for which he was initially wanted, moore, 25, faces charges of making a false bomb report at a school, obstructing an officer, and drug paraphernalia possession.",

Her condition continued to deteriorate; her lungs, liver, and heart began failing, she started suffering seizures, and had to go on kidney dialysis, usa today reports. She died in her father's arms with her mother by her side, nicole wrote on facebook tuesday. A pediatrician tells cnn that while contracting the herpes virus is \" very common, \" it's rare for the virus to develop into meningitis. Still, nicole advises other new parents: \" keep your babies isolated. Don't let just anyone come visit them. Make sure they are constantly washing their hands. Don't let people kiss your baby and make sure they ask before they pick up your baby. \" a gofundme campaign has been set up for the family. ( another newborn nearly suffered the same fate. )",

        "summary": "An investigation into what appears to be a nearly 2 million-year-old site in china's hebei province suggests the spot served an important purpose: fun. The south china morning post compares the dig site to a \" playground \" for ancient hominids, noting that it was home to some 700 stone objects and 20,000 fragments; some may well have been kids'toys, believes lead researcher wei qi. He speculates that the objects, most less than two inches long, were made by children and their mothers. \" you can almost feel the maker's love and passion, \" says wei of one piece he describes as \" beautifully shaped. \" the other bits of evidence supporting his playground theory: the remains of animals or large tools in the area are scarce, suggesting it's not where hominids lived and a limited number of adults toiled there. The site is part of the nihewan basin, which has been the source of a vast trove of ancient discoveries since 1921, ancient origins reports. What's also relatively new is the dating of the site, carried out by studying its magnetic properties. Results suggesting it dates to between 1.77 million and 1.95 million years ago could make it older than the dmanisi site in georgia, which unesco calls the \" most ancient \" in eurasia. But outside researchers have their doubts about the playground theory: \" it is difficult to rule out the possibility that ( the objects ) were just stone fragments created by natural forces, \" says one. If the discoveries really were made by hominids more than 1.8 million years ago — when the first hominid is though to have left africa — it could change the story of human origins, the week notes.

The washington post notes that thursday's vote was the first time the house officially made its voice heard on the issue. The hill reports there were no public naysayers during the floor debate on the amendment, but that didn't mean the day passed drama-free. The legislative director for republican rep. Lynn westmoreland sent out an email ( posted on twitter by hill reporter cristina marcos ) before the vote, noting, \" you know who else supports destroying history so that they can advance their own agenda? isil.

        "summary": "The texas veterinarian who was fired after boasting about killing a cat with a bow and arrow is trying to keep her license — and she promises she won't do it again. Dr. Kristen lindsey appeared before state administrative judges tuesday for the second day of a hearing about revoking her license, kags reports. Lindsey has testified that the cat had a foul odor and fleas, leading her to believe it was feral and possibly rabid, though witnesses have testified that the cat was their pet, tiger. Lindsey told the board that she hasn't been able to find work since her facebook post about killing the cat went viral last year, reports kbtx. The texas board of veterinary medical examiners filed a complaint and is seeking to revoke her license. The facebook post that led to lindsey's firing included a picture of her holding a dead cat with an arrow through its head, the dallas morning news reports. \" my first bow kill lol, \" she wrote. \" the only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through its head! \" she told the hearing that using a bow and arrow was an \" efficient \" way to kill a cat, but admitted it was inappropriate. \" no, god no, \" she said when asked if she would shoot another feral cat. A decision on her license will not be made until next month at the earliest. An attorney for tiger's justice team tells kbtx that \" many, many people \" want to see her license revoked, which would be \" appropriate justice. \" ( the sheriff's office decided not to file charges. )",

The mattoon journal gazette reports the martinsville school board dismissed jordan parmenter on thursday in a 6-0 vote; the decision was effective immediately. The incident occurred during a may 15 lesson on freedom of speech at martinsville junior-senior high school. Parmenter reportedly shifted his class's attention to a chart by using an american flag as a pointer; a student challenged him on that, branding the move as disrespectful. Parmenter then made what he says was a \" terrible error in judgment, \" per the journal gazette: to further illustrate free speech, he dropped the flag and stepped on it. The class immediately became upset, and outrage apparently followed: wthi reports flag-carrying protesters gathered outside the school in may, and a press release posted to the school's website on may 19 notes that threats had been made against parmenter, and had been reported to police. The 26-year-old was put on leave, and penned an apology that he delivered to the school board. A passage: \" i believe that ideas such as the nature of symbolism and freedom of expression are valuable topics to discuss in the classroom and that surprise can be a useful tool to use when engaging students, however in this instance i chose a very poor way of addressing this subject. What i did was never intended as a show of disrespect to our country, to our veterans, or to anyone, nor would i ever do or say anything with that intention. \" parmenter spoke to the board on thursday, but apparently to no avail.",

A federal court, however, has ruled that no matter how badly parole officers may have bungled their supervision of phillip garrido, dugard isn't allowed to sue the federal government, reports reuters. \" while our hearts are with ms. Dugard, the law is not, \" judge john owens wrote after a three-member panel of the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco ruled 2-1 against dugard, who was appealing an earlier ruling. \" phillip garrido, a parolee with a terrible history of drug-fueled sexual violence, committed unspeakable crimes against jaycee dugard for 18 years, \" owens wrote. \" state and federal authorities missed many opportunities to stop these tragic events. \" the court noted that a federal parole officer failed to report no fewer 70 drug-related parole violations, despite being aware that garrido was known to become sexually violent while on drugs, the los angeles times reports. But because courts have limited the liability of the federal government for incompetent parole officers, dugard still can't sue, the court ruled. In 2010, california settled with dugard for $ 20 million. ( parole officers once actually spoke to dugard while she was still a captive at garrido's california home. )",

        "summary": "Hostilities only seem to be escalating as the israeli offensive against gaza enters a fourth day. Early this morning, a rocket from gaza ignited a tanker at a gas station in southern israel, injuring three people in the most serious hit on israel so far. For the first time in this offensive, rockets from southern lebanon were fired at israel today as well, the ap reports. An israeli military spokesman says israel fired about 25 artillery shells in response. At least 550 rockets have been fired from gaza this week, though israel says its iron dome defense system has stopped about a quarter of them. In other developments: president obama says the us is ready to broker a cease-fire between israel and hamas, reports the bbc. The white house says that in a call to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, obama \" expressed concern about the risk of further escalation and emphasized the need for all sides to do everything they can to protect the lives of civilians and restore calm. \" france and russia also made cease-fire pleas, and the state department says john kerry has urged egyptian leaders to help calm the situation. A kerry spokeswoman says \" nobody wants to see a ground invasion, \" but some 20,000 israeli reservists have been mobilized and israeli leaders have hinted that the first ground assault on gaza since 2009 could be imminent. \" so far the battle is progressing as planned, but we can expect further stages in future, \" netanyahu said. \" up to now, we have hit hamas and the terror organizations hard and as the battle continues we will increase strikes at them. \" in gaza, which has been hit by more than 1,100 strikes, medical officials say at least 70 civilians, including children, are among at least 95 people killed since the offensive began, reuters reports. Hamas says most of the casualties have been in at least 200 houses israel has bombed this week. As rockets and missiles fly, questions are being raised about israel's actions in the weeks after the kidnapping of three israeli teenagers, who were later found dead, the new york times finds. It has emerged that israel's security services banned the media from reporting that gunshots had been heard on a distress call made by one of the kidnapped teens, and some israeli commentators accuse authorities of giving the public false hope the teens were alive in a calculated effort to build support for its crackdown on hamas.",

            "New york, new york -- hillary clinton unveiled her vision for the economy monday, placing her focus squarely on boosting the middle class through a three-part plan to create jobs, reduce income inequality and hold financial institutions more accountable. \" previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead, \" she said in a speech at the new school, a progressive university in new york city. \" but over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again. \" clinton, in the first major economic policy speech of her campaign, proposed expanding the workforce, especially for women, through both private and public investments, better benefits and lower healthcare costs for workers, and a reformed, more balanced tax code. Her goal, she said, was to create more \" pathways \" into the middle class. \" the defining challenge of our time is clear, \" she said. \" we must raise incomes for hard working americans so they can afford a middle class life. \" clinton drew a stark comparison with her counterparts on the republican side of the race. She took aim first at jeb bush, who clinton pounced on last week for saying that \" people need to work longer hours \" in an interview with the new hampshire union leader. \" let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night, \" she said. \" they do not need a lecture, they need a raise. \" but bush was not talking about the work ethic of americans. In a press conference with reporters after a town hall in hudson, new hampshire, he said that his words had been \" taken out of context \" and that he was referring to the need for people to have the opportunity for full-time work. \" if we're going to grow the economy people need to stop being part-time workers, they need to have access to greater opportunities to work, \" bush said.

Democrat phillip puckett will step down effective immediately — and be swiftly appointed to the state tobacco commission, which is controlled by republicans, the washington post reports. The move will also allow his daughter to be appointed to a permanent judgeship. \" it's astounding to me, \" one democrat said. \" they figure the only way they could win was to give a job to a state senator. \" mcauliffe blasted the move, saying he was \" deeply disappointed \" by \" the uncertainty \" it created, but vowed to press on in the senate. Virginia's long battle over medicaid expansion is coming to a head because of a looming budget deadline, and could lead to virginia's first government shutdown, vox explains. The republican-controlled house is firmly opposed, but democrats held narrow control of the senate — until now. Puckett's resignation will give republicans a 20-19 edge in the chamber, though three moderate republicans do support expansion. Republicans issued a statement praising puckett's decision to resign. The chair of the tobacco commission said it hadn't bribed puckett to resign with the job offer, but was eager to hire him now that he was free.",

        "summary": "The murder of a nun shook baltimore in 1969. Sister catherine ann cesnik disappeared in november of that year before her body turned up in a field in january with blunt force trauma to the head. The murder remains unsolved, though a seven-part netflix documentary series out friday points the finger at rev. A. Joseph maskell, a counselor and chaplain at a high school where cesnik taught. Some say he killed the 26-year-old after students told her about sexual abuse they'd suffered at maskell's hands, reports the baltimore sun. Baltimore police have also explored this theory: on feb. 28, maskell's body was exhumed ( he died in 2001 ) to see if his dna matched a sample from the crime scene, per cnn. On wednesday, police said it did not. That doesn't mean maskell wasn't involved, only that current forensic technology can't provide a link, says a police rep. But cesnik's former students hope netflix's the keepers will lead to tips, and ultimately a resolution. The series explores the power of the catholic church at the time, particularly over police, but centers on jean wehner, who claimed in 1994 that maskell showed her cesnik's body before it was officially discovered. By that time, maskell had resigned and fled to ireland as abuse allegations against him mounted, per the sun. He was never charged with abuse, though the catholic archdiocese of baltimore eventually paid $ 472,000 to 16 victims. Before his death, maskell denied the abuse and any involvement in cesnik's murder. ( a 1970 murder case was just reopened. )",

In his third and final scheduled criminal sentencing, eaton county circuit court judge janice cunningham handed down nassar's sentence after hearing two full days of victim impact statements, many of whom spoke publicly for the first time last week. She said she doesn't have confidence nassar truly understands the devastation of the abuse he inflicted and the emotional and physical pain he's caused the women he abused. \" clearly you're in denial, \" cunningham told nassar. \" you don't get it, and i do not believe there's a likelihood that you could be reformed. \" nassar's eaton county sentence will run concurrently with the 40-175 years he was sentenced to on similar charges in",

        "summary": "A wooden boat carrying migrants from the turkish town of ayvacik to the greek island of lesbos hit rocks at the start of its perilous journey, but it kept going. That turned out to be a fatal mistake, as the boat sank wednesday, killing 14, including seven children holed up in the boat's cabin, per officials and reports cited by the ap. \" the boat took a hit, it began to take in water, but nevertheless continued on its route, \" the turkish regional governor told the state-run anadolu agency. \" when it took in more water they tried to return, but the boat sank before they could make it back to shore. \" the turkish coast guard managed to rescue 27 others, and divers and fishermen are continuing to search the waters for other potential victims, the ap notes. The nationalities of the migrants aren't yet known. Another four migrants died when a second boat sank off the coast of izmir, with 22 rescued, afp notes. At the end of october, the save the children charity noted more than 70 children had perished since early september trying to flee to greece ( the ap notes that number has now surpassed 80 ). After word of the ayvacik sinking got out, turkish president recep tayyip erdogan implored western nations to help with the refugee crisis, saying, \" should there be another aylan for the world to take notice? \" aylan, of course, is the syrian toddler who made headlines when his body washed up on a turkish beach at the end of the summer. Eu and african leaders are set to meet in malta wednesday to discuss the migrant crisis, and world leaders will be gathering sunday for the g20 summit in turkey, where the migrant issue is expected to be broached, reuters notes.
