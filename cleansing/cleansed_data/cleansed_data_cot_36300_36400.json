        "summary": "The roman catholic church has an \" enormous problem, \" pope francis told german newspaper die zeit in an interview published thursday: a dearth of clergy. To solve that issue, cnn reports, the pontiff is considering tapping into \" viri probati \" — \" tested men, \" or married ones. What francis is mulling would allow men who've already said their \" i do's \" to be ordained, though priests already of the cloth wouldn't get to walk down the aisle. As it stands now, the only priests in the catholic church who can wear wedding rings are already married protestant priests who convert to catholicism, as well as eastern rite priests who become ordained after marriage. The ap notes that the viri probati concept has received renewed interest under the argentinian-born pope, as he understands the struggles of countries like brazil, which has a huge catholic demographic but very few priests. What's got some irritated about the clergy shortage and the solutions being bandied about: that women aren't being considered in the mix. Per catholic news service, while francis did note he has oked a commission to research the role of women deacons early in the church's history, he clarified that was more for theological study purposes, \" not to open a door. \" that lines up with statements the pontiff made late last year in which he conceded women did \" many other things better than men, \" but would still likely never be priests, per the guardian. Also broached in the pope's die zeit interview, per the ap: his thoughts on populism popping up in more democratic societies of late ( it's \" evil \" and \" ends badly, as the past century showed \" ) and whether he ever harbored his own uncertainties about god. \" i, too, know moments of emptiness, \" he said.",

But lead is different, and a cache of hundreds of ancient sling bullets was readily detected thanks to specialized metal detectors in burnswark hill in southern scotland. Their discovery tells the story of what may be among the first battles of the roman invasion of scotland ( then called caledonia ) around ad140, reports the bbc. It's a big break for battlefield archaeologists who have been trying for centuries to sort out the precise role burnswark hill played in rome's attempted occupation of the area 1,800 years ago. And it seems the romans staged a huge show of force to overtake an outnumbered enemy guarding a fort. The excavations turned up the largest cache of roman sling bullets ever found, from small ones drilled with holes that would have made terrifying whistling sounds to much larger lemon-shaped ones that were \" very lethal, \" one archaeologist tells live science. Researchers estimate that there were 5,000 roman soldiers spread across two army camps and as many as 2,000 armed defenders. The ensuing violence was likely \" exemplary, \" an \" opening event \" meant to terrorize caledonian tribes as romans tried to push north of hadrian's wall, which was the upper border of the roman empire.

The company believes the wreck 160 miles off the south carolina coast still holds $ 86 million in gold — as well as the bodies of 425 passengers and crew who went down with the ship. And odyssey arrived at the site this week with an 8-ton remotely operated vehicle that will dive to the ocean floor. \" the ss central america is one of the greatest shipwreck stories of all time, \" odyssey's ceo said in a statement. \" we're very familiar with mid-19th century paddlewheel shipwrecks, as well as the range of artifacts that are likely to be on the site. \" skeptics, however, suspect the firm will come up empty-handed — unless rumors of a secret cache of military gold on board are true. \" the only way it is a home run project is if they found this secret army gold, \" an investor who is selling odyssey stock short tells bloomberg. \" otherwise, they are literally picking coins out of the skeletons of 425 dead passengers. \" ( odyssey managed to make a major discovery in 2013 involving silver bullion. )",

        "summary": "Apple says its latest iphone has an encryption system that will keep users ' emails and photos safe from the prying eyes of the nsa or any law-enforcement agency, reports the new york times. The company says its algorithm is so complex that if it ever had to turn over data from an iphone 6, it would take the nsa about five years to decode it. Even if apple is underestimating the nsa's abilities, the principle isn't sitting well with fbi chief james comey. \"what concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law, \" he says. Comey cited the example of a kidnapping in which parents come to him \" with tears in their eyes \" and say, \" ' what do you mean you can't? ' \" the times report also quotes security officials who predict terrorists will quickly embrace such technology, along with a tech expert who says law-enforcement concerns are being exaggerated. In an earlier piece on the encryption by matthew green at slate, green says apple isn't picking a fight with the government. \" apple is not designing systems to prevent law enforcement from executing legitimate warrants, \" he writes. \" it's building systems that prevent everyone who might want your data — including hackers, malicious insiders, and even hostile foreign governments — from accessing your phone. \" what's more, \" apple is setting a precedent that users, and not companies, should hold the keys to their own devices. \" google has similar protection available for android phones, though the encryption is not currently a default option. That will change with new androids out in october. ( in other iphone 6 news, apple said last week it's received only nine complaints about phones bending. )",

The national security agency and the nation's law enforcement agencies have a different concern: that the smartphone is the first of a post-snowden generation of equipment that will disrupt their investigative abilities. The phone encrypts emails, photos and contacts based on a complex mathematical algorithm that uses a code created by, and unique to, the phone's user — and that apple says it will not possess. The result, the company is essentially saying, is that if apple is sent a court order demanding that the contents of an iphone 6 be provided to intelligence agencies or law enforcement, it will turn over gibberish, along with a note saying that to decode the phone's emails, contacts and photos, investigators will have to break the code or get the code from the phone's owner. Breaking the code, according to an apple technical guide, could take \"more than 5 1/2 years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers. \" ( computer security experts question that figure, because apple does not fully realize how quickly the n.s.a.

Writing in the washington post on sept. 19, orin kerr referred to apple's new policy as a \"dangerous game, \" one that \"doesn't stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents \" but \"only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants. \" while kerr has moderated his views since his initial post, his overarching concern remains the same: by placing customer interests before that of law enforcement, apple is working against the public interest.

        "summary": "With the push to repeal obamacare all but dead for now, president trump and republicans are moving on to their next big initiative: reform of the tax code. Trump and the gop are releasing the broad strokes of their plan wednesday, and the president will try to rally support for it during a speech in indiana by pitching it as a tax cut for the middle class, as well as for businesses. The washington post obtained a blueprint of the plan, which leaves much up in the air, including which tax benefits to ditch in order to make up an estimated revenue shortfall of $ 5 trillion over 10 years. Some highlights: corporations: the new york times reports that the plan calls for a steep reduction in the tax rate paid by corporations from 35 % to 20 %, which trump sees as vital to stimulating the economy. Standard deduction: this would roughly double to $ 12,000 for individuals and $ 24,000 for married couples, \" meaning trump can accurately argue that many more low income earners would pay no tax under his plan, \" writes jonathan swan at axios. But: the fine print: the savings in the larger deduction isn't quite as big as it appears, notes business insider, pointing to the fine print: \" to simplify the tax rules, the additional standard deduction and the personal exemptions for taxpayer and spouse are consolidated into this larger standard deduction. \" for example, a single person with no dependents currently takes the standard deduction of $ 6,350, plus one personal exemption of $ 4,050. The new plan replaces that with a single deduction of $ 12,000, or a 15 % increase. Wealthiest: though initial plans called for a reduction in the top rate paid by the wealthiest individuals ( those who make more than $ 418,000 ) from 39.6 % to 35 %, politico reports that this is \" now open to negotiation. \" that's partly because trump wants to make sure democrats are on board, reports cnn. Another idea being floated is to impose some kind of tax surcharge on the wealthiest americans. The plan also calls for the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative-minimum tax. Lowest rate: it would reportedly rise from 10 % to 12 %, though the increase for low-income americans would likely be offset by the bigger standard deduction. Simplification: the current system has seven brackets ranging from 10 % to 39.6 %. Trump wants to reduce the number of brackets to three, perhaps from 12 % to 35 %, reports the hill. ( income levels for each have not been determined, and it's possible a fourth bracket would be added",

Police say denaro, 53, would communicate with the men, aged 27 to 77, through scraps of paper wrapped in tape and hidden under a rock at a farm in western sicily. Mobsters were alerted to new messages by former boss and sheep farmer vito gondola who would mention agriculture-related codewords like \" pigs, \" \" beans, \" and \" fertilizer, \" as well as phrases like \" the sheep need shearing, \" \" the shears need sharpening, \" and \" the hay is ready, \" reports the mirror. One message said, \" i've put the ricotta cheese aside for you, will you come by later? \" the telegraph reports the scraps of paper contained instructions for denaro's henchmen as well as personal messages for his female flames. Cameras and microphones hidden around the farm recorded the men, who read the messages, then destroyed them, police say. They reportedly had 15 days to respond. Gondola was also recorded telling a mobster that denaro is losing power as criminals \" disappear without saying anything. \" the cosa nostra syndicate was considered the most powerful in italy in the 1980s and ' 90s but has since fallen from grace as its members are rounded up by authorities. Those nabbed today are \" closest to denaro right now, \" a police official tells the afp, noting it's \" too early to say \" if the arrests will lead police to denaro.",

Included in the business restructuring is a shift away from sedans, which haven't been selling well, and toward suvs, pickup trucks, electric cars, and hybrids. At the top of the discontinuation list, per fortune and cnn, is the chevy volt, a plug-in electric hybrid sedan that has seen lagging sales of late. Five other sedans that, like the volt, will cease production by the end of next year: the chevy cruze, a gm best-seller that was once the subject of a press release entirely in emoji; the chevy impala, among gm's worst sellers, despite being a consumer reports top pick; the cadillac ct6, which cnn calls \" the only surprise of the bunch, \" as it \" serves as the tech halo for cadillac \" ( though it's the caddy that sells the least ); the cadillac xts, a four-door sedan typically sold to taxi and limo firms; and the buick lacrosse, launched in 2004.

Such an exemption from the obamacare mandate was only scheduled to last a year, but will now last two, the journal explains.

        "summary": "Amazon has narrowed the list of cities vying for its second headquarters to 20, and the new york times reports on an interesting part of the competition: the cities'top-secret bids are often top-secret even to officials of those very cities. In indianapolis, for example, a city council member says he has been told \" absolutely nothing \" about the financial incentives offered to amazon in the \" hq2 \" hunt. One big reason is that the bids were often put together by public-private development groups affiliated with the local chamber of commerce, and those groups aren't required to make them public under freedom-of-information laws. However, that raises the prospect that taxpayers of the eventual winning city might end up paying a steeper-than-expected price in exchange for the jobs and economic jolt promised by amazon. Not all the cities are being completely secretive. Newark, new jersey, for example has outlined a $ 7 billion package of tax credits and other incentives to lure the behemoth. But others don't want to tip their hands, and amazon apparently likes it that way. \"i don't know what we offered amazon in terms of financial incentives, but i believe amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them, \" says an austin city council member. No word on when the winner will be announced, but another winnowing of the finalists is expected soon. At fast company, one writer thinks it would be better for everyone if amazon opened several smaller headquarters, while another at forbes wonders if a public job posting suggests that dc has an edge.

            "As the world eagerly anticipates an announcement about the location of amazon's $ 5 billion second headquarters, experts are narrowing down the list of 20 finalists based on a number of factors: which city has the best public transportation? the best housing market? where is tech talent strongest? and could amazon's job posting for an economic development manager hint at plans for hq2? here's a rundown of some of the more popular factors being discussed and how the finalists stack up in each department. Public transportation just last week, amazon announced plans for a $ 1.5 million investment in bus infrastructure in seattle, the location of its first headquarters. In total, it has spent $ 60 million on seattle's public transportation. Experts believe that this signals that public transportation could be a factor when determining which city is chosen for hq2. \"we will provide faster, more reliable transit service on some of our most popular routes, thanks to our partnerships with amazon and the city of seattle, \" king county executive dow constantine said in a press release. \"demand for transit continues to grow throughout our region, and we are stepping up to deliver. \" inc. Recently made an argument that this move, along with details from the original rfp, could mean that public transportation is a top priority for the second headquarters. \"according to amazon's rfp, there are a few things the ecommerce giant really wants for its new home, besides an appropriate building site. These include: a population center no more than 30 miles away, an international airport no more than about 45 minutes away, one or more major highways or 'arterial roads ' no more than 1 to 2 miles away",
            "Jared evans, a member of the indianapolis city-county council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of amazon. He does, however, have one small question: what financial incentives did his city dangle in front of amazon? \"what have i been told? \" mr. Evans said. \"absolutely nothing. \" across the country, the search for hq2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can't find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it. \"the only time the public may become aware if the city has promised amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed, \" mr. Evans said."

Experts believe that this signals that public transportation could be a factor when determining which city is chosen for hq2. \"we will provide faster, more reliable transit service on some of our most popular routes, thanks to our partnerships with amazon and the city of seattle, \" king county executive dow constantine said in a press release. \"demand for transit continues to grow throughout our region, and we are stepping up to deliver. \" inc. Recently made an argument that this move, along with details from the original rfp, could mean that public transportation is a top priority for the second headquarters. \"according to amazon's rfp, there are a few things the ecommerce giant really wants for its new home, besides an appropriate building site. These include: a population center no more than 30 miles away, an international airport no more than about 45 minutes away, one or more major highways or 'arterial roads ' no more than 1 to 2 miles away",
            "Jared evans, a member of the indianapolis city-county council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of amazon. He does, however, have one small question: what financial incentives did his city dangle in front of amazon? \"what have i been told? \" mr. Evans said. \"absolutely nothing. \" across the country, the search for hq2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can't find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it. \"the only time the public may become aware if the city has promised amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed, \" mr. Evans said."

The quest to diagnose them is getting a big boost from the national institutes of health, which yesterday announced the creation of a an \" undiagnosed diseases network. \" essentially, nih is handing a total of $ 43 million in grants to six centers: at duke, stanford, baylor, vanderbilt, baylor, and boston children's hospital/brigham and women's hospital/massachusetts general hospital. The hope is that within three years, each center will see 50 patients annually — testing their genetic codes and comparing notes on the findings, nbc news reports. Patients will be directed to the various centers via a coordinating center at harvard, which will also make sure that relevant data is shared across centers, reports the boston globe. The nih explains that the network builds on a 6-year-old program at the nih clinical center in bethesda, md.; but that program has only been able to study about 20 % of the 3,000 people who have applied to it, per the globe. Their disorders are often caused by extremely rare genetic mutations, and genetic sequencing has unraveled some of the mystery. Researchers have already found the genomic foundation for 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but 3,000 more remain, the director of one of the nih institutes explains. The globe puts the current odds of finding the root of a rare disease at about 25 % — a stat that could be boosted as the six centers use the most cutting-edge technology.",

        "summary": "Alexander hamilton was many things — a bastard from the caribbean, the founder of the bank of new york, the father of the us coast guard, and the first secretary of the treasury, to name a few. But the man who died in a duel against aaron burr at the age of 49 was never president of the united states. And yet most americans think he was, researchers at washington university in st. Louis report in the journal psychological science. \" about 71 % of americans [ in our survey ] are fairly certain that alexander hamilton is among our nation's past presidents, \" one researcher says. \" their confidence in hamilton having been president is fairly high — higher than for six or so actual presidents. \" the 326 participants were given a list of 41 actual presidents alongside 82 \" lures \" and told to pick out the presidents and say how certain they were of each answer. The majority mistakenly thought benjamin franklin was a us president, as well as thomas moore, of whom there are several in us history but none particularly famous and none who served higher than in the us house of representatives. On the flip side, presidents franklin pierce and chester arthur didn't hit the 60 % -recognition mark. Previous research shows that americans can recall about half the us presidents, but this latest survey illustrates how famous names such as franklin, hubert humphrey, and john calhoun can lead to false positives where people know the name is an important piece of american history but not necessarily how. The researchers note they conducted their survey two months before hamilton debuted on broadway. ( see what it's like to follow franklin's daily schedule. )",

The nfl isn't commenting on particulars, and a rep would say only that its commitment is only \" to put on the best possible show. \" though the journal notes that the idea met a \" chilly reception, \" it's an interesting gambit: last year's show hauled in 115.3 million viewers, and artists such as bruno mars and beyonce have successfully used their performances as a springboard for concert tours — often putting tickets on sale virtually as the curtain goes down. Cd and mp3 sales often see a boost, as well, though it's tough to gauge exactly what that windfall might be. As for who might be inclined to cough up, the verge notes that all three acts are well-established cash cows and don't need the exposure the way an up-and-comer might.

Sister helen prejean, who developed a close relationship with louisiana death row inmate patrick sonnier before his execution in 1984, is one of two witnesses left to testify for the defense, though federal prosecutors plan to file a motion to bar her from taking the stand, nbc news reports. With prejean in mind, talk has already turned to where tsarnaev would end up should he get life in prison. Nbc news reports tsarnaev is likely to spend the rest of his life at colorado's supermax — described in a recent lawsuit — if the jury rules against the death penalty. There, under special conditions, he could get two 15-minute phone calls per month and visits from parents and siblings only, according a former warden of a death-row prison in indiana. Testifying for the defense, he argued tsarnaev would be shut out from the rest of the world at the prison, where inmates spend about 23 hours a day in isolation, the christian science monitor reports. Tsarnaev's lawyers are suggesting such a fate is nearly on par with execution. Attempting to bolster their case for the death penalty, prosecutors noted inmates are subject to special administrative measures which can be renewed annually, challenged by inmates, and are often lifted via a \" step-down process, \" a prosecutor said. The prosecution also took issue with the defense's aerial photo of the prison covered in snow, which made it look like it was \" an extremely forlorn, forbidding institution, \" per the boston globe. Prosecutors aruge there's no guarantee tsarnaev will end up at the supermax, or that he won't be moved from it in the future.",

George zimmerman was arrested monday after he cocked and pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend, shattered a glass-top table, then pushed her out of the house and barricaded himself inside after she ordered him to move out, according to the seminole county sheriff's office. He surrendered peacefully a few minutes later and was hauled off to jail, where he was being held without bail on domestic-violence and aggravated-assault charges. It was the second time in three months that the former neighborhood watch volunteer, who was acquitted of murdering 17-year-old trayvon martin, was handcuffed after being accused of domestic violence and threatening a woman with a gun. In a september blowup with his estranged wife, police filed no charges. This time, authorities did not buy his story, one that he quickly got into public circulation. While deputies were outside, banging on the door, trying to get him to come out, zimmerman called 911 and blamed monday's dispute on his girlfriend, 27-year-old samantha scheibe, whom he said had \" gone crazy on me. \" the couple had been living together in the home she rented on topfield court near apopka since august, said seminole county chief deputy dennis lemma. Scheibe was pregnant, zimmerman told the",
            "George zimmerman was granted a bond amount of $ 9,000 tuesday, a day after he was arrested on a felony charge of aggravated assault. A judge ordered that zimmerman avoid contact with the alleged victim and to stay away from weapons. He was also ordered to wear a gps tracking device, and he is not allowed to travel outside of florida. Zimmerman faces a felony charge of aggravated assault following his arrest at the home where he lives with his girlfriend in apopka. Zimmerman was acquitted of criminal charges in the fatal shooting of trayvon martin earlier this year. Channel 9 learned zimmerman's girlfriend told authorities he broke a table and pointed a long-barreled shotgun at her during a verbal dispute at her home on topfield court. \" i ' m doing this again? you just broke my glass table, you just broke my sunglasses, and you put your gun in my friggin ' face and told me to get the f --- out, this is not your house, \" samantha scheibe can be heard saying on a 911 call. Scheibe claims she told zimmerman to leave the home she rents, and that he's been living in since august. On top of the felony assault charge, zimmerman also faces battery and criminal mischief charges, according chief deputy dennis lemma of the seminole county sheriff's office."

        "summary": "The fcc is unveiling its proposal for new rules to govern internet traffic today, in a heated hearing that promises to be the next big battle in the war over net neutrali- wait, come back! as mashable sagely notes, the words \" net neutrality \" scare a lot of people, so let's break down exactly what's at stake here: what is net neutrality?: it's the principle that internet providers can't treat traffic from any given source different from another. Basically, it stops netflix or the huffington post from paying to load faster than a new startup's site. Activists worry that if sites could pay to play faster, the internet would become a gated, cable tv-esque business. Do we have it now?: we used to, but a court struck down the fcc regulation mandating it. What's happening today?: the fcc officially rolls out and begins debate on a replacement rule that initial reports indicated would essentially end the concept of net neutrality, allowing \" commercially reasonable \" deals to speed up traffic. No one is sure what \" commercially reasonable \" means. So net neutrality is dead?: not necessarily. In response to a massive backlash, fcc chair tom wheeler promised that he would revise the rules, and even accept comments on whether isps should be regulated like utilities, the wall street journal reports. Who's on what side?: some of the biggest names in tech — think google, netflix, and microsoft — are making a loud stink about the rules, arguing in favor of net neutrality. Cable giants like comcast have long pushed against neutrality. There has also been a small camp of pro-neutrality protesters \" occupying \" the fcc since last wednesday, pc world reports. How will the fcc vote?: it's unclear, but some commissioners have expressed support for net neutrality as a concept. Abc news saw one commissioner talking with protesters yesterday. \" i want you to know i share your passion, \" she assured them, encouraging them to get involved with the process that begins today. Protesters say fcc staffers have been \" giving us high fives. \"",

It's basically a combination of shark tank, the reality show in which would-be entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to business titans for possible investment, and basically any reality competition show you've ever seen. Developers pitch ideas for apps to four judges: musician will.i.am ( who also judges on the voice in the uk ), actresses jessica alba and gwyneth paltrow ( who both started their own lifestyle brands ), and vaynermedia founder gary vaynerchuk. In a twist on the classic elevator speech, competitors will have 60 seconds, while coming down an escalator, to give their pitch in an attempt to get one or more judges to agree to act as their adviser. Competitors then get to consult with experts from companies including yelp and uber as they work on their apps. In the end, they pitch again, this time to reps from a venture capital firm; if the firm agrees to fund an app, it ends up featured on apple's app store. The trailer for the show, which attempts to make app developers seem like today's \" rock stars, \" is getting panned by some who say it glosses over just how difficult it really is to be an app developer these days, cnbc reports, and business insider notes that even apple fans and employees are saying the show looks \" cringe-worthy. \" one apple app developer went so far as to say, \" today, i am ashamed to work for apple.

But the relaxing escape soon turned into a nightmare when the mother of three became separated from her mates. Cassady told police he last saw fraser, 30, in a nearby gazebo but returned minutes later to find it empty, the brisbane times reports. Divers searched the swimming hole, officers combed the bush, and helicopters kept watch overhead, but fraser was nowhere to be found — until yesterday. She surprised a banana farmer at breakfast when she stumbled out of the bush, 35 pounds lighter than when she entered it and just 30 yards from where she was last seen, abc news reports. She apparently followed colored markers left for her by search teams; an official noted that her location had \" gone out of what we could reasonably expect [ of ] a person who is lost in those circumstances. \" as for her condition, \" her whole body is scarred and peeling, \" cassady tells the bbc, which reports fraser survived on creek water, small fish, and insects. She ' ll undergo surgery today to have stones and splinters removed from her feet. She also has infected cuts and a sunburn so severe she sat in a creek for three days to soothe it, says her mother. Now that the ordeal — which she told family included being chased by a 6-foot freshwater crocodile — is over, it looks like a wedding is on the way. Abc news reports fraser proposed to cassady just two days before she vanished. Over the course of 17 days, \" i could always feel it in my heart that she was alive, \" he says. \" there was no way she was gone. \"",

        "summary": "\" drop that plate right now \" was the command hurled at 90-year-old arnold abbott on sunday before he was charged with violating florida law. His crime: feeding fort lauderdale's homeless. Abbott and two pastors, dwayne black and mark sims, were cited for disobeying a new city ordinance that effectively bans public food sharing, which could lead to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine for each, local 10 reports. Abbott, who runs the nonprofit love thy neighbor and has been feeding the homeless for more than 20 years, had served up just a handful of meals in stranahan park when he was stopped, the sun-sentinel reports. \" i ' m going to have to go to court again and sue the city of fort lauderdale, \" he tells local 10. \" these are the poorest of the poor, they have nothing.... How do you turn them away? \" by \" go to court again, \" abbott refers to a 1999 lawsuit — which he won — that he brought against the city for the exact same reason. The new ordinance puts more stringent restrictions on how the homeless can be fed — for instance, food providers must offer toilet facilities, something abbott can't manage, fox news reports. Vocal supporters for the law include mayor jack seiler, who tells the sun-sentinel, \" i ' m not satisfied with having a cycle of homeless in [ the ] city of fort lauderdale. Providing them with a meal and keeping them in that cycle on the street is not productive. \" cal deal, a retired journalist who records homeless people around town, agrees. \" the people feeding them are enablers, \" he tells the new times broward-palm beach. \" hunger is a big motivator. Are people more likely to seek help when they're hungry or when they're fed and happy? \" rev. Black acknowledges the city's homeless problem but tells the sun-sentinel, \" let's just feed them and then deal with other issues. \" ( in houston, a homeless veteran got ticketed for looking for food in the trash. )",

It also explains the estimated yield ( meaning how much energy is released in an explosion ) was 100 kilotons, versus the yields of the atomic bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki, which were 15 and 21 kilotons, respectively. Per the bbc, the \" largest man-made explosion ever on earth \" was the soviet union's tsar bomba in 1961, at \" the height of the nuclear arms race. \" deutsche welle explains the differences between the hydrogen bomb pyongyang claims it tested and the weaker atomic bomb: it really comes down to the \" detonation process. \" trump responded to news of the test by criticizing south korea on twitter, writing \" their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work, they only understand one thing! \" the new york times calls it a \" notably harsh line \"... Amid an escalating dispute over trade that threatens to weaken a central partnership in the region. \" more on trump's debate over whether to withdraw from a major trade deal with the south here. The hill notes the perspective of a state department official under bush: \" this is no time to lecture south korea or suspend free trade agreement. Best way to deter north korea is to stand firmly with seoul+tokyo. \" texas sen. Ted cruz appeared on abc news'the week sunday morning and was asked what he thought of trump's handling of the situation. \" the president speaks in ways that i wouldn't speak, but that is his prerogative. I do think it helps for north korea and for china to understand that we have a president who is strong.",

        "summary": "The supreme court was unanimous today in a decision that will allow an arkansas inmate to grow a half-inch beard. The state's rule specified that beard length must be kept to a quarter inch; gregory holt, a muslim man also known as abdul maalik muhammad, had sought permission to grow the slightly longer beard in a compromise: he believes his faith demands a full beard, but was willing to accept the half-inch length in keeping with what california prison policy afford muslim inmates there. In what nbc news terms a \" handwritten plea, \" he noted that arkansas'restriction put inmates in a catch-22: grow the full beard he sees as required by his religion and be disciplined, or give in and violate his faith. Arkansas argued that contraband smuggling would become a concern with the longer beard. Wrote justice samuel alito in the opinion, that \" argument... Is hard to take seriously. An item of contraband would have to be very small indeed to be concealed by \" such a beard, and the inmate would have to devise a way to keep the item in there to boot. Further, \" since the department does not demand that inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is hard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband in a half-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his head. \" the ap notes that more than 40 states allow inmates to keep beards, and nbc frames arkansas as \" virtually alone in having such a restrictive rule. \" holt has previously served time for threatening president bush's daughters; he's now serving a life sentence for a brutal assault on his girlfriend.",

            "A unanimous supreme court ruling has invalidated an arkansas state prison rule that barred inmates from growing beards measuring more than a quarter of an inch long. The rule had been challenged by inmate gregory holt, a muslim man who had asked for permission to grow a half-inch-long beard as a compromise from the full beard he believes is required by his faith. In a ruling announced tuesday, the supreme court said the policy violated holt's religious beliefs. Arkansas was virtually alone in having such a restrictive rule on beards. Holt — who is also known as abdul maalik muhammad — had argued in a handwritten plea to the court that the state's refusal to grant exceptions was oppressive and forced inmates \" to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand, or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce \" to the grooming policy. The supreme court had earlier granted holt's request to maintain a half-inch long beard while his case worked its way through the appeals process. Holt, who did time for making a threat against president bush's daughters before being convicted in 2010 of knifing his girlfriend, was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. The opinion, written by justice samuel alito, said the state has a legitimate need to prevent the concealment of contraband, which was its stated reason for the policy. But, alito said, \" the argument that this interest would be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to grow a 1⁄2-inch beard is hard to take seriously. \" \" an item of contraband would have to be very small indeed to be concealed by a 1⁄2-inch beard, and a prisoner seeking to hide an item in such a short beard would have to find a way to prevent the item from falling out. Since the department does not demand that inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is hard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband in a 1⁄2-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his head, \" alito said."

Gill, 85, was devastated, telling the washington post, \" they say you get over things, but when i think of her, i start crying. I don't think i ' ll ever get over that. \" now, gill is the sole caregiver to his adult grandsons, both of whom have special needs. \" i've got my hands full trying to work and take care of them, too, he tells the lexington herald-leader. After della gill died, wendall gill was back working at the mcdonald's. Michael todd oldfield, who met gill in 1978 when he worked at the restaurant as a teen, walked in and asked how he was doing. \" he began telling me this story, and he couldn't go 30 seconds without welling up, \" oldfield tells the post. \" i was torn up \" by gill's story, he says, and decided to do something to ease gill's burden. The result was a gofundme page headlined \" wendall needs us to serve him now! \" as of this writing, more than $ 76,000 has been raised. The money is intended to pay off gill's two vehicles, as well as cover his mortgage and other bills. And now that his wife is gone, gill will need to take time off of work to take his grandsons to doctor appointments. Of his older grandson, who is 33, gill tells the post, \" he ' ll kind of cry a little every now and then and say, ' i miss granny.

        "summary": "Dig if you will the picture: two people engaged in a kiss. Prince sang about \" curious poses, \" but new research suggests that most of us may strike similar poses, leaning to the right instead of the left when kissing the lips of our partners. Researchers at the university of bath and in bangladesh report in the journal scientific reports that more than two-thirds of so-called kiss \" initiators \" and kiss \" recipients \" in their study leaned their heads to the right, with a person's handedness predicting which way the initiator went. That didn't hold for the recipients, however, who preferred to match the direction of the head leaning toward them and avoid what was described as discomfort when heads were mirrored. For this study, researchers looked at 48 married couples in bangladesh, where kissing is rarely done in public or on screen, who reported on kissing in the privacy of their own homes. The findings are similar to those found in previous studies in western countries, where kissing is often more public — suggesting the reason may be innate instead of cultural. The results suggest that kissing is determined by how the brain assigns tasks to its left and right hemispheres, with certain tasks playing out in the left, more emotion-based half of the brain, reports the guardian. Hormone levels like testosterone may be unevenly distributed as well, spurring a right-leaning bias. Phys.org notes that men initiate kisses 15 times more frequently than women, and that this tendency to lean to the right could have wider implications for cognitive science and neuroscience.

That's because researchers are studying a \" mood-stabilizing \" drug that enables an adult brain to take in new information as it did during early childhood. The drug \" restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state, \" says takao hensch, co-author of a new study on the subject. Hensch tested the enzyme-inhibitor on several young men who had received no musical training in childhood. They made efforts to train their ears, and after two weeks did far better on pitch tests than those who had taken a placebo, raw story reports. So what's the big deal? \" there are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch, \" hensch says. In fact, the drug could rewire \" otherwise firmly established pathways in the brain, \" according to the study. So you could learn new languages fairly easily, for example — but hensch calls it \" a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly. \"",

However, research has shown that histone-deacetylase inhibitors ( hdac inhibitors ) enable adult mice to establish perceptual preferences that are otherwise impossible to acquire after youth. In humans, we found that adult men who took valproate ( vpa ) ( a hdac inhibitor ) learned to identify pitch significantly better than those taking placebo — evidence that vpa facilitated critical-period learning in the adult human brain. Importantly, this result was not due to a general change in cognitive function, but rather a specific effect on a sensory task associated with a critical-period.

The company, which is losing us market share to rivals such as shake shack and five guys, said don thompson would step down as mcdonald's president and chief executive on 1 march. Mcdonald's sales slump: what's on the menu for the new boss? read more he will be replaced by briton steve easterbrook, the company's chief brand officer and former boss of mcdonald's in the uk and northern europe. Thompson, who became chief executive in 2012, had worked at mcdonald's since 1990 when he joined as engineer. He was axed following pressure from investors frustrated at the company's poor performance. Last week mcdonald's reported a 15 % fall in annual profits to $ 4.7bn. \"it's tough to say goodbye to the mcfamily, but there is a time and season for everything, \" thompson said in a press release after the markets. \"i am truly confident as i pass the reins over to steve, that he will continue to move our business and brand forward. \" mcdonald's shares, which have fallen by nearly 6 % over the past year, rose 3 % in after-hours trading following the news of his exit. On a conference call to discuss the poor results on friday, thompson said: \"we're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are under way. \" he said 2014 was a \"challenging year \" in \"each of our geographic segments \". He warned that mcdonald's, which serves 69 million customers at more than 36,000 outlets across the world, \"continues to face meaningful headwinds \". Easterbrook said: \"i am honoured to lead this great brand, and am committed to working with our franchisees, suppliers and employees to drive forward our strategic business priorities to better serve our customers. \" easterbrook joined mcdonald's in london in 1993. He rose quickly to become the boss of all southern uk stores in 2001, and in 2006 became ceo of mcdonald's uk.

        "summary": "Being physically unfit is more damaging to living a long life than everything except smoking, according to a study published wednesday in the european journal of preventive cardiology. And as the huffington post puts it: \" we all know how evil smoking is. \" researchers measured the maximum oxygen intake of nearly 800 men who were 54 in 1967. The study continued through 2012, with those participants who were still alive being tested about once a decade. Aerobic capacity is a measure of physical fitness; the higher the capacity the more fit the individual, according to a press release. The new york times reports that people with the lowest aerobic capacity had a 21 % higher risk of dying prematurely than people with middling aerobic capacity and a 42 % higher risk of dying early than people with the best aerobic capacity. The study confirms what others have found but over a much longer time period. \" the benefits of being physically active over a lifetime are clear, \" study author dr. Per ladenvall says in the press release. The study found being out of shape was an even bigger risk than high blood pressure or cholesterol. In fact, men who were fit but had blood pressure or cholesterol problems still tended to live longer than unfit men with good blood pressure and cholesterol. The cdc found 80 % of americans don't meet federal recommendations for aerobic strength. But the good news is it's never too late to start improving fitness. \" we have come a long way in reducing smoking, \" ladenvall says in the press release. \" the next major challenge is to keep us physically active and also to reduce physical inactivity, such as prolonged sitting. \" ( another study found one in four people barely ever get off the couch. )",

        "summary": "People are heading to the polls in israel today to elect a 120-member parliament, with seats assigned based on a party's percentage of the national vote. The polls are expected to close at 10pm local time ( 4pm eastern ). Until then, here's what you need to know: on forming a government: as israel is governed by a coalition, the president will decide which party leader ( there are 25 parties in total ) has the best chance of forming a government following the vote, the ap notes. If he or she can form a coalition within six weeks, that leader — usually of the parliament's largest party — becomes prime minister. Otherwise, a new leader is chosen. On arab voters: the latest polls show the zionist union led by isaac herzog with 25 seats over 21 seats for benjamin netanyahu's likud party, time reports. Smaller parties that lend their support either way could make a huge difference. In an attempt to \" narrow the gap, \" netanyahu called on supporters to counter the high arab voter turnout, which he said threatened his party's rule, reports the ap. That could come back to bite him: about 20 % of the population is arab. On america: a defeat for netanyahu could mean a fresh start for us-israeli relations. Challengers have criticized the prime minister's controversial speech to congress earlier this month as injuring the country's relationship with its most important ally. Opponents, including herzog, have promised to repair ties with america. Herzog has also vowed to renew peace efforts with the palestinians. On palestinians: in the past, netanyahu has acknowledged the notion of a palestinian state, but yesterday said he would prevent it from becoming more than an idea, which puts him at odds with western allies. A palestinian state would provide \" attack grounds to the radical islam against the state of israel, \" he said, per time. He also suggested herzog and the the zionist union wound surrender territory for such a state. On iran: netanyahu maintains iran's apparent nuclear program poses a threat to israel. He indicated other leaders wouldn't confront the issue as he would. Opponents seem more concerned with issues at home. Much of the zionist union's campaign has focused on addressing israel's rising cost of living, which is a key issue for voters.",

Per the ap, a police spokesman said the gunman was dead, but it was not immediately clear if he took his own life or was killed by police. According to nbc chicago, the shooting unfolded at mercy hospital on the city's south side around 3: 30pm. A witness named james gray told reporters that he saw multiple people shot: \" it looked like he was turning and shooting people at random. \" television footage showed several people, including some wearing white coats, walking through a parking lot with their arms up. Hundreds of police cars, fire trucks and ambulance lined the streets encircling the hospital. Police blocked off streets into the near south side neighborhood. Mercy has a rich history as the city's first chartered hospital. It began in 1852, when the sisters of mercy religious group converted a rooming house. During the civil war, the hospital treated both union soldiers and confederate prisoners of war, according to its website. ( last month, a masked gunman was sought in chicago for another set of seemingly random slayings. )",

Hours after hundreds of catholic school students protested their vice principal's dismissal because of his gay marriage, alumni said they would stop financial support if the school didn't make amends. \"i read the story today about the firing of the vice principal because he is gay, \" eastside catholic alumni jason hilton wrote to the school development director thursday afternoon. \"i hope this story is not true. \" hilton, who was the senior class president in 1999, said his feelings were echoed by many classmates – and he was surprised to learn the dismissal was at the direction of the archdiocese. \"unless the people responsible are removed from echs and an apology to",

Students called the rule \"totally unfair \" and walked out of class in protest on thursday. When eastside catholic high school ended the employment of its vice principal for marrying his same-sex partner, it joined a growing list of catholic institutions that have fired gay employees for marrying, announcing wedding plans or advocating too enthusiastically for gay marriage.

        "summary": "Freddie mercury had one of the most memorable voices in music, and now researchers have unlocked some of the mystery behind it. For one thing, his vocal chords moved faster than normal. But the bigger part of the puzzle involves something called subharmonics, which the consequence of sound defines as a \" singing style where the ventricular folds vibrate along with the vocal folds. \" it is most famously employed by tuvan throat singers, and while mercury didn't achieve tuvan levels, it's still quite a feat for a rock vocalist to even come close. Subharmonics help \" in creating the impression of a sound production system driven to its limits, even while used with great finesse, \" write the austrian, czech, and swedish researchers in the logopedics phoniatrics vocology journal. \" these traits, in combination with the fast and irregular vibrato, might have helped create freddie mercury's eccentric and flamboyant stage persona. \" the researchers figured this out in part by asking a singer to imitate mercury's style, and then filming what was happening in his larynx with a high-speed camera. They also analyzed several old interviews with mercury to get a sense of his normal speaking voice. After all this, they were not able to substantiate long-held speculation that mercury's voice spanned four octaves. In fact, his range was \" normal for a healthy adult — not more, not less, \" says one of the researchers. But they did conclude that mercury was likely a natural baritone, albeit one \" who sang as a tenor with exceptional control over his voice production technique, \" says a post at phys.org. The bottom line: mercury \" had a voice unlike anyone else in rock ' n ' roll, and that led to one of the most unique singers and stage performers of all time, \" writes ben kaye at cos.

Sixteen days later, david stojcevski was dead. Stojcevski's brother filed a lawsuit against the macomb county jail near detroit in march, the contents of which were made public this week. According to the detroit free press, the lawsuit claims stojcevski was a drug addict admitted to jail with prescriptions for xanax, klonopin, and oxycodone to treat his withdrawals. The lawsuit states stojcevski was marked as having completed his detox after four days in jail; his symptoms started two days later, the washington post reports. Jail staff allegedly spent the next 10 days watching stojcevski die slowly and painfully. The lawsuit claims as stojcevski's symptoms worsened, he lost 50 pounds — more than a quarter of his body weight — while experiencing hallucinations and convulsions, the post reports. It states a medical team examined stojcevski at one point and determined he was fine. According to the free press, he was allegedly moved naked to a mental-health cell, where he was monitored by video surveillance 24 hours a day under lights that never turned off. At no point, the lawsuit claims, did staff listen to his pleas for help or check the state's records to verify the prescriptions they refused to provide him. Stojcevski was finally rushed to the hospital when staff found him on the floor of his cell struggling to breathe. He died soon after.

        "summary": "Tea consumption is on the upswing in the us, and with that comes the rise of high-end varieties and yes, even tea sommeliers. For those interested in acquiring such a title, it's time to get up to speed on the scents of flowers, reports modern farmer. The website interviews chas kroll, executive director of the international tea masters association, a group that issues three separate certifications of varying skill levels. To be able to describe the tastes and aromas of various teas, kroll has his students smell all kinds of flowers to develop what dan nosowitz writes is a \" mental rolodex \" from which to draw. \" a popular flower used in teas is the jasmine, but most of my students have never smelled a jasmine before, or could tell you what the aroma of chrysanthemum or orchid is, \" says kroll. Hence the crash course on flowers. Those in the two most intense courses combine in-class lessons with studies at home to become expert in brewing, tasting, smelling, and, of course, talking the talk. They also have to identify teas from around the world in a process similar to wine tasting, writes nosowitz. \" they smell, sip carefully, swish, and describe the different qualities they perceive. \" then comes a dissertation and a final exam. The most difficult course involves identifying three mystery teas that come with zero information, along with essay questions on topics such as terroir. \" my vision for the future is to see every major restaurant in the world serving tea — not just tea but high-quality, loose-leaf tea — to their guests to make it a central product just like wine is today, \" says kroll.

Healey is now claiming the petition, with more than 3.7 million signatures, has been \" hijacked \" by \" remain \" supporters, the telegraph reports. \" this petition was created at a time … when it was looking unlikely that ' leave ' were going to win, \" he wrote in a facebook post. And now that team leave is the victor, healey is steaming. \" i am genuinely appalled by the behavior of some of the remain campaign. … the referendum was fairly funded; democratically endorsed, every vote was weighted equally and i believe this was a true reflection of the mood of the country. \" another twist: a house of commons investigation that thousands of petition signatures may be fraudulent, with people complaining online that phony signatures may have been electronically created and that some petition signers seem to come from as far away as north korea and bermuda, among other non-uk locales. About 77,000 signatures have already been scrubbed, the hoc petitions committee said in a sunday tweet, and an hoc rep said it would consider debating the petition next week.

            "The last photos taken of james gandolfini show \"the sopranos \" star dining in rome, apparently relaxed and enjoying the company of others at an al fresco table. The pictures were taken tuesday night in the heart of the eternal city. Less than 24 hours later, gandolfini was dead. In one photo, snapped by an american tourist sitting at a nearby table, the 51-year-old gandolfini is dressed in a casual dark blue shirt, enjoying an evening meal at the sabatini restaurant off rome's piazza santa maria. He appears to be eating a plate of the restaurant's freshly made gnocchi as tourists stroll the piazza admiring a historic fountain. Just five days earlier, a seemingly healthy and happy gandolfini spoke excitedly about his upcoming father-son italian vacation.

He would later admit that he \" could have and should have \" done more to protect pierre-paul's privacy. Deadspin believes it will be difficult for pierre-paul to win his suit, as the florida statute really only applies to the hospital for letting schefter see pierre-paul's medical records in the first place and public figures \" rarely win invasion of privacy cases. \" two hospital employees have already been fired, and the hospital settled a lawsuit — likely brought by pierre-paul — related to the case.

        "summary": "When it comes to those close to us, we often quickly forgive and forget a deep offense — but if someone we don't know harms us slightly, we ' ll nurse our anger far longer. So suggests new research on our ability to hold grudges, io9 reports. Researchers asked participants to write personal stories that they believed would be exchanged with a partner. After exchanging stories, participants would deduce what they could about their partners ' personalities. Half the participants were told they'd meet their partner after the exchange; half were told they wouldn't meet again. The twist: during the process, participants were insulted by their partners. Researchers asked participants how they felt about their \" buddy \"; unsurprisingly, not so good. But after five minutes, things changed. Participants who believed they were due to meet partners later began to forgive them, whereas those who never had to deal with their partners again kept fuming. The authors theorize that we're essentially protecting ourselves. We won't hold a grudge if it means future pain, as in the case of a loved one — but, as esther inglis-arkell writes, \" if a hurt is minor, we can let it fester. \" click for her full piece; the study is here.",

            "Why do people forgive the guy who burned their house down, but still hate that one relative who had a nasty tone while thanking them for a birthday present? here's why we nurse grudges about small things, but forgive the big ones. We seem to have a kind of pettiness built into our nature. We will watch soppy movies about the redemption of murderers, or long tv series about gleeful serial killers, but have a character in a movie litter and we want them in prison. Our real lives are not exempt from this. We can nurse a grudge against someone who gave us a dirty look for years. When someone we love screams at us, we forgive them in a few days. A team of scientists from ucla, harvard, and the university of virginia conducted a series of experiments that showed the people are bad at predicting how hurt will affect them over time. We tend to assume the more painful injuries, the major ones, or the ones committed by loved ones, will cause the most pain over time. In a preliminary study, the team had people rate how they thought they would feel both when a series of unpleasant things happened to them, and a week afterwards. The series included everything from being turned down for a date, to a restaurant refusing use of the bathroom because they weren't paying customers, to a close friend becoming a neo-nazi. The participants in the study believed that, if they disliked something or someone intensely at the moment of injury, they would still dislike them strongly ( if not as strongly ), a week later. Minor offences would also incur dislike, but less dislike at the time, and also less dislike a week later. Obviously, the scientists couldn't check the participants predictions - although if they tried it would either be a cruel experiment or an inspired piece of performance art. So they went on to another series of experiments. Advertisement the next group of participants had a little project to do. They would write an autobiographical story, then switch stories with another participant, and assess each other's personalities based on the story.

After a four-week gambling hot streak collapsed in devastating fashion, the 36-year-old fisher found himself hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and up to 50 pounds heavier. He tells the new york post he was \" broke, big, and isolated. \" he attributes the weight gain to \" amazing, wonderful, rich \" casino food — double veal parms, full pizzas, single-serving chocolate cakes. \" it was disastrous, \" fisher says. He was 245 pounds with 33 % body fat. His friends bet him $ 1 million he couldn't get down to 10 % body fat in six months. On june 22 — five and a half months later — fisher won the bet: he was 175 pounds with 8.8 % body fat. It wasn't easy to get there. Fisher traded casino food for oatmeal, egg whites, and tilapia. He hired a personal trainer and nutritionist. He worked out seven days a week for up to 10 hours per day, needing cryotherapy to help his body recover in between workouts. \" we don't recommend you try this excessive amount of training to drop weight this fast, \" men's fitness says of fisher's routine.

If all doctors performed as well as women doctors, some 32,000 lives would be saved each year. And female docs are pulling this off while being paid less and promoted less often than men, notes nbc news. Why are women doing a better job? \" the data out there says that women physicians tend to be a little bit better at sticking to the evidence and doing the things that we know work better, \" lead author dr.

Previous research has shown \" female physicians have a more patient-centered communication style, are more encouraging and reassuring, and have longer visits than male physicians, \" writes dr. Anna parks, per nbc. Writing in jama internal medicine, researchers examined the records of more than 1.5 million medicare patients hospitalized for illnesses ( excluding surgery ) between 2011 and 2015. Less than 11.1 % of those treated by women died within 30 days, compared to 11.5 % treated by male doctors. While that might not seem like much, jha tells webmd, \" it's similar to the number of people who die in motor vehicle accidents each year. \" of those patients treated by women, about 15 % had to be re-hospitalized within 30 days, compared with 15.5 % treated by men. While the study can't prove that gender alone was responsible for extending lives, jha's team made multiple efforts to rule out other factors, reports the washington post. Yet a study this year found a $ 20,000 pay gap between the sexes. At the very least, dr.

In a national study, researchers found that older hospital patients treated by female internists had a slightly lower death rate than those treated by men. Their risk of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days was also slightly lower, the findings showed. The differences were \" modest, \" said senior researcher dr.

Per the american automobile association, us drivers blew about $ 2.1 billion on higher-octane fuel than their cars need, as most engines — about 70 % — are sated with regular unleaded fuel, cnnmoney reports. Aaa says despite this fact, about 16.5 million drivers admitted filling up at least once last year with the higher-grade gas, which costs, on average, about 50 cents more per gallon than regular. \" drivers see the ' premium ' name at the pump and may assume the fuel is better for their vehicle, \" an aaa engineering and repair expert notes. High-octane fuel's benefits, per edmunds.com: it's able to withstand more compression without combusting, making it critical in high-performance engines. But while cars on the \" premium required \" list need that higher-grade fuel to prevent engine damage — about 16 % of americans drive those types of cars, per cnn — edmunds notes cars on the \" premium recommended \" list are likely just fine with regular gas, thanks to advanced engine technology. The engine won't suffer, and the worst effect may be a slight speed reduction ( e.g., a half-second when going from zero to 60mph ). And while some drivers may still buy premium once in a while to flush out the tank, experts note all gas grades have an ample amount of additives for cutting down emissions and keeping engines in tiptop shape. What aaa says is a better bet, per marketwatch: taking your car for regular maintenance checkups and keeping away from low-quality gas, which is different than regular gas from a top-tier brand.

That's one reason premium costs more. To increase the octane rating and reduce knock, refineries use a more elaborate process that blends an expensive substance called alkylate into the fuel. What is engine knock? after vaporized fuel mixes with air and fills the combustion chamber, rising pistons compress it. The spark plug then fires, initiating the combustion process.

In 2007, lester was forced out of the jones beach lifeguard job he had held for four decades when he was told he had to squeeze into a speedo for the annual swim test. The 61-year-old long island man, who preferred his slightly more modest pair of biking shorts, refused and lost his job.

After the rare attack in new zealand, police in inflatable boats shot at and hit the shark, which is believed to have been a great white around 14 feet long, but they say it swam away, the new zealand herald reports. Citing local reports, tmz says at least three more sharks were drawn to the initial attack, and the body of one eventually washed up onshore. A fisherman says he saw the shark attack strange when he was about 650 feet off the popular muriwai beach near auckland. \" all of a sudden there was blood everywhere, \" says the fisherman, who saw the shark swim off after a struggle with strange before returning for a second attack, which attracted the additional sharks. \" i yelled at him to swim to the rocks. There was blood everywhere. The water was red. It's pretty scary, \" he says. Great whites are often seen in new zealand waters at this time of year, but there have been just 15 fatal attacks recorded since records began in 1837, with the last confirmed one in 1976, reports tvnz. Strange, 46, was \" a glorious father, husband, and friend, \" says a family statement.",
