Here's a sampling of their jokes via the hollywood reporter, the washington post, and the new york times: seth meyers: \" house republicans today voted on and passed an obamacare replacement bill without knowing how much it would cost. Though i ' m not surprised — they also voted on an obama replacement without knowing the cost. \" ( see his clip here. ) meyers: \" obamacare was paid for largely with a tax increase on the richest americans. The new bill would cut taxes for the wealthy up to $ 883 billion. Now, listen, if hearing that raises your blood pressure, calm down. You can't afford the medication anymore. \" stephen colbert noted a quote from white house chief of staff reince priebus that said, \" the president stepped up and helped punt the ball into the end zone. \" said colbert: \" yes, a punt into the end zone. Accurate because it gets you zero points and gives your opponent good field position. \" ( see his clip here. ) colbert: \" this new bill allows states to waive the benefit rules and set up their own standards. You know, because people get sick differently in different states. In california you could be suffering from ' hella foot pain, brah. ' whereas in massachusetts, it's ' wicked bad gout in yer red sox. ' \" trevor noah: \" republicans passed this bill without an official scoring of its costs from the congressional budget office, so the true effects of the bill could be anything. Your baby could have to do its own c-section from the inside. You don't know. \" ( see his clip here. ) noah: \" right now, obamacare doesn't let insurers raise rates for people with preexisting conditions. But with this bill, their rates could go way up. And if people can't afford their higher rates, they get thrown into something called a ' high risk pool, ' which sounds less like an insurance plan and more like something you find in charlie sheen's backyard. \"",

This isn't some gourmet fad like bacon chocolate — it's an attempt to make the sweet treat healthier. Chemistry professor stefan bon of the university of warwick and his colleagues say they've found a way to infuse chocolate with fruit juice, diet cola or vitamin c water to replace up to half the fat normally found in the confection. Dark chocolate gets high marks for heart health: it's been linked to lower risk of heart attack and stroke. But it's still rather fatty, with a 2-ounce serving weighing in at up to 13 grams of fat. That's 20 percent of the daily fat intake recommended for someone on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Bon and his colleagues have been testing technology to cut the fat without losing chocolate's velvety mouth-feel. They say they've discovered a way to infuse chocolate with \" micro-bubbles \" of juice or other liquids. The micro-bubbles keep the melt-in-your-mouth texture of chocolate, bon said"

        "summary": "People are still talking about the ads that aired during last night's super bowl. Here are some of the stories that caught our eye: dodge's show-stopping \" god made a farmer \" looked awfully familiar to david haglund at slate: it's nearly identical to a farms.com ad that showed up on youtube in 2011, albeit with higher production values. It turns out the similarity is no coincidence — chrysler is working with farms.com to raise money for the future farmers of america. But haglund can't help pointing out that this is one reason super bowl ads have become less compelling: \" better stuff gets uploaded to youtube every day. \" coca cola's ambitious \" coke chase \" campaign, which urged viewers to rush to their computers to influence the outcome of a drag race between some cowboys, mad max-style road warriors, and pink-clad show girls, appears to have been a disappointment, mashable reports; only 1.3 million people visited cokechase.com, down from 9 million who checked out coke's polar bear-themed site last year. But one ad that was an unqualified success was budweiser's \" brotherhood \" ad about a man's love for a clydesdale he'd raised up from a baby. By this morning, the ad had become the third-most shared ad of all time, behind volkswagen's mini-vader ad from 2011, and budweiser's own 9/11 ad.

            "Gwyneth paltrow isn't impressed with a star-studded, glamorous event ¿ she says she's never returning to the met gala ¿ here's her list of complaints. Gwyneth paltrow reportedly has no intention of returning for the costume institute's annual met gala next year. The star-studded fashion event took place monday at the metropolitan museum of art and paltrow is sharing her thoughts on the whole affair. \" i ' m never going again, \" she told usa today. \" it was so un-fun. It was boiling. It was too crowded. I did not enjoy it at all. \" photos: met ball fashion highlights maybe she's got a problem with punk theme? or was too warm in her own barbie-like gown? people's most beautiful woman of 2013 was on hand to support honorary event chairwoman and pal beyonce. And paltrow was uncharacteristically covered up in a long-sleeve, hot pink valentino haute couture gown with nude tulle around the shoulders that showed off her tan lines. Vogue editor anna wintour, who wore a floral chanel gown, said \" pink is the color of punk, \" but perhaps paltrow didn't get the memo because she told vogue that she totally ignored the theme.

            "Perhaps the costume institute should not bother cc ' ing gwyneth paltrow on next year's met ball e-vite. Two days after the 2013 gala, held as a fund-raiser for the metropolitan museum of art's fashion arm, the oscar winner, iron man 3 actress, and conversely most beautiful woman/most hated celebrity has reportedly dismissed the annual event. Usa today quotes paltrow as saying, \"i ' m never going again. It was so un-fun. It was boiling. It was too crowded. I did not enjoy it at all. \" not only might these alleged comments be hurtful to the institute, but they hopefully won't get back to taylor swift, with whom us weekly reports she bonded on monday night. At the gala, which celebrated the opening of the museum's new show \"punk: chaos to couture, \" paltrow wore vintage hot-pink valentino and arrived separately from her husband, chris martin. Although it's not clear what exactly went wrong during paltrow's 2013 met ball experience, the actress did seem less than enthusiastic about the night's theme, which she told vogue she ignored: \"i guess it's punk in that i've gone just totally classic on a punk night. \" paltrow is not the only one who reportedly had a bad time at the event."

        "summary": "China today signed a landmark agreement with russia that will see it buying a reported $ 400 billion in natural gas over 30 years. The decade-in-the-making deal will have gazprom supply china's state-owned gas company with up to 38 billion cubic meters of gas each year starting in 2018, reports usa today. That's about 25 % of what china consumes annually, the ap notes. The news is largely being painted as an important easing of russia's economic reliance on the west. Currently, most of its gas goes to europe, and with this agreement, \" we will be able to show to europe that we have other customers, \" says one russian official. And while the signing of the deal was trumpeted, many of its details were kept secret. The $ 400 billion figure is what gazprom's ceo cited to russian media, but he also said the price of the gas \" is a commercial secret. \" and the washington post reports that the true price tag \" remained a mystery hours after the signing, raising suspicion for some of the kremlin's skeptics that it had dropped the price significantly for china in a desperate maneuver to shore up a steady cash flow. \" as forbes notes, \" it is far from clear who will make how much money from it. \" based on the $ 400 billion figure, forbes calculates china will pay roughly $ 350 per 1,000 cubic meters, about on par with the $ 360 average europe is reported to have paid last year. But in this case, gazprom will first have to build a new oil pipeline, at a rumored $ 30 billion cost.",

But prosecutors now suspect parts of the story were as fictional as the exploits of the incredible hulk. Jay barbeau, who had been in jail since the alleged june 1 incident, was released monday after district attorney john hummel dropped the charges, saying he had \" no confidence \" in the credibility of megan stackhouse and lucinda mann, the two women who said they were assaulted by the 48-year-old man after they squeezed in front of his vehicle in heavy traffic in bend, the oregonian reports. \" he really never once struck any of those women, \" said casey baxter, a lawyer for barbeau. \" the entire event was a terrible lie that turned into international condemnation. \" hummel said barbeau had admitted tailing the women's vehicle and punching the window, for which he \" served 11 days in jail and received national ridicule and condemnation... This is more than enough punishment. \" baxter said her client had been angered when the women, leaving a cider festival, almost slammed into his truck and repeatedly flipped off him and his wife. Hummel said witnesses did not support mann's claim that barbeau threw her to the ground or stackhouse's claim that he broke her arm, the bend bulletin reports. The district attorney said that just a few days ago, mann deliberately threw herself on the hood of a car after drinking with stackhouse — and that days after the barbeau incident, mann was charged with punching a woman in the face after crashing into her car on mother's day.",

        "summary": "When it comes to taking property that isn't theirs, burglars are facing some stiff competition: law enforcement officers. In 2014, the washington post reports, the federal treasury and justice departments accumulated more than $ 5 billion via civil asset forfeiture — the controversial practice of law enforcement seizing cash and property from people, even if those people haven't been convicted ( or charged, for that matter ) with a crime. During that same period, losses attributed to burglary came in at just under $ 4 billion, the fbi reports. The comparison ( the first time civil asset forfeiture has come in ahead of burglary in these statistics ) was first reported on the armstrong economics blog. There are, however, some caveats. The post points out that the sum of property lost to all types of theft — not just burglary — in 2014 was about $ 12.3 billion. Also, a large portion of the total income from civil asset forfeiture may be from a handful of high-dollar cases in 2014, such as the $ 1.7 billion bernie madoff judgment — and some money, in cases like those, goes back to victims. But, even when looking at a more stable indicator to account for things like payments to victims, the forfeiture number hit $ 4.5 billion last year. State and local police also use civil asset forfeiture, and according to the institute for justice, the 14 states for which there were reliable data collected $ 250 million in 2013. Figures like these have fueled critics ' calls to do away with the practice — originally a tool for the war on drugs — altogether. Several states have either passed or are discussing civil asset forfeiture reforms, the daily signal notes.",

Ray hair, president of american federation of musicians, said travelers have been subject to arbitrary and contradictory size and weight rules for instruments for years. \" airlines will now follow a consistent policy for all musicians traveling with instruments, \" hair said. Perhaps the best-known incident involving a damaged instrument involved canadian musician dave carroll, whose guitar in checked baggage was damaged during a flight on united airlines in 2008. He later wrote a song about the incident called united breaks guitars, which became popular on youtube. The new dot rule also covers larger instruments such as tubas weighing up to 165 pounds. The rule says travelers can buy a seat if they want to transport larger instruments in the cabin, but the instrument must be tied down without blocking emergency exits or signs for other passengers. The transportation department developed the rule in meetings with musicians, airline representatives and industry associations. The department estimates it will cost airlines $ 732,000 to modify their policies covering instruments. Airlines will also have to spend",

He's also used facebook to argue that justice sotomayor would be working in fast food without affirmative action, that a 19-year-old burglar should have been \" executed on the spot, \" and that donald sterling should be supported after he was banned by the nba over racist remarks.",

The board gave paladino 24 hours to resign over what it called \" unambiguously racist \" and \" morally repugnant \" remarks about the obamas he made last week, reports the huffington post. Paladino, who unsuccessfully ran for governor as a republican in 2010, told buffalo weekly artvoice that he wanted to see president obama die of mad cow disease in 2017, and for michelle obama to \" return to being a male \" and live in a cave in zimbabwe with a gorilla. The board said that if paladino won't quit, it will petition new york education commissioner maryellen elia to remove him, the buffalo news reports. \" words matter, mr. Paladino, \" said school board president barbara seals nevergold at a raucous meeting thursday, which paladino did not attend. \" the impact on children of color, especially african-american children, is incalculable, \" she said. \" they would like me to tell you, ' you're fired. ' \" other board members accused paladino of racism and other misconduct going back many years. Paladino, who has said he won't step down, issued a statement accusing the board of trying to get rid of him for exposing corruption. Earlier this week, paladino — whose comments were called \" reprehensible \" by the trump transition team — said his words were poorly chosen and claimed he had meant to forward his remarks to friends instead of sending them to artvoice, the wall street journal reports.",

A south korean lawmaker briefed by the country's spy agency says north korea is moving aircraft to its east coast in an effort to bolster its defenses, per reuters. The revelation comes days after us bombers flew in international airspace east of north korea, prompting foreign minister ri yong ho to warn the north would shoot down us planes \" even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country. \" adding to the tension: a recent propaganda video released by the north korean regime — using photos and simple animation — shows us warplanes and an aircraft carrier under attack, reports the ap. Despite that, military analysts don't believe there's any real risk to us planes. For one thing, south korean intelligence suggests north korean radar missed sunday's flights by us planes. For another, it isn't clear if north korea has the technological capabilities to bring down planes outside its airspace. According to some analysts, north korea might simply be blowing smoke in an effort to divert attention away from its nuclear weapons program. The country might also be trying to save face. \" the most obvious reason ri made those comments was because north korea simply can't tolerate such high-profile insults to its supreme leadership, \" du hyeogn cha of seoul's asan institute for policy studies tells the ap.",

Everest. Since april, they've managed to bring down over 9 tons of cast-off mountaineering gear and other garbage, the reuters reports, citing the state-run global times. However, lost carabiners and old tents don't make up all the junk. Human waste and household waste made up over two tons and five tons of the removed mass respectively. Since the task is an extremely arduous one, officials in tibet have given every climber since 2015 on tibet's side of the 29,000 foot peak two trash bags to use to bring back down at least 8 kilos of trash, or over 17.5 pounds. A climber is fined if they come up short. Scientists say climate change is warming things up on everest, causing snow to melt and accumulated trash to emerge. At the same time, more brave climbers than ever are ascending the mountain. Per reuters, last years climbing season saw 202 summit from the tibet side and 446 via nepal's slope. Thousands of others visited camps along both mountainsides. According to the ap, the spring season runs just march until the end of may, after which weather conditions on the mountain begin to deteriorate. There are only about a couple of days of windows of good weather on the highest part of the peak in may, when climbers rush to attempt their way to the summit.

Prosecutors believe the brothers were seeking retaliation against the u.s. For wars in muslim countries. Now that prosecutors have finished their case, tsarnaev's lawyers will get a chance to present theirs. The defense has made it clear since testimony began march 4 that its strategy during the two-phase trial is not to win an acquittal for tsarnaev but to save him from the death penalty. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line april 15, 2013. Prosecutors presented heart-wrenching testimony from survivors who lost legs in the bombings and from the father of 8-year-old martin richard, the youngest person killed in the explosions. A string of first responders described a chaotic mix of smoke, blood and screams just after the bombs went off. Tsarnaev's lawyers did not cross-examine any of the victims but instead focused on trying to show that tamerlan tsarnaev",

The president's first tweet of the day on thursday called out the senate majority leader, marking the second straight day he has done so. \" can you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal &amp; replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done, \" he wrote. \" must repeal &amp; replace obamacare! \" hours later, he added another: \" mitch, get back to work and put repeal &amp; replace, tax reform &amp; cuts and a great infrastructure bill on my desk for signing. You can do it! \" as the new york times reports, this all started earlier in the week when mcconnell — whose wife, elaine chao, is trump's transportation secretary — said that the president had \" excessive expectations \" about how fast legislation could be passed by congress. Trump called mcconnell to complain about the remark wednesday morning in what fox news describes as a \" tense \" 10-minute conversation. A few hours after that, he tweeted, \" senator mitch mcconnell said i had ' excessive expectations, ' but i don't think so. After 7 years of hearing repeal &amp; replace, why not done? \" mcconnell's camp has downplayed the rift. At cnn, chris cillizza notes that white house social media chief dan scavino also criticized mcconnell, and cillizza doesn't get the strategy. \" from where i sit, this was a needless fight to pick that could have decidedly negative consequences \" for trump's agenda. In particular, trump will need mcconnell for the two mentioned in his most recent tweet, tax reform and infrastructure spending, notes the washington post. One person who disagrees: fox's sean hannity, who tweeted that mcconnell is \" weak \" and should retire.",

With him came documents that the ap calls \" one of the biggest intelligence leaks in history — a who's who of soviet spying. \" two decades later, the first batch of them has been released, upon mitrokhin's explicit wishes. Mitrokhin was a senior archivist at the kgb's foreign intelligence headquarters, and, between 1972 and 1984, smuggled files to his home, where he copied them by hand, then typed them up and hid them — some were squirreled away in a milk churn, others under floorboards. As the story goes, following the soviet union's 1991 fall he first tried to hand the files over at a us embassy: in the ap's telling, it was in an unnamed baltic state and he was denied; the guardian reports it was in riga, and mitrokhin gave up after seeing the long visa line. The brits in riga, however, offered him tea, and he ended up handing over his 2,000 pages — along with the demand they be published, reports the guardian. The first wave of documents is now out, and includes: a 40-page, 1,000-name-strong list of kgb agents in america details on the \" cambridge spies, \" upper-level british intelligence officials who worked for the soviets — but who were described as \" constantly under the influence of alcohol \" ( though guy burgess handed the kgb at least 550 documents ) and \" not very good at keeping secrets \" ( donald maclean told his lover about his work...

The judge said he had heard so much conflicting testimony from dozens of experts that he could not determine whether collector oded galon was guilty of forging the inscription, ap reports. \" this topic is likely to continue to be the subject of research in the scientific and archeological worlds, and time will tell, \" the judge wrote in his 475-page verdict.

His latest sound bite came this week in an interview with myfox new york, during which he said, among other things, that actual presidential contender ted cruz ripped off one of his lines when he announced his 2016 campaign. \" the line of ' make america great again,'the phrase, that was mine, i came up with it about a year ago, and i kept using it, and everybody's now using it, they are all loving it, \" trump said, per the hill. \" i don't know, i guess i should copyright it, maybe i have copyrighted it. \" ( the way cruz used it: \" it's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make america great again, and i ' m ready to stand with you to lead the fight. \" ) just one problem, as rolling stone points out: trump definitely didn't come up with the line. Ronald reagan was the one who used \" make america great again \" in his presidential campaign — and he used it quite a lot, on buttons and posters and even in a television ad. And, writes matt taibbi, \" i seem to remember rick perry using it as well, and i'd love it if readers could dig up the full record, because it would be amusing background for trump's copyright application. \" trump's still using the phrase; when he announced that he may or may not run for president again, he noted, \" i am the only one who can make america truly great again. \" meanwhile, in a familiar twist, trump is questioning whether cruz can even run, notes the hill: \" he was born in canada. If you know and when we all studied our history lessons, you are supposed to be born in this country, so i just don't know how the courts will rule on this. \"",

Huge numbers of bottles and barrels of wine were ruined as yesterday's 6.0 magnitude quake caused widespread damage across the valley, the san jose mercury-news reports. Wineries say the quake will cause serious losses, but the harvest now under way shouldn't be affected. The us geological survey believes total damage could be more than $ 1 billion. More: authorities say that across the region, around 100 homes have been red-tagged as unsafe to return to until authorities declare them safe — and they are only a third of the way through the process of tagging buildings, the san francisco chronicle reports. There have been more than 50 aftershocks but state officials say that they now consider a major follow-up quake unlikely, reports the los angeles times. Three of the injured are in critical condition, including a 13-year-old boy injured by debris from a falling chimney, according to the ap. Some 172 people were treated in the emergency room of the queen of the valley medical center in napa after the quake, though it's not clear how many of them were there for quake-related injuries. A usgs geophysicist says that despite the damage, the earthquake was \" truly small \" compared to some that california has experienced. \" we owe wine country in part to earthquakes \" that created the terrain, he tells the new york times. \" we all want to enjoy the fruits of the quakes, so we all have to prepare for the downside, too. \"",

Alma-tadema is widely considered one of the most important artists of the victorian era, and the art world is abuzz with the re-discovery of this particular painting, notes artnet news.

Although it was exhibited a few times, it vanished from public view in 1913 and was widely regarded as having been lost or destroyed. That is, until it showed up on antiques roadshow, courtesy of lowenstam's great-great-grandson. ( the american version of the show on pbs is based on this older, british version. ) turns out, it was just being handed down in the family.

Nearby, a mural of bowie at the brixton underground station was adorned with hundreds of flowers, reports newsweek. Flowers, candles, and glitter were also placed on bowie's star on the hollywood walk of fame and outside his former home in berlin, reports the bbc, which notes that a tribute concert for bowie, scheduled for march 31 at carnegie hall, will go on as planned. In a facebook post, former canadian astronaut chris hadfield, whose cover of \" space oddity \" became the first track recorded in space, calls bowie a \" genius. \" his death \" leaves me and, i suspect, millions around the world, with an instant feeling of loss and emptiness — and yet also a wistful joy, a sense of how creative and inspirational just one of us can be, \" he writes, per time. \" ashes to ashes, dust to stardust.

Though the medical examiner's office has yet to release a cause of death, a heroin overdose is suspected. He was found in his bathroom by screenwriter david katz, who, unable to get in touch with hoffman, went to the west village apartment. The new york post goes further, reporting he was found with a needle still in his arm. Police officials tell the journal a hypodermic needle and two envelopes possibly containing heroin were recovered from the apartment. Hoffman had undergone a stint in rehab last may for snorting heroin. Hoffman had most recently starred in a most wanted man, and leaves behind three children he had with longtime girlfriend mimi o'donnell. The new york daily news has this statement from the family: \" we are devastated by the loss of our beloved phil and appreciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from everyone. This is a tragic and sudden loss and we ask that you respect our privacy during this time of grieving. Please keep phil in your thoughts and prayers. \"",

        "summary": "What's so special about ancient rome's concrete? well, it just might be \" the most durable building material in human history, \" as one engineer puts it, per the washington post. A new study in american mineralogist sheds further light onto why: romans mixed a specific volcanic ash with lime to create a concrete similar to stone, perfect for building sea walls that have lasted some 2,000 years. The key ingredient, however, was continually added by nature. Researchers at the university of utah who studied minerals in roman concrete samples say seawater crashing against concrete sea walls caused a chemical reaction that helped strengthen the material over time. In other words, the concrete is actually stronger today than when it was made. Inside samples, researchers found crystals of aluminous tobermorite growing from the mineral phillipsite. Phillipsite occurs naturally in volcanic rocks, but aluminous tobermorite is \" very rare \" and would have formed as seawater penetrated the concrete, study author marie jackson tells nature. As its crystals grew to form \" interlocking plates, \" the concrete likely gained the strength to bend, rather than shatter, under pressure, per a release. \" this rocklike concrete is behaving, in many ways, like volcanic deposits in submarine environments, \" says jackson, adding that the romans may have studied volcanoes to learn how ash could be turned to rock. She's now trying to come up with the precise concrete recipe, which could be utilized in modern sea walls as global seas rise. ( these alaskan villagers can relate to that risk. )",

Other highlights from the chat: the single most shocking revelation from the leaks: \" the general revelation that the objective of the nsa is literally the elimination of global privacy: ensuring that every form of human electronic communication — not just those of the terrorists™ — is collected, stored, analyzed, and monitored. \" how he keeps his work secure from the nsa: \" we use highly advanced means of encryption. Remember, the only ones whose op sec has proven horrible and who has lost control of huge numbers of documents is the nsa and gchq. \" whether there's enough proof the us government has broken the law: \" i think there already are things clearly showing the government broke the law, including ( but not only ) the constitution, but there is much more to come on that score. \" the two most overlooked nsa stories: \" the one... About the secret presidential directive signed by obama to prepare for offensive cyber operations: essentially the militarization of the internet... And the document we recently published showing nsa gives unminimized communications of us persons to israel with very few binding safeguards. \" on british authorities seizing his partner's laptop: \" they outright lied when they said he was carrying a password that allowed access to the documents. Indeed, on the same day they told that lie... ( that ) what he was carrying was ' heavily encrypted ' and they were able to only'reconstruct ' 75 documents. Obviously, if he had a password that enabled access to the documents, then they would have been able to access them. He did not, and thus they could not. \" what americans can do to limit the power and abuses of the nsa: \" the tide is clearly turning.... What will ultimately determine the outcome here is how much pressure citizens continue to apply in defense of their privacy rights and against massive, ubiquitous, secret spying systems aimed at them. \" read the full ama at reddit, or selected highlights as chosen by salon, techcrunch, the guardian, and policymic.",

Many don't understand that the amendment bans both, ppp explains; north carolina already has a law on the books banning gay marriage, and this one goes further by including other types of domestic unions.

        "summary": "\" this is a pretty incredible conservation moment, \" a rep for the center for biological diversity tells the san francisco chronicle following news from california: a second pack of gray wolves has been spotted in the state. State officials have known for about a year that a pair of gray wolves had hunkered down in lassen national forest, reports the san jose mercury news. But after trapping the 75-pound adult female last week, they determined the wolf had recently given birth. After taking samples and fitting the female with a tracking collar, they released her with high hopes. Later, a trail camera spotted her running around with three pups. A rep for the california department of fish and wildlife says officials are \" excited \" because \" if two packs can be established, then others can get here. \" also of note: \" the pups are really cute. \" the first gray wolf pack in california in nearly a century — made up of a male, female, and five pups — was spotted in siskiyou county in 2015. The siskiyou wolves are likely distant cousins to those in lassen national forest, officials say. But whereas the siskiyou pack is descended from a wolf pack in northeast oregon, the lassen pack is descended from or7, the first gray wolf to appear in california following the animal's extinction there in 1924. Specifically, one of or7's sons is the mate of the female wolf captured last week. New granddad or7 now resides in oregon. ( wolf hunting may resume in these states. )",

Limber twig apples, rambo apples, mother apples. If those names aren't exactly ringing bells in your noggin, consider that some 17,000 varieties of apples have been grown on our continent across the centuries; of those, only about 4,000 varieties remain. The new york times visits washington state, which is home to about two-thirds of an apple industry that's worth about $ 4 billion — and built on the cores of just 15 varieties, most prominently the half-correctly-named red delicious. But those lost varieties linger: in abandoned orchards, in forests and parks. Which brings us to the people who hunt them down. \" it's like a crime scene, \" says former fbi investigator david benscoter. \" you have to establish that the trees existed, and hope that there's a paper trail to follow. \" benscoter has tracked down one lone arkansas beauty tree, thought to be the last on earth and \" twisted with age, \" writes the times. He prunes it to stimulate new shoots that can in turn be grafted onto other trees, allowing it to survive another generation. Often, these varieties were good for a very particular purpose: philly.com notes that the golden russet apple, \" a homely fruit with mottled skin that looks more like a misshapen asian pear, \" was the perfect apple for hard cider, no blending with other varieties needed. But when prohibition hit, \" the golden russet practically vanished, like so many other heirloom varieties with no grocery store future. \" now, with the re-emergence of craft ciders, the golden russet is enjoying a rebirth, but don't expect that trend industry-wide. \" they're hard to grow, \" says one grower of heirlooms, and \" land costs money. \" ( americans used to booze all day. )",

        "summary": "Do you make happy sounds when you're eating a tasty meal? if so, you're not alone. Researchers have discovered that gorillas sing and hum while they eat, new scientist reports, and the findings ( published this month in plos one ) could provide insights into how language evolved in early humans. While sounds related to food have been documented in animals including chimps and bonobos, until now there was no evidence of gorillas engaging in them, aside from anecdotal accounts from zoos. One zookeeper in toronto, for example, says humming and singing at mealtime is common for captive gorillas, with each gorilla singing at mealtimes ( \" and if it's their favorite food, they sing louder \" ). However, the researchers found that in the wild, dominant males do the most singing. \"he's the one making the collective decisions for the group, \" primatologist eva luef says. \"we think he uses this vocalization to inform the others, 'ok, now we're eating.

With every budget, lawmakers are slashing into discretionary spending, but with social security and various health entitlement costs rising, government spending is growing anyway. The result: \" governmental competence is being systematically degraded. … we are spending more and getting less. \" by 2024, current projections show that all spending on non-entitlements will be just 7.4 % of gdp — the lowest share since 1940. Cuts are hitting everything from the military ( sort of ) to medical research to the federal courts. Yet political debates never focus on this dynamic, in part because polls show the public isn't concerned. \" both liberals and conservatives are complicit in this charade, \" but ironically it's liberals who most refuse to discuss entitlements. Hence another paradox: \" the pro-government party in rhetoric has become an anti-government party in practice. \" click for samuelson's full column.",

The biting insects are one of nature's top disease vectors, spreading everything from yellow fever and dengue to zika and malaria, and a group of scientists recently set out to test which of 11 types of repellents actually keep aedes aegypti mosquitoes at bay. Almost all the products had a small or undetectable effect, including sprays, wearable devices, and citronella candles, reports science. Only deet and lemon eucalyptus spray did the trick. To test this, scientists put a person at one end of a wind tunnel to act as the bait, released a band of several dozen hungry mosquitoes, and tried each of the 11 products individually, reports ars technica. Cutter lemon eucalyptus, a spray of lemon eucalyptus oil, was apparently so repulsive to the insects that only 29.6 % of them dared approach the human; ben's tick &amp; insect repellent, a spray-on that is 98 % deet, attracted 33.7 % of mosquitoes; and a wearable device, the off! clip-on that fans out metofluthrin insecticide, attracted just 27 %. Meanwhile, personal sonic mosquito repellent and citronella candles actually drew more than 90 % of the mosquitoes, which was more than the 88 % found to venture that way in the control test. \" the most egregious danger to the consumer is the false comfort that some repellents give them protection against ae.

Kobayashi, who was ineligible to compete in the beloved brooklyn contest because he won't sign an exclusive contract with major league eating, put away 69 dogs purchased earlier in the day from the south street seaport nathan's. \" i ' m feeling pretty damn good right now, \" chestnut, 27, said after the 10-minute televised competition wrapped. \" at the end, i kept messing up my rhythm … ( but ) i just kept pushing. \" \" some",
            "It was close for a few minutes, and then \" jaws \" pulled away. Joey chestnut ate 62 hot dogs monday to capture his fifth title in a row in nathan's famous hot dog eating contest. \" winning tastes pretty good. I feel great, \" chestnut said. \" it was hot out here but that didn't really affect me. \" after an event in washington, d.c., in a day or so, the 27-year-old chestnut will head back to his normal life as a construction engineer in san jose, calif. \" my girlfriend didn't even make the trip out here to coney island, \" chestnut said. \" she just told me to come back in one piece. \" it's really not much of a contest anymore, as chestnut has dominated the past five years. Patrick \" deep dish \" bertoletti finished second with 53, while tim janus finished with 45. With no takeru kobayashi -- dealing with a contract dispute -- and no real formidable foes, chestnut will continue to win anytime he enters the contest, which celebrated its 96th year monday. His total of 62 compares well to previous years -- 2010 ( 54 ), 2009 ( world-record 68 ), 2008 ( 59 ) and 2007 ( 66 ) -- but he doesn't have anyone pushing him to"

The wall street journal catches up with the odd phenomenon of little bai, better known to legions of fans as xiaoman. In scores of videos her mom posts online — see examples here — xiaoman can be seen happily chowing down on whatever is put in front of her. In a nation where eating videos are a bit of a sensation, xiaoman appears to be the youngest star in the odd genre. Last year, quartz and the daily mail were among those to take note of her burgeoning fame on the chinese app meipai. Though people have expressed concern that xiaoman may be eating too much, her mom posted a video of a visit to the doctor to prove that her daughter is healthy. The amount of food she eats \" looks big in the video, but it is very little, \" says mom duan yu, who stays off camera and says the original intent wasn't to make her daughter famous. She merely began posting videos of her growing up, and people began to become fascinated with her non-finicky eating habits. Duan says it might help that she limits snacks and doesn't ever give the toddler seconds, even if she cries for more. Xiaoman now has an agent at models international who says the appeal isn't complicated. She \" eats everything by herself and appreciates it, \" the agent explains. \" that's why people love her so much. \" ( this 6-year-old boy will only eat one thing. )",

        "summary": "Have you ever wondered if would be ok — healthwise, not morally speaking — to feast on a fellow human? if so, gizmodo has some answers. The strongest case against cannibalism is a version of mad cow disease or creutzfeld-jacob disease known as kuru to the fore people of papua new guinea. For 20 years starting in the 1950s, more than 2,500 women and children died from the so-called \"shaking death \" after eating their relatives ' body parts. This practice was part of a funeral ritual meant to show respect; the fore believe a person's soul isn't free until their flesh is eaten. But because of the ritual, many contracted the fatal prion malady, which prevents brain cells from working and can take up to a year to kill the victim after the symptoms first appear. If you absolutely must eat a body part, you may want to avoid the brain, spinal cord, bone marrow, and small intestine, which are the ones most likely to be infected. As for the fore, they mostly stopped the practice known as \" transumption \" in the mid-1950s; but nowadays, as mark griffiths points out in the independent, \" sexual cannibalism \" has been in the news quite a bit, particularly thanks to dale bolinger, a uk nurse recently convicted of grooming a teenage girl with the ultimate intention of eating her. The gruesome fetish is typically considered a psychosexual disorder. But if you're just curious what human flesh might taste like, 1930s adventurer william buehler seabrook once tried it and revealed that it tastes very much like veal, slate notes. While there's technically no law in the us banning cannibalism, cornell university law school notes that it would likely violate laws against corpse desecration — or murder.

Thirteen years later, he was arrested, charged, and sentenced to 26 years to life in prison after the cold case was reopened, according to the los angeles times. And on tuesday, bradford was granted parole despite the strenuous objections of his own daughter and the man who prosecuted him. \"i have spent a lifetime living with the knowledge and grief that goes along with losing my mom to murder at the hands of someone that i used to call dad, \" 50-year-old shaun rickerl tells the breeze. \" the safety of everyone connected to the trial should take precedence over the release of a man convicted of murder. \" rickerl isn't the only one afraid for her safety. John lewin, deputy district attorney for los angeles county, says bradford had only been in prison a few months when lewin heard from a cellmate that bradford was threatening to kill lewin, his wife, and his children. \" this is the one guy that scares me, \" lewin tells the times. \" how dare you play russian roulette with my family. \" but bradford's lawyer, maya emig, says her 84-year-old client is too old and sick — suffering from dementia and more — to hurt anyone. She says he doesn't remember who prosecuted him and fell asleep during the hearing. \" he can't put two and two together, \" emig says. \" he doesn't have the resources to go out and hire a hit man. \" state commissioners agreed, ruling bradford isn't a danger to the public. The earliest bradford could be released is 2019. His parole could still be overturned by the governor.",

        "summary": "A british criminal who soared to fame after helping to rob a train of more than $ 7 million has died at 84 of unspecified causes. Ronnie biggs made his name with the great train robbery of 1963, though he actually spent most of the heist in a nearby car. After escaping prison, however, he managed to avoid capture for decades, traveling to australia and brazil before finally returning to britain in 2001 for health treatment — knowing he'd be imprisoned, the new york times reports. \" sadly, we lost ron during the night. As always, his timing was perfect to the end, \" his publicists tweeted. Biggs could simply have served his sentence and been paroled long ago, the times notes. Instead, he used ropes to clamber over the prison wall and flee. After getting plastic surgery in continental europe, he traveled to australia; his family came along. A few years later, he headed to brazil. Later, on the verge of capture, he was allowed to stay because his brazilian girlfriend was pregnant. He soon began a public life in the country, offering commercial appearances and souvenirs. After heading to back to britain in 2001, he was imprisoned until 2009, when the justice secretary allowed him compassionate release. The guardian notes that some have been critical of his celebrity status given the beating of a train engineer during the heist. \" biggs wasn't a cuddly heart of gold cockney character to be feted. His gang beat a man with an iron bar, ruining his life, \" tweeted a conservative party lobbyist.",

            "It was hard to make ends meet. In 1963, mr. Biggs approached mr. Reynolds, a man he had known in jail, to request a small loan. But mr. Reynolds had other plans, involving a very unusual royal mail train. Running by night and appearing on no printed schedule, it transported vast quantities of cash between provincial bank branches and central banks in london. The money was in the second of 12 cars. The gang mr. Reynolds assembled included men with intimate knowledge of railroad timetables, signals and switches. Mr. Biggs recruited a retired engineer to drive the train. After midnight on aug. 8, 1963, the gang turned a signal light along the route to red. The train ground to a halt in the buckinghamshire countryside at 3: 15 a.m. When the engineer, jack mills, stepped out of the cab, a waiting gang member bludgeoned him with an iron bar. The gang uncoupled the last 10 cars. Mr. Biggs's engineer was brought on board but was unable to release the train's brake. Mr. Mills, bleeding badly, was forced back into the cab and ordered to drive the head cars to a secluded spot down the line. There the robbers stormed the second car, subdued its crew and unloaded 120 mailbags into waiting vehicles. The whole thing was over in about 15 minutes. As was widely reported, mr. Biggs spent most of that time sitting in a land rover near the railway embankment, his failed engineer beside him.

            "It was hard to make ends meet. In 1963, mr. Biggs approached mr. Reynolds, a man he had known in jail, to request a small loan. But mr. Reynolds had other plans, involving a very unusual royal mail train. Running by night and appearing on no printed schedule, it transported vast quantities of cash between provincial bank branches and central banks in london. The money was in the second of 12 cars. The gang mr. Reynolds assembled included men with intimate knowledge of railroad timetables, signals and switches. Mr. Biggs recruited a retired engineer to drive the train. After midnight on aug. 8, 1963, the gang turned a signal light along the route to red. The train ground to a halt in the buckinghamshire countryside at 3: 15 a.m. When the engineer, jack mills, stepped out of the cab, a waiting gang member bludgeoned him with an iron bar. The gang uncoupled the last 10 cars. Mr. Biggs's engineer was brought on board but was unable to release the train's brake. Mr. Mills, bleeding badly, was forced back into the cab and ordered to drive the head cars to a secluded spot down the line. There the robbers stormed the second car, subdued its crew and unloaded 120 mailbags into waiting vehicles. The whole thing was over in about 15 minutes. As was widely reported, mr. Biggs spent most of that time sitting in a land rover near the railway embankment, his failed engineer beside him. The bank notes in the bags came to 2.6 million pounds, or about $ 7.3 million — roughly $ 70 million today. Most of the money has never been found.

A study out of the university of florida and published wednesday in the journal of preventative medicine found a correlation between gonorrhea rates and the price of alcohol. According to a press release, maryland raised its alcohol sales tax from 6 % to 9 % in 2011. Gonorrhea rates dropped 24 % in the 18 months afterward, the south florida sun sentinel reports. \" if policymakers are looking for methods to protect young people from harmful stis, they should consider raising alcohol taxes, which have decreased remarkably over the years due to inflation, \" lead researcher stephanie staras, says in the press release. The study compared rates of gonorrhea across states before and after maryland's tax increase on alcohol. It found 1,600 fewer cases of gonorrhea per year in maryland after the increase. The sun sentinel reports maryland was the exception as sti rates rose around the country. Researchers concluded higher taxes on alcohol reduce the amount of alcohol consumption within a state, and people who are drinking less are less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors. \" right now, the only population-level intervention for stis recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention is condom distribution, \" staras says in the press release. \" however, the effects we observed in this study are comparable to the effectiveness of condom distribution. \" ( some teens invented a condom that turns colors near stis. )",

Unless you're massachusetts resident judy brown, who got the whole thing out of the way in about an hour. Abc news reports the 47-year-old went to the hospital wednesday night with \" severe abdominal pain \" and what she thought was a gallstone or something. It turns out she was actually exceedingly pregnant. \" to understand and take in that i was pregnant and was about to go into labor … it was very overwhelming, \" brown says. According to wcvb, brown thought the changes her body was going through over the past few months — including a growing belly — were just the process of getting older. \" i felt like i was turning into my mother, \" she says. Approximately an hour after arriving at the hospital, brown gave birth to a healthy baby girl — her first child, abc reports. \" now i have a new purpose in life, \" brown's husband jason tells the salem news. \" i ' m already a big kid myself, so now i have one to be with. \" but he says that's not going to stop him from getting surgery to make sure something like this never happens again, according to wcvb. Since it never occurred to the couple brown might be pregnant, abc reports they had to borrow a car seat and bassinet just to leave the hospital. It may seem bizarre, but this kind of thing isn't unheard of. \" people don't know sometimes, or they're in denial about it, \" one doctor says. \" and denial can be pretty strong. \" ( meanwhile, these women have given birth in some pretty strange places. )",

About 2.5 million light years from the milky way, andromeda is speeding toward us at a zippy 250,000 miles per hour.

We've known that andromeda, called m31, has been moving toward our galaxy for quite some time, drawn by the force of gravity between the two collections of stars.

It's the biggest thing to hit the milky way. Ever. In four billion years, the andromeda galaxy will plow through the milky way head on in a collision of cosmic proportions – not once, not twice, but three times over about a 2 billion year span. When cosmic do-si-do ends, the result will be an enormous elliptical galaxy that will alter a starry night sky in ways that would make vincent van gogh drop his brushes in awe ( see video ). The edge-on view of the milky way now visible on a clear night under dark skies would first yield to a dazzling array of large, bright regions of star formation all across the sky.

This could be how the night sky looks on earth just before the predicted merger between our milky way galaxy and the neighboring andromeda galaxy 3.5 billion years from now, shown in a nasa photo illustration released friday. It's the biggest thing to hit the milky way. Ever. In four billion years, the andromeda galaxy will plow through the milky way head on in a collision of cosmic proportions – not once, not twice, but three times over about a 2 billion year span. When cosmic do-si-do ends, the result will be an enormous elliptical galaxy that will alter a starry night sky in ways that would make vincent van gogh drop his brushes in awe ( see video ). The edge-on view of the milky way now visible on a clear night under dark skies would first yield to a dazzling array of large, bright regions of star formation all across the sky. Ultimately, the sky would be dominated by a giant brightly glowing ellipse of stars – the core of the new galaxy that our solar system would inhabit at a much greater distance from the center than it now does.

The exclusive interview, titled \" things my father taught me, \" touched on everything from how they bond to the vp's 1967 corvette. Some nuggets: joe stresses the sanctity of family, noting that if an employee of his ever showed up for work instead of attending an important event for a loved one, he would say: \" don't work for me. \" \" we have an expression in our family: if you have to ask for help, it's too late, \" he adds. The vp's tight relationship with hunter and his late son, beau, has been well documented. \" one of the reasons for the special, incredible bond that beau and hunt and i had is that any loss that i had was their deep loss as well, \" he says, noting that he and the boys all looked after each other after joe's first wife ( hunter and beau's mom ) and young daughter died in 1972. Joe's best memory of driving in his ' 67 vette, a wedding gift from his own dad: cruising with 3-year-old hunter down a rural country road. \" a beautiful day like today, and he's sitting on my lap, and he turns around and puts his hand on my face and he says,'daddy? daddy? i love you more than the whole sky.

        "summary": "Aids isn't a wounded enemy on the brink of defeat, it \" is still one of the biggest killers in the world \" and the target of ending the epidemic by 2030 now looks completely unrealistic, warns the chief of the united nations program on hiv and aids. Former unaids director peter piot tells the guardian that \" it is as if we're rowing in a boat with a big hole and we are just trying to take the water out. We're in a big crisis with this continuing number of infections and that's not a matter of just doing a few interventions. \" there are still almost 2 million new infections every year — 60 % of them among women and girls — and the hiv virus is becoming resistant to drugs currently used to keep infected people healthy, leaving expensive new drug combinations as the only alternative. \" we will not end hiv as an epidemic just by medical means, \" warns piot, who notes that many african girls are infected by much older men and that gay men still face severe discrimination in many countries. \"people are not robots. Sex happens in a context. It is about power, \" he says. Rfi reports that out of around 37 million people infected worldwide, only around 17 million are receiving any kind of treatment, meaning that the aids death toll, which has been holding steady at around 1.5 million a year, could start rising again. Piot and other experts say progress — and, someday, victory — is still possible, but the fight has been slowed down by a shortage of funding, which has been partly because donor countries no longer see the epidemic as a major or urgent problem. ( in the us, there are \" stark differences \" between the infection rates of different groups. )",

        "summary": "When the 80-year-old japanese company that produces hagoromo fulltouch chalk went out of business this past spring, mathematicians took to social media to pay their respects and their wallets to buy as much of the chalk as they could — 15 years ' worth in the case of one professor. Sarah zhang set out to learn why, and writes in gizmodo that the tongue-in-cheek \" tragedy of mathematics \" that is the demise of hagoromo is such a big deal to mathematicians because whiteboards and tablets simply don't offer the same appeal to \" crotchety \" academics, as one put it. \" plus, technology has that annoying tendency of becoming glitchy at the most inconvenient times, \" zhang writes. Chalkboards, apparently, tend to be easier to clean and maintain than whiteboards, which involve cleaning fluids, chemicals, and the tendency of markers to run out in the middle of something. And the japanese chalk has a shiny, clear coating that doesn't get too dusty, and appears \" thicker and sturdier \" than its american-made cousins, writes zhang. \" it's hard to articulate but when i ' m using it, i can feel it's nicer — it both flows nicely and it lasts much longer, too, \" one mathematician says. But it's not just the end of a company's era, zhang notes; it's the end of a medium, the chalkboard. In fact, the technology for making hagoromo chalk lives on, transferred to a big office supply corporation in japan that now makes something called dc chalk deluxe.
