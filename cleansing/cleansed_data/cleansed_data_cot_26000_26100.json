Mr. Cosby's career as an entertainer is already stalled and will remain so for the time being. The mistrial did little, experts said, to affect the status of \"the cosby show, \" which became something of a third rail for cable networks as cosby accusers surfaced. It would have been further tarnished by a conviction, but it is slowly re-emerging, with all eight seasons available to stream on amazon prime and two television outlets, tv one and bounce tv, now airing reruns. Barbara ashcroft, a former prosecutor who teaches at the temple university beasley school of law, said that as the second criminal trial approaches, both sides would study the first. \"steele will likely use what he learns from this trial to tighten up the commonwealth's case and come back even stronger during the retrial, \" she said.

The sacramento bee reports on what's said to have transpired nov. 28 at guiding hands school in el dorado hills, when a 13-year-old student who cops say was severely autistic reportedly became violent, prompting staff to place him in what's called a \" prone restraint, \" in which the person is held facedown. An el dorado county sheriff's office rep says the boy, who was 6 feet tall and about 280 pounds, became unresponsive while in this position, and staff tried to administer cpr before help arrived. Per cbs sacramento, the boy died at uc davis medical center two days later. Using this type of restraint can be legal in some cases in california, though it's been banned in schools in several other states. A disability rights attorney tells the bee if the move isn't done correctly, it \" can cause trauma and death, \" as the positioning can keep oxygen from circulating. The school was sued nearly 15 years ago for using this type of restraint, and a former student tells fox40 she left the school after eighth grade due to what her family thought was overuse of this type of response. A guiding hands statement announced the teen's death \" with heavy hearts, \" adding that staff used \" a nationally recognized behavior management protocol \" and that an investigation continues.

            "Restraint &amp; seclusion about autism restraint &amp; seclusion in may, 2009 the us government accountability office ( gao ) completed its nationwide investigation into the use of restraint &amp; seclusion in public schools. The result of its findings concluded that no federal laws were in place to keep educators from using dangerous and abusive methods to restrain or seclude a student. The investigation found that many states had no laws in place, and that existing state-to-state laws were 'widely divergent. ' it also showed that although the children's health act of 2000 protects children from abusive practices in facilities such as hospitals, residential treatment centers and residential group homes, it does not protect children from such practices in schools. Read full report here: http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09719t.pdf definitions restraint: restraint is any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of an individual. Seclusion: the involuntary confinement of an individual alone in a room or area from which they are physically prevented from leaving. Types of restraint prone restraint means that the child is laid in the facedown position. Supine restraint means that the child is laid in the face-up position. Physical restraints involve a person applying various holds using their arms, legs or body weight to immobilize an individual or bring an individual to the floor.

        "summary": "A new study about sugar is good news for companies that make sugar-laden products. The problem is that the study itself was funded by those very same companies. As time reports, the research newly published in the annals of internal medicine looks specifically at guidelines, including those in the us, advising people to limit added sugars to less than 10 % of their daily calories. That's about the equivalent of a large soda. The researchers concluded that those guidelines are \" not trustworthy \" and \" based on low-quality evidence. \" study author bradley johnston also accuses scientists of using sugar as \" the scapegoat for the rise in obesity and diabetes \" when \" it's one factor among many, \" per npr. The review was funded by the international life science institute, whose board members include reps from mcdonald's, coca cola, pepsi, nestle, and hershey. That's a major red flag, says a nutrition professor at new york university, who calls the study a \" shameful \" move by food and beverage companies \" right out of the tobacco industry's playbook, \" per reuters. The journal aim was clearly aware such criticism would be coming and took the unusual approach of running an opposing editorial in the same issue by dr. Dean schillinger of the university of california, whose research last month found that studies funded by the industry generally seemed to dispute any link between sugar and health problems. \" policymakers, when confronted with claims that sugar guidelines are based on ' junk science,'should consider whether ' junk food ' was the [ funding ] source. \" ( documents suggest the sugar industry has been trying to shape health studies since the 1960s. )",

        "summary": "Researchers have made a rare find that demonstrates how clever prehistoric hunters in north america could be — and it's at the bottom of lake huron of all places. Researchers at the university of michigan found evidence of a network of hunting blinds they say was used to kill caribou on their seasonal migrations, reports livescience. The stone structures are now submerged under more than 100 feet of water, but they were on land about 9,000 years ago on a ridge that runs from northeast michigan to southern ontario. Essentially, the hunters of yore built stone \" drive lanes \" that the caribou would enter, unaware it was an ambush. The exact method was actually different based on which direction the animals were headed — the difference between spring and fall migrations. If these structures \" were on solid ground, ( they ) probably would've been bulldozed away for a walmart parking lot by now, \" an archaeologist not involved with the study tells usa today. Underwater archaeology may be pricey — this find required sonar and a remotely operated vehicle — but here \" it's revealing a site that's in pretty much pristine condition. \" the discovery could shed more light on the hunting and migratory habits of the era, notes ap, because the system would have needed 15 or so people in the spring ( though fewer in the fall ). \"the larger size and multiple parts of the complex drive lanes would have necessitated a larger cooperating group of individuals involved in the hunt, \" says one of the um scienists. \"the smaller v-shaped hunting blinds could be operated by very small family groups relying on the natural shape of the landform to channel caribou toward them. \"",

An elaborate array of linear stone lanes and v-shaped structures has been discovered on an underwater ridge in lake huron, marking what is thought to be the most complex set of ancient hunting structures ever found beneath the great lakes, according to a new report. Researchers based at the university of michigan think the roughly 9,000-year-old-structure helped natives corral caribou herds migrating across what was then an exposed land-corridor — the so-called alpena-amberley ridge — connecting northeast michigan to southern ontario. The area is now covered by 120 feet ( 347 meters ) of water, but at the time, was exposed due to dry conditions of the last ice age. Using underwater sonar and a remotely operated vehicle ( rov ) equipped with a video camera, the researchers found two parallel lines of stones that create a 26-foot-wide ( 8 meters ) and 98 foot-long ( 30 m ) northwesterly-oriented lane that ends in a natural cul-de-sac.

When they reach the top, one of the two is seen smoking some sort of cigarette and gazing down at the city of cairo, lit up for the night. The clip then cuts to the woman stripping off her shirt, then morphs into a still image of the two lying together naked as the sun comes up. \" in late november 2018, a friend and i climbed the great pyramid of giza ( a.k.a. Pyramid of khufu, pyramid of cheops ), \" hvid wrote when he posted the video. \" fearing to be spotted by the many guards, i did not film the several hours of sneaking around at the giza plateau, which lead up to the climb. \" per sky, a pyramid site rep says he thinks the footage is fake due to a suspect \" illumination \" seen at one point in the clip. Not only is scaling egypt's ancient pyramids illegal — the conservative populace isn't looking too kindly on the couple's supposed sexytime on top of the pyramid, either. The country's antiquities minister has referred the video to the prosecutor general to be looked into. The video is no longer on hvid's youtube channel, though others have been posting it instead, and a still of the nude couple can be seen on his website under the \" nude art \" section.",

Researchers found that having a drink and a half or less per day was associated with 7,000 of the 19,500 annual booze-linked cancer deaths, nbc news reports. The us sees some 577,000 cancer deaths each year, which means 3.5 % of those are related to alcohol, the study notes. To put the figure in perspective, 14,000 people died from ovarian cancer in 2009; 9,000 died from melanoma that same year. But the alcohol connection isn't a widely publicized one; indeed, this study is the first major review of the subject in three decades. Some 15 % of breast cancer deaths were tied to alcohol; among men, mouth, throat and esophageal cancers were commonly tied to booze, cbc reports. In short,'there is no safe threshold for alcohol and cancer risk, \" the researchers say. It's still not clear how alcohol boosts cancer, but previous studies have found it ups women's estrogen and helps tobacco chemicals enter the digestive tract, the san francisco chronicle reports.",

The tractor-trailer carried about 90 cows and about half of them were still roaming in the cobb county and sandy springs area late monday morning, worsham said. \" we're wrangling some cows, that's what we're doing, \" said worsham. Some roads in the area were closed for a time but had reopened late monday morning, he said. Sandy springs police worked four wrecks caused by the wandering cows, worsham said. No one was injured in any of those accidents, although several cows were hurt and some had to be tranquilized as officers tried to corral them. Cobb county sgt. Wayne delk was quoted by the atlanta journal constitution as saying that investigators do not believe speed was a factor in the crash. The driver of the tractor-trailer that was carrying the cattle was taken to a hospital with injuries. Cobb county animal control brought a horse trailer to the area and police were putting some of the animals in the trailer, he said.",
            "Dozens of cows roamed free on atlanta interstates monday after a tractor-trailer hauling them overturned, setting off a nearly 16-hour roundup effort through two metro counties. The truck was carrying 89 calves from florida to northwest georgia when it tipped over on the i-285 east ramp at the i-75 interchange in cobb county. Some of the animals were trapped in the truck, while dozens more spilled onto the interstate. Authorities with the georgia department of transportation have rescued cows trapped on a cattle truck that overturned on i-285 at the cobb cloverleaf early monday morning. John spink / jspink@ajc.com several were hit by drivers coming around the curve of the exit ramp, according to authorities. Eleven cows were killed. Sandy springs police originally said they captured the final loose cow just after 4: 15 p.m. On i-285, but police were still searching for it at 6: 30 p.m. It reportedly jumped over the side of the road and into the woods. Around 8 p.m., sandy spring police spokesman sgt. Sam warsham told ajc.com that authorities had captured the elusive last calf in a creek bed near ray's on the river, which is on powers ferry road. #update the cow jumped over the side of the road after police had it blocked in -- and screamed \" you ' ll never take me alive, coppers!! \" but really,"

        "summary": "Shout \" bella \" in a dog park and there's a good chance a new friend will come running. According to nextdoor.com, bella is the most popular dog name in the us... As it was in 2017 and 2016. At quartz, jane c. Hu sets out to explain our attraction to the name, noting it's also the top one for dogs in new zealand and australia. It's been most popular among us dogs since 2009, when stephenie meyer's twilight series starring bella swan hit peak popularity. \" but now that it's 2018 and it's safe to say that twilight-mania is behind us, there must be something else going on here, \" hu writes. Laura wattenberg of baby name wizard has a few ideas, noting bella manages to be both classic and trendy, and feminine without being \" ultra-feminine. \" while \" hyper-masculine \" dog names like tank or diesel remain popular, names like precious are becoming less so. \" feminine markers are considered almost a pejorative, \" but bella avoids that, watternberg says. Meaning \" beauty \" in spanish and italian, the name conveys femininity and warmth. Like lucy and max, it's also classic, short, easy to say, and suits a dog of any dog breed, opposed to curly or patches, watternberg tells hu. A bonus: it falls under the trend of bestowing dogs with human names, which \" probably reflects a change in how people think about their pets \" — increasingly as akin to children, watternberg says. Rather your dog stand out from the pack? woman's day lists unique dog names — but please don't pick \" pumpkin spice. \" ( these names are said to be especially sexy. )",

Uber used information like geolocation data and credit card details to pinpoint users that might be involved in sting operations in cities like portland, ore. Those users were then \" greyballed \" when they tried to get an uber car, with the app either showing no cars available or displaying \" ghost cars \" in a fake version of the app, uber sources tell the times. The insiders say the program, used in us cities including boston and las vegas and in countries including australia and china, is still being used to dodge regulators today. If a driver did pick up somebody the system had identified as a possible law enforcement agent, uber would call to cancel the ride, according to the sources, who say some people in the company worried that the program might be unethical or illegal. Uber did not deny the program existed, the guardian reports, but said it \" denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service, \" including \" opponents who collude with officials on secret'stings ' meant to entrap drivers. \" business analysts tell the washington post that the exposure of greyball adds to a \" really bad month \" for uber and that the company will need better management for its reputation to start recovering.

Prime minister mariano rajoy recently announced that he is looking into doing away with the long break in the workday, which is blamed for spanish workers having one of the lowest productivity rates in europe despite working longer hours than most, the independent reports. The typical working day currently runs from 8am to 8pm with a break from 1: 30pm to 5pm, which workers use for lunch, errands, and picking children up from school as well as napping, nbc news reports. Rajoy says he wants to bring in a 6pm finish time across the country, where siesta observance varies from region to region. There have been complaints that ditching the siesta would wreck the traditional rhythm of the spanish day, though polls have found most spaniards favor the change, reports npr, which notes that spanish media has focused more on stereotype-heavy foreign coverage of the proposal than the plan itself. Rajoy has also revived a proposal to move the clocks back an hour to put spain on the same time as the uk and other countries on the same longitude. Generalissimo francisco franco moved the time forward in 1942 to put spain on the same time as nazi germany.

After reviewing 10 years ' worth of data from agencies including the world cancer research fund, researchers conclude drinking is a direct cause of not just liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, reports the guardian. \" the highest risks are associated with the heaviest drinking but a considerable burden is experienced by drinkers with low to moderate consumption, \" says study author jennie connor. She tells the telegraph there's actually no safe level of drinking in reference to cancer. As cnet puts it, \" you booze, you lose. \" drinking 50 grams of alcohol per day — about 2.6 beers or roughly three 6-ounce glasses of wine — results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, and a 1.5 times greater risk of the others, compared to consuming no alcohol at all, reports live science. Alcohol may also cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, says connor, adding the purported benefits of alcohol are \" seen increasingly as... Irrelevant in comparison to the increase in risk of a range of cancers. \" scientists aren't sure how alcohol causes cancer, but acetaldehyde — the compound formed when alcohol breaks down — damages the dna of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. The good news: those who stopped drinking reduced their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to fall the longer they steered clear of booze. ( good thing we're drinking less. )",

A woman in san francisco says she got attacked by \" wanker google glass haters \" for wearing the glasses inside a haight street establishment, reports the los angeles times. Tech publicist sarah slocum wrote on facebook that a man ripped them off her face after a verbal confrontation and ran outside the bar. She got the glasses back but says his friends then stole her purse, cellphone, and wallet. In the huge online conversation this triggered, slocum labeled herself the victim of a \" hate crime. \" but her critics say she was being a \" glasshole. \" cbs san francisco talks to a bar patron who says that people were annoyed that slocum was recording video. They were \" rather insulted that someone thinks it's ok to record them the entire time they're in public. \" especially at a bar, near closing time. Things got testy, and one of slocum's friends punched one of her hecklers, he says. Slocum posted a 9-second video of the moments before her glasses were taken, though it's a little tough to figure out what's going on, notes adam martin at the daily intelligencer. \" so for now, this all sounds like some overly fraught discussion of some idiocy that happened on the kind of drunken night you would usually want to forget. \"",

The plan was only finalized 20 minutes before kickoff. \" i've never been prouder of my association with players and a coaching staff as i am with this crew, \" jones said after the cowboys ' 28-17 win. \" we all agreed that our players wanted to make a statement about unity and equality. \" asked about trump's remarks, jones said: \" i made my mind up on this issue that i wasn't going to comment.

        "summary": "Canadian rancher pete stoner was having a heck of a time getting google to change its mapping tool to direct people in search of the fort george canyon provincial park in british columbia to the trailhead instead of his private property. He says it all started in 2014, when he was working on a tractor and saw three guys open his chained gate and try to walk through after using google maps, reports the cbc. Never mind that there was still a river and large rock wall in the way. Since then, he's counted scores of people — some who are belligerent when they learn they must backtrack two hours to get through, but most of whom are just confused. \" last weekend i counted 62 people, \" he says. The frustrated sawmill operator and his wife maggie tried to contact google several times by filling out an online form, to no avail. \" it's like,'thank you for your input, now go pound sand, \" says stoner, who even took his problem to b.c. Parks in december. But the mapping tool is crowd-sourced, so not long after the cbc's story ran last week, people scrambled to try to fix the map. \" i was like, ' oh! poor guy! ' \" says google maps regional reviewer alex duffield. He added a path, marked the stoners'driveway private, and then approved two other edits that redirect users to the actual trailhead, and nicole bell of google followed up to write that the correction is live, reports the cbc. Good news for stoner and google maps users alike, then — there's no longer a private ranch, river, and hundred-foot rock wall between hikers and their destination.

Fifty-five percent of the continental united states — from california to arkansas, texas to north dakota — is under moderate to extreme drought, according to the government, the largest such area since december 1956. An analysis released on thursday by the united states drought monitor showed that 88 percent of corn and 87 percent of soybean crops in the country were in drought-stricken regions, a 10 percent jump from a week before. Corn and soybean prices reached record highs on thursday, with corn closing just over $ 8.07 a bushel and soybeans trading as high as $ 17.49. As of sunday, more than half of the corn in seven states was in poor or very poor condition, according to the department of agriculture. In kentucky, missouri and indiana, that figure is above 70 percent"

European commission head jean-claude juncker says that with the deal, which includes a $ 55 billion fund to be created by privatizing parts of the greek economy, greece will not have to leave the eurozone, the bbc reports. In return for more loans to keep its economy from collapsing, the deal requires greek prime minister alexis tsipras to bring in what the ap calls a \" drastic austerity program \" in a country that has already seen years of tough austerity measures — and voted against them just a week ago. The greek leader, who had been under intense pressure to accept the deal and now has to present it to lawmakers, told reporters it had been a \" tough battle \" but that greece had averted \" extreme measures \" and won debt restructuring. \" the deal is difficult but we averted the pursuit to move state assets abroad, \" he said, per the bbc. \" we averted the plan for a financial strangulation and for the collapse of the banking system. \"",

Planted on the south lawn in 2009, the garden has become a symbol of obama's efforts toward \" growing a healthier nation for our children, \" according to a new paving stone. It's one of many recent changes to the 2,800-square-foot garden, unveiled wednesday, reports politico. Once made up of wood planters and sawdust paths, it now includes stone pathways, a stone-paved seating area, and a wood and steel arbor cemented into the ground. Though it will be up to the next administration to decide what to do with the garden, the \" brilliant \" renovation means removing it will be no easy task. \" if it were taken out, it would truly just be a political statement, \" says an expert on the white house garden. And the possibility of it being removed is real. Ronald reagan famously got rid of jimmy carter's solar panels when he moved in. Bill clinton removed george hw bush's horseshoe pit, and george w bush nixed clinton's jogging path. However, a home gardening company has agreed to donate $ 2.5 million over 17 years to maintain and \" further develop \" the garden, which supplies 2,000 pounds of produce annually, per the washington times. \" i take great pride in knowing that this little garden will live on, \" obama says. \" i am hopeful that future first families will cherish this garden like we have. \"",

Young children who don't have a regular bedtime behave worse than kids who go to sleep at the same time each night, a new study suggests. British researchers found that both mothers and teachers rated 7-year-olds who had inconsistent bedtimes as being more hyperactive than their better-rested peers, and as having more social, emotional and conduct problems. The results also revealed that behavior grew worse the more years a child spent without a firm bedtime. But the good news is that children's behavior noticeably improved when they switched to a scheduled bedtime. \" this is a very well-done study that in many ways reaffirms what we already know about a lack of sleep, \" said dr.

        "summary": "A prominent chicago theater critic is under fire for publishing a review of steppenwolf's production of pass over that many are calling racist. In fact, a petition signed by more than 3,000 people so far calls for hedy weiss of the sun-times to stop being invited to shows — meaning she would no longer receive free tickets, but could purchase her own ticket if she wanted to attend a performance in order to review it. Weiss criticized pass over, a \" riff on waiting for godot \" by antoinette nwandu that includes a scene in which a bigoted cop confronts the two black main characters, for featuring what she called a \" simplistic, wholly generic characterization of a racist white cop ( clearly meant to indict all white cops ) \" that \" is wrong-headed and self-defeating. \" steppenwolf's artistic director responded to the controversy in a facebook post on behalf of the company wednesday, chicagoist reports. The post notes that \" some of the critical responses from this work have been shocking \" and have revealed a strong racial bias, and calls weiss'review \" particularly egregious. \" the petition accuses weiss of publishing other reviews with racist, homophobic, or body-shaming views, and posts here and here catalog some past controversies; weiss infamously once wrote that angels in america playwright tony kushner exhibited \" the classic style of a self-loathing jew. \" a performink blog takes not just weiss but other critics who wrote about pass over to task, noting that one critic used the n-word multiple times in her review while another seemed to be wondering why the play didn't focus more on black-on-black crime. Weiss has yet to respond to the petition, but broadway world notes that the chicago tribune theater critic did weigh in, noting that he believes \" engagement with different points of view is always preferable to trying to shut them down or ban their free expression. \"",

        "summary": "President trump appears about to set a second potentially controversial pardon in motion, sources tell abc news and the new york times. Scooter libby, former chief of staff to ex-vp dick cheney, will be the next to see a presidential reprieve, with a pardon greenlit by trump after he mulled it over for a few months. Then-president george w. Bush had granted a commutation for libby in 2007 after he was convicted for perjury, obstruction of justice, and other charges related to the leak on cia operative valerie plame. What may have struck a chord with trump in libby's case: the fact that libby was painted by conservatives as being the victim of a rogue special prosecutor, which is similar to how some in conservative circles are framing the robert mueller investigation swirling around trump ( the washington post dives deeper into other similarities ). If a pardon for libby is indeed in the works, it would be just over seven months since trump pardoned former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio. The times notes some are wondering if a libby pardon would be meant as a signal from trump that he'd look out for those who stayed loyal to him, as libby was believed to have done for cheney — especially as libby hasn't been a name trump has previously stumped for. In fact, while campaigning in 2015, trump called it an \" irrelevant \" issue. If the libby pardon comes to fruition, it would be trump's third since taking office: besides arpaio, he also pardoned navy sailor kristian saucier last month, and he commuted in december the sentence of sholom rubashkin, the ex-owner of the country's largest kosher meat-processing factory.

        "summary": "After a bomb killed ho van thanh's wife and two of his sons during the vietnam war, ho took his 1-year-old son into the jungle — and never came back. That was 40 years ago. On wednesday, officials carried the too-weak-to-move 82-year-old away from the treehouse he and his son had been living in, thanh nien news reports. Ho and his son, ho van lang, now 42, have spent the intervening years hunting and subsisting on both wild plants and cassava roots and corn and sugarcane grown on their own nearly 2.5-acre field. The men wore loincloths made of bark — though the elder ho still had his military uniform pants folded neatly in the treehouse, which sat about 16 feet off the ground, alongside a small red jacket his son once wore. The younger ho knows only a few words, and his father has \" fallen out of the habit of speech, \" the telegraph reports. Though times live reports they were found by villagers who were searching for firewood and alerted authorities, their existence apparently wasn't entirely unknown. Ho's youngest son — who was a newborn when ho disappeared — found the two more than two decades ago, but couldn't persuade them to accept him or rejoin society, despite annual gifts of salt and oil. ( amazingly, they're not the only family to live in isolation for 40 years. )",

But, the washington post notes, they weren't ready for newt gingrich. As polls show that the primary is increasingly becoming a two-man race, romney is struggling to deal with gingrich's rise — a particularly daunting rise because, unlike many of the others, gingrich has passion, political experience, and substantive policy ideas. Romney could continue to focus on the general election, but strategists worry that gingrich, unlike the others, won't decline on his own. On the other hand, a direct attack on gingrich could backfire. Romney wasn't as cool as usual in a recent fox news interview, appearing agitated as he was questioned about flip-flopping, and taking a rare swipe at gingrich, hinting that he does consider his rival a credible threat. He criticized him again on sean hannity's radio show, calling gingrich a \" career politician \" while touting his own business experience, the wall street journal notes. Also hurting romney is gingrich's ability to draw more enthusiastic support, as evidenced by the energetic crowds at his campaign events compared to romney's comparatively sedate gatherings. A recent gallup poll shows gingrich has a 20 % lead over romney's 9 % when it comes to \" positive intensity \" among voters. Click for a recent swipe gingrich took at romney.",

Police say 23-year-old brittany pilkington has told investigators that she killed her three young sons over a 13-month period, and that she did so because her husband, joseph pilkington, wasn't paying enough attention to their 3-year-old daughter, the columbus dispatch reports. She has been charged with murder in the deaths of 3-month-old niall, who died in july last year; 4-year-old gavin, who died in april this year; and 3-month-old noah, who died yesterday — just six days after a judge returned him to his parents when a coroner decided the other two boys hadn't died of suspicious causes. Noah had been removed from the home soon after his birth, along with the 3-year-old girl, and logan county prosecutor william goslee says his office wanted to keep them in state custody for longer, the dayton daily news reports. He tells the dispatch that hours after the latest death, pilkington admitted smothering the boys with a blanket and in her mind, \" she was protecting her daughter from being not as loved as the boys were by their father. \" joseph pilkington's brother tells the dispatch that his brother — who found the bodies of the first two boys after returning home from work at a honda plant — is so distraught that he's considering admitting himself to the hospital. \" i just feel real bad for my brother, \" he says. \" it's messed up. \" the couple married when brittany was 18 and joseph was 38.",

The qsr magazine annual study also found that mcdonald's had its worst year yet, with customers waiting an average of 189.5 seconds between ordering their food and picking it up. The industry average is about nine seconds shorter than that, usa today reports. If you're really in a hurry, wendy's had the best average: 133.6 seconds. \" the operational pressures to assemble [ complicated premium ] items are slowing down the drive-thru, \" says the qsr editor. ( taco bell told the magazine its new cantina bell bowls can have as many as 12 ingredients; we're not sure what the other seven are. ) plus, the editor adds, some companies are purposely slowing down the drive-thru process so orders can be double-checked for accuracy, since customers would rather wait a few more seconds than drive away without their doritos locos taco. Amusingly, drive-thru order accuracy was 87.2 % this year, compared to 88.8 % last year.",

Innovations throughout the years, from wireless headsets and order-confirmation boards to dual lanes and pre-sell signage, have created a better drive thru capable of handling the 60 – 70 percent of business that now loops the exterior of most quick-service restaurants. With the drive-thru performance study, qsr — together with columbus, ohio – based insula research, which co-owns the proprietary report — has monitored the innovations and success of quick-serve drive thrus for the last 15 years. And since 2011, we've pared down the industry to a benchmark group, a set of six permanent brands — burger king, chick-fil-a, krystal, mcdonald's, taco bell, and wendy's — along with one annually rotating brand — this year's being taco john's — that regularly perform best in the drive-thru arena, to get a better idea of what companies can aspire to in the future.
