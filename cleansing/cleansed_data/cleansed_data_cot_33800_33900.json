        "summary": "Apple is facing class-action lawsuits in the us and canada over iphones that owners say are freezing up, the cbc reports. At the heart of the suits is a big functionality problem: people say the touch screens on their iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus phones occasionally stop working, and the complaints are so widespread that a blog post at ifixit.org has labeled it \" touch disease. \" the lawsuits say apple knew about the problem and didn't fix it. \" they brushed it under the rug, \" says canadian attorney tony merchant, who adds that apple has told customers that they must pay about $ 300 to have the issue fixed. The company has not publicly commented on the lawsuits. \" you miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap, \" says the lead plaintiff in the canadian legal action. ( at least one class-action suit has been filed in the us. ) independent repair shops and analysts have isolated the cause of these failures, according to motherboard. It's related to another apple problem: the \" bendgate \" controversy that marred the launch of the iphone 6 plus. The soft housing on the large phone is prone to bending, which can dislodge two small chip connectors responsible for translating touchscreen inputs into on-screen actions. Simply replacing the screen won't fix the issue — the chips must be resoldered — and the ifixit blog post says the problem worsens over time. ( a french man destroyed every phone he could inside an apple store. )",

        "summary": "Lovers of sports spectacles can rejoice: the long-rumored super-fight between undefeated boxing great floyd mayweather jr. And mixed martial arts champion conor mcgregor has been made official. Yahoo sports reports the two men will face each other in a boxing match on august 26 in las vegas. The 40-year-old mayweather will end a 23-month retirement to face mcgregor, the 28-year-old irishman who went from being a rookie in the ultimate fighting championship to the biggest star in the history of mixed martial arts in just a few years. According to espn, mcgregor first suggested the idea of a cross-sport superfight with mayweather on conan o ' brien's talk show back in 2015. It wasn't until mcgregor won the ufc lightweight belt last november, however, that the fantasy started to become a reality. Mayweather is considered the heavy favorite going into the fight, though regardless of the outcome mcgregor's paycheck promises to be by far the biggest of his career. According to the new york times, mayweather's 2015 fight with manny pacquiao drew nearly 4.5 million viewers through pay-per-view. Mcgregor's biggest pay-per-view draw to date drew 1.6 million. Forbes reports each fighter could take home more than $ 100 million for the fight. The two men will meet at the light-middleweight limit of 154 pounds, which bodes well for mcgregor, who is currently the ufc's 155-pound champion. Mayweather, meanwhile, won one of the biggest fights of his life when he jumped up in weight to fight oscar de la hoya for the 154-pound belt in 2007. Mayweather walked into that fight 10 pounds lighter than his opponent.",

        "summary": "Morning joe hosts mika brzezinski and joe scarborough had planned to take friday off to start their july 4 vacation early — but that was before they became part of a president trump controversy. Sources tell the new york daily news that the hosts stayed an extra day to fire back at trump, who described brzezinski as \" bleeding badly from a face-lift \" in widely condemned tweets early thursday. In a washington post op-ed early friday, the msnbc hosts urge trump to stop watching their show, saying they don't believe he is \" mentally equipped for it. \" \" the president's unhealthy obsession with morning joe does not serve the best interests of either his mental state or the country he runs, \" they write. The hosts give a very different version of the encounter trump described in his tweets, saying mika \" reluctantly \" met trump briefly at mar-a-lago on dec. 31, but turned down his invitation to a new year's eve party. \" putting aside mr. Trump's never-ending obsession with women's blood, \" photos show that her face was \" perfectly intact. \" mika has never had a face-lift, they add, though it is \" hardly a state secret \" that she has had \" a little skin under her chin tweaked. \" the real issue, they write, is that trump \" is setting the poorest of standards for our children \" with his \" continued mistreatment of women. \" in other developments: the remarks, which were defended by melania trump and white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders, drew some of the loudest — and most bipartisan — condemnation of trump's presidency, with numerous republican lawmakers joining democrats in calling trump's remarks unacceptable, the ap reports. In their op-ed, the hosts say they are heartened by the response from gop figures, and they hope women in trump's life will follow suit. Late-night hosts including stephen colbert and seth meyers also weighed in thursday, with meyers introducing a new \" i can't \" segment, saying he had been left speechless by the \" vicious and cruel \" remarks. Colbert said he hadn't realized it was still possible for him to be shocked by something trump said, mediaite reports. He read out headlines calling the tweets a \" new low \" before quipping: \" no, it's the same low. \"",

        "summary": "The fabulous amber room looted by the nazis from a russian palace in 1941 may be the world's \" most valuable piece of lost art, \" according to reuters — and a 68-year-old man in western germany thinks he knows where it is. Karl-heinz kleine and friends from his bowling club have been exploring tunnels and bunkers under the old industrial city of wuppertal. He tells the daily mail that erich koch, the chief nazi administrator in east prussia, came from the town and had the jewel-clad chamber dismantled and shipped there as the red army advanced on koenigsberg ( now kaliningrad ), the room's last known location. \" he brought it to a place he knew, where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future, \" says kleine, who has studied records and talked to locals who were alive in the mid- ' 40s. But kleine says the search is expensive — and a building company that loaned the team a drill has now asked that it be returned. \" we need helpers, special equipment, and money, \" he tells reuters. \" i only have a small pension, a new machine is too expensive for me. But whoever helps will get his share of the amber room when we find it, \" he adds, predicting that the search will move rapidly if he gets the right tools. The smithsonian has more background on the amber-paneled room, a 1716 gift to peter the great from the king of prussia that some called the \" eighth wonder of the world. \" an interesting detail: with the nazis approaching, the room was covered in wallpaper in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise it. In 2007 the magazine valued the room at $ 142 million in that year's dollars. ( the long-lost diary of a hitler aide recently surfaced in upstate new york. )",

The specifics of what may have happened became only slightly less opaque during a friday press conference in which the benbrook pd said vadym kholodenko placed the 911 call at 9: 27am, just minutes after he arrived to pick up the children. \" he found the mother in an extreme state of distress and discovered the children, \" says commander david babcock, per cbs fort worth. Police are waiting on autopsy results, but they say nika, 5, and michela, 1, were not stabbed and showed no visible injuries. Kholodenko is not a suspect; his wife and the girls ' mother, 31-year-old sofia tsygankova, is \" being held on a mental health evaluation \" in a fort worth hospital. The fort worth star-telegram reports by way of court records that the ukrainian pianist — winner of the gold medal at the 2013 van cliburn international piano competition, according to a bio — filed for divorce from tsygankova in november, two months after the pair had apparently stopped living together as a couple. The divorce is still pending. Kholodenko had been scheduled to play three shows with the fort worth symphony orchestra this weekend but will be replaced, reports nbc dfw. It adds that benbrook police have responded to calls at the house in the past, though babcock didn't offer any specifics. Though it's unclear whether tsygankova's wounds were self-inflicted or the result of an attack, babcock said there is no active search for a suspect. Kholodenko said in a statement released by his lawyer that he \" is experiencing great grief at this time and has no further comment. Thank you for respecting his privacy. \"",

        "summary": "Syed rizwan farook supported isis and was obsessed with israel, his father told italian newspaper la stampa in a frank interview that has apparently now been retracted. The elder farook said his son had been a good, studious boy, but too shy and conservative in his views, and fixated on israel. Farook, who said his son \" shared the ideology \" of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi to create an islamic state, told the newspaper that he became angry when he saw his son with a gun, cnn reports. \" i became angry. In 45 years in the united states, i yelled: ' i have never had a weapon, ' \" said farook, who added that he \" cannot forgive \" himself for what happened. The la-area director of the council on american-islamic relations tells the los angeles times that the father is on medication, is under a lot of stress, and can't remember making those comments during the interview. In other developments: a law enforcement source tells the times that federal agents have raided the riverside, calif., home of a former farook neighbor to determine whether he supplied some of the guns used in wednesday's san bernardino shooting rampage. Rep. Michael mccaul, chair of the house homeland security committee, says investigators are looking into the past of farook's wife, tashfeen malik, whom they suspect of radicalizing her husband, reports reuters. Mccaul told fox and friends that authorities are also trying to find out how the couple could afford the \" veritable arsenal \" found in their home. \" we are looking at the terrorist financing aspect to this case. I believe on his salary, he was not able to buy this on his own, \" he said. Attorney general loretta lynch told nbc's meet the press that the fbi is taking a close look at farook's mother who, unlike his father, lived with the couple. She said the possibility that the mother was aware the couple was stockpiling thousands of rounds of ammunition and more than a dozen pipe bombs is \" something that we're looking at very, very closely. \" the ap reports that just four days before the shootings, an nsa program collecting americans ' phone records in bulk was shut down, meaning investigators will not be able to access agency records going back five years. Under the new usa freedom act, investigators can ask phone companies for records going back two years. ( a man who died saving a colleague told her: \" i got you. \" )",

Eric trump says he's considering shutting down the charitybuzz auction, meant to benefit a children's hospital in tennessee, after the new york times raised ethical concerns. Trump says the auction is an annual event, with one member of the family agreeing to have coffee with the winner, but this year is obviously a \" new world, \" he says. The current high bid is almost $ 73,000, with bidding scheduled to end on dec. 20. Ethics lawyers tell the times a public official shouldn't trade access for money, even to benefit a charity. The gray area, of course, is what kind of role ivanka trump will play in her father's administration. Trump adviser kellyanne conway suggested this week that federal rules about family members don't apply, notes time. \"the anti-nepotism law apparently has an exception if you want to work in the west wing because the president is able to appoint his own staff, \" she said on msnbc. \"of course, this came about to stop maybe family members from serving on the cabinet, but the president does have discretion to choose a staff of his liking. \" ( one possibility: she may be \" climate czar. \" )",

        "summary": "The man who first proved that aids was triggered by the hiv virus more than 30 years ago is back with a potential vaccine that starts human testing this month, science alert reports. In the three decades since dr. Robert gallo made his breakthrough, more than 100 aids vaccines have been tested with limited success. According to the baltimore sun, only one study — in 2009 in thailand — came close to being effective enough for widespread use, and that only protected one-third of patients. But the 78-year-old gallo and his team at the institute of human virology believe they've come up with a unique approach that could work using their \" full-length single chain \" vaccine. ( \"it's a terrible name, \" gallo admits to science. ) science alert reports aids is notoriously difficult to fight because the hiv virus hides in the body's t-cells and turns the immune system against the body. With his vaccine, gallo hopes to trigger antibodies to attack the hiv virus when it reveals itself just as it attaches to a t-cell but before it completely invades it. Gallo has been working on the vaccine for 15 years. He tells science it took so long to get to human trials because researchers extensively tested it on monkeys — where it showed promise — and needed to secure new funding. This first round of human testing will involve 60 volunteers and only look at the safety and immune responses of the patients. Testing for effectiveness will come later, and gallo is already tempering expectations. \" can i promise absolute success? no, \" he tells the sun. \" do i hope it leads to a series of advances in the fields? yes. \" ( read about how a policy change kept 120 people from getting hiv. )",

The room, released in 2003, is arguably one of the worst movies ever made. But the same can't be said of james franco's the disaster artist, which explores how wiseau's creation came to be. With a star-studded cast including franco as wiseau, the film has an impressive 96 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" this movie about a very bad movie is, in fact, very good \" and \" also very, very funny, \" writes katie walsh at tribune news service. A \" superb \" franco \" gets right at the heart of what makes wiseau a true hero — his sheer willingness to try — and that is what makes the disaster artist work so well. \" make sure you're familiar with the room because \" it's almost obsessively brought back to life \" in this \" celebration of anybody who ever made art — no matter how egregious, \" writes stephen whitty at the newark star-ledger. Franco's wiseau is \" truly terrific, \" whitty writes, adding that his relationship with fellow actor greg sestero, played by franco's brother dave, is \" the sweetest part of the movie. \" see the room or don't. Either way, the disaster artist will have you laughing your heart out, writes mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle. \" it's funnier more often and in more different ways than there are synonyms for hilarious, \" says lasalle, adding franco \" climbs into the head of [ wiseau ] and gives us his thought processes, which are ultimately an even greater source of jaw-dropping comic amazement. \" \" it would have been easy … to simply lampoon wiseau and his film. \" instead, the disaster artist \" takes the vastly more interesting approach of examining how and why the room happened, illuminating aspects of bro culture and celebrity worship along the way, \" writes peter howell at the toronto star.

Though it was the setting for a movie that won in each of the so-called big five academy award categories, there's not much action in this community an hour south of pittsburgh, which might be the reason a home with hollywood cachet is failing to sell. Photos of the home show a sun-drenched yard, a pool and clean bedrooms, a departure from the cluttered, gray interior of a home used by one of the film's villains. Nearby, there's a creepy-looking tunnel, which some visitors suspect is haunted. There's an old, rusty bridge that crosses the youghiogheny river and serves as the",

First seen in october 2015, the icy world seems to be orbiting something big in a distant region of the solar system called the oort cloud, space.com reports. A team led by scott sheppard of the carnegie institution for science in washington, dc, spent three years tracking the dwarf planet's astounding orbit, which reaches a point nearly 60 times further from the sun than pluto and takes 40,000 years to complete, per the guardian. Two other dwarf planets are orbiting the same area, suggesting some huge unseen object is out there in a region nasa describes as \" a thick bubble of icy debris that surrounds our solar system. \" \" these distant objects are like breadcrumbs leading us to planet x, \" says sheppard in a statement, referring to a hypothetical planet he first proposed with a colleague in 2014 to explain orbits of other oort cloud dwarf planets called sedna and 2012 vp113, per space.com. Also known as planet nine, this possible world could be hovering on the edge of our solar system or existing entirely outside it, ejected long ago. Sheppard says he plans to further investigate by seeking more evidence of distant dwarf planets — worlds too small to be called full-sized planets. \" the more of them we can find, the better we can understand the outer solar system and the possible planet that we think is shaping their orbits — a discovery that would redefine our knowledge of the solar system's evolution, \" he says.",

Per afp, grace meng relayed the jarring information to a group of reporters in lyon, france, where the global police agency is based. Meng gave her statement with her back turned to reporters in order to hide her face for fear she, too, could be vulnerable, as she believes the knife was meant as a sign from her husband he is in danger. \" i ' m not sure what has happened to him, \" she told reporters. \" this matter belongs to the international community. \" meng left france late last month and confusion was widespread at the news of his disappearance. However, the nature of his predicament became clearer soon after his wife's statement on sunday. Per the ap, china announced less than an hour later that meng, who also serves as the country's vice minister of public security, had been detained for unnamed legal violations. A rather vague statement posted online by china's new national supervision commission, an anti-corruption agency, said meng is \" suspected of violating the law and is currently under the monitoring and investigation. \" the news has observers guessing that meng has been caught up in president xi jinping's widening crackdown on what his communist party deems as dissent. Prior to his arrest, the new york times notes that meng's appointment as interpol's first chinese chief was seen as a step toward authoritarian china's embrace of international organizations. Last month, one of china's top energy officials was also snared in xi's continued anti-corruption crusade.",

She had committed no crime, but raised suspicions by repeatedly depositing amounts lower than $ 10,000 in her bank. And hinders isn't alone, the new york times reports: the irs inflicted this brand of \" civil forfeiture \" ( authorities taking people's money based on suspicion of a crime ) 639 times in 2012, 525 times more than it did in 2005, according to a public interest law firm that's going after the government practice. Responding to the times, the irs said it would stop such forfeitures unless they were warranted by \" exceptional circumstances, \" but refused to review past cases. The times, however, did look at a couple. On long island, the irs seized $ 447,000 from a cigarette and candy distributor; in arlington, va., the feds took $ 66,000 from an army sergeant who eventually settled for $ 21,000, but the loss forced one of his daughters to delay going to college. So why the $ 10,000 deposit rule? many criminals, knowing that banks must report deposits over that amount, often deposit less in order to keep their money laundering or drug trafficking secret. To counteract that, the feds tell banks to report any repeated deposits under ten grand. The law once said that perpetrators of \" structuring \" ( as it's called ) had to do it \" willfully, \" but that changed after a defendant did it on purpose yet claimed not to know it was illegal, the washington post reports. So congress struck out the \" willfully \" requirement, \" leaving us with the mess we now have, \" the post says.",

A 19-year-old mexican man worked a single day at a louisiana sugar cane plantation last year before fatigue, numbness, and pain in his shoulder sent him to a local hospital. He was tested for a wide range of diseases, including hiv, herpes, and lyme. The possibility of a vampire bat bite didn't come up: the bats don't live in the us except in zoos, msnbc reports. Doctors eventually considered rabies, and the young man tested positive — a day before he died. An investigation revealed that he had been bitten on the heel by the bloodsucking creature while asleep in southwest mexico, 10 days before heading to louisiana, the afp notes. The rare form of rabies took just 15 days to incubate; most us rabies cases take closer to 85 days. The case \"highlights the growing importance of bats in public health, \" said the cdc. \"research suggests that the range of these bats might be expanding as a result of changes in climate. \" head to the huffington post for more on the vampire bat case.",

The rebel group, known as the yarmouk martyrs ' brigade, has pulled down a video they'd posted on facebook saying they wouldn't release the 20-some philippines troops until bashar al-assad's forces left the area, replacing it with one saying that they had \" managed to secure \" the troops \" after they were victims of the criminal shelling of assad's gangs, \" the washington post reports. The video concludes by asking the un to send a security convoy to retrieve the troops. The change of heart followed a series of negotiations with the un overnight. All along, the rebels insisted that the troops were being treated as \" visitors and guests \" and wouldn't be harmed, the new york times reports. Philippine president benigno aquino had expressed confidence the troops would be released today or tomorrow, and said that both sides considered the un a \" benign presence \" — a sentiment seemingly at odds with the brigade's first video, which accused the troops of collaborating with assad, reuters points out.",

It is made up of people doing what they think is best for their community. Violence is not the answer, though. \" apparently that last part of the tweet wasn't enough to soften the rest of it, because people on social media jumped on him, as did dfl party chief ken martin. In a dfl statement, martin says kimmel's comments \" do not reflect the views of the minnesota dfl and have no place in our party \" and he asks kimmel \" to apologize to all the families who have been torn apart by the terrorist organization and their senseless violence. \" kimmel initially tried to walk back his tweet, including with a follow-up post that read, per the star tribune: \" i deplore evil acts of isis. I do not defend their acts. \" but townhall.com reports that house dfl minority leader paul thissen jumped into the fray saturday with his own statement, in which he also called for a kimmel apology, as well as an end to his house campaign. And that's exactly what kimmel did sunday, announcing he was ending his run ( as well as his social media accounts, apparently ). \" my tweet … was … poorly worded and did not convey my intent, \" he wrote on his website. \" i am very sorry for'spreading ick ' on other candidates and the dfl party.

Nena told rivera gracias that limon had molested her and sexually assaulted her mother. The arrest warrant affidavit states rivera gracias wanted to kill him over the allegations; tina moya had also asked various people to kill him. Ultimately, the affidavit states, she convinced rivera gracias and her boyfriend to do the deed while she and her daughter, aware of what was going on, were nearby. Rivera gracias is accused of wielding the knife that killed limon; his body was found dumped near a guardrail on lookout mountain with a steak knife blade stuck in his chest. Tina moya and her boyfriend pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 36 and 48 years, respectively; nena pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder and was handed a two-year sentence, to be served in a youth corrections facility.",

And it turns out, they're under attack a lot more often than one might think. Andrew mcgill at the atlantic set up a server pretending to be an internet-connected toaster, and watched to see how frequently hackers attempted to access it. It took less than an hour for the first hacker to hit his system — and the first was far from the last. So why do hackers find these \" internet of things \" devices so tempting to attack? the answer's pretty simple, says cnet: no one ever changes the passwords. Even if users change the passwords used to access the software that manages these devices, they don't change the hardware passwords, which most people aren't even aware of. If that sounds like too much tech-savvy for your regular user, some manufacturers agree, reuters reports. Chinese company hangzhou xiongmai technology plans to recall up to 10,000 vulnerable webcams and swap them for newer models which urge users to change the default passwords and disable settings which can be used to allow remote access.",

Last week, sources told the ap that the faa advisory committee had voted to approve the use of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other gadgets for takeoff and landing. But a senior amazon executive on the advisory panel now tells the wall street journal that the new recommendations go even further, clearing the way for \" gate to gate use \" of devices, regardless of the apps they're running or the wireless transmission mode they're in. Paul misener, amazon's vp of global public policy, also says the panel recommended a simple system for airlines to prove that devices and wifi won't interfere with their planes — one that looks at past tests instead of requiring a host of new ones. If the recommendations are approved, fliers would still have to use on-board wifi to access the internet — not due to safety concerns, but because the fcc bans airborne cell service. About 60 % of commercial passenger planes are set up for wifi, though the largest us inflight internet provider says its service doesn't really work below 10,000 feet — so even though you may soon be allowed to read your kindle during takeoff, you may not be able to download e-books at the time.",

Back in 1998, the good doctor gave a commencement address at andrews university, a school tied to the seventh-day adventist church, and while he shot down the theory that aliens built the ancient structures, he floated another interesting conjecture instead, per a video that surfaced via buzzfeed wednesday. \" my own personal theory is that joseph built the pyramids to store grain, \" carson said during his speech. \" now all the archaeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs ' graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. \" coupled with the fact of the pyramids ' \" many chambers that are hermetically sealed, \" carson said that that \" something big \" would had to have been grain storage units. That would back up the old testament story in which joseph has a vision of a coming famine and advises the egyptian pharaoh to build storage facilities for grain, buzzfeed notes. \" various … scientists have said, 'well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that's how, \" carson said at the time. \" you know, it doesn't require an alien being when god is with you. \" but that was 17 years ago.

Police say he has admitted vandalizing books in stores and libraries over the last several weeks, though it's unclear whether he had any help. Surveillance video shows him at the scene of several of the incidents, and he was apparently spotted putting up presumably anti-semitic fliers, reports rocket news 24, which rounds up accounts in japanese media outlets. In a not-so surprising development, those accounts suggest that the suspect \" appears to be mentally unstable. \" more than 300 books have been damaged in the vandalism spree, and israel's embassy in japan is donating replacements.",

Obama broached the subject toward the end of the conversation moderated by presidential historian jon meacham, however, after baker said he was most proud not to have been indicted while serving under three presidents. \" not only did i not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted, \" obama told the crowd of more than 1,000 invited guests, per the chronicle and kprc. \" it was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about … probably because the people who joined us were there for the right reasons, \" obama continued. Again without naming him, the 44th president also referenced trump's ideology — \" a nationalism that's not pride in country but hatred for somebody on the other side of the border, \" per the guardian — though the conversation mostly centered on political partisanship and the media. \" what you increasingly have is a media environment in which if you are a fox news viewer, you have an entirely different reality than if you are a new york times reader, \" obama said. \" it means the bases of each party have become more ideological. \" \" the responsible center in american politics has disappeared, \" baker agreed.

        "summary": "Japanese telecom giant softbank has finalized a $ 20.1 billion deal to buy 70 % of american wireless carrier sprint, reports the ap. The deal announced in tokyo today is the biggest-ever foreign takeover by a japanese company and still needs to be approved by sprint shareholders and american regulators. The deal would give sprint, america's third-largest wireless carrier, the funds to compete with at&t and verizon, but the deal looks like a risky move from softbank, which is already deeply in debt, the wall street journal notes. Shares in softbank have lost more than a fifth of their value since news of the deal first surfaced last week, reuters reports. The japanese company is gambling that the american market will offer better prospects for growth than its stagnant homeland. \" there is always a risk when you face a big challenge, \" softbank's billionaire founder masayoshi son said at a briefing today. \" it could be safe if you do nothing and our challenge in the us is not going to be easy at all. We must enter a new market, one with a different culture, and we must start again from zero after all we have built. But not taking this challenge will be a bigger risk. \"",

The deal for the third-largest u.s. Wireless carrier represents the most a japanese firm has spent on an overseas acquisition.

Parents are also having children later in life, which has been shown to increase the risk of autism. New jersey's rates were particularly high, while in alabama just 1 in 175 children is diagnosed. The study also showed that the disorder is still being diagnosed late, with the average coming at age 4, even though the disorder is detectable by age 2 — or perhaps even earlier than that.",

Per his rep, the nba legend learned of a 2014 study that found children in the north carolina city have the worst odds of kids in any major us city to get out of poverty. After that study, a task force was created to work on the problem, and \" michael really wanted to do something personally, \" his rep says. One of the task force's findings is that lack of access to health care is a critical factor in the city's economic-mobility problems. The donation will fund two novant health family clinics in communities that have some of the \" densest concentrations of poverty \" in the city, per the charlotte observer; the charlotte business journal notes the neighborhoods were ones identified by the task force. In addition to medical services, the clinics will offer behavioral health, physical therapy, social work, oral health, and family planning services. It's estimated they ' ll provide affordable care to almost 35,000 children and adults who don't currently have access to primary or preventive care, or who head to the er for non-emergency issues, the ap reports.

Rove remains one of the best-connected men in politics, and the new york times reports that top romney campaign officials were telling him the network had its call wrong, that ohio was too close to call. Fox, believing rove had insider info, let him air his objections. Meanwhile, those same advisers were urging romney not to concede, based on field reports from ohio, virginia, and florida. The campaign had four planes ready to go to fight recount battles. But before the campaign could announce its decision to press on, romney gave in. \" it's not going to happen, \" he said quietly. A few other salient details: while the times article says rove's behavior \" raises questions about his role, \" as analyst and super pac operative, there's no indication fox is actually concerned with that, mediaite points out. Indeed, fox vp michael clemente tells the ap that the incident improves rove's standing with the network, because he knew something fox didn't: only 1,000 votes separated the candidates in ohio. But the network knew something rove didn't: all the uncounted votes came from heavily democratic counties. \" it all came out at once, \" clemente says.",

Pittsburgh police say aaron goempel, 27, started throwing the hard-boiled eggs at the female victim after she accused him of cheating on her yesterday. When police arrived, goempel had barricaded himself in a bedroom, and when officers got through the door, he reached for swords and knives that were on top of his dresser, the pittsburgh tribune-review reports. But officers managed to get him outside, where he allegedly kicked one of them in the groin while hurling racist obscenities as police got him into the cruiser. They had covered his head with a pillowcase before taking him outside... Because, not surprisingly, he's had run-ins with the law before, and is known to be a spitter. He faces charges of aggravated assault. One of the eggs hit and bruised the victim's right eye, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports.",

And yes, plenty of critics call the wine undrinkable and worse, even accusing parent company bronco wine of not removing such harvest debris as dead birds, insects, and rodents from its crops of grapes. But far more people like it enough to buy it, with more than 800 million bottles sold since then. So business insider set out to calculate just how the wine can be produced so cheaply, and a lot of it comes down to simple location and sheer volume. Bronco wine may be \" bottled in napa valley, \" per its label, but the grapes are grown in a far less prestigious and ideal area: california's hot central valley. This means grapes grow in great abundance, with huge harvests, but the heat scorches quality. Bronco also ferments the wines in oak chips instead of barrels, uses a cheap form of natural cork for its corks, and ships in lighter bottles and cheaper brown boxes. The wines are even described as being \" freeway aged, \" meaning they only age on the truck ride to the bottling facility in napa, per marketplace. Volume helps, too, with 90 million gallons of wine produced a year.

And why not? it has few side effects, cures 90 % of patients, and, oh yeah, costs $ 1,000 a day. That price tag is causing turmoil throughout the health care system, cbs reports. Doctors can't resist prescribing it, but several insurers might see a more than 10 % drop in earnings because of it, one analyst tells the wall street journal. There are an estimated 3.2 million hepatitis c sufferers in the us, and if all those eligible for sovaldi took it, the price could be as much as $ 27 billion, one investment bank calculated, according to forbes. A lot of that burden would fall on taxpayers, because hepatitis c patients are often veterans, prisoners, uninsured, or on medicaid. Several democratic congressmen recently sent a letter demanding that sovaldi's maker, gilead, explain the price tag — especially given that it costs 99 % less in hepatitis-ridden egypt; congress has no power to alter the price, however. Gilead says its prices ( $ 84,000 for a full course of treatment in the us ) key off a country's per-capita income, and argues that it's still a good deal long-term, because it cures patients in 12 weeks. Upi points out that some hepatitis c sufferers ultimately require a liver transplant, which costs upward of $ 175,000.",

        "summary": "With less than a week to go until election day, hillary clinton is spending her time on attack instead of defense. At a rally in florida tuesday night, she made no mention of her emails, but she slammed donald trump as \" the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy \" and attacked his \" legally dubious \" avoidance of taxes, the orlando sentinel reports. The bbc reports that earlier tuesday, she also accused trump of being a \" bully \" to women and \" demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting \" them over more than 30 years. Her introductory speaker at a tuesday afternoon rally was alicia machado, the pageant winner who says trump called her \" miss piggy. \" in other coverage: speaking at a rally in wisconsin tuesday night, trump urged early clinton voters in the state with \" buyer's remorse \" to change their votes to trump before it's too late. He urged clinton voters in michigan, pennsylvania, and minnesota, which also allow vote changes, to do the same. Fox news explains how the vote-changing works in those four states. The washington post reports that the crusader, the kkk's main publication, offered a glowing endorsement of trump's message. The trump campaign forcefully rejected it. \" this publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of americans who are uniting behind our campaign, \" the campaign said in a statement tuesday night. The new york times reports that in a worrying development for the clinton campaign, early turnout among black voters is down significantly from 2012. In crucial swing state north carolina, black turnout is down around 16 % — and white turnout is up by almost the same amount. President obama will appear at a rally in north carolina wednesday to try to boost turnout, the ap reports. The clinton campaign says singer james taylor will also appear at the chapel hill rally. The hill reports that in more promising news for clinton, a poll released tuesday puts her support at 28 % among republican early voters in florida, and 55 % among early voters in general. Politico reports that texas land commissioner george p. Bush told a rally tuesday night that his uncle, george w. Bush, was likely to vote for clinton — and his grandfather, george hw bush, was likely to do the same.",

The hiker, who'd set out a full week earlier and left a note at home that he'd be home in a day or two, according to cnycentral.com, was severely dehydrated, weak, and disoriented, and a police captain says combs was unable to move once they did find him.

Cops arrested david zimmer, 66, in the strangulation of his estranged, wife, cathy, reports the san francisco chronicle. They also filed murder charges against his older brother robert, whose dna was found \" in an intimate area \" of cathy zimmer's clothing. Her body was found in the back seat of her car at the san jose airport, covered in a distinctive homemade quilt. Authorities revealed the presence of the quilt only last month in reopening the case, hoping that someone would come forward to help identify it. The two arrests came soon after, though it's not entirely clear whether the quilt made the difference. Authorities say david zimmer sold the couple's home for $ 225,000 and cashed in two insurance policies within a month of his 38-year-old wife's death, reports the san jose mercury news.

        "summary": "Your dramatic eye makeup could actually be unhealthy for your eyes assuming you're a contact lens wearer, according to a tiny pilot study that appears in eye and contact lens science and clinical practice. The study involves the \" waterline. \" that's the thin inner portion of the eyelash line, and it's a popular place to apply eyeliner: the waterline has an entire pinterest board dedicated to it; an allure article touts the \" big, open eyes \" you can get from putting makeup on it; and celebs like selena gomez apparently favor it. But researchers wanted to quantify how much eyeliner might enter the tear film — which a press release explains is \" the thin coating protecting the eye \" — when it's applied in one of two places: on the waterline, or outside the lash line, along the skin. The study involved just three female participants who visited twice on separate days. They were randomly assigned one of the two eyeliner application conditions, and used avon's \" glimmerstick. \" alison ng, a scientist at canada's university of waterloo, took more than 200 frames of video of the subjects ' eyes over a two-hour period to record the amount of particles that moved into the tear film. Ng says, \" the makeup migration happened quicker and was greater \" in the waterline scenarios. \" within five minutes, between 15 % and 30 % more particles moved into the eye's tear film, \" the release notes. That could lead to discomfort, says ng, or cause buildup on the lens ( especially when lenses are worn for several days ) that could fuel more troublesome problems, like irritation or even an eye infection. \" for anyone who wears heavy makeup or enjoys regularly applying beauty products around the eye, i would recommend daily disposable lenses for optimal cleanliness and comfort, \" she says.

The guardian reports that 19 of the 31 apartment buildings, each of them 17 stories, have yet to be fully checked. The australian delegation has complained that their assigned accommodation isn't fit to live in and other teams, including the italians, have had to hire outside contractors to deal with problems including water leaks and electrical faults. The president of the argentine olympic committee has also complained, saying two of the five floors assigned to his country are \" uninhabitable, \" the ap reports. Rio 2016 spokesman mario andrada admits that there are many problems, but he says people are working around the clock to get the apartment blocks ready for all 18,000 athletes and coaching staff set to arrive before the games begin august 5. The australians hope to move in by wednesday and rio mayor eduardo paes, who earlier joked about giving them a kangaroo to make them feel at home, has admitted that they had been assigned to the worst building in the complex. The olympic village was built by construction company odebrecht and property developer carvalho hosken. They had planned to profit by selling the apartments after the games, but a plunge in rio real estate prices — and the jailing of odebrecht's president for corruption earlier this year — could explain why the work wasn't completed to a high standard, the guardian notes.",

And a man from singapore, damian ng yih leong, posted on facebook that after seeing the conjuring 2 earlier this month he saw a cross drawn on a mirror in his hotel room. He and his companion got a new room, and when they returned to pick up items the next morning, \" the funny thing is that the cross that was drawn on the mirror was gone. \" some on social media say it's all \" a clever viral marketing stunt, \" per jakarta coconuts, and coincidentally the film could use a boost after opening in first place and slipping to the no. 3 spot this weekend, entertainment weekly reports.

        "summary": "It looks like the beginning of the end for angela merkel's long tenure as germany's chancellor. After her ruling party under-performed in state elections, merkel told leaders of her christian democratic union that this would be her final parliamentary term as chancellor, reports the ap. The current term ends in late 2021, and it's uncertain whether merkel will be able to remain even that long. Earlier reports said merkel informed cdu leaders that she would quickly step down as party leader but remain as chancellor, a post she has held since 2005. She has been cdu leader since 2000. The wall street journal sees even that move as a \" watershed moment \" for merkel, and not in a good way. It's not unprecedented for a german chancellor not to be leader of the ruling party — in fact that situation briefly applied to merkel's predecessor, gerhard schroeder, reports the ap. Schroeder lasted only a year, however, and merkel has long insisted that the positions be jointly held. Here is how the washington post puts it: \" while her departure would not automatically result in her stepping down as german chancellor, the move is an acknowledgment of her increasingly volatile position. \" on a similar note, the guardian expects a race to begin immediately within the cdu for the next chancellor.",

        "summary": "Lab results have revealed the answer to a mystery at an oklahoma zoo: just what caused a female lion to sprout a mane. The oklahoma city zoo says in its march newsletter that testing at the university of tennessee found the african lioness named bridget has an elevated level of androstenedione, a hormone that can contribute to developing male features. Veterinarians compared bridget's blood to samples from her sister, who has no mane. Bridget's blood also contained a higher level of cortisol, which regulates metabolism and the immune system, the ap reports. The zoo says the results likely mean the 18-year-old lioness has a benign tumor in her adrenal gland that's producing the hormones, but that her health is excellent. Kfor reports treatment isn't necessary right now, and that she ' ll keep the mane for as long as that remains the case. For male lions, testosterone production steps up around age 1, which is when they usually begin growing a mane. The zoo says female lions with manes are not unheard of, but they are rare. Indeed, national geographic reports on a case from 2011 in which a 13-year-old lioness kept in a south african zoo similarly developed a mane; in her case, the mane was traced to a \" virtually unheard of \" issue with her ovaries. ( a \" lion whisperer \" took three lions for a walk; it did not end well. )",

Dr. Jennifer d ' agostino, the director of veterinary services at the zoo, announced that the medical mystery is solved. Veterinarians took a blood sample from bridget and her sister, tia, to use as a side-by-side comparison to see what could be causing the mane growth.

        "summary": "Here's your fun fact for the day: contrary to popular belief, the x chromosome isn't shaped like an x at all — something that scientists have actually long been aware of. What they haven't known, however, is what that shape is... Until now. Per a paper published in nature, the first 3d model of the chromosome has been made using measurements taken of the x chromosome in mice, and it depicts what livescience likens to \" amoebas \" and \" lumpy blobs \"; the christian science monitor prefers \" a heap of threaded-up vermicelli. \" the model, which is tinier than a red blood cell, provides a \" map of how the chromosome folds, which parts touch and where, and who is next to who, \" explains paper author peter fraser. Before sharing the implications of this, the monitor gives some interesting history: the \" x \" designation started as a placeholder in 1890 ( \" x \" as \" unknown \" ) and turned out to be a temporarily appropriate moniker: in the instant before cells divide ( high-school biology refresher: we're talking about mitosis ), the splitting cell's soon-to-be-two-cells pull away from each other while attached at the middle, giving an x appearance. But only.01 % of your cells are dividing at any given time; the rest of the time things are more blob-like, and the new model will help scientists better understand which of the x chromosome's 153 million base pairs actually sit next to each other in their pasta-like state. Why this is a big deal: scientists should be able to better study which of the many bundled-together regions of the chromosome are related to things like aging and disease.

Gabrielle giffords walks on stage during the final day of the democratic national convention at time warner cable arena on september 6, 2012 in charlotte as we explained yesterday, today's the day of a high-profile senate hearing on gun safety and control featuring both the nra's wayne lapierre and mark kelly. The hearing is the senate judiciary committee's first on gun-related violence in more than 14 months, and is expected to lay the groundwork for whatever action the upper chamber ends up taking when it comes to guns. It's also likely to provide some good theater, as lapierre faces what is expected to be some harsh questions from gun-control advocates like the panel's dianne feinstein. Former rep. Gabby giffords made something of a surprise appearance to deliver prepared remarks to kick things off this morning. \" speaking is difficult,",

That's not the way the terminally ill single mother — the non-smoker has stage iv lung cancer that has spread to her brain, liver, rib, and spine — wants to go.

It's a very present fear. \" every day, when my daughter is coming home from work, she calls me on the phone to talk to me. You know why? she wants to know before she gets home if i ' m still alive. \" o'donnell says she's lived \" 10 people's lives \" — the practicing lawyer is a former sergeant in the lapd who tells abc7 she investigated hundreds of suicides. Kfor reports that the california state senate is considering bill 128, the end of life option act, and has until june 5 to pass it; in which case the assembly would have a sept. 11 deadline. O'donnell says that timeline is too long for her, and wants to be able to get a prescription that she could use when she feels the time has come. A press release from compassion &amp; choices, which filed the suit on the plaintiffs ' behalf, says the suit asserts \" that the california constitution and existing state law allow the medical practice of aid in dying. \" ( a well-known right-to-die opponent succumbed to cancer in march. )",

Barrels of crude oil that once fetched $ 110 each plunged as low as $ 45 a barrel earlier this year and are now hovering around $ 60 per barrel — an economic reality the post says has caused oil rigs to shut down and killed 44,000 jobs in the oil and gas drilling industry and related sectors since november, according to the adp research institute. \" it was like somebody knocked the wind out of you a little bit, \" an oil worker from enid, okla., tells the paper, explaining how he lost his job with an oil-field construction company during the crash. This oil and gas industry workforce that's suffering most is made up predominantly of men without college degrees, who can claim more than nine out of 10 jobs in this sector, per the post. The paper notes these workers were once able to command twice the salary of men in different industries with the same education. A caseworker for an oklahoma nonprofit tells the post she recently met someone who was forced to take an $ 8-an-hour job after previously working a $ 40-an-hour one, adding, \" i see people who are being evicted. I see people who are homeless. \" there are other industries that pay decent wages for men with only a high school education, the paper notes, including the railroads and power utilities sectors — but they don't have enough open positions to take in all the newly unemployed and haven't enjoyed the same salary growth as the oil industry.

            "The plummeting price of oil is still the biggest energy story in the world. It's bringing back cheap gasoline to the united states while wreaking havoc on oil-producing countries like russia and venezuela. But why does the price of oil keep falling? back in june 2014, the price of brent crude was up around $ 115 per barrel. As of january 23, 2015, it had fallen by more than half, down to $ 49 per barrel: the short version of the story goes like this: for much of the past decade, oil prices have been high — bouncing around $ 100 per barrel since 2010 — because of soaring oil consumption in countries like china and conflicts in key oil nations like iraq. Oil production in conventional fields couldn't keep up with demand, so prices spiked. By 2014, oil supply was much higher than demand but beneath the surface, many of those dynamics were rapidly shifting. High prices spurred companies in the us and canada to start drilling for new, hard-to-extract crude in north dakota's shale formations and alberta's oil sands. Then, over the last year, demand for oil in places like europe, asia, and the us began tapering off,"

            "What do russia, exxon mobil, and isis have in common? not much, except that they're all grappling with an inconvenient but incontrovertible truth: a sudden, significant, and prolonged shift in the price of oil changes the world. That truth was on display in 1974, and it's on display again now. Over the course of just a few months in 1973-1974, the price of oil surged from $ 3 to $ 12 per barrel. The new price created new global economic powers: oil-producing countries primarily in the middle east and north africa. It also dealt a severe blow to the economies of the united states, europe, japan, and other oil importers. The oil shock altered power relations between the world's main geopolitical players and created new ones. Higher oil prices had many unexpected consequences — from breeding oil wars to fueling the international spread of islamic fundamentalism thanks to funding from newly super-rich countries like saudi arabia. Today's drop in crude-oil prices, which began in the summer of 2014, may be as disruptive as the quadrupling of oil prices that created the oil shock of 1974. Some of the effects of this decline in oil prices have been clear and immediate; picture",

            "The plummeting price of oil is still the biggest energy story in the world. It's bringing back cheap gasoline to the united states while wreaking havoc on oil-producing countries like russia and venezuela. But why does the price of oil keep falling? back in june 2014, the price of brent crude was up around $ 115 per barrel. As of january 23, 2015, it had fallen by more than half, down to $ 49 per barrel: the short version of the story goes like this: for much of the past decade, oil prices have been high — bouncing around $ 100 per barrel since 2010 — because of soaring oil consumption in countries like china and conflicts in key oil nations like iraq. Oil production in conventional fields couldn't keep up with demand, so prices spiked. By 2014, oil supply was much higher than demand but beneath the surface, many of those dynamics were rapidly shifting. High prices spurred companies in the us and canada to start drilling for new, hard-to-extract crude in north dakota's shale formations and alberta's oil sands. Then, over the last year, demand for oil in places like europe, asia, and the us began tapering off,"

It's a little complicated, but the strains of yeast that ferment wine ( along with beer and bread ) are \" polyploid \" strains. Those strains \" contain multiple copies of genes in the genome, \" says yong-su jin, whose study was published in applied and environmental microbiology. The difficulty comes into play when you try to alter a gene in one copy of the genome. Essentially, you can't: \" an unaltered copy would correct the one that had been changed. \" the enzyme fixes that problem. It allows the genetic engineering of polyploid strains, specifically saccharomyces cerevisiae — which you're more likely to know as baker's yeast, jove notes. Researchers are calling the engineered result a \" jailbreaking \" yeast. Engineered yeast could make wine healthier by boosting the amount of a nutrient called resveratrol \" by 10 times or more, \" jin notes. As for post-booze headaches, the \" genome knife \" could act on what's known as malolactic fermentation, which can result in hangover-inducing toxic substances. That's good news, though medical daily reports that the variety of factors leading to hangovers likely means such a product wouldn't get rid of them completely.

        "summary": "China's newest stealth fighter was surprisingly unveiled tuesday as two chengdu j-20 twin-engine prototypes flew at an airshow in zhuhai in front of a cheering crowd. According to us officials, washington is actually deserving of the applause. They believe chinese hackers stole data on america's f-35 and f-22 fighter jets to help build the j-20, in the works since 2011 and scheduled to take to the sky around 2018. The j-20 — which china claims can detect the f-22, per popular mechanics — certainly looks like its us counterparts and could potentially overpower them in number. But one analyst suspects it won't be as stealthy or as quick, based on a visual inspection and china's issues with engines, per nbc news. The jet will have the \" sacred mission of safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, \" says a chinese military rep. Of concern to the us, however, is how the jet will be used amid territorial disputes in the south china sea. \" it gives china a modern long-range strike capability that is able to carry much heavier payloads into areas of the pacific and south china sea that it was previously unable to reach in an effective manner, \" says an analyst. Us air force chief of staff gen. David goldfein certainly didn't seem too worried in august, though. \" it's no longer about a [ single aircraft ], it's about a family of systems and it's about a network, and that's what gives us an asymmetric advantage, \" he said when asked about the j-20.",

        "summary": "On the whole, working out is good for people. But when digging into the numbers, researchers have found a wide range of responses to regimens: some people reap tremendous benefits, while others actually regress in their fitness, reports the new york times. But new research suggests that these so-called \" non-responders \" just need to switch up their game plan and find something their bodies respond to instead of sweating over lack of progress. Reporting in the journal plos one, researchers note a simple at-home test that can help people learn if they're getting anything out of a particular workout: measure your fitness level before starting a new fitness regimen by quickly stepping onto and off a box or climbing stairs, then check your pulse to get a baseline number. After a month of exercising, do the test again; if your pulse rate hasn't gone down, you might not be responding to the exercise you chose and you should consider a different type of workout. Researchers found that people who didn't respond well to endurance training did respond to interval training, and vice versa. These findings suggest \" there is no one-size-fits-all approach to exercise, \" the lead researcher tells the times. \" but it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone. \" while they have yet to find any correlation between age, sex, or ethnicity and being a non-responder, researchers find it tends to run in families, suggesting genes play a role. And roughly a third of people tested fit the bill. Some non-responders benefit from higher-intensity workouts in particular, meaning that this study highlights why the \" just get to the gym \" advice doesn't work for everyone, shape notes: \" you're better off turning up the intensity — whether it's with bodyweight tabata workouts, functional fitness routines, or lifting free weights. \" ( don't like intense workouts? music helps. )",

            "The current study examined the adaptive response to both endurance ( end ) and sprint interval training ( sit ) in a group of twenty-one recreationally active adults. All participants completed three weeks ( four days/ week ) of both end ( 30 minutes at ~65 % vo2peak work rate ( wr ) and sit ( eight, 20-second intervals at ~170 % vo2peak wr separated by 10 seconds of active rest ) following a randomized crossover study design with a three-month washout period between training interventions. While a main effect of training was observed for vo2peak, lactate threshold, and submaximal heart rate ( hr ), considerable variability was observed in the individual responses to both end and sit. No significant positive relationships were observed between end and sit for individual changes in any variable. Non-responses were determined using two times the typical error ( te ) of measurement for vo2peak ( 0.107 l/min ), lactate threshold (",

Since then, other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens, with some packing on power and mass and others losing both.
