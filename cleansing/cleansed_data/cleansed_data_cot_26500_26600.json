Surbaugh apologized last week to members of the scouting community who were offended by the political rhetoric in trump's july 24 speech in west virginia. Other us presidents have delivered nonpolitical speeches at past jamborees. To the dismay of many parents and former scouts, trump promoted his political agenda and derided his rivals, inducing some of the scouts in attendance to boo at the mention of barack obama, his predecessor. Stephenson, in a phone interview with the ap two days after the speech, said boy scout leaders anticipated trump would spark controversy with politically tinged remarks, yet felt obliged to invite him out of respect for his office.",

After the trump administration recommended new 25 % tariffs on $ 50 billion in chinese goods tuesday, beijing hit back within hours with its own proposed tariffs on 106 american products accounting for around $ 50 billion in trade, raising fears of an all-out trade war between the world's two biggest economies, the new york times reports. The new categories of american goods that would face tariffs under the move include aircraft, soybeans, and cars, which were last year's three biggest exports from the us to china, reports the guardian. Other goods targeted include whisky, tobacco, cotton, wheat, and corn. As asian markets tumbled, a foreign ministry spokesman in beijing slammed trump's approach to trade issues. \" those who attempt to make china surrender through pressure or intimidation have never succeeded before, and will not succeed now, \" said geng shuang. Sources tell the wall street journal that many of the 106 items on china's list, including sorghum and beef, were included in an attempt to target states that voted for trump. But both sides still have a chance to back down from the brink of trade war. China hasn't said when its tariffs will take effect, and the us tariffs are not due to take effect until may 11 at the earliest.

Like other reviewers, she does have one qualm: gordon-levitt's \" distracting \" prosthetic makeover to look more like willis. \" little here is as initially transfixing as mr. Gordon-levitt's mug. \" at the new york post, lou lumenick puts it simply. \" an indie-inflected popcorn movie with major brains, brilliant acting and a highly satisfying payoff, looper is the first must-see movie of the season. \" but at slate, dana stevens isn't as impressed, calling the film \" a maddening near-miss: it posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship...

The conflict between ukraine and separatists has been going on since russia annexed crimea in 2014. More than 10,000 people have been killed. Russia denies us and ukraine accusations of supplying weapons to separatists. Until this point, the us had only been providing ukraine with non-weapon support. However, earlier this week the trump administration announced us manufacturers could begin to sell some small arms to ukraine. The state department was clear those weapons weren't coming from the us government. The announcement friday that the us government would supply weapons to ukraine was not welcomed by russia, where deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said the decision \" raises the danger of derailing the process of peaceful settlement in ukraine. \" providing arms to ukraine likely won't help the us/russia relationship any, and germany's angela merkel and france's emmanuel macron released a statement urging a peaceful resolution to the conflict.",

Hagel's facing skepticism and outright opposition from both sides of the aisle over past stances, particularly on israel and nuclear proliferation. But he also has friends from his senate tenure, and has been going on what the washington post terms a \" charm offensive, \" meeting with more than 50 senators and special interest group founders. A look at how things stand going into today's hearing: there are 14 democrats and 12 republicans on the armed services committee, but insiders say there's no guarantee hagel will get all the democrats. \" if you read the tea leaves, i think he might get more republican votes than people might think, \" adds one aide. A number of senators have seen their states pelted by ads from groups funded by anonymous donors opposing hagel — including one that sprung up weeks ago for expressly that purpose, the wall street journal reports. \" this is unprecedented, \" says one democrat. \" this is not a presidential campaign. \" hagel will offer a \" blunt rebuttal \" of his critics, the post says. He ' ll also voice his support for israel and his view of the pentagon's fiscal challenges. Gay rights groups have largely dropped their complaints over hagel's \" aggressively gay \" comment; the ambassador who was on the receiving end of that slur has even endorsed him. But questions persist over hagel's commitment to israel, despite endorsements from friends like rabbi aryeh azriel of the temple of israel in omaha, cnn reports. Major hagel foe james inhofe says israel is hagel's biggest vulnerability. But it's far from his only one. Many are also skeptical of hagel's views on nuclear proliferation ( he co-authored a study calling for the us to drop 900 of its roughly 5,000 warheads ), defense spending ( he's called the pentagon budget \" bloated \" ), and afghanistan ( he criticized the 2009 surge by saying the us was \" marking time as we slaughter more young people \" ). Inhofe and five other republicans also asked hagel in a letter this week to explain his ties to several companies with defense department contracts. Hagel has promised to divest himself of all such ties.

Obama himself postponed meeting the dalai lama in washington dc in deference to chinese sensitivities. But in beijing, there was an unmistakable sense that he stooped to concur, that china talked to him not just as an equal, but as an ascendant power.experts noted that beijing virtually micro-managed obama's visit, rejected us pleas on almost every major issue ( monetary policy, climate change, human rights etc )",

The question agitating their minds is whether his engagement with beijing marked a visible shift in the international power dynamic, with the us openly acquiescing to chinese influence in the world, with the possible return of a bi-polar world. ( watch video in the past few months japan, australia, new zealand among others have bowed to beijing on various issues. Obama himself postponed meeting the dalai lama in washington dc in deference to chinese sensitivities. But in beijing, there was an unmistakable sense that he stooped to concur, that china talked to him not just as an equal, but as an ascendant power.experts noted that beijing virtually micro-managed obama's visit, rejected us pleas on almost every major issue ( monetary policy, climate change, human rights etc )",

Their confident prediction is based on norse folklore that ragnarok will happen after three freezing winters with no summers in between, which usa today notes is a \" subjective call \" after two lousy summers in northern europe. The organizers — who have a countdown to doomsday on their website — say they're pretty sure the god heimdallr blew the mystical gjallerhorn on nov. 15 as \" a portent of doom, \" marking the start of a 100-day countdown to the norse apocalypse, reports the independent. \" ragnarok is the ultimate landmark in viking mythology, when the gods fall and die, so this really is an event that should not be underestimated, \" the festival's director says. Two human survivors will remain to populate the world, but if your name isn't liv or livtrasir and you don't dwell in the underworld, you're out of luck.

        "summary": "After double tragedies rocked australia last week, farmer tom wagner couldn't bear hearing about another. So when he heard a dad and his two young sons had disappeared on a road trip and been missing for a week, wagner canceled his waterskiing plans, conferred with other local farmers and churchgoers, and took off on his atv to search for them in nearby expedition national park, news.com.au reports. His efforts paid off when he located steven van lonkhuyzen and sons ethan, 7, and timothy, 5, yesterday, near their four-wheel-drive vehicle, which was mired in the mud, the ap reports. A queensland police rep says that lonkhuyzen was trying to cut through the park — not usually frequented this time of year because of inhospitable weather — from his home in brisbane to a friend's house in cairns when he made a wrong turn. The trio was able to survive in the hot, muggy wilderness thanks to several factors. Lonkhuyzen carefully rationed their four-day food supply — they were down to their last bread slices when wagner found them, the guardian reports — and caught rainwater to drink in a plastic container. Lonkhuyzen also kept the family next to the car, set up eye-catching items around the vehicle in case search parties came by, and made the boys stick to a daily routine. The last piece of the puzzle was wagner, who had been tending his cattle when he saw their vehicle enter the remote national park a few days earlier. The boys are recovering and in stable condition at a local hospital, and wagner says he hopes to stay in contact with them. \" it's good to have a good story like that in time for christmas, \" he says. ( here's how a man lost at sea for 12 days survived. )",

        "summary": "Facebook hosted its annual developers ' conference on tuesday, but mark zuckerberg pivoted briefly to discuss the weekend murder of a man in cleveland that was broadcast on facebook live. \" we have a lot more to do here, \" he said, per the bbc, offering sympathy to the family of victim of robert godwin. \" we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening. \" but how the company can do that is the difficult question. A look at coverage: when facebook live launched last year, zuckerberg said he wanted \" raw and visceral \" video, and the company has been plagued by clips of killings, torture, and suicides, reports the washington post. One law professor's pessimistic take: \" i don't think it's a solvable problem. \" the new york times takes a similar deep dive into the issue, noting that facebook currently relies on an \" imperfect \" combination of high-tech tools and human moderators. If enough users object to a video, algorithms alert the moderators, who can assess and delete as necessary. In the cleveland case, the shooting video was up for about two hours before facebook removed it. The company lays out the timeline here, adding, \" we know we must do better. \" at slate, will oremus suggests that facebook doesn't seem to have thought out the ramifications of facebook live before launch. It always seems \" woefully unprepared \" after each new instance of trouble, and the technical difficulty of a fix is no excuse. \" if the company's reputation suffers because it can't find better ways to handle it, that's ( no one's ) fault but its own. \" a post at recode wonders if it's time to shut down facebook live altogether — whether it's \" worth the pain of exposing users to murder and torture. \" short of ditching facebook live, the company could restrict it to verified users, notes a post at fortune. But that's unlikely given that facebook thinks video will play such a vital role in its future, it adds. A post at smallbiztrends notes that live videos now account for one in five videos shared on facebook, which it sees as impressive growth. But a post at cnbc notes that advertisers remain leery, because they're worried about being linked to heinous content. Another facebook live video is currently making headlines: a migrant activist based in san diego disappeared in mexico after posting a video asking for help along a highway. Authorities are poring over the video for clues, reports the union-tribune",

Based on these factors, some very important jobs rank unfavorably against other professions. The worst jobs of 2017 are some of the cornerstones of our society, and great careers for those with the personality types able to face stress ( and sometimes danger ) head-on. The two lowest-ranking jobs of 2017 have recently taken center stage in american culture in a way not seen in many years. The value of trained, professional newspaper reporters and broadcasters has taken on heightened importance recently as well as increased scrutiny. Journalists covering politics in particular, have been under extreme pressure as they strive to credibly cover the news and keep our nation informed. Working extensively in the public eye and often under tight deadlines contributes to the high stress rankings",

Smoking marijuana in public is still illegal, and with cops in anchorage ready to start handing out $ 100 fines, there are unlikely to be any major public celebrations of the change in the law, the ap reports. For now, alaskans in need of weed will have to grow their own or rely on friends: it's legal to grow up to six marijuana plants at home and for adults to give each other up to an ounce of pot, the alaska dispatch reports in a look at questions surrounding the law. But forget about bartering things like firewood for pot: the director of the state's alcoholic beverage control board, which is overseeing legalization, tells the dispatch that trades and barters are still considered sales and the board isn't going to allow a \" system with giant loopholes for marijuana. \" ( new research says marijuana is a lot safer than other drugs, including alcohol. )",

        "summary": "The senate's gun control bill cleared its first major hurdle today, as the chamber voted 68-31 to begin debate, defeating at least the first attempt to filibuster the bill. Sixteen republicans joined 52 democrats in voting to begin debate, the washington post reports, while two democrats voted against. But despite the encouraging vote — and a bipartisan compromise on background checks — don't expect smooth sailing; the hill expects the debate to last weeks. Here's what you need to know: the nra came out with a statement last night saying it is \" unequivocally opposed \" to the safe communities, safe schools act of 2013, and specifically called out the \" misguided ' compromise ' proposal drafted by senators joe manchin, pat toomey, and chuck schumer, \" reports the huffington post. The public is \" far ahead \" of politicians on gun control, said vp joe biden in a morning joe appearance today, per politico. \" you saw it in immigration, marriage issues, you're seeing it now. The public has moved to a different place. \" case in point: 91 % of military veterans support background checks, according to a survey by one liberal group, reports politico. Vets also support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines ( 61 % ), and 58 % favor banning assault-style weapons. This marks the first time \" in a generation \" that a meaty gun measure has hit the floor, reports the los angeles times. Senate officials say gun rights advocates plan to take a similar tack as last time: stretch out the debate on amendments, particularly ones that would broaden gun owners ' rights; hope democrats running next year in conservative states back them; then hope so many of those amendments pass that gun control advocates sour on the bill.",

A gop aide says the congressional budget office is looking at two versions of the better care reconciliation act — one of which contains an amendment by cruz that is getting support from moderate and conservative republicans in the house and senate. The cruz amendment would allow insurance providers to sell any kind of policies they wanted — as long as they also sold at least one policy that complies with aca requirements. Those requirements include covering maternity care and mental healthcare and not charging sick people more for insurance. Under the cruz amendment, americans without health risks could buy cheaper, non-comprehensive plans, while americans with health problems could buy the more expensive, aca-compliant plans, the new york times reports. Government subsidies for those aca-compliant plans would be available to people making less than $ 42,000 or so per year. Conservative republicans like the plan because \" it gives everybody some options, \" while moderates like that it semi-preserves protections for pre-existing conditions. But experts warn such segmenting leads to expensive and volatile insurance markets. Meanwhile, as his amendment is being considered, cruz was nearly shouted down during a fourth of july speech by protesters upset with his healthcare efforts, the texas tribune reports.",

Ryan is being lambasted today for what sally kohn of fox news calls \" an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech. \" here's what the critics are saying: ryan said obama broke a promise by not saving a gm plant in janesville, wis. But politifact could find no evidence that obama explicitly made such a promise and, more importantly, the plant closed before obama was even sworn in. Ryan chastised obama for creating a bipartisan debt commission and doing nothing with its findings. But as talking points memo points out, ryan was on that commission — and voted against it, as did the panel's other republicans. Ryan attacked obama for the s&p's downgrade of america's sovereign credit rating. Which is rich, writes brett logiurato of business insider, because the s&p specifically said that it downgraded the rating \" because the majority of republicans in congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues. \" he repeated the romney campaign's frequent assertion that obama \" funneled \" $ 716 billion out of medicare to pay for obamacare. Actually, the affordable care act reduces payments to health care providers, not medicare's budget. In another oft-repeated distortion, ryan said obama wanted to credit the government with the private sector's successes. \" that isn't what the president said. Period, \" kohn writes. The speech also gave mitt romney credit for bringing up household income as governor of massachusetts. That's only half-true, politifact rules: adjust for inflation, and income actually decreased. Near the end, ryan described protecting the poor as the \" greatest of all responsibilities. \" according to tpm, two-thirds of the cuts in his budget proposal come from programs that help the poor.",

The study casts doubt on the legacy of bill clinton's sweeping welfare reform two decades ago, notes the guardian. Among the institute's recommendations: expanding school meals in the summer and after class, creating jobs for kids, and keeping kids out of the criminal justice system.

Hawaii emergency management agency administrator vern miyagi explained sunday that the inbound missile alert was sent by a member of his team during a routine test that happens at the start of every shift, nbc news reports. Miyagi said he took responsibility for the error and the 38-minute delay in issuing an all-clear. Agency spokesman richard rapoza explained that an employee chose the wrong option from a drop-down menu, activating a missile warning instead of a test alert, reuters reports. The employee then clicked \" yes \" when the system asked whether he wanted to proceed, rapoza said. Rapoza said the employee responsible has been \" temporarily reassigned \" to other duties. Miyagi said procedures are being changed and from now on, activation of the test and a real incoming-missile alert will require two people, and a command that can cancel a mistaken activation within seconds will be created, usa today reports. He said the reason it took so long to cancel saturday's alert was because no such button was in place. Federal communications commission chairman ajit pai, whose agency is investigating the incident, said sunday that it appears \" reasonable safeguards \" were lacking.

The indictment is the clearest allegation yet of russian efforts to meddle in american politics, per the ap. The indictment lays out a sweeping and coordinated effort to break into key democratic email accounts, including those belonging to the democratic national committee, the clinton campaign, and the democratic congressional campaign committee.

Pennsylvania teen jacinda cambray was celebrating her sweet 16 birthday with about 40 guests in her family's backyard on sunday when a party pooper brought the event to a screeching halt. Family members had just brought the teen's giant purple cake inside when \" out of nowhere, from the sky, comes a bunch of feces, \" stepfather joe cambray tells fox 29. \" it was brown. It was everywhere. It got on everything, \" a relative adds, per fox6. While it isn't clear where exactly the poop came from, joe cambray's sister quickly checked her smartphone and found there were five planes flying over their location at the time, spawning a theory that one had illegally unloaded its waste on the party. Though party guests were swimming and playing horseshoes, most of the feces landed on a canopy that cambray says he had purchased just hours earlier to protect visitors in case it rained. \" i was eating cake, and then i just heard a big splat! \" one partygoer says. Cambray says he washed away most of the waste with a hose, but \" everybody was not very happy! \" tv reporters, at least, have been having fun with the story. Philadelphia magazine points out fox 29 reporter brad sattin's best line of his coverage: \" in airport lingo, jacinda's sweet 16 party certainly should have qualified as a dooty-free zone. \" as all planes are required to get rid of waste at airports, the family has filed a complaint with the faa, which is investigating.

The research published in science translational medicine suggests that old infections in the brain — or, more specifically, the body's attempt to fight them off — may be at the root of the disease. The study revolves around the telltale plaque in the brain associated with alzheimer's, which is caused by a buildup of a protein called amyloid beta. Scientists have never been sure why the protein begins to build up as people age. \"does it play a role in the brain, or is it just garbage that accumulates? \" is how harvard's rudolph tanzi frames the question per new scientist. His study suggests that it does indeed play a role, and an important one: the body produces the protein to fight off infections that pass into the brain through the blood-brain barrier; the problem occurs when it doesn't get properly cleared away after the fight. \"it's interesting and provocative, \" an alzheimer's researcher at the university of california, san francisco, tells the times of theory. It's been tested on mice and roundworms but not humans yet. \" most shocking of all, \" writes scientific american, \" was that when they injected bacteria into the brains of alzheimer's mouse models, amyloid plaques — the hallmark of the disease — formed within 48 hours. \" if further research backs up the notion, it could lead to new ways of treating the disease. For example, if this protein that eventually causes trouble comes into being originally as a way to fight pathogens, \" you could vaccinate against those pathogens, and potentially prevent this problem arising later in life, \" says tanzi's co-author, robert moir of massachusetts general hospital.

            "General consensus among alzheimer's researchers has it that the disease's main culprit, a protein called amyloid beta, is an unfortunate waste product that is not known to play any useful role in the body — and one that can have devastating consequences.

The protein has thus become a major drug target in the search for a cure to alzheimer's. Now a team of researchers at harvard medical school and massachusetts general hospital are proposing a very different story. In a study published this week in science translational medicine, neurologists rudolph tanzi and robert moir report evidence that amyloid beta serves a crucial purpose: protecting the brain from invading microbes. \"the original idea goes back to 2010 or so when rob had a few too many coronas, \" tanzi jokes. Moir had come across surprising similarities between amyloid beta and ll37, a protein that acts as a foot soldier in the brain's innate immune system, killing potentially harmful bugs and alerting other cells to their presence. \"these types of proteins, although small, are very sophisticated in what they do, \" moir says. \"and they're very ancient, going back to the dawn of multicellular",

        "summary": "Perhaps you know someone who's written his name in snow, you know, with urine. That's essentially what some fish do every day. In a study titled, \" to pee or not to pee: urine signals mediate aggressive interactions in the cooperatively breeding cichlid, \" researchers explain that urination for the cichlid fish is not only a bodily function but also a form of communication, per science. To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually. But the fish also gave off a chemical signal with urine. In cases where the barrier had tiny holes allowing water to flow through, for example, the smaller fish appeared to get a signal from the larger fish to stop their attack since they were more likely to show aggression when the barrier was solid. Both the smaller and larger fish also peed more when presented with another fish than they did when alone, especially when the barrier between them kept them from receiving the other fish's signals. Researchers are only beginning to understand this form of communication, but gizmodo sums it up thusly: \" fish literally have pissing contests. \" ( big and small mammals take the same amount of time to pee. )",

It turns out that angry cichlids let out some pee to tell one another they're pissed. Fish literally have pissing contests. Advertisement the first step was to create an experiment to measure when and why the fish were relieving themselves. The researchers built special fish tanks in which two fish are separated by an opaque barrier and a transparent barrier. In some tanks the barriers had holes, and in other tanks they lacked holes. Once the fish were acclimated to the water, the scientists anesthetized them and injected them with a special dye to help track their pee — this also turned the naturally pink fish blue. Finally, they measured the amount of fish pee and number of pee pulses, removed the opaque barrier, measured the pee, put the barrier back, and measured the pee again.

The creatures are vital to coral because they eat algae and grasses that have now overwhelmed the reefs. Parrotfish and and surgeonfish also keep the vegetation in check, but overfishing has reduced their populations. Meanwhile, warmer waters have forced out beneficial algae that prevent the reefs from bleaching and dying. \"the caribbean system is one of first systems to experience collapse, \" says a researcher. \" it's something that will happen across the globe if human use of coral reefs continues as it is. \"",

        "summary": "A new study out of britain reveals that pain during sex afflicts a surprising number of women. The survey of nearly 7,000 sexually active women found that one in 10 reported some type of pain during intercourse, the bbc reports. Writing in bjog: an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology, the authors note that painful sex ( dyspareunia ) is a neglected, often chronic problem that afflicts women around the world. The latest sampling of women aged 16 to 74 found that women in their late 50s and 60s were most affected, though younger women were not spared. Pain during sex can be caused by vaginal dryness, particularly post-menopause, but can have more serious roots in untreated conditions such as stds, endometriosis, and fibroids. Emotional causes such as anxiety can also play a role. \" you worry and get tense and that only makes it worse, \" says one middle-aged woman of the \" vicious cycle. \" after her sex drive dipped, she experienced vaginismus, involuntary tightening of the vaginal muscles during penetration. One quarter of the women who reported painful sex said it happened often or all the time in the past six months. About 33 % said they were unhappy with their sex life. Lead author dr. Kirstin mitchell says embarrassment prevents many women from seeking help, including young women new to sex who may be ill at ease. Given that women aged 16-24 came in second in the survey, she urged better sex education in school — \" for example the importance of being able to talk about what you like and don't like, \" per the independent.

The survey of nearly 7,000 sexually active women aged 16 to 74, in bjog: an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology, suggests this medical problem - called dyspareunia - is common and affects women of all ages. Women in their late 50s and early 60s are most likely to be affected, followed by women aged 16-24. Doctors say there are treatments that can help if women seek advice. But many still find the subject embarrassing and taboo, the survey results show. Painful sex was strongly linked to other sexual problems, including vaginal dryness, feeling anxious during sex, and lack of enjoyment of sex. However, there can be lots of different physical, psychological and emotional factors causing painful sex, which can be complex to treat.

            "Image copyright thinkstock nearly one in 10 british women finds sex painful, according to a big study. The survey of nearly 7,000 sexually active women aged 16 to 74, in bjog: an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology, suggests this medical problem - called dyspareunia - is common and affects women of all ages. Women in their late 50s and early 60s are most likely to be affected, followed by women aged 16-24. Doctors say there are treatments that can help if women seek advice. But many still find the subject embarrassing and taboo, the survey results show. Painful sex was strongly linked to other sexual problems, including vaginal dryness, feeling anxious during sex, and lack of enjoyment of sex. However, there can be lots of different physical, psychological and emotional factors causing painful sex, which can be complex to treat. Some women said they avoided intercourse because they were so afraid of the pain.

Many must instead sleep in cattle sheds, as the guardian explained in a feature earlier this year.

        "summary": "The age-old stunt of cow tipping isn't an age-old stunt after all, writes jake swearingen at modern farmer. In fact, he argues that it never happens in the real world, only in the movies. Don't believe him? go scour youtube and prove him wrong. You won't find a single such cow-tipping video for a simple reason: physics. It would be virtually impossible for a single person to dig in a shoulder and tip a cow, and almost as impossible for two or three. Physicists who studied the matter thought that six people might be able to get the job done. Still don't believe him? talk to actual dairy farmers, as he does, and they ' ll clue you in: cow tipping is an urban legend, rural-style. Swearingen explains some of the other reasons — cows don't sleep standing up, and they're naturally wary animals, for example — to dispel the pop-culture myth, but he also digs into why it persists. One reason is \" that the closest many people come to a cow is seeing a holstein along the interstate. \" it looks easy to do from there, until you walk up to a 1,400-pound dairy cow in person. Another: cow tipping is a \" muddier, drunker, and more dangerous version of the snipe hunt \" — that is, sending out a sucker on a futile mission, all for entertainment purposes. \" in other words, as long as there's booze, gullibility and a pasture nearby, cow tipping will live on, \" writes swearingen. \" luckily for the cows, there's very little chance they ' ll ever end up actually on their sides. \" at takepart, one iowan who always felt \" vaguely un-iowan \" for never trying now feels vindicated.",

        "summary": "The mexican peso hit an all-time low against the dollar wednesday shortly after president-elect donald trump took the stage, reports reuters, falling to 22 pesos on the dollar. The peso was already in freefall, dropping 2 % on tuesday and almost 16 % against the dollar since trump's election victory amid fears that his administration will renegotiate the north american free trade agreement. The thinking is that such a move would bring tariffs against mexico — which sends 80 % of its exports to the us — sparking a recession, reports the wall street journal. The dip would have been greater if mexico's central bank hadn't sold $ 2 billion in dollar reserves last week, per reuters. But a former mexican finance minister adds further depreciation is \" almost inevitable. \" inflation also hit its fastest pace in two years in december. \" a renegotiation of nafta would basically kill mexico's growth model, \" says an economist, adding strict trade terms could shrink mexico's economy by 3.3 % this year after 2.1 % growth in 2016. \" trump is manipulating mexico's currency through his tweets — against the us interest, \" adds a former mexican trade official. He argues a declining peso could mean less mexicans buying american goods and more illegal immigration across the border. The peso also plunged in 1995, when mexico received a $ 12.5 billion loan from washington, since repaid. But \" trump has a very adversarial relationship with mexico and would likely be much less cooperative in terms of bilateral aid, \" a strategist says.

However this doesn't mean that s&p will change its mind. The news was first reported by cnbc, abc, cnn, and politico earlier this evening.

And then the event's host tried to be funny: french dj martin solveig asked hegerberg to dance and wondered if she knew how to twerk, reports time. Hegerberg responded \" no \" and began walking off stage, the moment captured here, though she did remain to dance with solveig to a frank sinatra song. The \" twerk \" question, though, exploded on social media, with solveig coming under worldwide criticism for sexism. \"this is disgusting, \" tweeted us soccer great abby wambach. \"imagine having just been given the best award for your craft/job/passion, and this is the question you're asked?! \" from the tennis world, andy murray called it \"another example of the ridiculous sexism in sport, \" per the guardian. Solveig tweeted an apology video, saying it was a \" bad joke \" and not meant to offend, and hegerberg herself told the bbc that she didn't perceive it as an insult in the moment. \" i was just happy to do the dance and win the ballon d ' or, to be honest. \" though hegerberg isn't joining the anti-solveig bandwagon, she is a big proponent for women's equality in sport. The ap reports, for example, that she won't play for norway in next year's women's world cup because she thinks the team's players aren't treated fairly. \" it's all about how we respect women's football, \" she said. \" i don't think the respect has been there. \" ( people were miffed about us soccer star brandi chastain's likeness on a plaque. )",

Many of the people devin went on to kill that sunday were people danielle knew and loved. \" if it was only me that could've died and everybody else could've been alive, \" danielle said. \" i would've gladly taken that. \" devin kelley also injured 20 people before fleeing in a car and ultimately taking his own life.

        "summary": "Workers are planning to dump 18,000 tons of concrete into the gulf of mexico — for a good reason. Hurricanes and changing currents have destroyed the reef system in gulf waters around florida's collier county, according to the community foundation of collier county, so the county, along with the cities of marco and naples, came up with a plan: the concrete will be placed on the gulf floor to form what workers say will be the biggest artificial reef in the western hemisphere, the houston chronicle reports. In fact, 36 individual reefs will be built simultaneously in groups of six, and \" we can continue to add more reefs once this is done, \" says a member of the region's economic recovery task force. Workers have been inspecting the concrete — some of it old piping — to make sure it's safe for the ocean. The $ 1.5 million project is being funded in part by a grant from the bp oil spill restoration fund, along with private donations, and advocates hope that — in addition to boosting the local marine ecosystem — the reef system will ultimately bring in $ 30 million to the area annually. The reefs could offer a safe habitat for young sport fish, which are popular with gulf fishermen, and should also create a popular area for divers to explore. Users of other artificial reefs in florida have created thousands of jobs, the naples daily news reports. On jan. 8, the ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place on a barge loaded with material for the reef; next december, the concrete will set out into the gulf by flotilla. The project is expected to take six months to complete, and the attorney who dreamed it up says fish could start moving in as soon as 12 hours after the reef is created.

The rubble, about 600 to 800 tons, has been collected on the north side of the s.s. Judge jolly bridge and will be loaded onto a barge. Then, it will be transported offshore and dropped, the first delivery for the reef project. A deployment ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m., thursday, jan. 8, near the jolly bridge staging area. The program will include an address by collier county commissioner donna fiala and a ribbon cutting in front of the fully loaded barge. On jan. 9, a flotilla and barge will converge on the first of six reef sites and drop the materials 10 nautical miles from gordon pass. At 10 a.m., a local minister will perform the \"blessing of the reefs \" from the flotilla. When completed the artificial reef will measure one-quarter mile by one-quarter mile. Off marco island, one drop area is in 36 feet of water and a second in 74 feet.

There are six legacy reefs that make up the paradise reef project. Each legacy reef contains between four to seven 500-ton reefs; a total of thirty-six ( 36 ) 500-ton reefs. The first reef was deployed january 2015. The thirty-sixth reef was deployed october 2015. ( gps coordinates below ) the reefs will be augmented with artificial reef modules; specially designed habitats for marine life made of concrete and limestone. The modules serve as a vital component of the overall project and will be placed in proximity to the reefs. A documentary film about the project, 'paradise reef ', received an emmy award from the national academy of television arts &amp; sciences'suncoast chapter. The one-hour documentary film follows the quest to secure donations and grants,",
            "Marco island, florida - pipes and other suitable concrete sit ready for a trip to the gulf of mexico to build the largest artificial reef in the western hemisphere. The rubble, about 600 to 800 tons, has been collected on the north side of the s.s. Judge jolly bridge and will be loaded onto a barge. Then, it will be transported offshore and dropped, the first delivery for the reef project. A deployment ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m., thursday, jan. 8, near the jolly bridge staging area. The program will include an address by collier county commissioner donna fiala and a ribbon cutting in front of the fully loaded barge. On jan. 9, a flotilla and barge will converge on the first of six reef sites and drop the materials 10 nautical miles from gordon pass. At 10 a.m., a local minister will perform the \"blessing of the reefs \" from the flotilla. When completed the artificial reef will measure one-quarter mile by one-quarter mile. Off marco island, one drop area is in 36 feet of water and a second in 74 feet. The reef is meant to generate millions in tourism dollars for collier county. \"a 2011 sea grant study of six coastal counties in florida, found that the users of artificial reefs created 2,600 jobs that generated $ 253 million annually for those counties,"

They returned the next day and, in broad daylight, allegedly sprayed the door handle of the home of former russian spy sergei skripal with novichok nerve agent held in a fake nina ricci \" premier jour \" perfume bottle, per bloomberg. Before the bottle was found in a charity bin in june, leading to a woman's death, uk authorities allege it was carried on an aeroflot flight from moscow to london's gatwick airport, then through train stations and a budget hotel, by alexander petrov and ruslan boshirov — likely aliases for agents of russia's military foreign intelligence service. Bloomberg notes investigators took more than 1,400 witness statements and surveyed 11,000 hours of cctv footage before arriving at their conclusion. Prime minister theresa may said wednesday the operation was \" almost certainly \" approved by the russian state, which responded to the uk's repeated questions with \" obfuscation and lies. \" though russia's constitution doesn't allow for extradition, europe-wide arrest warrants have been issued and the matter is to be raised at a thursday meeting of the un security council. As for the east london hotel the men reportedly stayed at for two nights in march, cnn reports it was \" deemed safe \" following tests performed in may and that no one who stayed there in the interim reported becoming sick.",

Interior minister matteo salvini — an anti-immigrant politician who has refused to let the asylum seekers set foot on italian soil — has threatened to send those aboard the vessel, which is named the diciotti, back to libya. Critics say salvini is breaking both italian and international law. And italian media has reported that a public prosecutor was investigating an \" unknown person \" for illegal imprisonment, according to dw.com. In reply to potential legal jeopardy, though, salvini said, \" i ' m not afraid of anything. I have a clean conscience, \" per courthouse news. On thursday, 27 children between 14 and 16 years of age were allowed to leave the boat, per dw.com. As for the rest of the migrants, salvini, who has pledged to deport some 500,000 immigrants from italy, is asking other european union countries to accept them, even threatening to withhold payments to the eu. As of friday, belgian and hungary had refused, according to reports, and germany has not made a decision. While salvini's hardline stance on immigration reportedly has popular support, not all italians agree with him.

In pursuit of that, they gather intel on everything from human rights violations to gunrunning.

        "summary": "A measure to repeal online privacy rules brought in under former president barack obama before they take effect is on its way to president trump's desk after the house passed it with a 215-205 vote. The measure — which passed the senate 50-48 last week — blocks the fcc from enforcing a rule it approved in october banning internet service providers from selling and sharing users'data without obtaining their consent. The white house issued a statement tuesday saying trump strongly supports the move because websites are not required to obtain the same consent, resulting in \" rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor, \" reuters reports. A look at the debate: house minority leader nancy pelosi accused republicans of putting profits before privacy, the ap reports. \" overwhelmingly, the american people do not agree with republicans that this information should be sold, and it certainly should not be sold without your permission, \" she said. \" our broadband providers know deeply personal information about us and our families. \" the ap notes that 15 republicans joined democrats in voting against the move. The move allows isps to sell data such as browsing history and geolocation information. \" i have a simple question: what the heck are you thinking? \" democratic rep. Michael capuano said during the house debate, per ars technica. \" what is in your mind? why would you want to give up any of your personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it? give me one good reason why comcast should know my mother's medical problems. \" online privacy advocates argued that isps should face stricter guidelines because unlike website and search engines, they have information on all the websites a user visits, meaning they will be better able to sell highly targeted ads, the washington post reports. \" today's vote means that americans will never be safe online from having their most personal details stealthily scrutinized and sold to the highest bidder, \" said jeffrey chester, executive director of the center for digital democracy. Republicans including trump-appointed fcc chief ajit pai argued that a different federal agency, the federal trade commission, should be in charge of regulating privacy for both websites and isps. The ap notes that the ftc has long been seen as having a lighter regulatory touch than the fcc. \" the internet has become the amazing tool that it is because it is largely left untouched by regulation, and that shouldn't stop now, \" house majority leader kevin mccarthy said.",

Veterinary experts say xylitol — also used in toothpaste, gummy vitamins, some peanut butters, and breath mints — is about 100 times as toxic as milk chocolate to dogs, and it's being blamed for an uptick in accidental pup poisonings, say animal poison-control centers. The aspca's poison center, for instance, received more than 3,700 xylitol-related calls last year, with nearly a dozen deaths. And a toxicologist from the pet poison helpline says it's seen a \" dramatic increase \" in calls related to the sweetener, with only 300 in 2009, but 2,800 so far this year. The problem xylitol poses for dogs is it causes a sudden surge of insulin after they eat it, which makes blood pressure plummet, possibly resulting in seizures, brain damage, or liver failure. And it takes just a small amount: as little as 50 milligrams of the sweetener per pound of body weight can be toxic, so even one or two pieces of gum can make a small dog ill. When tonia cox's dog murphy jo scarfed about 20 pieces of ice breakers, the labradoodle immediately started throwing up, became sluggish, and was diagnosed with liver failure, per the journal. \" they told me to bring my kids in to say goodbye to her, \" cox says. ( murphy jo survived, three blood transfusions and $ 5,000 later. ) some pet owners are petitioning for labels on items with xylitol, while others say owner education is best.

The president has been to sub-saharan africa only once since taking office — a 24-hour trip to ghana in 2009 — and critics say the region has been largely ignored. The american government is \"not seeing africa as a big priority, \" said a spokesman for transafrica forum. \" there has been some ambivalence. \" but the obama administration is defending its policies, with one official noting that the white house has been active, helping prevent violence from the ivory coast to southern sudan. Others call it unrealistic to expect this administration to be different. \"we really said if a black man became president, it would change the world, but we are basically back at the same level we were before, \" said a researcher specializing in africa policy. \"the bulk of the policy is still the legacy of the clinton and bush years. \" for an ongoing account of the first lady's trip, check out the washington post blog.",

Friday's massive internet outage, which affected sites including twitter and reddit, was caused by hacked \" internet of things \" devices including dvrs, webcams, and smart fridges, according to the krebs on security blog. Experts say malware caused \" mirai \" targeted poorly protected devices. Allison nixon, a researcher at security firm flashpoint, says friday's attack involved components built by chinese firm xiongmai technologies — and it is \" remarkable that virtually an entire company's product line has just been turned into a botnet that is now attacking the united states. \" to launch a distributed denial of service attack and overwhelm its targets with traffic, the mirai code infected devices that still had the factory-default password, popular mechanics reports. \" your connected refrigerator, your door alarm, your webcams, there's a proliferation of devices. They're in people's homes. They're secured by ordinary people who don't know much about security and don't change the credentials, \" university of colorado professor john black tells the denver post. \" somebody somewhere has figured this out and probed the internet to find these devices. \" he urges people to use unique passwords for all their devices, right down to smart light bulbs.",

Earlier today cyber criminals began training their attack cannons on dyn, an internet infrastructure company that provides critical technology services to some of the internet's top destinations. The attack began creating problems for internet users reaching an array of sites, including twitter, amazon, tumblr, reddit, spotify and netflix. At first, it was unclear who or what was behind the attack on dyn. But over the past few hours, at least one computer security firm has come out saying the attack involved mirai, the same malware strain that was used in the record 620 gpbs attack on my site last month. At the end september 2016, the hacker responsible for creating the mirai malware released the source code for it, effectively letting anyone build their own attack army using mirai. Mirai scours the web for iot devices protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords, and then enlists the devices in attacks that hurl junk traffic at an online target until it can no longer accommodate legitimate visitors or users.

Security researchers say it was enabled by insecure internet of things devices whose owners failed to change a default password.

        "summary": "It's a move that dan diamond, writing for forbes, frames as what could be \" the beginning of the beginning of the end … for the nfl's reign as the nation's most popular sport. \" san francisco 49ers rookie linebacker chris borland yesterday told espn's outside the lines that he's retiring from football due to fears of the long-term effects of head trauma. The 24-year-old said he came to his decision after talking to family, friends, teammates, and concussion experts, making a play he ultimately believes is \" best for my health. \" \" from what i've researched and what i've experienced, i don't think it's worth the risk, \" he said. Borland said he's never felt better but simply wanted to take a \" proactive \" move to protect himself in a league where brain damage, depression, and progressive neurological issues have been linked to those who've suffered repeated head injuries while playing, espn notes. The 49ers issued a statement, per espn, that said, \" while unexpected, we certainly respect chris'decision. … we will always consider him a 49er. \" borland's retirement is a particular blow to san francisco because he was expected to replace patrick willis as linebacker and play a key part in the team's defense; willis retired last week at age 30. Dozens of players reacted via twitter, notes nbc sports, with reactions ranging from surprise to keep calm and carry on. \" no offense to anyone but i ' m playing until i can't anymore. I love this game to much, \" tweeted seahawks linebacker bobby wagner. At forbes, diamond notes that fan reaction was largely supportive of borland's move and that it's \" the shifting of norms \" that should terrify the nfl. \" when your own fans readily accept the data that your product is a killer... At some point, the morality questions around football will be too embarrassing to ignore, \" he writes.",
