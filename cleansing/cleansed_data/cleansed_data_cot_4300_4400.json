In a court filing ahead of his formal sentencing in federal court next thursday, a prosecutor urges a judge to give the former subway spokesman 12½ years in prison, the maximum agreed under a plea deal for child pornography and underage sex charges, reports the indianapolis star. \" persons with a sexual attraction to young children may be difficult to deter, but these sentences matter, \" the court filing says. \" these offenders frequently communicate with each other online, and they are concerned about the law enforcement efforts. \" \" the results of these cases help to deter and teach by example, \" the filing continues, and the fogle result \" will be closely watched by current and potential offenders who have not yet been identified. \" the filing also states that fogle paid for sex with adults \" on hundreds of occasions \" and some of the child pornography in his possession featured children as young as 6, reports the star, which notes that the federal judge is free to sentence fogle to more, or less, than what prosecutors agreed to ask for. Co-conspirator russell taylor, former director of fogle's jared foundation charity, has also pleaded guilty to child-porn charges and will be sentenced to at least 15 years in prison, nbc news reports. ( fogle has already paid restitution to most of the 14 victims prosecutors have identified. )",

His father, late leader kim jong il, addressed the public only once in his lifetime. Appearing calm and measured as he read the 20-minute speech, kim jong un covered a wide range of topics, from foreign policy to the economy. His speech, and a military parade that followed, capped the carefully choreographed festivities commemorating kim il sung's birthday. It was the best look yet the outside world has had of the young kim, who is believed to be in his late twenties. Punctuating kim's message that the north will continue to pour funds into its military, the parade culminated with the unveiling of a new long-range missile, though it's not clear how powerful or significant the addition"

Kristen bell stars as a workaholic new yorker besieged by suitors after plucking their coins from a roman fountain, but the movie's not even as \" mildly fun \" as that premise might sound, warns adam markowitz at entertainment weekly. The movie \" lacks invention and true magic in the worst way \" and is even short on rome, writes michael phillips at the chicago tribune. Many of the roman scenes were filmed in new york, he notes, which could be why \" the key roman fountain scenes look like a gussied-up corner of toronto. \" bell's co-star josh duhamel \" has the timing of a broken watch \" in this \" rom-bomb, \" carrie rickey writes at the philadelphia inquirer. Claudia puig is a bit more charitable at usa today: when in rome is a predictable genre movie that goes a little too heavy on the slapstick, she writes, but the \" higher-than-average dose of chemistry \" make it worth watching.",

The seattle pi reports amazon received a patent for an \" unmanned aerial vehicle assistant \" on oct. 18. Illustrations from the us patent and trademark office show a miniature drone perched on a docking station on an officer's shoulder. The drone could id missing children by scanning bar codes on their clothes, follow a fleeing suspect while an officer cuts them off, or run license plates, according to cnbc. Gizmodo notes the drone could also follow one suspect while the officer chases another. The drone would be controlled with voice commands, such as \" follow me \" or \" hover. \" the patent explains that the drones could be so small because their processors could be housed in their docking stations. But their size is exactly what concerns the aclu. A technology and liberty project director with the group says the drones are so small they could monitor people without their knowledge and \" make an end-run around the constitutional protections. \" but amazon's tiny drones could also have uses beyond policing. The patent states they could be used to help people feel safer while walking alone at night, record extreme-sports stunts, or figure out how many people are ahead of someone waiting in a long line.

Ricky dubose, 24, and donnie rowe, 43, were among the 30-some prisoners being transported from baldwin county prison. According to cnn, authorities say dubose and rowe overpowered the correctional officers around 5: 45am, taking their weapons. One of the convicts then allegedly shot and killed both officers, identified as christopher monica and curtis billue. Authorities say dubose and rowe escaped the bus and carjacked a honda civic. A manhunt for rowe and dubose is underway, but authorities say they have \" no idea \" where the escapees are, noting the men have a few hours head start on police. Rowe and dubose are believed to be armed with the officers ' guns, and citizens are warned not to approach them. Rowe was serving up to life in prison for armed robbery and aggravated assault.

        "summary": "A land-reform rally in india's capital went horribly awry yesterday when a farmer took his own life in front of attendees, the independent reports. Gajendra singh, said by the hindustan times to be a 43-year-old father of three, shocked onlookers at the aam aadmi party gathering by climbing a tree and hanging himself — supposedly ( according to some ) to protest a lack of government compensation for farmers whose crops have been ruined by bad weather. Although the government has said it will help farmers adversely affected by recent heavy rains, protestors say payments haven't been arriving and blame prime minister narendra modi of being \" anti-farmer, \" per the independent; the paper adds that around 40 farmers have taken their lives over the past few weeks. Singh allegedly left a suicide note in which the independent says he wrote, \" i don't have the money to feed my children. Hence, i want to commit suicide. \" however, there's lots of finger-pointing going on, with singh's family blaming pols and the aap for his death, the aap blaming delhi police, and the cops blaming the aap. \" i personally hold [ delhi chief minister ] arvind kejriwal responsible, \" singh's brother tells the times of india; he also accuses another local politican for coaxing his brother to attend the rally. An aap member at the protest tells the independent, \" the police were acting like mute spectators. We urged them several times to take action, but they did not pay any heed. \" meanwhile, police contend aap protestors obstructed cops from helping singh and that they \" instigated … singh to commit suicide, \" per ibnlive. Adding to the confusion: singh's sister tells news nation that the suicide note wasn't in his handwriting, and a district leader tells ani that crop destruction in singh's area wasn't near levels that qualify for government compensation and that singh himself was \" financially sound. \"",

The soldier was fired upon by his former comrades as he tried to defect and was rescued by south korean forces before being flown to a hospital in suwon. Though it's not clear if the soldier is talking, officials say his state of health suggests he's a victim of nutrition problems long suspected in the north. The parasites, for instance, may be the result of the use of untreated feces as fertilizer, which can lead to contaminated food. While some parasites are life-threatening, others are less so and generally symptom-less. But \" all indicate a poor health status \" as they \" take nutrients away from your body, \" a doctor explains.

The candidate told abc's this week that the campaign always had good ideas, but lacked \" the ability to execute a plan. \" carson said that when he brought in retired gen. Bob dees as his new campaign chief, \" there were some who decided under those circumstances it would be too difficult for them to work, \" including campaign manager barry bennett and communications director doug watts, who abruptly announced their resignation. Carson said bennett quit because of the \" very substantial changes \" being made, not because he was about to get fired. When asked about top adviser armstrong williams, whose role in the campaign troubled bennett and other aides, carson admitted that his friend had \" made some bad judgments \" but said he was a \" valuable individual, \" politico notes. Carson promised there would be big changes ahead for his campaign, which has fallen to fourth in the polls amid worries about his grasp of foreign policy, the wall street journal reports. He still appears to have work to do: later in the this week interview, when host martha raddatz asked carson about saudi arabia's execution of a prominent shiite cleric, carson seemed unfamiliar with the issues involved and tried to steer the conversation toward president obama's nuclear deal with iran.

        "summary": "A possible deal between turkey and the european union to handle the ongoing migrant crisis is being hailed as a \" breakthrough \" by eu leaders after an outline was drafted tuesday, the ap reports. This \" one-for-one \" arrangement would mean that in exchange for every migrant in europe that turkey takes back ( including any plucked from the eu's territorial waters ), the eu will agree to resettle what cnn refers to as one \" legitimate \" refugee who would qualify for asylum, which probably means mostly syrian refugees. The deal is designed to keep migrants out of the hands of smugglers and human traffickers and to keep many from making the dangerous journey. \" we will break the business model of smugglers exploiting human misery and make clear that the only viable way to come to europe is through legal channels, \" european commission president jean-claude juncker said tuesday, per deutsche welle. Turkey already shelters about 2.7 million refugees, most syrian, and if the deal is finalized, it could result in thousands more flooding back in. The eu would pick up part of the tab, as well as expedite talks on bringing turkey into the union and streamline the visa process for turkish citizens. But some humanitarian groups are concerned. \" the collective expulsion of foreigners is prohibited under the european convention of human rights, \" a regional director for the un's refugee agency says, per the telegraph. Unicef is also wary, with a rep noting \" too many details still remain unclear \" and that kids are especially at risk. \" children should not to be returned if they face risks including detention, forced recruitment, trafficking, or exploitation, \" the rep says. Amnesty international says the plan is \" alarmingly short-sighted and inhumane, \" mainly because turkey can't take care of the refugees already there. Eu leaders hope to close the deal at their next summit in brussels on march 17. ( the crisis is only expected to get worse come spring. )",

        "summary": "President trump's decision to pull the us out of the paris climate accord is being denounced as a big mistake by leaders of other countries — and plenty of american mayors and governors don't sound any happier. French president emmanuel macron, delivering a rare english-language speech, said there is no \" plan b \" for the climate and promised that france will become a \" second homeland \" for climate scientists, the independent reports. In a dig at trump, he said everybody needs to work together to \" make our planet great again. \" in other developments: american states, cities, and companies have vowed to meet their paris commitments despite the withdrawal and are planning to submit a \" parallel \" pledge to the united nations, the new york times reports. The governors of california, new york, and washington say they are starting an alliance of states committed to upholding the agreement. The leaders of france, italy, and germany issued a joint statement condemning the decision and saying the renegotiation trump has suggested is not an option because the accord \" is a vital instrument for our planet, societies, and economies, \" the guardian reports. Britain's prime minister theresa may did not sign the statement, though a spokesperson said she had told trump of her \" disappointment. \" pittsburgh mayor bill peduto slammed trump for referring to the city in his announcement, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. \" this city does not support the initiatives that he is doing. This city is adamantly opposed to them, \" said the mayor. Trump, who said he was elected to \" represent pittsburgh, not paris, \" is not \" representing us at all, or not very well, \" the mayor said. China's state-controlled media joined in the criticism, denouncing trump for making america the only country apart from syria and nicaragua to reject the accord, the washington post reports. Xinhua called trump \" foolish \" and said he was isolating his country. The bbc looks at five effects of the american pullout, including greater cooperation between the eu and china as they move forward with emissions goals. The bbc notes that coal is still unlikely to make a comeback, and american emissions will probably still fall.",

She never returned at all. Doctors discovered that melanoma she had been diagnosed with in 2015 had spread to her stomach, liver, kidney, and brain. The 30-year-old new jersey mom died three weeks later on feb. 27, reports today. But first, \" she sacrificed herself to save her son, \" who was born via c-section on feb. 24 weighing just 1 pound 11 ounces, janofsky's mom wrote in a feb. 28 facebook post. In the weeks since, more than $ 80,000 has been raised to help care for baby jake, who has chronic lung disease and is kept on a ventilator in the university of pennsylvania's neonatal intensive care unit. Janofsky had been given a good prognosis after her melanoma diagnosis and its spread went undetected. An oncologist says her pregnancy may have played a role. \"it's possible that pregnancy is a type of immune suppression, \" says the doctor at md anderson cancer center in houston. \" your body is really focusing its efforts on growing another human being, so it's a little distracted on really taking care of itself. \" janofsky's husband, max, a k-9 police officer who served tours in iraq and afghanistan, says he's heartbroken to know his wife won't see jake and their 4-year-old daughter, avery, grow up. \" you know how people have hobbies? hers was being a wife and a mother, \" he tells nj.com. \" if there's one thing i want people to really take away from this it's that melanoma isn't a little thing, \" he adds. \" take it seriously and get checked. \" ( a cancer survivor died a day after having twins. )",

Well, it turns out the west point part is not true, and carson's camp confirms that. Politico reached out to west point, which has no record of carson being offered admission, and then reached out to carson. \" dr. Carson was the top rotc student in the city of detroit.

They told him they could help him get an appointment based on his grades and performance in rotc.

Washington rep. Cathy mcmorris rodgers, the highest-ranked female republican in congress, delivered the official rebuttal. Rodgers, chair of the house republican conference, said she offered a \" more hopeful, republican vision — one that empowers you, not the government, \" the hill reports. She emphasized her three children, along with standard republican talking points like getting rid of red tape, and said instead of obama's \" year of action, \" there should be a \" year of real action \" that doesn't make people's \" lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs. \" utah sen. Mike lee delivered the tea party rebuttal, and he focused on inequality in america, which he blames on big government, politico reports. He touched on abortion, same-sex marriage, and nsa snooping, but saved much of his ire for obamacare, which he described as a \" godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages, and their jobs. \" kentucky sen. Rand paul, who delivered the tea party response last year, focused on free enterprise in a response posted on his youtube channel. \" the ticket to the middle class is not higher taxes on the very businesses that must create jobs, \" he said. \" economic growth will come when we lower taxes for everyone. \"",

A clause in the constitution largely protects lawmakers from prosecution over their comments on the house or senate floor, the denver post reports. And with udall on his way out after losing in the midterms, he can make classified information public without facing the loss of his senate job and privileges, writes conor friedersdorf at the atlantic. Friedersdorf calls on udall to tell us more about the \" cia torture and mass surveillance of innocent people that the executive branch wants to hide. \" udall should ask himself: \" what fulfills his obligations to his constituents, his country, and the oath of office he took to support and defend the constitution? \" friedersdorf writes. Normally, friedersdorf would call on legislators to think seriously before revealing secret information. But in the case of torture, we're talking about a \" heinous \" crime that has resulted in a still-suppressed 6,300-page report that took years of time and millions of dollars in taxpayer money to create. For his part, udall has signaled an openness to the possibility: \" i ' m going to keep all options on the table to ensure the truth comes out, \" he told the denver post. Meanwhile, other observers have also called on udall to take action — among them the senator who entered the pentagon papers into the public record in 1971, the intercept reports.

That's right: according to researchers studying long-term marijuana use, the only drawback, as far as physical health is concerned, is gum disease. Their findings were published wednesday in jama psychiatry. Researchers tested the periodontal health, systemic inflammation, metabolic health, and lung function of 1,037 new zealanders — 675 of whom reported smoking pot, according to a press release — through the age of 38. The guardian reports they found 55.6 % of people who had used marijuana for more than 15 years had periodontal disease. Only 13.5 % of people who'd never used marijuana did. Researchers were unsure what was causing the poor gum health — the less-frequent brushing and flossing of marijuana-users wouldn't be enough — and believe it's possible cannabis itself is bad for gums. Researchers were surprised to find periodontal disease — and not the poor lung function associated with smoking cigarettes — was the only negative physical health effect of long-term pot use. But that doesn't mean you can cheef with impunity. \"our results should be interpreted in the context of prior research showing that cannabis use is associated with accidents and injuries, bronchitis, acute cardiovascular events, and, possibly, infectious diseases and cancer, \" the press release quotes the study as saying.

Kyle bristow, the attorney for the unidentified woman, says that as a result of this cyber blitz, his client was \" tormented \" for a year and a half before he stepped in as she tried to get the photos taken down in what he describes as a \" horrific game of whack a ball. \" and bristow is apparently a decent advocate to have in one's corner: since at least 2012, he's been representing victims by the dozen ( mostly women ) and trying to shutter sites that host these types of images and videos. Per the cyber civil rights initiative, 34 states and dc have revenge-porn laws on the books, and michigan is one of them, having passed a law in april that makes it illegal to put sexually explicit pics or videos of someone online without that person's consent, per cbs detroit. The ex in this particular case was also instructed by anderson to immediately destroy the woman's photos and never post them to third-party sites again, or else risk prison time or more fines in contempt of court. \" we are truly winning the battle, \" bristow tells the free press.

Some wondered if the scandal-tainted government staged the brazen scheme in an effort to curtail daily, paralyzing demonstrations that have destabilized the government, per the new york times. Protesters who initially cheered a rogue band of cops presumably opposed to maduro later weren't so sure. \" i wanted it to be true, \" one witness tells the times. \" but i had to ask myself if this had all been staged or wasn't coming from the government. \" most venezuelans \" don't know what to make of it, \" one analyst says. Maduro blamed \" terrorists, \" and officials insisted the plot was real, engineered by the cia and retired gen. Miguel rodriguez torres, a maduro critic. Torres called the attack that left no injuries a \" stupid montage, \" per the journal. He questioned how the chopper could buzz the city for so long — cnn reports it lasted about two hours — without being shot down.

At least that's what dutch researchers saw when performing a ct scan on a statue shown last year in the netherlands at drents museum, discover reports. The body is believed to be that of buddhist master liuquan, who perhaps died while undergoing \" self-mummification. \" in this tradition, old buddhist monks ingested mostly resin and pine needles until they were nearly dead, reports livescience. Then they were buried alive while breathing through a tube so they could meditate until the end. \" there are historical records of some aging monks who have done this practice, \" says an archaeology curator. \" but if this is also the case with this monk is not known. \" however he got in there, the monk's presence wasn't a total surprise. The statue — which was likely kept in a chinese monastery for centuries — somehow ended up in the netherlands, where a private owner discovered a body inside in 1996 while repairing a few cracks and chips. Then a ct scan in germany in 2013 showed the remains in great detail. The latest scan reveals what appears to be lung tissue along with little bits of paper in place of bodily organs. On the scraps is chinese text suggesting that the monk was liuquan, who may have been revered after his death as a \" living buddha, \" cnet reports. He's not alone, however: mummies from this period, around the 11th or 12th century, are fairly common in asia.

However, researchers do have some anecdotal support for the idea that introducing healthy new gut microbes into a person can affect weight. In one study cited by ars, researchers took gut microbes from a set of twins and put them into some mice. One of the twins was lean, the other was obese. Mice that received microbes from the obese twin got chubby. Restoring the balance of gut microbes via fecal transplant has been used to treat intestinal clostridium difficile infections, the new york times reports. In one case, per ars, a woman received a fecal matter transplant from her healthy-yet-overweight daughter. The woman's infection was cured, but she began to gain weight. One challenge for the whole enterprise has been creating a suitable capsule to get the job done, the times notes. Capsules typically dissolve in feces, so when they contain feces, they dissolve from the inside out. A nonprofit called openbiome, however, created a capsule that makes use of \" aqueous fat \" and doesn't break down until it enters the small intestine. The times notes that researchers are studying the use of poop to treat other maladies as well, such as crohn's disease. \" without capsules, \" one doctor says, \" we wouldn't be able to do this kind of work. \" ( speaking of fecal matter, it's in your ground beef. )",

Her lawyer had said lohan would start today.

As of 9am today she was still not there. However … tmz reports lohan's actual start time was 8am and that she arrived by 8: 40 because she didn't know the correct entrance, but notes that she was in fact turned away at that time.

But though hotel staffers responded to the outbreak of the las vegas mass shooting, asking for the shooter's room number and urging the worker to shield himself, abc news reports that police weren't immediately called. A source who reviewed mandalay bay's phone records says it was only after stephen paddock began firing on the route 91 festival that a call was placed to police. That was a full six minutes after security guard jesus campos was shot on the 32nd floor and it would be another 12 minutes before police arrived, unaware campos was wounded. The delay in calling cops is just one criticism of mandalay bay, which is accused of failing to maintain a \" reasonably safe condition \" in the first lawsuit filed by a victim, per buzzfeed. The lawsuit, filed by 21-year-old california college student paige gasper, also names festival host live nation, paddock's estate, and slide fire, the bump stock manufacturer. Steve wynn of wynn resorts says that paddock \" didn't let anyone in [ his ] room for two or three days, \" which should have been a warning sign for mandalay bay staff or at least prompted a wellness check.

So say researchers who are investigating new and existing drugs that may help slow the aging process, reports seeker. The projections are based on drug trials that see mice boasting a 20 % to 25 % increase in lifespan, which some are confident will extend to humans. Two researchers, in fact, made a wager in 2000 on whether the first human to live to 150 has already been born, reports mainebiz. Biology professor stephen austad of the university of alabama at birmingham and s. Jay olshansky of the university of chicago have each put $ 150 into an investment account that could reach $ 500 million when the wager is settled in 2150. Austad is confident someone will have reached 150 by then, olshansky bets otherwise. The age 150 is 21 % older than the oldest person ever documented, jeanne calment of france, who died in 1997 at age 122. If humans do end up living at least another 25 years on average — to about age 100 — austad says it will \" influence when we have kids, what kind of careers we have, and our second, third, or fourth careers....

On thursday, the bank announced a third-party firm has finished reviewing 165 million accounts opened between january 2009 and september 2016 and has jacked the total of potential fake accounts up 67 %, to 3.5 million, reports bloomberg. Cnbc reports the initial count was based on a narrower review of a four-year period; the new review found about 450,000 additional accounts from that period and nearly 1 million more from the expanded years. Wells fargo ceo timothy sloan called the completion of the review an \" important milestone \" as the company works to \" make things right for our customers. \" cnnmoney reports the estimate of accounts that were hit with inappropriate fees was raised from 130,000 to 190,000. The analysis also surfaced a new issue: roughly half a million potentially unauthorized online bill-pay enrollments. Wells fargo will refund customers $ 910,000 in relation to those enrollments; another $ 6.1 million will be refunded in connection with the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts, a figure that was previously $ 3.3 million.

The 2017 dirty dozen list, released wednesday evening, includes in order: strawberries, spinach, nectarines, apples, peaches, celery, grapes, pears, cherries, tomatoes, sweet bell peppers and potatoes. Each of these foods tested positive for a number of different pesticide residues and contained higher concentrations of pesticides than other produce. Pears and potatoes were new additions to the dirty dozen, displacing cherry tomatoes and cucumbers from last year's list. The alliance for food and farming, a non-profit organization formed in 1989 which represents organic and conventional farmers of fruits and vegetables and farms of all sizes, has repeatedly called for ewg to stop publishing the list. The group asserts that the information is negative and misleading and might be scaring people away from consuming a healthful diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. The list is based on ewg's analysis of tests by the u.s. Department of agriculture and found that nearly 70 percent of samples of 48 types of conventionally grown produce"

It turns out that winnie the pooh has become a bit of a political meme in china, reports the bbc, where posts that compare the sweet-natured bear to the country's president have been popping up ( and getting taken down ) since 2013. It started with a photo of xi jinping walking alongside former us president barack obama paired next to an image of pooh and tigger, thought to resemble obama's taller, lean frame. More viral memes juxtaposing xi with pooh followed, including a shot with him and japanese prime minister shinzo abe ( depicted as gloomy eeyore ) — while a meme described by global risk insights as the most censored image of 2015 pokes fun at xi popping his head through his limo's sun roof next to a winnie-the-pooh car push toy. Per the bbc, censors in china are able to virtually wipe out material from the internet and social sharing in the country; the bbc cites the case of dissident nobel peace prize winner liu xiaobo, whose name simply won't appear in private wechat messages. Heightened censorship around the pooh memes comes before this fall's community party congress, a meeting held every five years to announce important political appointments.",

        "summary": "Jerry and rita alter were worldly, fascinating, and kept a stolen willem de kooning painting in their bedroom — but did they actually steal it? a few clues may tell the tale. The alters had moved from new york city to rural new mexico in their 50s when, the day after thanksgiving 1985, \" woman-ochre \" by de kooning was brazenly cut from its frame at the university of arizona museum of art in tucson. It happens the alters were visiting family in tucson that thanksgiving, the arizona republic reports. They also drove mostly red cars, similar to the \" rust-colored \" getaway car reportedly used by the two thieves. The alters also bear some resemblance to police composite sketches of the male-female pair. And they hung the painting behind their bedroom door, out of view, for years. What's more, a fictional travel adventure written by the couple chronicles a grandmother and granddaughter who steal a museum's 120-carat emerald and keep it behind a panel — \" and two pairs of eyes, exclusively, are there to see! \" they write. The new york times suggests that jerry ( dressed as a woman ) and his son joseph, then 23, bear a greater resemblance to the composites and may have stolen it. But who's to say? jerry and rita are now dead, and joseph, who's suffered serious psychological problems for years, won't talk. Rita's nephew, ron roseman, has a more benign view: maybe jerry and his aunt were at the gallery when someone told them, \" i have something better in my garage. \" as for the painting — now valued at around $ 100 million — an antique-shop owner who happened to buy it with the alters ' estate turned it in last year.",

The sources say she was only wearing her robe and feared she would be raped when masked men broke into the apartment where she was staying and tied her hands with plastic handcuffs. The robbers duct-taped her mouth shut as she pleaded for her life, the sources say. A friend sleeping in a downstairs bedroom phoned bodyguard pascal duvier after hearing the noise, and the insiders say he arrived just two minutes after the intruders made their getaway. The robbers are believed to have made off with a ring and other valuables worth around $ 11 million. A source tells people that kardashian was very badly shaken by the ordeal and will be dealing with the aftermath for some time. \" she was just hysterical when she talked to kanye, \" the source says. \" he told her that he couldn't care less about the jewelry; he's just thankful that she's ok. \" kardashian returned to new york on monday and was reunited with husband kanye west and their two children.

Glyphosate notably generated headlines last year after the world health organization declared the chemical \" probably \" causes cancer in people.

Pepsico ( pep ), meanwhile, says it stands by the safety and quality of quaker oats ' products, adding \" producing health, wholesome food is quaker's number one priority and we've been doing that for nearly 140 years. \" \" quaker does not add glyphosate during any part of the milling",
            "A lawsuit filed against quaker oats calls into question the company's claims that its product is 100 percent natural. The new york times reports a class-action lawsuit has been filed against the company in new york and california \" after testing found traces of the pesticide glyphosate in some oatmeal. \" glyphosate is the active ingredient in weed-killer roundup but according to the times, the amount found in quaker oats fall far below potentially harmful levels. The real issue, according to this lawsuit at least, is that the product is marketed as \" 100 percent natural \" and therefore is being falsely advertised. According to the times, the lawsuit will be filed in additional states this week. The plaintiffs are seeking refunds and asking that pepsico ( quaker's parent company ) \" either be required to reformulate the products or disclose the presence of glyphosate in them. \" glyphosate has also been found in more than dozen popular german beers. Earlier this year, the food and drug administration announced that it would begin cracking down on the use of glyphosate; the world health organization has concluded the herbicide \" probably \" causes cancer, in part based on a 1985 study on mice. But monsanto, the company behind roundup, disputes that research, writing on its website that \" glyphosate is not a carcinogen. \" this isn't"

Kelly — a firm supporter of gun control whose primary campaign was bankrolled by michael bloomberg — won after raising more than 80 times as much as her republican opponent, a community activist who spent around 20 years in jail for armed robberies and burglaries, politico reports. But for kelly — whose three predecessors all left amid scandals — winning is probably the easy part, the ap finds. She faces huge expectations on a national scale because of her support for gun control, and on a local scale, in a poor district to which her powerful predecessor managed to bring more than $ 1 billion over 17 years. \" when a freshman person goes in dealing with guys who are well-grounded and unwilling to negotiate, nothing's going to transfer.

It is illegal! \" the same thing happened in 2012, goldenfield noted. The suburban cincinnati county is overwhelmingly republican; mitt romney got 69 percent of the vote four years ago. It's been almost 40 years since a democrat was elected to countywide office. Goldenfield told the enquirer the warren county sheriff's office called her around 7: 45 a.m. Saturday alerting her to the manure pile outside the lebanon building. Deputies met party officials later to review video. \" hopefully the perps will be held accountable for their actions, \" she said. Jeff monroe, chairman of the warren county republican party, said the gop had nothing to do with the manure \" and has offered to help clean things up. \" the warren county sheriff's office had no additional information. Goldenfield said the party hired a contractor to remove the pile. There have been other incidents of party headquarter vandalism nationwide, to both parties. In north carolina, someone firebombed the orange county gop headquarters. Earlier this month someone tossed a brick through the window of an indiana republican party office.

Police have identified the father as dita oepriarto, head of a local isis-inspired terror cell. Six family members and eight others died in the three attacks. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and police say the family members were among hundreds of indonesians to return to the country from syria after the collapse of isis ' \" caliphate. \" in another surabaya blast, three people were killed in an explosion at an apartment sunday night.

Here's what the pundits are taking away from this one: romney has a much tougher fight ahead than john mccain did at this stage in 2008, analysts tell the la times. The reason: super pacs. In the past, primary defeats cut off a candidate's fundraising, but now deep-pocket donors, like newt gingrich's pal sheldon adelson, can keep shoveling in cash. As his obama-focused victory speech indicated, romney will once again be running two campaigns: one for the nomination and one for the general election, politico observes. But it ' ll be a tricky balance, because voters may have actually liked the attack dog version of mitt. \" inevitability restored, \" declares john dickerson of slate. Romney has won the biggest contest, and \" rolls on wheels that are made of money. \" he even did well in north florida, an area much like the southern states gingrich is counting on. Then again, it's worth noting that self-proclaimed \" very conservative \" voters still weren't behind romney; they backed gingrich 43 % to 29 %, and overall 41 % said romney wasn't conservative enough. Plus, jonathan bernstein of the washington post thinks there might be a \" weird equilibrium in which gingrich's popularity rises every time he's out of it, and people stop reminding republican voters about all the reasons they should oppose him. \" of course, it \" then sinks rapidly as soon as they do. \"",

Louis cardinals. The suspected goal of what deadspin notes may become \" one of the biggest and weirdest scandals in baseball history \": to take successful astros ' gm jeff luhnow ( an ex-cardinals exec ) down a notch. Player personnel info, scouting reports, and internal trade discussions were all said to be compromised in the 2013 hack, which the times says \" did not appear to be sophisticated, \" per law enforcement sources. Subpoenas for electronic correspondence have been served to the cardinals and mlb. The league \" has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach, \" a spokesman for mlb commissioner rob manfred said in a statement, per the times. Luhnow's backstory explains what might have prompted the hack: before luhnow created the astros ' \" ground control \" computer network — which deadspin called \" a marvel \" in its june 2014 article that published part of the breached info — he had worked with the cardinals'similar redbird network, the times notes. Cardinals officials believed luhnow skipped town with their database concept and proprietary info, investigators say, also noting a smacking-our-heads theory about how the hackers may have gained access: working off the master list of passwords luhnow used to access redbird. In the meantime, as the feds continue their probe, no heads have rolled at the cardinals, and no individuals have been named, the times notes.",

            "A bill to legalize same-sex marriage won narrow approval friday night in the maryland house of delegates, setting the stage for the state to join seven others and the district in allowing gay nuptials. The 72 to 67 vote, which followed a day of emotional and contentious debate, capped a dramatic turnaround from a year ago and all but assures the measure will be sent to gov. Martin o ' malley ( d ) for his promised signature. The bill passed with one vote to spare and moves to the senate, which approved similar legislation last year. But maryland voters could get the final say: opponents are widely expected to launch a petition drive that could put the issue on the november ballot. \"we should extend to families, same-sex loving couples, the right to marry in a civil ceremony, \" del. Maggie l. Mcintosh ( d-baltimore ), one of seven gay house members, told a hushed chamber friday night after relaying her experience of coming out as a lesbian. \"i ' m going to ask you today, my colleagues, to make history. \" maryland's move toward same-sex marriage comes amid a fresh wave of momentum nationally for gay-rights activists. Gay nuptials bills were signed by the governors of new york in june and washington state this month, and a federal appeals court this month declared california '",
            "A bill that would legalize same-sex marriage squeaked through the house of delegates on friday night with just one vote above the minimum needed for passage, putting maryland on the cusp of becoming the eighth state to allow such unions.cheers erupted when the gavel dropped on the final 72-67 tally. Within minutes, gov.martin o ' malley, a democrat who sponsored the bill, walked from his second-floor office to the door of the house chamber, embraced house speakermichael e. Buschand said, \" good job, man. \" \" we are a good people. We all want the same things for our kids, \" o ' malley said. Then he extended credit to delegates and activists, many of whom had been skeptical about his commitment to the issue. \" these guys did it, \" he said.the measure now goes to the senate, which passed a similar bill last year and is expected do so again. The chamber will likely take up the measure next week.should the bill pass in both chambers, activists on both sides believe it would be petitioned to referendum in november. If voters approve the measure, the earliest a gay couple would be able to wed is january 2013, when the law would go into effect.the victory is significant for o ' malley, who threw the weight of his office behind the measure after a similar bill fell"

A prototype will be mounted on the uss ponce and tried out in the 5th fleet region of the middle east next year. The navy also released a video of the laser locking on an unmanned drone and causing it to catch fire and crash. \" it operates much like a blowtorch... With an unlimited magazine, \" said an official. At about $ 32 million each, the weapon is far cheaper than the air force's abandoned $ 1.5 billion nose-mounted lasers — and navy researchers say their version hit every time in testing. But it fares less well in bad weather, requires a direct line of sight to the target, and could be rendered ineffective by a drone or vessel coated with a reflective surface, the new york times reports. Meanwhile, the navy is looking into a more versatile free-electron laser and a \" rail gun \" that fires bullets several times faster than the speed of sound.",

The unidentified woman told cops she lit up with other moms before getting in the car. She was cited for the speeding offense, though not for toking up, cbc reports. Saanich pd tweeted that the driver was given a sobriety test. Responding on twitter, one man rapped cops for failing to tweet that the woman passed the test and thus wasn't charged with impaired driving. Donnie villeneuve posted: \"why don't you mention that despite smoking this obvious devil weed, she passed the sobriety test and wasn't charged? #shame \" the pd responded: \"the point is you don't consume intoxicants before driving. And you then don't speed thru school zone while under influence. \" canada is in the process of legalizing marijuana, but price said that shouldn't lead anyone to think it's ok to smoke and drive. \"that's not the case, \" he said, per ctv.

Administration officials said those include removing several indian space and defense companies from the entities list, which identifies firms that manufacture products with dual civilian and military purposes and makes it more difficult for them to trade with the united states. Obama also informed indian officials that he will support the country's membership to four international alliances responsible for regulating trade in nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technology and materials, including the nuclear suppliers group. Indian leaders have aspired to join, but u.s. Nonproliferation groups immediately criticized the move for weakening the world's ability to monitor nuclear trade. \" i ' m here because i believe that in our interconnected world, increased commerce between the united states and india can be and will be a win-win proposition for both nations, \" obama told the u.s.-india business council, drawing applause. \" i realize that for some, this truth may not"

        "summary": "The moment that will live in infamy from last night's debate, the gaffe that overshadowed everything else, was rick perry's utter meltdown as he forgot one of the agencies he himself wanted to eliminate. But there were other people onstage, and here's how people are grading them this morning: herman cain, loser: \"it's hard to imagine what cain could have done to change the conversation, \" says brian montopoli of cbs news. \"but he didn't do it. Cain brought no new ideas wednesday, \" focusing instead on 9-9-9 — which now draws laughter. Newt gingrich, winner: but kind of by default. He came across \"as grumpy and impatient, \" says joe holley of the houston chronicle, but he probably gained momentum nonetheless. \"gingrich is clearly the most experienced and knowledgeable debater on the stage, and he would be the first to tell you so. \" mitt romney, winner: romney debates \"like a lexus sedan — smooth and dependable, albeit not particularly exciting, \" says holley. The implosion of perry, his only well-funded rival, puts romney comfortably in the driver's seat. Jon huntsman, loser: he did well, but needed romney to collapse. Since that didn't happen, montopoli thinks he's still \"on the outside looking in. \" maria bartiromo, winner: chris cillizza of the washington post was impressed with the cnbc moderator, who tried to \"push the candidates off of their talking points, forcing them to answer the questions actually asked of them. \"",

The casual-eating chain announced yesterday it's cutting that artificial ingredient and some 150 others ( out of some 465 ingredients currently used ) from its menu by the end of 2016 in response to consumer demand, the wall street journal reports. The items on the eatery's \" no no list \" include artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors, and preservatives, though some artificial items will remain in the beverages it sells. Panera says it's the first restaurant company in the us to make public such a list, fortune reports. \" we're trying to draw a line in the sand in the industry so that consumers have an easy way to know what's in the food they buy, \" says ron shaich, chief executive of panera, per the new york times. Panera joins the likes of chipotle, mcdonald's, and even mac-and-cheese king kraft in offering what appear to be more healthful, natural foods. But sarah kaplan writes for the washington post that this \" reflects more pr than science, \" arguing that some of the ingredients haven't been linked to negative effects. The executive director of the center for science in the public interest agrees, telling usa today that \" eliminating many of the ingredients with unfamiliar chemical names … is done solely for pr purposes and not to make safer, more healthful foods. \" shaich doesn't totally dispute this, telling the times, \" i ' m not wading into the debate over whether any of these things cause cancer or are otherwise bad for you. I just think this is where the consumer's head is right now. \" the changes are already beginning: artificial-ingredient-free salad dressings hit panera tomorrow.",
