Abdulazeez, a naturalized us citizen, had relatives in the country and had made the trip at least four times previously over the years. He had also visited kuwait. \"he'd take off for a month or two mostly during his college breaks, \" a high school friend tells the washington post. But if those trips radicalized him, nobody seemed to know about it. \" muhammad was always happy go lucky, \" says the friend. The tennessean reports that abdulazeez, who had an engineering degree from the university of tennessee at chattanooga, had been working the last three months as a shift supervisor at a local tech company called superior essex inc. Aside from his calling in sick the last few days he was supposed to work, he showed no signs of trouble there. The first hint of it appears to have come in a blog post just days ago in which he described life as \" short and bitter \" and urged submission to allah. There's still no confirmation on how abdulazeez died, but the fbi says evidence suggests the 24-year-old was killed by police bullets and did not take his own life, reports cnn. He had two long guns, one handgun, and a \" load-bearing vest \" that allowed him to carry extra ammunition.",

Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, ceos have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced.

        "summary": "The battle for iraq is getting uncomfortably close to its capital city. Islamic state of iraq and syria militants briefly took over parts of the city of baquba, which is just 37 miles from baghdad, the bbc reports. The iraqi military and allied shiite militias eventually drove them off — and killed 28 rebels in the process, an official tells the wall street journal. During the battle 44 prisoners at a police station were also killed, though by whom is unclear. Nouri al-maliki's office blamed militants, but other officials said security forces killed the prisoners as they tried to escape. Baquba residents are frightened, sources say, and many are fleeing the city. Government fighters are combing the city for isis holdouts. There has also been fighting on two major highways leading into baghdad. Meanwhile, inside baghdad, four young men believed to be sunnis were found dead in a predominantly shiite neighborhood, the new york times reports. Each had been shot numerous times, in murders reminiscent of death squad killings that were common in 2006 and 2007 government forces are also fighting to retake tal afar, which is west of mosul. Those forces are massing at the airport in preparation for their next assault, as the government launches airstrikes on the city center. About 700 isis fighters are massed there. Iraq's government has openly accused saudi arabia of funding isis, the telegraph reports. Riyadh is \" siding with terrorism, \" maliki's office said in a statement. \" the saudi government should be held responsible for the dangerous crimes committed by these terrorist groups. \" the us has made a reduction of sectarian tensions in iraq a prerequisite for aide, but maliki has done precious little work on that front, the times reveals today. Instead, maliki has occupied himself solely with military matters — so much so that his staff has begun wearing fatigues.",

        "summary": "A nifty new knife that can sniff out cancer might soon be in operating rooms, reports bloomberg. In its first major test, the \" intelligent knife, \" or iknife, did spectacularly well — as in, 100 % accuracy in 91 cases. Here's how it works: when a surgeon cuts into a patient's tissue, the heat sends up smoke. The iknife collects the smoke and analyzes it to determine whether the tissue is cancerous, explains ap. Under current procedures, doctors typically must wait a half-hour to get such results. The new knife provides them instantly. The upshot is that when surgeons open up a patient to remove a tumor, the device would give them a much better chance of snipping out all the cancerous tissue and leaving behind all the healthy stuff. Among other things, that could reduce the need for follow-up surgeries, notes the royal society of chemistry. But first comes more tests for maker medimass. The knife costs $ 380,000, but the price should drop assuming it aces those tests, too, and goes commercial.",

        "summary": "One of the worst fiascos in smartphone history was caused not by faulty hardware or software, but by faulty batteries from two different manufacturers, samsung says. In a monday press conference in seoul, the company said early galaxy note 7 fires were caused by ill-fitting battery components, the bbc reports. In replacement phones, defects including welding issues and a lack of insulation were to blame, the company said. Samsung issued a recall last year after widely reported cases of the phone catching fire and exploding. It ended up axing its answer to the iphone and losing around $ 5.3 billion. \" the lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process, \" samsung mobile chief koh dong-jing told reporters. \" samsung electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust, \" koh said. Samsung says that to verify the cause of the fires, 700 researchers tested more than 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries, the ap reports. Koh told reporters that there was no sign that the very high energy density of the note 7 batteries had made them prone to overheating, but the episode provides a \" chance to strengthen the safety of lithium-ion batteries for the entire industry, not only us. \" samsung says it has recovered 96 % of the 3 million note 7s that were sold, and it hasn't decided yet whether it is going to reuse parts. Analysts tell reuters that samsung has probably done enough to reassure consumers, but it will be a different story if there are any problems with its galaxy s8, which is expected to be in stores by april.",

        "summary": "It's official. As predicted by many, president trump nominated neil gorsuch for supreme court justice on tuesday, the new york times reports. Gorsuch is a \" reliably conservative figure \" with a similar philosophy to the late antonin scalia. If gorsuch is confirmed, justice kennedy would once again be the court's swing vote between its liberal and conservative members. Gorsuch, a 49-year-old federal appeals court judge from denver, is the youngest nominee in 25 years. Here's what you need to know about trump's pick: the denver post looks at gorsuch's notable cases as a judge, including siding with hobby lobby and other religious organizations against the affordable care act and coming out against euthanasia and assisted suicide. Similarities to scalia or not, gorsuch was always going to be labeled the next coming of the former supreme court justice, new republic argues. That way the gop can make it seem only obvious that someone like scalia should be approved to fill \" scalia's chair. \" international business times compares the net worth of gorsuch — who stands to make nearly $ 250,000 a year as a justice — with those of other justices. The new york times has a nifty chart showing where gorsuch would fit on the supreme court, ideologically speaking. It turns out only clarence thomas would be further to the right. Gorsuch actually served as a law clerk for justice kennedy, and the national law journal wonders if there are now too many former clerks on the supreme court, limiting its experiential diversity. The denver post reports gorsuch is generally well-liked by colorado university law students, one of whom says he's a \" person of character and quality, intellectually curious and willing to debate all sides. \" gorsuch's family has a history in washington dc, cnn reports. His mom was an epa administrator under reagan. She refused to give congress records on toxic waste and resigned amid controversy. The human rights commission issued a statement against gorsuch and his \" long and troubling career \" opposing civil rights. That includes speaking out against marriage equality, which he called part of the liberal \" social agenda. \"",

At gawker, hamilton nolan weighs in: \" online advertising can generate enough revenue to support an operation like gawker media, but not an operation like the new york times.

The economics of the online news business will not support the infrastructure or newsroom that the printed paper supports. Unless the new york times company can come up with a miracle new digital revenue stream, therefore, it will eventually have to be restructured and downsized ( or sold to a deep-pocketed sydney harmon-type who runs it at a loss out of love ). Importantly, even a successful online paywall will not allow the paper to maintain its current cost structure. We estimate that the nyt currently spends about $ 200 million a year on its newsroom and generates about $ 150 million of online revenue.

            "The new york times is due to introduce a ' metered ' paywall in early 2011. Readers will be allowed to access a certain number of articles free each month, then will be asked to pay. \" this has the benefit of allowing our millions of readers who come to us through search engine to still find our content, \" sulzberger specified, while those who use the site heavily will be charged. Chairman and publisher of the, stressed the need to take risks and not be afraid of failure in the quest to find a business model that can adequately support high quality journalism. He was speaking at thein london. He confirmed that the paper will work with google to implement first click free, stressing that \" we want to ensure that nytimes.com continues to be part of the open web ecosystem. \" many details of the pay strategy are yet to be decided,",
            "At a conference in london, arthur sulzberger jr conceded that someday the new york times company will be forced to stop publishing a printed paper. * this sounds obvious, but it's a big deal. The economics of the online news business will not support the infrastructure or newsroom that the printed paper supports. Unless the new york times company can come up with a miracle new digital revenue stream, therefore, it will eventually have to be restructured and downsized ( or sold to a deep-pocketed sydney harmon-type who runs it at a loss out of love ). Importantly, even a successful online paywall will not allow the paper to maintain its current cost structure. We estimate that the nyt currently spends about $ 200 million a year on its newsroom and generates about $ 150 million of online revenue. If the paywall is highly successful -- attracting, say, 1 million subscribers",

He tweeted that the inquiry is \" the greatest witch hunt in political history \" and said donald trump jr. Was \" open, transparent and innocent \" after the younger trump's fox news appearance on tuesday night. Behind the scenes, however, trump is said to be seething because the russia story continues to command so much attention and because leakers keep feeding the fire. The washington post quotes an anonymous trump supporter outside the white house who calls the pr mess a \" category 5 hurricane, \" and the story says infighting is at a fever pitch. Axios also takes note of the \" tense environment \" and says one of the top concerns inside the white house is figuring out who leaked news of the trump jr. Meeting. Buzzfeed takes a specific look at the leaker angle and quotes trump adviser roger stone as betting on former campaign manager corey lewandowski. \" donny was a vocal critic of corey — he walked him towards the exits, \" says stone, who clashed with lewandowki himself. \" i ' m not unbiased, but he'd be my choice. \" lewandowski did not comment. As for the president, politico reports that he's \" using his relatively light schedule to watch tv and fume about \" the new twist. Meanwhile, a statement from vp mike pence in response to the latest revelations is raising eyebrows, with some suggesting that he's trying to distance himself from the mess. \" the vice president was not aware of the meeting, \" says a statement, per the hill. \" he is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket. \"",

        "summary": "The toll from tuesday's chemical attack on the syrian town of khan sheikhoun now stands at more than 80 — including 22 members of a single extended family. The alyousef family was one of the town's main clans, and 29-year-old survivor abdel hameed alyousef has had to bury his 9-month-old twins ( a son and a daughter ), along with his wife and other family members, the ap reports. The shopkeeper, who's being treated for exposure to toxins, says that when airstrikes hit, he was with the twins and his wife. He says he brought them to paramedics, thinking they would be ok and went to look for other family members, but he found only bodies. \" i couldn't save anyone. They're all dead now, \" he says. Relatives later said that his wife and the twins, aya and ahmed, had also died. At least 30 children and 20 women were among the victims of the attack, and authorities say the toll could still rise. \" many are still missing. We are afraid to enter homes sometimes lest we find more people dead, \" says alaa alyousef, another surviving member of the clan. Syria has denied responsibility, though witnesses say they saw a syrian army jet drop three conventional bombs on the rebel-held town tuesday morning, along with one that made little sound but left a cloud of white smoke, reuters reports. Medecins sans frontieres says the victims it has treated had symptoms that suggest exposure to sarin gas. President trump has called the attack an \" affront to humanity \" and said it is \" his responsibility \" to deal with syria.",

They'd known for decades that the 100-foot-tall structure in mexico's yucatan state sits on top of a smaller, 65-foot-tall pyramid. Now, a new scan reveals that a third pyramid is beneath the second one, reports the bbc. Hence the russian nesting doll comparison: \" under the large one we get another and another, \" says project head rene chavez seguro. The outer pyramid was built between 700 and 1,000 years ago and draws 1 million visitors a year. This newly discovered pyramid, reaching 33 feet tall, may be up to 1,500 years old and appears to have a staircase and an altar at its peak. It's also slightly out of alignment with the other two pyramids, which \" may indicate that there are other buildings hidden at the same level, \" reports deutsche welle. As for why the mayans built over it, the bbc cites two possibilities: a transfer of leadership or because it was simply in bad shape. Cbs news reports the discovery was made using a non-invasive electrical imaging technique called 3d electrical tomography, and says no excavation plans have been announced.

        "summary": "For his first solo album, aerosmith's steven tyler went out and made a country record. But here's the kicker: it's apparently — against all odds — pretty darn good. \"i ' m looking forward to hopefully being accepted into the community of country, \" tyler tells the arizona republic. \"i know it's a tight gang to get into. But... I think i hit on some magic. \" here's what people are saying about some of that magic found on we're all somebody from somewhere, which most admit seemed like a terrible idea on paper: the album \" seems worrisome \" but is actually \" remarkably consistent, even organic, \" the boston globe reports. \" tyler, who co-wrote all of the album's strongest material, proves a solid storyteller with a gift for melody. \" instead of a \"frivolous exercise by a past-his-prime, attention-seeking celebrity, \" listeners get an album \"worthy of serious appraisal, \" according to slant magazine. The ap notes that despite immediate references to bullets, whiskey, and jesus, only one song on we're all somebody from somewhere comes across as \" corny bro-country banalities. \" \"i've got to tell you that i am more than just a little pleased with the result. Hell, let me say this. I am outright impressed, \" says sounds like nashville's chuck dauphin, who initially wrote the album off as a \" marketing ploy. \" the boston herald reports we're all somebody from somewhere has \" strong stuff on it. \" a number of tracks have a \"raw, cool, and strange but magnetic americana approach that's been missing from aerosmith for a few decades. \" but there's always an exception that proves the rule. The album is \" tolerably listenable, \" but \"whatever country is these days, it is not steven tyler, \" according to the irish times. Watch tyler perform one of his country songs here.",

        "summary": "Little garnett spears seemed to be constantly in and out of hospitals and doctor's offices, struggling with various health maladies for all of his short life, while his doting single mom lacey documented it all on facebook and twitter and asked for prayers. Garnett didn't survive the last hospitalization, dying on jan. 23 in an upstate new york hospital — and now authorities are investigating lacey spears, who's under suspicion of poisoning the boy she called her \" little prince. \" garnett had suspiciously elevated sodium levels when he was admitted to the hospital, prompting doctors to alert police. Sources tell the journal news they found a high concentration of sodium in a feeding bag spears used to feed her son through a tube in his stomach — a bag that spears allegedly asked a friend to throw away while she was at the hospital with garnett. Why would spears do such a thing? investigators think she could have munchausen by proxy, a psychiatric disorder in which a parent harms a child in order to get sympathy and attention from others. The journal news is running a five-part series on the tragedy. The first two parts are online now; they reveal that before she gave birth to garnett, spears often watched the child of a friend and co-worker — and would tell people, both in person and online ( where she posted many pictures of him with captions like \" my world my everything \" ) that he was her son. That boy's mother says he suffered from chronic ear infections during that time period — a malady that also plagued garnett — but they went away when spears stopped watching him. And then things get even weirder: spears claimed garnett's father, a police officer named blake she called her \" soulmate \" and wrote extensively about on a blog, died in a car accident. But close friends insist no such person exists, and the man who claims to be garnett's real father says the boy was conceived during a brief fling and spears never introduced garnett to him. The medical examiner has not yet ruled on garnett's cause of death, and spears has not been charged. The full story is worth a read, including this article on munchausen by proxy \" red flags. \"",

        "summary": "President trump hit the six-month mark in office thursday. So, how's he doing? that depends. The washington post looks at trump's progress on seven key campaign issues. The status of his goals to have better relations with russia and reform health care have been well-covered elsewhere. The wall is still not built, though trump has continued to specify what it will look like ( solar panels, see-through parts to protect from flying bags of drugs, etc. ). Portions of his travel ban have been halted by the courts, and he went back on his promise to label china a currency manipulator. And whether or not you're \" tired of winning \" yet is \" in the eye of the beholder. \" here's what else you need to know about the trump presidency at six months: despite everything else, the economy is actually doing well under trump, marketwatch reports. The us has added 863,000 jobs since february, and the s&p 500 is up 10.4 % since january. However, wage growth hasn't matched those gains. Abc news looks at trump's 182 days in office by the numbers, including signing 42 pieces of legislation, a historically low 36 % approval rating, 37 days spent on a golf course he owns, one solo news conference, and 1,279 days left in his first term. The washington post has some other numbers: trump has made 836 false or misleading claims during his first six months for an average of 4.6 per day. Michael goodwin at the new york post says we can't judge trump's presidency too harshly because he's been targeted relentlessly by the media, democrats, and \" much of the permanent government \" and has yet to start \" world war iii with a tweet. \" goodwin thinks he ' ll turn it around: \" i believe trump's ego will not let him accept being a failed president. \" on the other hand, david leonhardt at the new york times says trump's presidency \" is off to the least successful start in modern times \" by the president's own stated terms. Despite using his executive power to change policies on immigration and climate change, trump hasn't passed a single major piece of legislation, is historically unpopular, and is embroiled in the russian scandal. In a press release, the white house touts six months of job creation, accountability, cutting regulations, and \" putting america first. \" finally, joe garofoli at the san francisco chronicle has some advice on how trump can \" reboot \" his presidency.

Instead, a domino's pizza deliveryman got a big shock — and an even bigger tip, wrtv indianapolis reports. Newman, ceo of residential education for the school, soon explained \" we were going to bless him with an offering, \" the student says. As james gilpin delivered the $ 12.50 order for two pizzas, he was presented with a $ 1,268 tip from students, $ 70 in gift cards, a piece of cake, and thousands of inspirational notes written only minutes before. His reaction: \" i was just in awe, \" gilpin tells wish, which notes it takes him about a month to make that much in tips. \" i just want to thank you for all your hard work, \" one letter in his stack read. \" no one else may see it, but i do. Never stop working hard for your dreams because you can accomplish anything. \" gilpin tells abc news the moment \" didn't sink in until about two hours afterwards, \" but \" i thought it was very nice for an average joe like me to get something like that. \" he adds, \" it couldn't have been a better time because i was struggling bad. \" gilpin says he ' ll use the money to pay off some bills, fix his car and roof, and help provide for his two young kids at christmas.

I am just so grateful they saw it. \" also surrounding the bombshell announcement: abc news recaps the case and answers some important questions, including a look back at how the occupation started and ended, what exactly went down in court ( including ammon bundy's attorney getting stun-gunned ), and what's now at stake. Lane crothers at the new york daily news notes there are two things about the verdict that \" should scare all americans. \" the first, per crothers, is that it was a \" clear case of jury nullification, \" in which the jurors were swayed by their own opinions rather than the letter of the law. The second? well, crothers says it's tied to donald trump, as well as to \" a resurgence of the violence that was once endemic across the american west. \" the oregonian points out how the verdict has \" [ deepened ] divides \" among the locals. While almost everyone seemed shocked by the verdict, which way their moods veered differed. One local businesswoman and rancher lauded the \" great news \" and noted \" we need to continue getting back in control and not having 40 % of our county under public employment. \" but another resident's take? \" it's absolutely devastating. It's awful. We're just disgusted with the verdict. \" comparisons have been drawn between what happened to the malheur seven on the wildlife reserve and what's currently going on with the native-america lakota protests to the dakota access pipeline — including the very different federal response to both.

Whitaker was yesterday called out by david carr, who wrote in the new york times that \" those in the know \" ( carr included ) neglected to more thoroughly investigate or report on the abuse allegations that have been floating around for years while penning their articles on cosby. Whitaker acknowledged his regrets online, tweeting to carr yesterday afternoon, \" david you are right. I was wrong to not deal with the sexual assault charges against cosby and pursue them more aggressively. \" he adds, \" i am following new developments and will address them at the appropriate time. If true the stories are shocking and horrible. \" carr isn't the first to wonder why whitaker sidestepped mention of the allegations, nor the last. In a piece on salon last night, erin keane wrote that while journalists should be lauded for fact-checking and confirming what they uncover before they print it, \" at some point, it becomes irresponsible not to mention multiple accusations of violence and sexual abuse, especially when they contrast so starkly with the image the bulk of the biography presents. \" and that biography, as dwight garner wrote in the times in september, is \" square, competent, gentle, g-rated, dignified, and, in the end, a bit distant. \" now whitaker is rethinking his decision, telling the daily beast, \" well, look, obviously the story has changed, and i ' m going to have to address that in future editions of the book, if not sooner.

Bono, a former republican congresswoman, had just replaced former president and ceo kerry perry, who herself resigned after just nine months on the job amid criticism she was not adequately responding to the larry nassar sex abuse scandal. But bono quickly came under fire for a september tweet in which she defaced a nike logo after the company featured colin kaepernick in an ad campaign; olympic champion simone biles expressed her displeasure with bono's stance on the matter, and other criticism followed. Bono deleted the tweet and released a statement saturday saying she regretted posting it, but more criticism followed. This time, it was bono's previous work for law firm faegre baker daniels that came under fire, with another olympic champion, aly raisman, bringing it up, cnn reports. It was a former attorney for that firm who allegedly worked with nassar on false statements about why he couldn't attend big events in the lead-up to the 2016 rio olympics in order to cover up the fact that he was under investigation for child sex abuse. \" my teammates &amp; i reported nassar's abuse to usag in 2015. We now know usoc &amp; lawyers at faegre baker daniels ( mary bono's firm ) were also told then, yet nassar continued to abuse children for 13 months!? why hire someone associated with the firm that helped cover up our abuse? \" raisman tweeted monday. Faegre baker daniels said in a statement that it helped report nassar to the fbi in 2015, and usa gymnastics said bono did not work with usag or nassar while she was at the firm. In her statement tuesday, bono said her resignation \" comes in the wake of personal attacks that, left undefended, would have made my leading usag a liability for the organization. \" she also defended her nike tweet, saying she was just exercising her first amendment rights, sports illustrated reports. There have been at least two other high-profile departures from usag since may, one of them after just three days on the job.",

        "summary": "Bottlenose dolphins may be an iconic draw to the mediterranean, but they're not exactly indigenous. So say researches out of the university of lincoln in the uk, who report in the journal evolutionary biology that the water-dwelling mammals didn't arrive until the end of the last ice age some 18,000 years ago. They reached this conclusion based on an analysis of dna samples collected from 194 adult bottlenose dolphins between 1992 and 2011, from which they were able to form a recent evolutionary genetic timeline. In fact, they say the area likely wasn't home to many cetaceans ( dolphins, whales, porpoises ) at all until this point, likely because the water was too salty. As glaciers melted and diluted the salt concentration, other fish began to move into the area, thus giving hungry dolphins a reason to follow suit, reports livescience. But because the move was so recent, the population of dolphins isn't genetically complex, reports nature world news, with just one \" metapopulation \" divided into subgroups by region.

        "summary": "A political fight on capitol hill becomes very real today for about 1.3 million americans: their long-term unemployment benefits expire. In the latest budget deal, lawmakers didn't extend the 5-year-old federal emergency program that provides an average of $ 300 a month to people who have used up their standard 26 weeks, reports the wall street journal. Expect it to be at the top of congress ' agenda in 2014, reports the hill, with democrats pressing to restore the benefits, perhaps retroactively. Doing so for the full year would cost about $ 25 billion. Republicans and libertarians generally argue that the extension was necessary during the worst of the recession, but no more. \" this is an emergency program, \" says a budget analyst with the cato institute think tank. \" the emergency has long been over. \" the benefits \" induce people to wait to start searching for a job, and that ends up kind of hurting them, \" he says. Democrats counter that the benefits not only provide vital cash to recipients — nancy pelosi called the failure to extend them \" immoral \" yesterday — but boosts the overall economy by helping people who would otherwise have no money to spend do so. Prospects for an extension are murky given the \" constrained fiscal environment, \" reports the new york times. One scenario is that republicans agree to a 3-month extension if democrats offset the money with cuts elsewhere.",

But as the guardian reports, the security breach ended up with an evacuation, armed law enforcement on the scene, and more than a gallon of a fruity syrup ingested by the one that committed the breach. The primate perp: kumbuka, a silverback gorilla that made an \" opportunistic \" escape through two unlocked doors. The 405-pound \" alpha male \" — said by the express to have an \" insatiable sexual appetite \" — was being summoned to dinner on oct. 13 in his enclosure when he discovered the first unlocked door, slipped through it, then breezed through a second unsecured entryway, at which point he encountered the zookeeper. The sun notes the zoo was put on lockdown, with some visitors cowering in an onsite cafe and other enclosures. But a potentially disastrous situation was mitigated by what field calls the \" incredibly close bond \" between gorilla — called a \" f --- ing psycho \" by one employee and a \" gentle giant \" by another, per the express — and human keeper, who chatted with kumbuka \" calmly and in the same light-hearted tone he would always use \" until he could get himself to safety. As an alarm sounded at the zoo, kumbuka explored the off-limits area, finding a stash of black currant squash — a concentrated nonalcoholic syrup used in fruity drinks — and downed more than a gallon of it. All told, kumbuka was on the loose for about 90 minutes before employees could tranquilize him and return him to his den. ( the bbc explains what ingesting that much squash would do to a gorilla. )",

Gray, who suffered a broken neck and later died, was handcuffed and put in leg irons during a police transfer. While authorities still don't know how or when the injury was caused, suspects without a seat belt have been paralyzed or killed during bumpy police rides, which some argue are intentional. One such death occurred in baltimore in 2005. Just nine days before gray's death, police regulations were revised to state that all prisoners must be strapped in a vehicle with seat belts or \" other authorized restraining devices \" for safety reasons; gray wasn't, says attorney michael davey. Commissioner anthony batts, who has met with gray's family, says a prisoner should not have been transported without a seat belt under any circumstance. \" he wasn't wearing a seat belt and that's part of our investigation, \" he says, per the guardian. But \" policy is policy, practice is something else, \" especially when suspects are aggressive, davey says. \" it is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small, and this one was very small. \" meanwhile, two men were arrested yesterday during a fifth night of protests; the baltimore pd tweeted that a 24-year-old was charged with destruction of property, and a 23-year-old was charged with assault.

Upon seeing it was a snake, kyle colquitt says his cousin reached out to grab it, unaware it had a venomous bite. Colquitt says the snake was a baby and that it actually bit adams three times. Colleton county fire chief barry mcroy said that after being bitten, adams \" was in bad shape, and greatly deteriorated \" during an ambulance ride. The colleton medical center had anti-venom ready in the emergency room to treat him, mcroy says. Adams was then flown by helicopter to the medical university of south carolina in charleston on sunday, and a rep for musc tells the state he's currently in \" good condition. \" the rep says adams does not want to speak to the media and does not want the attention the incident is generating. Mcroy described it as the first rattlesnake bite recorded in the county so far this year, the state reports, though there have been a few nonfatal copperhead attacks. Rattlesnake bites can lead to more serious health problems than a typical copperhead bite, but deaths are rare. ( this virginia woman was attacked by a copperhead snake inside a steakhouse. )",

The measure is widely considered retaliation for the magnitsky act, an american bill signed into law earlier this month that puts restrictions on russians deemed to be human-rights violators.

He says police told him one of the \" suspects they were looking at had dressed in drag, he had some odd habits, \" which sounds a lot like durst, who birkbeck says was living in the city then. \" the durst news has created enough of a question mark in my mind that i ' m going to follow up with the fbi, \" modafferi's father tells the daily news. Durst is currently in custody in new orleans, but his extradition to face murder charges in california will be delayed for at least a week while authorities in louisiana pursue weapons and marijuana charges against him, reports the guardian, which notes that his attorney, who says his arrest was based on ratings, not facts, has welcomed the delay. Police officers, one of them wearing an lapd badge, spent hours searching durst's houston home yesterday and left with two document boxes, the ap reports. ( the ap clarified yesterday that durst, 71, is not the lead singer of limp bizkit. )",

        "summary": "Lots of pundits are calling tuesday's election results a defeat for president trump and his agenda. One-time senior aide steve bannon has a different take: losing candidates weren't trumpian enough. \" one of the things about the gillespie campaign is that you can't fake the trump agenda, \" bannon said, referring to republican ed gillespie's loss in the virginia governor's race. Trump's \" is a winning agenda, \" he told a gathering of republicans wednesday in macomb county, mich., per nbc news. \" this is the agenda america needs now. \" gillespie embraced some of trump's views on immigration and crime during the campaign, but bannon still views gillespie as an \" establishment \" candidate at heart. Along those anti-establishment lines, bannon also again went after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, blaming him for not getting trump's initiatives passed. \" you cannot be nice to these guys, \" bannon said, referring to mcconnell, per the ap. \" you have to drop the hammer. That's what he understands. \" bannon also appeared on fox news wednesday, where he called for mcconnell's resignation, reports politico. \"i ' m to the point that i think mitch mcconnell, to really bring unity to the republican party and get things done, i think mitch mcconnell ought to tender his resignation, \" bannon told sean hannity. But he suggested mcconnell wait until after a proposed overhaul of the tax system is passed. ( trump similarly says that gillespie didn't \" embrace me or what i stand for. \" )",

        "summary": "Hurricane matthew's howling wind and driving rain pummeled florida early friday, starting what's expected to be a ruinous, dayslong battering of the southeast coast. The hurricane has not yet made landfall. Its strongest winds of 120mph were just offshore, but matthew's wrath still menaced more than 500 miles of coastline. It slowed to a category 3 storm early friday but remained dangerous — and is poised to be the first major hurricane to hit the east coast of central florida, the miami herald reports. In the latest developments: the number of homes and businesses without power jumped by the hour as the storm edged closer to the coast. More than 200,000 were in the dark by early friday, the ap reports. As it moved north thursday evening, matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off south florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the miami and fort lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects. The hurricane is expected to blow ashore — or come dangerously close to doing so — early friday north of west palm beach, then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the interstate 95 corridor, through cape canaveral and jacksonville, according to the national hurricane center. Forecasters say the major threat to the southeast will not be the winds — which newer buildings can withstand — but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from south florida to the charleston, sc, area. Cnn reports that in a statement similar to one it sent before hurricane katrina, the national weather service has warned that homes in parts of central florida \" may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. \" the guardian notes that as a category 3 storm, matthew is expected to cause \" devastating \" damage, according to the saffir-simpson grading scale. A category 4 storm causes \" catastrophic \" damage. President obama has declared a state of emergency for florida, georgia, and south carolina, freeing up federal money and personnel to protect lives and property. Matt drudge and others say the government is exaggerating the dangers to make a point about climate change. See slate.",

        "summary": "Amazon rocked the grocery world this month with its plan to buy whole foods. While the deal has not been approved yet, it's still generating all kinds of commentary on what it would mean for supermarkets and consumers. At the washington post, however, caitlin dewey assesses the \" big consequence \" that \" no one's talking about \": the deal's effect on small and mid-sized organic farms, and on the entire organic market in general. In short, it may be bad news on both fronts. Details on that and other aspects of deal: the farms: smaller farms are worried that amazon will do to them what it did to small players in the publishing industry: make them obsolete. Whole foods is the nation's biggest organic retailer, and jeff bezos ' push for lower prices may mean that only large industrialized operations will survive. ' organic ': \" but the real harm may come to the organic brand if amazon pushes for price concessions that lead producers to compromise on environmental and formulation standards, \" writes dewey. It's possible consumers might see more products labeled as \" natural \" instead of \" organic. \" unlike the latter, the \" natural \" label means nothing in the eyes of the agriculture department. Counter-view: npr rounds up views from small suppliers who are optimistic about the deal. Yes, amazon has the reputation of squeezing out the small guy, but this time might be different. \" potentially, they say, amazon will open new and better distribution channels, helping them sell products through an online platform with immediate name recognition. \" not enough: a post at quartz looks at the organic issue from a different perspective, pointing out that there's not enough organic food to meet the nation's growing demand. Amazon's entry into the industry might convince more farmers that it's worth the pricey investment and three-year process to convert acres into certified organic fields. Fewer humans: aside from the organic issue, one thing seems clear if the deal goes through: thousands of grocery store workers will lose their jobs through \" amazon-style automation, \" per an op-ed at cnn. The specifics: bloomberg reports that cashiers would be safe at first, with warehouse workers taking the first immediate hit. Indeed, it says that during talks, \" amazon spent a lot of time analyzing whole foods'distribution technology \" and looking for ways to cut costs. Fewer coupons: cnbc says amazon's relentless push for lower prices may ripple across the industry, which could eventually mean the demise of coupons.",

Announced by a russian official tuesday, and later confirmed by the white house, the meeting will take place as the leaders attend the g20 summit in hamburg, germany, reports cbs news. Although cbs has noted that trump would like the encounter to be accompanied by \" full diplomatic bells and whistles, \" not everyone in his administration agrees.

Administration officials tell cnn that trump will instead focus on syria and ukraine. That could be a wrong move that will \" give fuel to trump's critics who say he's blatantly ignoring a major national security threat, \" reports time, which also lists possible demands that could come up. Russia, for example, may demand the return of two compounds in maryland and new york. Speaking on the topic monday, per the ap, putin's foreign affairs adviser noted that moscow, whose patience \" has its limits, \" will be forced to retaliate if the seized properties aren't handed over soon. At the washington post, michael mcfaul, who served on the national security council under president obama, says trump should aim to appear as \" a tough negotiator \" who \" is not willing to offer concessions simply to win putin's praise. \" he offers other advice for trump, too. It's not just the topics of discussion, but the meeting itself, that's an issue for some. Cbs reports state department and national security council officials believe trump should keep putin at a distance.

Discover reports scientists in spain have figured out they can use ultrasound to create brandy that tastes like it's been aged for years in just three days. Brandy is made by distilling wine then aging it in wood casks for two years to more than a decade, according to forbes. The process can be expensive, but before the brandy is aged it's \" almost undrinkable. \" chemical reactions between the alcohol and the wood casks are what give brandies their flavor, smell, and color. That process takes years. Correction: it used to take years. Building off previous research that found ultrasound could be used to get chemicals out of plant tissue, researchers ran distilled wine through american oak chips while hitting it with ultrasound. The ultrasound waves created tiny bubbles that caused the oak chips to release chemical compounds, adding the brandy flavor, nova next reports. The results, published in ultrasonics sonochemistry, were \" really unexpected, \" one researcher tells discover. Eight trained judges ruled the ultrasound brandy \" tasted surprisingly well \" and was comparable to aged brandies. And while, at least in europe, brandy has to be barrel-aged to legally be called brandy, this process could be used to quickly test different woods or to create an entirely new kind of liquor. ( meanwhile, synthetic alcohol promises the buzz without the hangover. )",

You distill the wine ( and the pressed skins ) to get the raw brandy, which is almost undrinkable in its early life. Before it's even palatable, to shave off the raw edges, it needs to mature.

        "summary": "Not long after samsung was ordered to pay apple $ 1.05 billion over patent infringement, unredacted court documents are telling a different story. A perusal of the materials reveals that samsung bosses apparently called on employees to \" make something like the iphone \" — not to copy its design, notes chris matyszczyk at cnet. In the documents, an exec says the apple product is already the industry standard, and that samsung needs to think \" six months ahead \"; he asks his staff to \" be people with creativity. \" apple lawyers reportedly avoided mentioning that particular quote in court. The report comes amid broader questions over a murky patent system that many say is outdated, taking a toll on technological progress. The new york times highlights the issue in a lengthy report today, noting that the last two years have seen $ 20 billion spent on patents and related legal battles; indeed, apple and google spent more on patent issues than on research and development last year. While patents were designed for mechanical technology, digital patents can \" effectively grant ownership of concepts, \" allowing firms to strike down competitors ' work on barely-related products.

An instructor suggested he \" may need extra training. \" in april or may 2014, when liao was seeking a promotion to captain — which came in august — assessors also found performance issues during an abnormal engine start. They also noted problems with his \" cockpit management and flight planning \" and said he often failed to complete procedures and checks.

Syria launched cross-border airstrikes on several parts of anbar province yesterday, killing at least 57 civilians and wounding more than 120 more, local officials tell cnn. The officials say they used scopes and other equipment to identify the planes, which bore syrian flags, and returned to syrian airspace. \" unfortunately, ( the ) syrian regime carried out barbarian attacks against civilians in anbar province, \" the head of the anbar provincial council said. \" today we will hold an emergency meeting in ramadi to address this issue. \" iraq initially blamed us drones, notes the washington post, which says the strikes were aimed at sunni militant targets. In other developments: much of iraq is in the hands of isis militants and prime minister nouri al-maliki is ready to concede that loss temporarily to focus on protecting the capital, iraqi officials say. The military's best-trained and best-equipped troops have been deployed in baghdad, and shiite militias are also focused on protecting the capital and shiite shrines, the ap reports. Isis fighters and allied sunni tribes are battling iraqi forces in a town just 55 miles north of the city, reuters reports. Maliki also appeared to dash any hopes that he would form a unity government with sunni rivals, calling any such move a \" coup against the constitution and an attempt to end the democratic experience, \" the bbc reports. He also blamed political rivals for \" coordinating \" the crisis. The pentagon says the first us troops deployed to assist the iraqi military have arrived in the country and started work, the bbc reports. Two teams with a total of 40 us troops are now on the front line, and hundreds more will arrive in the days to come.

Huh — oh, lemme — just, hmm — one sec — oh, yes — right here — nothing! and it only gets better from there, as craig dismisses the interviewer's",
            "Life is good when you're james bond. At least, it seems to be for daniel craig. When we meet him at the corinthia hotel in london at the end of two years of shooting for the latest 007 film, spectre, the 47-year-old is in a good mood, with a mercurial smile, a firm handshake and a spring in his step. But, as craig admits, even the inspirational effects of being james bond have their limits. The red bulletin: what could we learn from james bond that would help us in our day-to-day lives? daniel craig: [ thinks for a short while. ] nothing. But james bond is one of the most legendary movie heroes of all time. Surely he must have a couple of inspirational personality traits? let's not talk these films up as some kind of life-changing experience",

The 26-year-old harry potter star met darke on the set of his 2013 film how to kill your darlings, when they filmed an intimate scene together.

After geoff keys, 63, took a wrong turn, he spent two days in the forest without food and wearing only a t-shirt, hat, and swim trunks, reports sky news. He decided to sleep until the sun came out, and eventually heard helicopters buzzing overhead. \" it meant that i had been reported missing by my friends and also brought home to me what a terrible night they must have had, wondering where i was, \" he says. Although the helicopter did not spot keys, it gave him an idea. So the retired mechanic wrote \" help 2807 \" in the sand at the beach, and added an arrow that pointed toward his direction. The \" 2807 \" addition indicates the date he wrote the message, july 28. \" i thought this would be enough to get any helicopter that saw it looking in the right place, \" he explains on his blog. A search and rescue helicopter saw the message the next afternoon, ending keys'dangerous ordeal. He was treated for exhaustion, dehydration, and lacerations to his feet, and expressed gratitude for the approximately $ 580,000 rescue. \" their skill and professionalism is incredible, \" he says of the search team. \" i feel stupid but lucky. \"",

I've already mentioned the old telegraph line ( the tele track ) and this story takes place on the second day of travelling up it. The track has several difficult creek crossings and i'd negotiated some of these in the company of two families in their fourbys ( 4x4s ). Mick, carley and blake in one; mike, angela, shakira, deek and jordan in the other. Mick had volunteered to take some of my luggage, which definitely made the soft sand much easier to deal with. We'd camped together at gunshot creek and at the time this story begins we were camped at canal creek, with plans to stay for a couple of nights as the location was so good. On monday morning i did some essential maintenance on my bike, while the families were having fun in the creek, but at about 15.00 i decided to go for a swim. The map showed that eliot falls weren't too far away down canal creek, about two kilometres, and then the walk back to the camp site from there would be about the same."
