Mcconnell has been carefully explaining — without explicitly telling trump what to do — which supreme court nominees would get faster approval before the november elections arrive and make everything dicey, insiders tell the new york times. Mcconnell prefers raymond kethledge and thomas hardiman and warns that reported front-runner brett kavanaugh poses two problems: too long a paper trail from his 12 years on the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, and too much political baggage from his years as assistant to kenneth starr and staff secretary to president george w. Bush. Mcconnell has also told trump he could lose two senate votes ( lisa murkowski and susan collins ) with another apparent contender, amy coney barrett, who has trumpeted socially conservative views and may be more likely to overturn roe v. Wade. Mcconnell is also aware that with john mccain away fighting brain cancer, the gop has only 50 votes, and libertarian-leaning rand paul could be a wild card. The times describes kethledge as a \" strongly conservative \" midwesterner who hasn't spent much time in washington, and hardiman as a \" reliable conservative \" who served with judge maryanne trump barry, one of trump's sisters, on the federal appeals court in philadelphia.

All three were diagnosed with craniosynostosis, a rare birth defect in which a newborn's skull fuses together early, which can impede brain growth.

The actor \" bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him, \" said heather unruh at a press conference wednesday. She says spacey stuck his hand down her son's pants and onto his genitals, and tried to convince him to go to a party where they could continue to drink, usa today reports. A bystander asked the teen if he was ok and the teen said no, at which point the woman urged the teen to flee and he took her advice, unruh said. Unruh, who appeared with an attorney, says her son filed a police report last week and handed over evidence; she says a criminal investigation has been opened but the nantucket police department has not confirmed that. The attorney with unruh noted that her son's accusations are \" well within \" both the civil and criminal statutes of limitations. Usa today has a list of the 14 people so far accusing spacey of sexual assault or harassment. Meanwhile jon bernthal, who worked with spacey on baby driver, told a siriusxm radio show tuesday that he lost respect for spacey while working on the film. \" i thought he was a bit of a bully, \" bernthal said, per people. \" i didn't really care for the way he was behaving toward some of the other people on set. \"",

After the post began drawing reactions, the restaurant apologized online and said the waiter had been fired. \" in no way are the actions of this former employee representative of the saint marc brand nor are they reflective of the opinions of anyone else on our team, including executive management, \" said a restaurant statement.

Saint marc offered to bring the women back for vip treatment and donate 10 % of the night's proceeds to a charity of their choice.

He is accused of starting the fires, the first in 2009 and the last this month, in hallways, in stairwells and in front of exit doors to maximize the potential damage. He was on duty when the fires broke out, the fire department said. All of the fires, which were set between 10: 11 p.m. And 5: 09 a.m., were quickly extinguished. Two firefighters sustained minor injuries in a fire in february, jim long, the fire department's director of public information, said. Mr. Barbosa was arrested, mr.

The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across la since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym angelyne — she's been called a precursor to other \" famous for being famous \" celebrities like paris hilton and kim kardashian — appears to have started off as ronia tamar goldberg. She came to california in 1959 by way of israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when goldberg, who upon arrival to la became renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to goldberg's alleged younger sister, now annette block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all. Angelyne, for her part, has gone on airtalk with host larry mantle to claim that the story contains \" a lot of inaccuracies \" and that the \" vindictive \" piece can never change the fact that she is \" not a woman \" but \" an icon. \" indeed, she ran for mayor of hollywood in 2008, per the washington post, and came in 28th out of 135 candidates; she also ran for governor of california in 2003 and, of course, has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary.

        "summary": "Medical firm founder roger williams owned private planes, flashy cars, and a yacht dubbed \" spare change \"; he had courtside seats to see the lakers and enjoyed spending thousands at strip clubs. But an investigation by the center for investigative reporting suggests his $ 18-million-a-year california company, spinal solutions, made its money in part through counterfeiting expensive screws used in spinal surgeries and then distributing the knockoff screws to surgeons. Williams allegedly wooed doctors via lavish vacations, lakers seats, and containers full of cash. There's no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting, but plenty of them used the screws. A machinist, now 85, tells cir that he made copies of screws for the company for $ 65 each, which is about half of their typical price — and far, far less than the $ 12,500 hospitals once billed for them. Other companies ' logos were also falsified on the screws. A whistleblower finally told the fda about the alleged counterfeiting in 2011, but the company was allowed to continue operation until debts ruined it in 2013. The losers in all this, of course, were the patients, who could face dangers thanks to the substandard equipment. \" this has been terrible, worst thing that's ever happened to me … not knowing if the stuff still in me they couldn't get out will one day kill me, \" says one patient. As of last month, 32 lawsuits sought to address the matter, cbs 2 reports; one has more than 20 plaintiffs. ( in happier spinal news, a paralyzed man's nose helped him to walk again. )",

            "With a metallic clatter, evidence of an elaborate scheme to enrich a few landed in the receiving room of richard walker's surgical supply firm in south africa. Although the true extent of the caper remains buried in the necks and backs of people scattered around the u.s., it began to unravel that day in 2009. Ortho sol makes precision screws for the most delicate of construction projects: spinal fusion. Doctors around the world drive them into the vertebrae of patients with devastating back injuries. The company had repossessed some of its screws after one u.s. Distributor – spinal solutions llc – stopped paying its bills. But now, nestled with the returns, the brighter yellow luster of a few screws caught walker's eye. Testing confirmed his fears. Some were not made of his firm's medical-grade titanium. Their uneven threads showed potential for backing out or breaking, he said. He feared the laser-etched markings intended to make them look authentic could be toxic to patients. Walker's conclusion: the southern california firm was knocking off his products. The screw in the foreground is a knockoff of south korean company u&i corp.'s product. The real screw, with its italic logo, is in the background. Credit: michael i schiller/cir yet it would be two more years before an employee of spinal solutions alerted",

In two statements, officers timothy loehmann and frank garmback say they were investigating a report of a \" guy with a gun \" in a park outside a recreation center on nov. 22, 2014, when they saw tamir pulling what they believed to be a real gun from his waistband, per cleveland.com. Garmback, 47, says he drove over a curb and across a lawn because the park's main entrance blocked cars from entering. Loehmann, 27, says he yelled \" show me your hands \" three times, then opened fire on tamir — who the officers believed was an adult, per the ap. \" even when he was reaching into his waistband, i didn't fire, ' \" loehmann says, per nbc news.

She adds, however, it was \" in the interest of the investigators having the facts. \" the statements were read to grand jurors on tuesday, per the guardian.

The day of the dead is not just observed in mexico, but other parts of latin america, europe and the united states. A petition to stop walt disney co. From trademarking \"dia de los muertos \" went up on change.org tuesday, a day after stitch kingdom reported the filings. As of wednesday morning it had 19,500 signatures. \"our spiritual traditions are for everyone, not for companies like walt disney to trademark and exploit, \" wrote grace sesma, the petition's creator. \"i am deeply offended and dismayed that a family-oriented company like walt disney would seek to own the rights to something that is the rightful heritage of the people of mexico. \" \"this is a sacred tradition. It's not for sale, \" wrote consuelo alba, of watsonville, calif. The trademark application was \" odd \" to evonne gallardo, executive director of the boyle heights art center self help graphics.

Dr lauren ahyow, consultant in communicable disease control at phe east midlands said: \"e. Coli is an infection that causes a spectrum of illness ranging from mild through to severe bloody diarrhoea, mostly without fever. \" sometimes the infection can cause a condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( hus ) which affects the kidneys and can be very serious.

        "summary": "The white, reflective surface of greenland's snowpack is getting darker and less reflective, all thanks to what the christian science monitor calls \" positive feedback loops \" — the idea that a little bit of melting leads to more and faster melting. \" we knew that these processes had been happening, \" says columbia professor marco tedesco, lead author of a new study in the journal cryosphere. \" what's new is the acceleration of the darkening, which started in 1996. \" in fact, parts of greenland may actually be 10 % darker — technically it is losing its \" albedo, \" or reflectivity — by the end of the century, researchers predict. \" it's a train running downhill, and the hill is getting steeper, \" tedesco says. So what happened in 1996? one likely culprit is the natural change in atmospheric circulation called the north atlantic oscillation, in which summer atmospheric conditions \" favored more incoming solar radiation and warmer, moist air from the south, \" tedesco writes in columbia's earth institute. This melting brought impurities such as soot from previous melts to the surface, making it darker and, in turn, prone to melting even faster. And because individual ice grains tend to get larger when snow melts and refreezes, less light scatters across those larger surfaces and more is absorbed, reports gizmodo. This effect appears strongest in the infrared range the human eye cannot see but was found in satellite images. When the atmospheric conditions naturally shifted back in 2013, the damage had already been done, with the ice sheet more vulnerable to melting.

The danish study looked at data from more than 64,000 children and found that those who had prenatal exposure to acetaminophen had a 13 % higher risk of exhibiting adhd-like behaviors, a 29 % higher risk of being prescribed adhd medication, and a 37 % higher risk of receiving a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, a severe form of adhd, usa today reports. The risk increased the later in pregnancy the drug was taken and the longer it was taken. Women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50 % higher chance of their children being prescribed adhd medication. But the authors did not find a cause-and-effect relationship, and they note that \" exhibiting adhd-like behaviors \" is not the same as actually having adhd. Right now, doctors consider acetaminophen the \" safest \" pain reliever for pregnant women, nbc news reports; the study author says pregnant women \" shouldn't worry at this point. \" what could account for the link? the authors think acetaminophen may interfere with key maternal hormones that impact fetal brain development.

        "summary": "Parents are often told to swaddle their newborn babies in order to help them sleep, but a new analysis of studies finds that the practice may increase the risk of sids, the new york times reports. Researchers looked at four studies that examined a total of 760 cases of sudden infant death syndrome, and found that swaddling ( wrapping a baby tightly in a blanket in order to simulate the feeling of being in the womb, aol reports ) increased the risk for sids by about a third overall. Of the babies who died of sids, 17 % were swaddled. The biggest risk was in babies asleep on their stomachs. It was less risky for those sleeping on their sides, and the least risky for those sleeping on their backs. Swaddling makes it more difficult for a baby to move, so a baby on his stomach may be more at risk if he is swaddled and his face is pushed into the mattress. The current recommendation is for parents to place babies on their backs to sleep, and the researchers say this is even more important if the baby is swaddled. The researchers also found the risk increased as the age of the babies increased, and as the study notes, it was greatest for babies older than six months — \" babies start to roll over between four and six months, and that point may be the best time to stop \" swaddling, the lead author says. As for babies swaddled and then put to sleep on their backs, researchers did find a \" small but significant risk \" of sids, the atlantic reports, and that's likely related to babies who were put to sleep on their backs swaddled, but then rolled over.",

The 87-year-old's accusation: that the nonprofit is making use of her fame without compensation. The trademark infringement lawsuit, filed oct. 15, calls out the monroe county heritage museum's website and gift shop sales of mockingbird-branded goods. The museum says that shop rakes in a measly $ 28,000 annually, which funds a few \" pitifully paid \" employees, and that it has sold such goods for two decades, reports al.com. But the suit accuses the museum of taking advantage of the book, and cites its web url as example: tokillamockingbird.com. Just 30,000 visitors head to the museum annually, and it warns that the suit could prove its undoing. Making the story even more contentious: locals aren't sure if lee is actually the driver of the suit, and the museum suspects her \" handlers \" are taking advantage of her declining health. More confusing still, the suit suggests the museum is exploiting her health by committing bolder trademark violations, notes al.com. Lee is deaf and nearly blind, and currently living in an assisted-living facility in monroeville. The guardian doesn't exactly make clear who is believed to be the driver, but floats one name: tonya carter, a lawyer married to truman capote's cousin ( a longtime friend of lee's ).

This time lee, who at 87 is profoundly deaf and almost totally blind, is not the author of the story but – on the surface at least – its protagonist. In a move which has shocked monroeville, lee, who resides in an assisted-living facility in the town, is bringing a lawsuit against the local museum, accusing the small, not-for-profit institution of exploiting her fame and the prestige of her pulitzer-winning book without offering compensation. The museum is fighting back, condemning lee's lawsuit as \"false \" and \"meritless \" and warning that the legal action could destroy an institution that honours the author's legacy and provides an economic boost to the town. It is the kind of ugly public dispute that lee, an intensely private figure who has spent her life avoiding the spotlight, might have been expected to avoid. Unsurprisingly, monroeville has been awash with with rumour about whether miss nelle, as the author is known locally, was personally responsible for the decision to sue"

        "summary": "The stat is remarkable: every three hours in the us, a child swallows a battery and risks potentially lethal consequences, per the washington post. Now, however, a clever fix is in sight, thanks to origami. Mit researchers have unveiled a tiny robot that, once ingested, unfolds inside the body to retrieve batteries or other foreign objects. They've demonstrated how it works in a synthetic stomach, with tests on live animals on deck. Research on the device is still in the early stages, but it could theoretically be used to patch wounds inside the stomach as well, the scientists say in a press release. \" it's really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care, \" says mit's daniela rus. The post notes that the robot's structural material had to be highly safe, meaning \" sharp chips \" were out. \" we spent a lot of time at asian markets and the chinatown market looking for materials, \" says one researcher, and they ended up going with dried pig intestine. ( the verge wonders about a vegan version. ) the robot is encapsulated in ice; upon being swallowed and melting, it opens up to move along like an \" inch-worm, \" explains cnet. Scientists are able to control its movement via magnetic fields, and it can \" swim \" in the stomach's fluids — \" 20 % of [ its ] forward motion is by propelling water, \" per the release. In the demonstration, the robot's attached magnet allowed it to latch onto a battery and remove it. ( the concept of origami holds the promise of creating inexpensive robots. )",

A sampling: the washington post has a feature on trump's life in trump tower: he \" rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air, \" and generally stays surrounded by a close circle of family and advisers. Despite his regular tweets, trump doesn't use email and almost never surfs the internet, but he does have one unusual access point: he answers his own cellphone, \" something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. \" read the profile here. Axios has an interview with trump, and the interviewers write that the president-elect \" seemed moved \" by his intel briefings. \" i've had a lot of briefings that are very … i don't want to say'scary, ' because i ' ll solve the problems. But … we have some big enemies out there. \" read it in full here. The wall street journal also interviewed trump, and it had real-world implications: \" the dollar tumbled to its lowest level in a month after donald trump suggested... He favored a weaker dollar, breaking with decades of tradition and intensifying investor concern over the incoming administration's capacity to surprise. \" read it here. In a wide-ranging interview with the new york times magazine, joe biden sounds worried about trump's shifting foreign policy pronouncements. \" it's like a rubik's cube trying to figure this guy out, \" he says. \" we have no freakin ' idea what he's going to do. \" read it in full here. Trump will enter office with only about half of his cabinet in place. Politico takes a look here. Trump also will enter office as the most unpopular president in at least 40 years ( see abc news ), while president obama exits with his approval ratings at an all-time high ( see cnn ). The hill looks ahead and sees five areas where trump and democrats can make progress, including a possible boost in minimum wage. The list is here. See friday's inauguration schedule here.",

But its story may not end there: scientists say they are close to resurrecting the \" supercow, \" once the largest land mammal in europe, reports cnn. In search of herbivores to maintain land areas at risk of becoming barren, geneticists began breeding aurochs descendants with similar cattle breeds in 2008 and found they could \" produce animals far closer to the aurochs than we would have expected, \" says ronald goderie of the tauros project. Fourth-generation beasts have now been introduced in croatia, spain, portugal, the czech republic, and romania, with promising results. \" we see progress not only in looks and behavior but also in de-domestication of the animals, \" says goderie, noting one herd has learned to defend itself against wolves. The hope is that they will become part of the ecosystem to maintain land for other animals. But a rep for the international union for the conservation of nature says it's unclear \" whether primarily wetland forests like the aurochs used to inhabit still exist, whether it could negatively impact wild or domestic plants or animals, and if it might endanger people. \" indeed, a british farmer had to kill some of his aurochs-descended cattle in 2015 because they tried to kill him, per the independent.

The auroch roamed the grassy plains of europe for 250,000 years until it died out in poland in 1627, and adolf hitler's followers tried to breed a similar beast as part of their aryan mythology. Now conservationists who believe the bovine ancestor was key to preserving the continent's ecosystem have said they are'rewilding'the fourth generation of their experimental auroch replacement as part of the tauros project.

        "summary": "Something to ponder about the origins of your seafood: a new report commissioned by food giant nestle finds that most seafood workers in thailand — the world's biggest exporter of shrimp — are migrants from cambodia or myanmar brought into the country illegally by traffickers and sold to boat captains, who force them to work 16-hour days, seven days a week, reports the new york times. As expected with such a schedule, they suffer chronic sleep deprivation. They also work in hazardous conditions and face physical and verbal abuse from captains, who withhold their personal documents, the report notes, per cnnmoney. \" sometimes, the net is too heavy, and workers get pulled into the water and just disappear, \" a burmese worker says in the report. \" when someone dies, he gets thrown into the water. \" the revelations don't stop there. The report also finds workers — including child workers — have an inadequate supply of water and limited access to medical care. Some toil for over a year before getting paid, while others are charged fees that leave them in debt. Nestle — which is facing a lawsuit claiming its fancy feast cat food comes from slave labor — acknowledges that seafood caught under these conditions ends up in its supply chain. But \" virtually all companies sourcing seafood in the thai seafood sector are exposed to the same risks, \" it says. The company, which encountered similar labor complaints regarding its chocolate business in 2001, has issued an action plan to cut down on abuse, which includes a way for workers to make complaints and training for boat captains, per bloomberg.",

Lawmakers are strongly against the move, which \" would ignite a political firestorm, even if it's the best resolution for the guantanamo problem, \" a law professor explains. You might recall that a previous use of executive power could soon see the president sued. But white house officials say obama is \" unwavering in his commitment \" to move gitmo's 149 inmates and close the prison's doors, something the president apparently sees as key to his legacy. What will obama do? well, he has two options, the journal points out. One: he vetoes the national defense authorization act, which includes the ban on transferring detainees to the us, after the midterm elections. Two: he signs the bill but argues the ban infringes on his powers as commander in chief. While officials won't say to which us facilities the prisoners would shift — the journal reports charleston's military brig seems likely — obama will likely lessen the blow by moving some of the 79 detainees cleared for transfer to places outside the us; estonia, for example, has already agreed to accept one prisoner, and other european countries are willing.

Students will also be required to take an english test, participate in a video interview and send their high school transcripts, reports the bbc, and they may still need to take the sat or act exam. If admitted they would pay out-of-state tuition and housing costs of more than $ 45,000 a year. A few private institutions in the us as well as dozens of universities in europe, australia, and canada already accept gaokao results on applications. The university of san francisco has an early admissions program that allows june test takers to enroll in the fall semester, based on their grades, gaokao score, and personal interview in english. Not everyone is a fan of the gaokao. Critics say the test emphasizes memorization over creativity, but university of san francisco president paul j.

        "summary": "You have one of six possible variations of the apoe gene, having inherited one variant — e2, e3, or e4 — from each parent. Reporting in the journal neuron, university of hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected — an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports healthday news. And while brain researcher rebecca knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the los angeles times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \" diet or cognitive training \" early on could change someone's \" trajectory, \" per knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14 % of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of alzheimer's, but knickmeyer points out that there are many alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop alzheimer's. ( some research suggests that memories lost to alzheimer's are actually retrievable. )",

            "The gene comes in three varieties, known as the e2, e3 and e4 variants. Since everyone inherits one version of the gene from each parent, there are six possible combinations. People with one — and especially two — e4 variants are significantly more likely to develop alzheimer's than people without e4. Researchers also have found that adults with e2 variants have more plaques in their brains but are less likely to have symptoms of dementia."

            "Variants of apolipoprotein e have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions. For example, apoe alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the apoe e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. This progressive narrowing of the arteries increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. The apoe e2 allele has been shown to greatly increase the risk of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type iii. Most people with this disorder have two copies of the apoe e2 allele, leading researchers to conclude that the e2 allele plays a critical role in the development of the condition. Hyperlipoproteinemia type iii is characterized by increased blood levels of cholesterol, certain fats called triglycerides, and molecules called beta-very low-density lipoproteins ( beta-vldls ), which carry cholesterol and lipoproteins in the bloodstream. A buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small, yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis. Apoe gene variants have also been studied as a potential risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss among older people worldwide. Some studies have suggested that having at least one copy of the apoe e4 allele may help protect against this disease or delay the onset of vision loss, while having at least one copy of the apoe e2 allele may increase the risk of this disease or cause symptoms to appear earlier. However, other studies have not found these associations. More research is needed to clarify what role, if any, apoe gene variants play in the development of age-related macular degeneration.",

The washington post reports 85 % of male smallmouth bass surveyed in the region have \" characteristics of the opposite sex \" — specifically eggs where their testes should be. The same is true of 27 % of area largemouth bass, vice adds. For a recently published study, researchers tested bass near 19 wildlife refuges in the northeast, according to a us geological survey press release. Researchers didn't do a chemical analysis of the water where the intersex fish were found, so they can't be sure specifically what is causing the sex changes. But they suspect the problem is things that get dumped down drains and into us waters. Researchers believe the likely culprits are birth control pills, pesticides, hormones in livestock manure, and other chemical-heavy products, according to the press release. Vice reports those products contain estrogen, which can produce dramatic effects even at very low levels. But this isn't just a problem in the northeast. Up to 90 % of male smallmouth bass in parts of west virginia are intersex, and increasing sex changes have been noted in nearly 40 fish species around the world going back 20 years, according to the post. Study author luke iwanowicz calls these fish \" the canary in the coal mine. \" \" we are looking at fish but, of course, there is that concern that, if this stuff is in the water, it can be affecting other wildlife, \" he tells vice.

A study published in november in restorative neurology and neuroscience said it's the first case showing \" the ' awakening ' effect of midazolam, \" a drug typically used to induce sleepiness before surgery. The man was in a coma for 40 days after his accident, then a \" vegetative state \" for four weeks. He was discharged after 10 months, but his condition worsened: two years after the accident he couldn't say a single word or respond to simple commands and was performing \" aimless repetitive behaviors \" like clapping. Doctors treated him with various meds to no avail but then gave him midazolam instead of the usual propofol ( the same drug that killed michael jackson ) before a ct scan. The man suddenly \" began to interact with the anesthetist, \" then with others, the study notes. The effect wore off after two hours, but doctors were able to replicate the results during a second midazolam dosage. The study notes that patients with catatonia ( a state of unresponsiveness they're not sure this man suffered from ) have responded to this drug before. Because midazolam can only be used in a hospital setting, doctors switched the patient over to carbamazepine ( an epilepsy drug ), which has since helped the man \" maintain the improvement of his ability to interact and communicate with people, \" a study co-author tells livescience. Interestingly, zolpidem ( often sold under the brand name ambien ) has been \" well documented in literature \" as evoking response in similar patients, but it didn't work this time, the study notes.

        "summary": "Tuesday was \" make america work again \" day at the republican national convention, though there was easily as much talk about hillary clinton as there was about the us economy. Still, the convention seemed to run far more smoothly than on monday — it was as if they \" had brought in an entirely new team of organizers, \" according to politico — and the gop was unified enough to deal with the matter of choosing its nominee. Among the winners in another eventful day at the quicken loans arena: donald trump. New york state's delegation put trump over the top, making him the official gop nominee 13 months after he launched what was seen as a long-shot bid. He \" did the unthinkable on tuesday night. And, whether you like him or hate him, he deserves a massive amount of credit for that, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Donald trump jr. He \" brought down the house \" with a speech that put him on the national stage and added a personal touch to his father's business successes, the hill reports. It briefly looked like there might be a repeat of the melania plagiarism controversy, but it quickly emerged that a francis buckley line in the speech had been put there by buckley himself, a friend of trump jr.'s who worked on the speech with him. Chris christie. The new jersey governor may still be smarting from vp rejection, but the crowd loved how he denounced clinton from the point of view of a former federal prosecutor. They chanted \" guilty! \" and \" lock her up! \" as christie made the case against clinton. Avocado growers. Discussion of jobs largely fell by the wayside, but soap opera actress kimberlin brown, who has an avocado farm in california, managed to deliver both an in-depth discussion of jobs and a passionate call to help us growers by restricting avocado imports, politico reports. Among the losers: party unity. Trump won the nomination, but some 721 delegates voted against him in the evening roll call, making it the most divided vote of its kind since the contested convention of 1976, the new york times notes. Never trump. The movement \" succumbed to multiple causes of death \" on tuesday, with many rebels deciding they had no choice but to support the nominee, the ap reports. The utah delegation announced that all its 40 votes were going to ted cruz, but they ended up going to trump because utah gop rules require ballots to be cast for active candidates only. Paul ryan.

The mccain was damaged on its port side aft, or left rear, from the accident that happened at 5: 24am, the navy's 7th fleet said, but it was heading to port under its own power. Malaysia's navy chief says two ships as well as aircraft from its navy and air force have been deployed to help look for the missing us sailors. Sen.

            "J ohn sidney mccain, sr. ( august 9, 1884 – september 6, 1945 ) was an admiral in the united states navy, notable as a commander of the fast carrier task force in world war ii. His son john s. Mccain, jr. Was also an admiral ( the only father-son pair of full admirals in us history ), and his grandson john mccain iii, also a naval officer, ( retired navy captain ), is a u.s. Senator from arizona. All three attended the united states naval academy, which his great-grandson, john s. ( jack ) mccain iv, is currently attending. Mccain was born in teoc, mississippi, and graduated from the naval academy in 1906 after attending a few years at the university of mississippi. His first assignments were on ships of the asiatic squadron. During the american occupation of veracruz in the mexican revolution he served in san diego, and remained on the ship during 1918 while she performed atlantic escort duty. In the years between the world wars, mccain served in many ships, including maryland ( bb-46 ), new mexico ( bb-40 ), and nitro ( ae-2 ). His first command was the sirius ( ak-18 ). In 1936, at the age of 51, he was designated a naval aviator, and from 1937 to 1939 he commanded the aircraft carrier ranger ( cv-4 ), contributing much to the development of carrier tactics for the war to come. For the first year of world war ii he served as commander of air forces for western sea frontier and the south pacific force. While the majority of his service in this capacity was reportedly excellent, a lapse in mccain's leadership of his forces significantly contributed to the allied defeat and heavy losses in one of the naval battles around guadalcanal. Mccain had been requested to conduct extra reconnaissance missions over \" the slot \" in the solomon islands on august 8, 1942. For reasons never explained, mccain failed to order the missions as requested, and furthermore, didn't inform the allied naval commanders at guadalcanal that they weren't carried out. As a result, allied naval forces were surprised and defeated in the battle of savo island on august 9, a defeat that jeopardized the entire guadalcanal operation for the allies. In october 1942 mccain became chief of the bureau of aeronautics and in august 1943 rose to the rank of vice admiral as deputy chief of naval operations ( air",

In fact, just two of the world's 53 living supercentenarians ( people 110 and older ) are men, reports ifl science. But why is the longevity gap so stark, and how long has it been so? an international team of researchers is investigating the lifespans of men and women born between 1800 and 1935 in 13 developed nations in search of answers, reports physorg, and they've found that women's superior longevity only emerged recently. Before 1840, death rates were very similar between men and women. But since those rates began to plummet in 1880 thanks in large part to improved diets, vaccinations, and better health care, female death rates have dropped 70 % faster than male ones, and heart disease seems to be holding men back the most, the researchers report in proceedings of the national academy of sciences. Men may be more biologically susceptible to cardiovascular health problems, and their different weight distribution could play a role here, reports live science. The researchers plan to further explore the differences between male and female biology, genetics, and lifestyles to look for answers.

Biophysicist daniel perlman at brandeis university, an inventor with more than 100 patents under his probably well-designed belt, says he's solved the age-old problem by etching a small groove into the bottle itself, per phys.org. ( you can see a demonstration via this video. ) to arrive at his solution, perlman studied slow-mo videos of wine being poured, then calculated precisely how large of an edge would be required to catch the offending drip. The answer: 2mm wide, 1mm deep. Gizmos already are on the market to stop the spills, while sommeliers might use a napkin to deftly wipe the bottle after a pour, but perlman wanted to simplify things. \" i wanted to change the wine bottle itself, \" thus avoiding the need for an accessory, he says. Bloggers sound intrigued. The drip issue is a \" pretty obvious \" flaw that has been allowed to linger for as long as wine bottles have been made, complains a post at bgr. Another at food &amp; wine notes that an industry-wide fix would likely raise manufacturing costs. \" but innovation has swept through the beverage industry before — remember when not all cans were wide-mouths? — so maybe a drip-free future is within our reach. \" ( how does neon-blue wine sound? )",

Kim jong un claimed last month that the country had an h-bomb, a weapon much more powerful and harder to make than an atomic bomb, and a confirmed test would almost certainly lead to tough new sanctions against north korea, the ap reports. North korean state media reported that the test of the \" miniaturized \" h-bomb was a \" perfect success. \" it could be weeks before an h-bomb test can be confirmed by outside experts, who seem skeptical of pyongyang's claims. \" given the scale, it is hard to believe this is a real hydrogen bomb, \" a rep from the korea defense and security forum tells reuters. \" they could have tested some middle stage kind [ of device ] between an a-bomb and h-bomb, but unless they come up with any clear evidence, it is difficult to trust their claim. \" the australian broadcasting corporation reports that the united nations security council plans to hold an emergency meeting wednesday to discuss the nuclear test.

        "summary": "It has to rank among the less usual undertakings doctors at massachusetts general hospital had attempted: in 2009 they removed a molar from a severed egyptian mummy's head via an endoscope with grasping forceps they inserted through the neck. The tooth was a hopeful clue in a nearly century-old mystery — one that still wouldn't be solved for years to come. The head ( see it here ) was discovered in 1915 in deir el-bersha, south of cairo, in a room built for a governor named djehutynakht and his wife 4,000 years ago. It had been looted by grave robbers, and the identity of the head — was it djehutynakht's or his wife's? — remained unclear. A dna test could provide the answer, but no mummy of that age had given up usable, reliable dna, and \" the ancient dna community had largely given up on the testing \" of such remains, per a report in the journal genes. The molar was their best bet, and scientists tried and failed to get it to give up its dna. Then, in 2016, the tooth made its way to the fbi's dr. Odile loreille, a forensic scientist with a long history of working with old and ancient dna; the new york times reports she has identified korean war victims, a 2-year-old who died on the titanic, and the remains of two children of russian tsar nicholas ii. She managed to retrieve a tiny bit of powder — just 0.004 ounces, per livescience — from the tooth's core, and the ratio of chromosomes it contained proved it was male dna: governor djehutynakht. The times sums up the significance: \" in doing so she had help[ ed ] establish that ancient egyptian dna could be extracted from mummies. \" ( this egyptian coffin is \" dowdy, \" but the inside is astonishing. )",

More on the 66-year-old kislyak, who nbc notes has kept a \" remarkably low profile \" in more than 40 years of service to his country: the washington post calls him \" quiet, careful, rumpled and portly, \" and says he \" shows up everywhere and tries to talk to everyone. \" he is not, however, thought to be especially close to vladimir putin. Kislyak was even in attendance on tuesday at president trump's address to congress, per the guardian. Its profile notes that he trained as an engineer and first worked as an envoy in the 1980s, under mikhail gorbachev. The ap tries to reconcile kislyak's new reputation as the \" kevin bacon of the trump white house's russia imbroglio \" with his old one as an under-the-radar diplomat who would be the last person observers would think was involved in controversy. Politico offers a look at \" washington's most dangerous diplomat, \" noting that kislyak was front and center at a trump foreign policy speech last april in which trump called for an easing of us-russia relations. And in november, kislyak accused america of carrying out a \" huge propaganda campaign against russia. \" a story at cnn takes a look at another accusation often thrown kislyak's way by us intelligence officials: that he's a russian spy who tries to recruit others. Not everyone agrees with that assessment, per abc news, which cites ex-us ambassadors and analysts who take issue with the espionage claims. \" if he's a spy, then all ambassadors are spies, \" one former us diplomat says. One thing he's exceptional at: networking, says the new york times, revealing details of \" over-the-top \" dinners he likes to throw for guests at his beaux arts mansion in washington and his ability to entertain, but \" always with a political objective, \" per a former us ambassador to russia.",

Per the miami herald, researchers from the us geological survey tested hundreds of the everglades ' already worryingly prolific giant snake species and what they found could mean an even hardier invader down the line. Where they expected to find nothing but dna from the water-loving ancestors of carelessly released pet burmese pythons, scientists discovered that at least 13 of 400 snakes tested showed signs of hybridization with a relative known as the indian rock python. Unlike the burmese, the rock python prefers to live on higher drier ground. It's also faster and smaller. Per the guardian, this tells researchers that floating somewhere in the gene pool of florida's estimated 150,000 pythons could be a mix of genes that could lead to a \" super snake \" with the ability to adapt even better to subtropical conditions in a florida ecosystem already overrun with exotic and damaging invasives. Because researchers can't tell from their 400 snakes exactly how many of the sunshine state's pythons are hybrids, they can't say for sure whether the added indian rock python traits could one day make the population more adaptable to larger swaths of florida and beyond.",

Instead of checking it as the crew suggested, she opted not to board at all. \" these are so delicate and breakable that if you check your violin, it will get broken, \" pine tells kob 4. \" there's no maybe it will get broken. It definitely will get broken. \" american ticket agents got her on another flight, violin and all, and the airline says in a statement that it \" has reached out to ms. Barton directly to apologize for the inconvenience. \" she has the violin courtesy of a lifetime loan from an anonymous patron.

She was able to free herself, but the train's wheels took her left leg and mangled her right. ( read the story of how a stolen stradivarius surfaced after 35 years. )",

This week, zou yongliao of the chinese academy of sciences announced plans to send a probe designated chang ' e 4 to the moon's far side by 2020, according to the asia times. \" china will be the first to complete the task if it is successful, \" zou said. In 2013, china became the third country to land a probe — chang ' e 3 — on the moon, following the united states and soviet union. China plans to study the geology of the far side of the moon — which is never visible from earth — in order to put a radio telescope there. The dark side of the moon would be ideal for studying radio waves because the moon itself blocks any interfering waves coming from earth. However, that also makes landing a probe on the moon's far side more difficult, according to the international business times. Without radio signals from earth, china will require additional satellite technology to communicate with the probe. In the meantime, the ap reports that china will be sending an unmanned spaceship to and from the moon to collect samples in 2017.

By the time michelle's body was found 40 feet away 20 hours later, her slippers on the dock, police had surmised that the couple had stopped by a friend's boat to \" get romantic, \" michelle's brother michael malkush says, and that william had died trying to save michelle, who couldn't swim. But many felt this didn't make sense given their fear of the water, the cold, and their home being so nearby.

More specifically, the researchers calculate that puerto rico had 4,645 \" excess deaths \" between sept. 20, 2017, and dec. 31, they write in the new england journal of medicine. How they got the figure: researchers surveyed 3,299 homes in january and february and turned up 38 deaths in the time period after the hurricane, then extrapolated the figure to the island's population of 3.4 million. They concluded with a 95 % certainty that the death toll attributable to the hurricane is between 800 and 8,500, with the figure of 4,645 a likely estimate. They also found that when comparing the number of deaths to 2016, the island's mortality rate increased 62 % in the three months following the storm. \" our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after hurricane maria, \" the authors write. The toll of 64 mostly counts people killed directly by rising water or wind, and the washington post provides an example of a death that went uncounted. Ivette leon, 54, died at home in november, less than a day after being released from the hospital. As her condition deteriorated, it took family members 20 minutes to get cell reception to summon help, and then nonworking traffic lights delayed the arrival of an ambulance. The new study suggests there are thousands more like her. \" that is an astonishing undercount, \" a columbia professor who wasn't involved with the study tells buzzfeed news. \" something has gone terribly wrong here if they have a 70-times-higher death rate. \"",

        "summary": "They're calling it \" the most cambridge thing ever \": graffiti — written in latin — scrawled across multiple million-dollar homes in the famed uk college town. The press association reports the graffiti, which reads \" locus in domos loci populum, \" appeared tuesday morning. The words were written on new luxury homes that are selling for more than $ 1.5 million each, according to the bbc. The homes replaced a pub, and locals believe the graffiti is likely a protest against skyrocketing home prices and the displacement of locals in a city where the average home price is more than 10 times the average salary. \" we've got incredibly rich people living one street away from incredibly poor people, \" one resident tells the press association. Locals say a vandal scrawling graffiti in latin is something that could \" only happen \" in cambridge. But the reaction to the graffiti may also be cambridge-specific. For example, it's not the graffiti the spectator takes issue with; it's the grammar. The blog points out the phrase \" locus in domos loci populum \" is complete \" gibberish \" and \" twaddle, \" likely the result of using google to poorly translate the phrase \" local homes for local people. \" a cambridge classics professor gives the bbc her interpretation: \" this is a bit hard to translate, but i think what they're trying to say is that a lovely place has been turned into houses. \" police are investigating, or as the romans ( by way of google ) would say: vigilum quaerimus.

Early autopsy results on george michael couldn't peg what caused his christmas day death, but on tuesday, a uk coroner announced the 53-year-old singer had died of natural causes, spurred by a fatty liver and \" dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis \" ( a clinical way of saying heart disease ), cbs news reports. Michael's partner, fadi fawaz, had put up a bunch of tweets insinuating suicide right after his boyfriend's death; fawaz later said he'd been hacked and took down the posts. A rep for michael had mentioned heart failure was the cause after the initial autopsy. Per the american heart association, dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by an enlarged heart chamber that eventually affects heart contractions and keeps blood from being efficiently pumped out; myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. A fatty liver could have any of a variety of causes, including drinking too much, a bout with hepatitis c, being overweight, or taking certain medication. \" i think his body just gave up, \" michael's former partner, kenny goss, told the sunday mirror over the weekend. Goss adds that now the family can move on with making final arrangements, saying, \" we just want closure, we want the funeral to happen. \" fawaz, meanwhile, posted a few tweets tuesday in apparent response to the news, noting, \" the truth is out... \" and \" now i hope to receive some real love. \"",

The white tiger was 17 and died \"after a short illness, \" according to a press release. Zoologists say 17 is within the lower-end parameter of a normal life expectancy for a tiger. The tiger ( his name usually spelled \"montecore \" in press reports ) was reported as seven years old the night he bit horn on the neck during a show at the mirage. Though horn suffered significant blood loss from the bite, it was a stroke and brain-swelling which followed the injury that left horn partially paralyzed, ending the entertainer's stage career. Mantecore was quarantined for 10 days following the oct. 3 injury, but was then returned to exhibit at the mirage's secret garden of siegfried &amp; roy attraction after no signs of disease or abnormal behavior were found. He spent most of his remaining years alternating between the secret garden attraction and horn's estate. Even during the early days of his recovery, horn was adamant in his wishes the tiger be spared, and has always argued with reports that he was \"attacked \" by the tiger. Siegfried &amp; roy have long contended horn suffered a stroke onstage, and that the tiger punctured his neck while dragging him backstage as a protective response.

            "Casey anthony verdict sparks campaign for 'caylee's law'this undated photo released by the orange county sheriff's office in orlando shows caylee marie anthony. ( ap ) when florida mother casey anthony was found not guilty of first-degree murder or manslaughter of her two-year-old daughter caylee tuesday, many americans who had followed the case were outraged, including a woman in oklahoma who decided to start a petition for a \"caylee's law. \" one of the sticking points of the casey anthony case was the fact that anthony never notified law enforcement that her daughter was missing, which led to her being found guilty of four counts of the misdemeanor crime of lying to investigators. Caylee was last seen on june 16, 2008, but her grandmother, cindy anthony, didn't notify the police until july 15, a month later. Oklahoman michelle crowder, who is a mother of two daughters, says parents need to report their child's disappearance immediately, and has started a change.org petition and facebook page to ask congress to create a law to enforce that. \"caylee's law \" would make it a federal offense and a felony for a parent or guardian to fail to report a child's disappearance to law enforcement. \"when i saw that casey anthony had been found not guilty in the murder of little caylee, and that she was only being convicted of lying to the police about her disappearance, i was sickened, \" crowder says. \"i could not believe she was not being charged with child neglect or endangerment, or even obstruction of justice. \" nearly 2,000 people have signed the \"caylee's law \" petition each hour since its creation, making it the fastest-growing campaign on change.org, according to the site.

The report says there is not only a 99 % chance of a 6.7 magnitude or greater quake like the 1994 northridge one hitting the state in the next 30 years, the chances of a mega-quake of 8 magnitude or greater are significantly higher than earlier thought, the ap reports. \" california is earthquake country, and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one, \" says lead author ned field, a usgs geophysicist. He says that out of the state's hundreds of faults, the \" locked and loaded \" san andreas fault is still the biggest threat. Field says the odds of a mega-quake in the next three decades have risen to 7 % from 4.7 % since the 2008 forecast because scientists now have a better understanding of the fault system and how quakes can jump from fault to fault, the los angeles times reports. In california, \" it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few [ well-separated ] faults, but with a vast interconnected fault system, \" he says. The usgs still can't predict exactly when an earthquake will hit, but it's testing an early warning system that will give authorities vital seconds to do things like shut off gas lines and slow down trains, the ap reports.

        "summary": "Between march and september of last year, four out of five visits to a major part of the dark web — the anonymous corner of the internet — were to sites exhibiting the sexual abuse of children, says a new study picked up by wired. These sites account for only 2 % of the dark web, but got five times more traffic ( or about 83 % ) than other sites, like those selling drugs, offering gambling, or providing a haven for whistleblowers. \" before we did this study, it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing. But it's … creating a place where pedophiles can act with impunity, \" says uk computer science researcher gareth owen. The websites studied are part of tor hidden services — which allows users to surf the web anonymously, bbc explains — and they occupy the biggest chunk of the dark web. Owen used relay computers and a web-crawling program to collect his data. Tor executives point out the results could be distorted, and owen acknowledges that \" caution is advised \" when assessing them. \" we do not know the cause of the high hit count ( to child abuse sites ) and cannot say with any certainty that it corresponds with humans, \" he says. It's possible the traffic could be caused by law enforcement groups conducting investigations or hackers flooding the sites with fake visits. And then there's the positive justification for an anonymous web. \" there are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access facebook or to blog anonymously, \" says tor's executive director. Still, law enforcement and politicians are expected to push for a crackdown because of the study, and owen says there may be ways to block child abuse sites.

After futile attempts to dislodge the piece, joniec rushed her daughter to an urgent-care facility, which then helped arrange for an ambulance to a children's hospital, reports the new york daily news. Fidget spinners boast nearly silent operation, but their weighted bearings, roughly the size of a quarter, must be cleaned on occasion, reports huffpost. Britton had popped one in her mouth and it ended up lodged in her esophagus; she had to have it surgically removed on monday, per the new york post, but she's now doing fine. While some claim the toys help students with attention disorders, others are skeptical or at the very least annoyed, and the daily news notes that some schools have banned them at lunch and in some classrooms.

Via reuters, the study published in climatic change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings ' capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10 % to 30 % of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at eurekalert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \" our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost, \" one of the study's lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, new york's laguardia and washington's reagan-national fared poorly because of short runways, as did dubai international airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55 % of the time during peak temperatures. Better news: new york's jfk wouldn't be much affected. Delayed departures won't be the only hassle. Scientists say severe turbulence would become more common. \"i've yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation, \" says atmospheric scientist paul williams, who believes it's high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt.

            "Rising temperatures due to global warming will make it harder for many aircraft around the world to take off in coming decades, says a new study. During the hottest parts of the day, 10 to 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to remove some fuel, cargo or passengers, or else wait for cooler hours to fly, the study concludes. The study, which is the first such global analysis, appears today in the journal climatic change. \" our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world, \" said lead author ethan coffel, a columbia university phd. Student. As air warms, it spreads out, and its density declines. In thinner air, wings generate less lift as a plane races along a runway. Thus, depending on aircraft model, runway length and other factors, at",
            "Last month, phoenix enduring a blistering heat wave, with temperatures so high that airport officials had to cancel dozens of flights. The reason was two-fold. First off, some jet engines risk catching on fire in extreme heat. And when air gets hot, it expands and becomes less dense — so an airplane's wings can't generate enough lift to get off the ground. Planes either need to speed up during take-off or use a longer runway. But phoenix's flight delays aren't a one-off event. As the earth's climate undergoes a 1 to 3 degree celsius warming over the next half-century, extreme heat waves will hit more frequently. Some of these heat waves will hit airports with short runways. Forget about rain delays or missing flight crews. At places like washington's reagan national airport, new york's laguardia airport,",

Airlines may increasingly be forced to cut their loads of passengers, cargo or fuel in order to take off safely because warming air lessens the ability of airplane wings to generate lift, according to u.s. Researchers. Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to climb some 5.5 degrees fahrenheit ( 3 celsius ) by 2100, researchers said.

During the hottest parts of the day, 10 to 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to remove some fuel, cargo or passengers, or else wait for cooler hours to fly, the study concludes. The study, which is the first such global analysis, appears today in the journal climatic change. \" our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world, \" said lead author ethan coffel, a columbia university phd. Student. As air warms, it spreads out, and its density declines. In thinner air, wings generate less lift as a plane races along a runway. Thus, depending on aircraft model, runway length and other factors, at",
            "Last month, phoenix enduring a blistering heat wave, with temperatures so high that airport officials had to cancel dozens of flights. The reason was two-fold. First off, some jet engines risk catching on fire in extreme heat. And when air gets hot, it expands and becomes less dense — so an airplane's wings can't generate enough lift to get off the ground. Planes either need to speed up during take-off or use a longer runway. But phoenix's flight delays aren't a one-off event. As the earth's climate undergoes a 1 to 3 degree celsius warming over the next half-century, extreme heat waves will hit more frequently. Some of these heat waves will hit airports with short runways. Forget about rain delays or missing flight crews. At places like washington's reagan national airport, new york's laguardia airport,",
            "New york ( thomson reuters foundation ) - more frequent heat waves and rising temperatures due to global warming may ground up to a third of airplanes worldwide during hot days in decades to come with some airports in new york and dubai likely to be hard hit, a study showed on thursday. Airlines may increasingly be forced to cut their loads of passengers, cargo or fuel in order to take off safely because warming air lessens the ability of airplane wings to generate lift, according to u.s. Researchers. Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to climb some 5.5 degrees fahrenheit ( 3 celsius ) by 2100, researchers said. But it is more prevalent heat waves that pose a larger threat to the airline industry, they said in a study published in the journal climate change. Annual maximum daily temperatures at airports could rise by 7 to 14 degrees fahrenheit ( 4 to 8 celsius ) by"

According to cbs news, 76-year-old jack mccullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and mccullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by mccullough, illinois state's attorney richard schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \" clear and convincing evidence \" that mccullough is innocent. While the judge friday vacated mccullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the chicago tribune reports. Mccullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an air force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the fbi's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and schmack says documents — including phone and air force records — supporting mccullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked mccullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at mccullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support mccullough's conviction.",
