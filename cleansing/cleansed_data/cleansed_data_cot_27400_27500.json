Young kids would be taught the proper medical terms for \"private parts \" like \" nipple, breast, penis, scrotum, and uterus, \" fox news explains. In first grade, they ' ll learn that sex can occur between two men, and by age 10 they ' ll learn that intercourse can occur vaginally, orally, or anally. Some parents were in favor of the proposal, the helena independent record reports. \"to bury our heads in the sand is to fail our children, \" said one expecting father. But two middle school-aged girls argued that abstinence education would work better, and one mother complained that planned parenthood had helped draft the document. \"why are we allowing planned parenthood to help with this, \" she demanded, \"when they stand to profit from these people who will be their future clients? \"",

            "Ben coulter independent record - liberty baptist pastor rick demato takes the podium during public testimony at front street learning center tuesday night concerning the proposed health enhancement curriculum for helena public schools. School trustees heard from 64 of the more than 300 people who attended the school board meeting tuesday night to speak about the proposed health curriculum, but made no decision about whether more public comment will be accepted at next month's meeting before taking action on the document. The helena school board meeting room couldn't accommodate all the supporters and opponents wanting to speak to trustees about the proposed k-12 health enhancement curriculum. An additional room across the hall was opened and filled to capacity, and the doors were locked to the outside. More than 100 others stood outside the front street learning center with a sound system so they could listen to the meeting. It was the most attended school board meeting in years. The proposed 62-page document covers a wide spectrum of health concerns and is the result of two years of work by a long list of people. It takes a science-based approach in covering topics such as nutrition, relationships, mental health, environmental health and disease prevention. But it is the material on human sexuality that has generated large-scale community interest. The question of how much sexual information to teach children and when has evoked strong"

        "summary": "Disputes with iran and mexico in the early days of the trump administration may have been predictable — but not many people predicted a clash with australia. The disagreement became public wednesday when the washington post reported that president trump's phone conversation with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull on saturday was an angry one, with trump slamming a deal to resettle refugees in the us as \" the worst deal ever, \" telling the australian leader that he'd spoken to other leaders that day and this was the worst \" by far. \" according to the post, trump abruptly ended the call more than 30 minutes early. Turnbull confirmed there had been a \" frank \" conversation, but denied that trump hung up on him. Trump — who allegedly accused australia of trying to send the \" next boston bombers \" to the us — tweeted about the issue wednesday evening, saying: \" do you believe it? the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia. Why? i will study this dumb deal! \" in other coverage: the deal trump is angry about was agreed upon between then-president obama and turnbull in august and involves the resettlement of 1,250 refugees currently in offshore detention centers. The majority of them are iranian, and there are also refugees from other countries named in trump's travel ban, the guardian reports. After the trump order last week, an iranian teenager at the nauru center was hospitalized after trying to hang himself. The ap reports that the disagreement shows how trump has changed the playing field even for america's closest allies and that australia has been \" stunned \" by the biggest public disagreement between us and aussie leaders since the vietnam war. Former australian foreign minister bob carr tells the sydney morning herald that the clash is actually good news for australia, since it forces aussies to drop \" romantic notions \" of the alliance. \" it liberates leaders to say no to washington if it seeks to recruit us for any reckless adventure, \" he says. \" america has taken a nationalist direction and won't be returning to global leadership as we've understood it. \" dougal robinson, a research fellow at the united states studies center at the university of sydney, tells news.com.au that the conversation shows there will be \" real change \" in the us-australia relationship, with an end to \" mate's rates. \" \" it is clear trump takes a transactional approach to his allies, including with australia, \" robinson says, noting that it's now far from clear whether the refugee deal will go ahead.",

Starting in 2018, civil rights pioneer viola desmond — aka the \" rosa parks of canada \" — will have her mug on the country's $ 10 bill, the toronto star reports. The globe and mail relays the story that made desmond famous in november 1946, when her car broke down in new glasgow, nova scotia. While she was waiting for her car to be repaired, she went to see a movie — but because she was nearsighted, she couldn't see well from the balcony seats where black patrons were made to sit. Instead, desmond took a seat in the whites-only section on the floor. She refused to move when asked and ended up being arrested and spending the night in jail. She was charged and convicted of tax evasion ( her balcony ticket cost a penny less than a floor ticket would have ) and was fined $ 26. Desmond took her case all the way up to the nova scotia supreme court, though her appeal was eventually dismissed. Desmond, who died in 1965 at the age of 50, was officially pardoned in 2010 by the region's black female lieutenant governor. \" it's a big day to have a woman on a banknote, \" desmond's sister said during the thursday announcement ceremony about the currency change, per the star. \" it's [ a ] really big day to have my big sister on a bank note. She would be so very proud. \" ( some canadians started slicing their banknotes in half. )",

Prosecutors allege he waited until they were asleep, entered their bedroom and used pepper spray as a distraction, then stabbed his father in the neck and stomach. When his mother woke up, they allege he stabbed her too. He then allegedly wrapped their bodies in a tarp and a tent, put them in his father's suv, and dumped them from a bridge about 40 miles from his parents ' home; he was unfamiliar with that area and couldn't give police an exact location. One of his friends is charged with obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicidal death; investigators say they have no evidence he was involved but that they believe he knew ramirez killed them.

            "Great white sharks have gotten a bad rap thanks to all the \" jaws \" movies and irrational human fears. They just want to go about their lives like any other animal, snacking on other critters and catching a few zzzs now and then. While we have plenty of video of great whites dramatically eating things, we haven't had any footage of the big sharks sleeping... Until discovery channel filmed one mid-nap. The discovery team used a robotic submersible to capture what the channel calls \" the first-ever footage of a great white shark napping. \" the clip comes from the shark week show \" jaws of the deep. \" the shark is a female hanging out in shallow water near guadalupe island in the pacific ocean. It's nighttime. The shark hugs the shoreline close to the ocean floor and her jaw sits open. The narrator notes that \" she appears to be in an almost catatonic state. \" nap time for sharks isn't as still as it is for humans. The great white must keep swimming; she just does it in a slow, relaxed state while facing into the current. It's just a very different way of \" sleeping with the fishes. \""

Fragoso started his binge friday along with two friends — as well as guinness record keepers and a doctor in case of emergency, according to wpix. Their playlist included adventure time, game of thrones, curb your enthusiasm, bob's burgers, and battlestar galactica. The rules were simple: no breaking eye contact with the screen, no prolonged conversation, and a five-minute break every hour. One of fragoso's accomplices dropped out quickly; another — molly ennis — was disqualified in hour 60. Fragoso was napping during one of his breaks when his phone went off. Ennis looked at the phone to push it toward him, breaking the first rule of official binge watching. By the time fragoso set the record tuesday at hour 94, he was suffering from acute hallucinations, involuntary \" micro-naps, \" and a raised heart rate. \" i would not recommend it, \" he tells wpix. In addition to cementing his place as a world-champion tv watcher, fragoso won $ 2,000. He broke the record of 92 hours set by four austrians just last month.

Instead, he launched his unscripted \" invisible obama \" shtick — \" a little improv, \" in the words of romney strategist stuart stevens. He also went on for more than 10 minutes, double his allotted time. It turns out that romney himself privately invited eastwood to speak, says the times, after the actor did a nice job endorsing romney at fundraiser in idaho. On thursday, eastwood cleared some main talking points with romney aides a few hours ahead of time but didn't go into detail about the speech, which he delivered without a teleprompter. On the record, the campaign is saying appreciative, if restrained, things about the appearance. But off the record, the times says a \" blame game \" is under way among top advisers.",

        "summary": "For years, the obama administration held secret back-channel talks with members of the syrian regime in the hope of unseating bashar al-assad, us and arab officials tell the wall street journal. The communication came in bursts — sometimes with senior syrian officials, other times through intermediaries including russia and iran. In 2011, officials identified officers who could possibly lead a military coup, they say. \" the white house's policy in 2011 was to get to the point of a transition in syria by finding cracks in the regime and offering incentives for people to abandon assad, \" a former official says. But, as the journal puts it, \" regime cohesiveness held, and the crackdown continued \"; by summer 2012, that regime-change effort was acknowledged as a failure. And how. The journal's take: \" instead of persuading mr. Assad to exit, the covert communications may have fed his sense of legitimacy and impunity. \" at bloombergview, josh rogin sees a shift in the us stance on assad. As the journal points out, the us line has consistently been that assad must step down. \" the obama administration has been slowly altering \" that, writes rogin. Indeed, last week the us put its support behind a un security council resolution \" that would establish an 18-month transition process during which assad could stay as syria's president and even run for elections sometime in 2017. \" read rogin's full column here.",

        "summary": "The attorney general in washington state appears to be breaking new ground on a modern malady: he's going after what he says is a bogus kickstarter campaign that collected money and delivered nothing, reports the seattle times. Bob ferguson has lodged a consumer-fraud lawsuit against the tennessee company altius management, which asked people to pony up for a deck of horror-themed playing cards. The campaign pulled in $ 25,000 from more than 800 people — 31 of them from washington state — but altius owner edward polchlopek hasn't fulfilled any of his promises after more than two years. \"consumers need to be aware that crowdfunding is not without risk, \" says ferguson. \"this lawsuit sends a clear message to people seeking the public's money: washington state will not tolerate crowdfunding theft. \" the better business bureau has launched an investigation of its own, and people in other states have begun filing complaints with their own attorneys general, reports ktuu. Kickstarter bears no financial responsibility for such financial flops, though a spokesperson says, \" we hope this process brings resolution and clarity to the backers of this project. \"",

The slide in american scotch sales comes amid surging sales of american whiskeys, with bourbon and tennessee whiskey sales up more than 7 % last year, reports the wall street journal. The popularity of american whiskeys — especially jack daniel's — is also hurting scotch sales around the world, the journal reports, but although sales of cheaper scotches like johnnie walker red label are down, the pricier single malts are still selling pretty well.

His actions have often remained inscrutable, obscured by awkward secrecy rules, polarized political commentary and the president's own deep reserve. In interviews with the new york times, three dozen of his current and former advisers described mr. Obama's evolution since taking on the role, without precedent in presidential history, of personally overseeing the shadow war with al qaeda. They describe a paradoxical leader who shunned the legislative deal-making required to close the detention facility at guantánamo bay in cuba, but approves lethal action without hand-wringing. While he was adamant about narrowing the fight and improving relations with the muslim world, he has followed the metastasizing enemy into new and dangerous lands. When he applies his lawyering skills to counterterrorism, it is usually to enable, not constrain, his ferocious campaign against al qaeda — even when it comes to killing an american cleric in yemen,"

            "Phoenix — lawyers for death-row inmates said recent changes to arizona's procedures for carrying out the death penalty didn't do enough to confront abuses in the state's power to decide the methods and amounts of drugs used in executions. The state released the revisions to the procedures earlier this month as it battles an inmate lawsuit that challenges the way the state handles the death penalty. Executions in arizona remain on hold until the lawsuit is resolved. Attorneys for the condemned inmates said in court papers filed friday that the state's corrections director, under the revisions, still has complete freedom to deviate from the written procedures. They say the revisions let the corrections director change timeframes for disclosing the types and amounts of drugs when he determines that there's an unexpected contingency. The lawyers for inmates said this particular revision is meaningless as an accountability check because it depends on the corrections director's subjective conclusion. The state says the revisions take away the power of the corrections director to deviate from key aspects of the execution process, such as doses of drugs, but they do let him depart from the procedures in a limited way when addressing unforeseen contingencies. The lawyers for the inmates said the revisions wouldn't have done anything to prevent the problems experienced during the july 2014 execution of joseph wood,"

        "summary": "The human chin is something of a mystery to scientists. How, exactly, did we end up with a seemingly useless structure at the bottom of our face? one theory, as smithsonian reported in 2012, is that they offer some support as we chew. Small amounts of stress can break down bone, allowing it to grow back tougher, which many thought could explain why our chins are much less pronounced as children than as adults. But new research out of the university of iowa rejects that idea. Researchers followed a group of almost 40 subjects as they grew from age three to adulthood. Turns out those whose jaws endured the most wear and tear actually had the smallest chins, io9 reports. So if it's not stress on the jaw, how do we explain our chins? the researchers suggest that it could actually be the result of our faces getting smaller as we evolved. Neanderthals didn't have chins — but they did have bigger heads than we do. While our heads shrunk over time, as male testosterone levels decreased, the chin may have remained as a sort of facial leftover. Other researchers have also pointed to sex hormones in explaining our chins, smithsonian notes: women may be attracted to guys with larger chins because it signals good genes, whereas smaller chins may be linked to higher estrogen, perhaps making them an attractive feature in women. No definitive answers yet, but it's something to chew on. ( meanwhile, an injection could be available soon to fix a different kind of chin. )",

Oprah winfrey weight watchers winfrey, who is a weight watchers shareholder, said that the program is less of a diet, and more of a life change. \"weight watchers is easier than any other program i've ever been on, \" she said in a press release shared with people. \"it's a lifestyle, a way of eating and a way of living that's so freeing. You never feel like you are on a diet and it works. \" \"i would say to anyone who's thinking of joining weight watchers: take the leap.

            "Weight watchers international inc.'s stock got another boost from the falling weight of oprah winfrey, the company's backer and most famous customer. The shares climbed as much as 19 percent after winfrey announced that she'd lost 40 pounds using the program. The diet company, whose shares had fallen 54 percent this year before thursday's surge, is unveiling new tv ads featuring winfrey that tout her weight loss. The media magnate and talk-show veteran became a centerpiece of weight watcher's comeback plan last year when she bought a stake in the company and joined the board. In october 2015, when weight watchers first announced its deal with winfrey, the shares more than doubled in a single day. Though the previous rally has faded, winfrey's subsequent endorsements of weight watchers have given the stock temporary jolts. The shares gained 27 percent over two days last december when oprah tweeted a video about using the weight-loss program, and there was a 20 percent bump in january after winfrey said she had lost 26 pounds while still eating bread every day. The latest marketing push begins next week, just before the new year's holiday.

With demand for fighters high, and the us recently departed, the group now known as the islamic state of iraq and syria filled its ranks with a series of prison breaks, beginning in july 2012 and culminating in a massive raid on abu ghraib a year later. They called the strategy \" operation breaking the walls. \" one inmate freed in the abu ghraib raid explained that like many he'd been radicalized in prison, and was freed by a corrupt guard. Once freed, isis gave him a choice: stay and fight in iraq, or go to syria. Many leaders chose the latter. \" they felt they would be freer \" there, he says. The prison break story has fueled the rebel conspiracy theory that isis is a pawn of bashar al-assad's regime, and that iraq's assad-friendly government helped free its fighters. There's no evidence supporting this, and many freed isis fighters are fighting iraq's government, too. But mcclatchy has an in-depth piece on moderate rebels ' animosity toward isis that notes some circumstantial evidence: assad's forces have largely left isis alone, it notes, and isis has mostly abducted and tortured assad opponents. \" it was like syrian intelligence, \" says one rebel chief who fell into the group's hands.",

Though on a \" definite course, \" per kotv, authorities hope $ 60,000 in combined rewards will encourage more tips.

Their 16-year-old daughter, ashley, was having a birthday sleepover with lauria bible, also 16, in the home. No evidence of the girls has been found since, including in a kansas mineshaft where a man once claimed he'd placed their bodies. Citing an unpaid debt, jeremy jones said he killed the freemans before driving the girls to kansas and shooting them, per inside edition. However, jones never faced charges in the case and later recanted his confession. He's currently on death row in alabama for a woman's rape and murder.

The twin peaks restaurant, part of a nationwide chain, will not be reopening again, the waco tribune-herald reports.

On monday, noor was identified as the officer who fatally shot justine damond two nights earlier after damond called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The star-tribune has more on the 31-year-old noor, who is one of only nine somali officers in minneapolis. For noor \" being a police officer is a calling, \" his lawyer says. Here's what else you need to know about saturday's fatal shooting: as previously reported, noor has three complaints on his file since joining the minneapolis police department. Eight days before her death, damond gave a lecture about her struggles with depression and addiction and the 2006 out-of-body experience that led her to new age spirituality, news.com.au reports. Video of that lecture is available on youtube. Huffpost lists what we know and don't know about the shooting, including the two big questions: what happened between damond's 911 call and her death, and did the responding officers ever look into the sexual assault she believed she heard taking place? a medical examiner has ruled the death of damond, who was unarmed and in her pajamas when she was shot, to be a homicide, aap reports. It's unclear why officers ' body cameras weren't turned on during the first fatal shooting since police started wearing them last year, according to mpr news. Officers are required to turn the cameras on before any use of force. Damond's father, john ruszcyzk, says his daughter was \" so special \" and a \" beacon to all. \" \"we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death, \" nbc news quotes him as saying. The washington post reports minneapolis'somali community is worried about a backlash following the identification of noor as the shooter. \" they fear this will be just another event used to create animosity toward the somali community, \" says the executive director of the confederation of somali community in minnesota.",

        "summary": "Kickstarter says it's sorry it allowed a project for what critics are calling a \" how-to guide on sexual assault, \" but that it's now too late to deny the book its funds. The controversy began when a popular regular on reddit's pickup artist sub-forum \" seddit \" decided to use the crowd-funding site to self-publish his book above the game: a guide to getting awesome with women. If you're not offended by pickup artistry in general, the project looked innocuous enough — or it did, until various people spotted an eyebrow-raising post ken hoinsky had made about sexual aggression. Some choice quotes ( others are more graphic ): \" never, ever, ever, wait for a sign before you escalate! you will miss out on the vast majority of chances if you sit around waiting for signs. … from now on you must assume that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished. \" \" physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances. \" \" all that matters is that you continue to try to escalate physically until she makes it genuinely clear that it's not happening. \" hoinsky says the post is being taken out of context — it assumes you've already gone on dates with the woman. \" if'don't wait for signs, make the first move ' promotes sexual assault, then ' kiss the girl ' from the little mermaid was a song about rape, \" he argues. But that didn't quell the uproar; a petition to take down the post garnered almost 58,000 signatures. Kickstarter didn't do that, and in a blog post today it admits it should have. The page is now gone, but kickstarter says it can't do anything about the money the project got from donors while it was up. The site will donate $ 25,000 to the anti-sexual assault group rainn in penance, and is banning all \" seduction guides \" from now on.",

Mr martin said the perpetrators deliberately targeted the imprint, which had been left uncovered for public enjoyment. \" they would need to know exactly where it is to find it, many people quite easily walk right past it, \" he said.

            "Vandals use hammer to damage 115-million-year-old dinosaur footprint near inverloch updated to the untrained eye it does not look like much. But in the coastal rocks near inverloch, south-east of melbourne, a meat-eating dinosaur left its mark 115 million years ago. The footprint, frozen in time in the bunurong marine park at flat rocks, is recognised as a site of international significance. But last month, park rangers discovered vandals had taken a hammer to the footprint at the dinosaur dreaming site, one of the few polar, or ice-age, dinosaur sites in the world. \" we took a school group out there and we noticed the deliberate damage, \" parks victoria ranger brian martin said. \" the rock there is reasonably hard so it looks like it's been hit with a hammer and pieces of the rock around the edge of the footprint have been broken away, \" mr martin said. When the dinosaur footprint was first discovered in 2006, palaeontologists from museum victoria and monash university decided it should be left where it is so visitors could see it in its natural state. They made a silicon rubber mould of the print. \" it is so disappointing. The footprint has been there for hundreds of thousands of years and it's a popular, significant site, \" mr martin said. \" for someone to damage"

Security in the city is very tight, scores of police and paramilitary troops are patrolling tiananmen square, and foreign reporters have been ordered not to meet with dissidents, the ap reports. Some relatives of those killed have been allowed to visit the graves of their loved ones under heavy police escort. Ahead of the anniversary, scores of activists were rounded up and google was blocked. In hong kong, meanwhile, where 150,000 people are expected to attend the annual rally marking the crackdown, linkedin users were startled to find that the social network had blocked all mention of the massacre, even though china's censorship requirements don't apply to the territory, the daily beast reports. The hong kong censorship appears to be a mistake, although linkedin admits that it has blocked tiananmen content in mainland china, calling the censorship part of doing business in the country. \" in order to create value for our members in china and around the world, we will need to implement the chinese government's restrictions on content, when and to the extent required, \" a spokesman says. In china, internet restrictions are so tight this week that search terms including \" special day, \" \" tank, \" \" suppress, \" \" mourn, \" and \" square \" have been blocked, business insider finds.",

As the houston chronicle reports, leslie amanda hippensteel, 31, and john ousley, 32, met saul eisenberg, 28, and his then-fiancée, 24, at a church in katy; ousley and eisenberg's fiancée ended up having an affair. They made sex videos, which were ultimately found by hippensteel. She allegedly blackmailed ousley with them and emailed them to eisenberg, who in turn allegedly forwarded them to his mother and stepfather. A big mess ensued: hippensteel and ousley divorced in march; eisenberg and his former fiancée are in the midst of custody proceedings over their 6-year-old child; and both hippensteel and eisenberg face misdemeanor charges of unlawful disclosure of intimate visual material. Hippensteel was arrested earlier this month for allegedly blackmailing her ex-husband with the sex videos during their divorce proceedings, threatening to send them to the christian high school where he worked if he didn't give her money. Ousley showed police records appearing to prove he gave hippensteel $ 7,812.21. She then allegedly sent the videos to eisenberg, who says he received them on feb. 2, and also allegedly sent them to ousley's employer. Ousley resigned after administrators confronted him about the videos. The videos also somehow ended up on pornhub.com. On thursday, a judge barred eisenberg from contacting ousley or his former fiancée. The dallas morning news, which notes that hippensteel is an actress, reports both she and eisenberg face up to a year in jail. ( read how a criminal found america's first big sex tape. )",

Bishop patrick j. Mcgrath, 73, acknowledged in an interview with the mercury news that he \" could understand \" how the purchase might not sit well with some parishioners. The nearly 3,300-square-foot home's listing boasts of a \" grand-sized chef's kitchen, \" \" soaring ceilings, \" and a \" spa-like marble bathroom \" in a \" tuscan estate. \" it was purchased with funds set aside for paying the costs of a bishop's housing and upkeep after retirement, said a rep for the diocese. Mcgrath said the diocese also got the proceeds from selling a condominium where his predecessor, retired bishop pierre dumaine, lived before moving into assisted living, reports the ap. \" the fund... Can be used for nothing else, \" mcgrath said. \" when i ' m not around anymore, the house can be sold. It's a good investment in that sense. It probably makes more money this way than if it were in the bank. \" still, the purchase appears at odds with mcgrath's previously expressed concerns about housing inequality in northern california.

Medicare will even pay for unlimited years of pricey dialysis necessary to keep people with kidney disease alive as they await a life-saving transplant. But for those fortunate enough to find a compatible donor, the specter of how to pay for anti-rejection drugs after the medicare cut-off can be overwhelming.

Doctors say many in creasey's position begin cutting back on their pills to conserve them, which can cause kidney failure again and force them back into dialysis, which costs medicare $ 90,000 a year. Compare that to anti-rejection drugs, with an annual price tag of $ 15,000, and the advantages of drug coverage are clear. Although lawmakers are concerned about the $ 30 billion annual cost of kidney disease, so far the few interested in reform have been unsuccessful in getting congress to act. \" the medicare [ savings ] in maintaining this drug coverage is better than putting people on dialysis, \" surgeon matthew cooper tells npr. \" to me this is a no-brainer. \"",

            "End-stage renal disease ( esrd ) is a medical condition in which a person's kidneys cease functioning on a permanent basis leading to the need for a regular course of long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life. Beneficiaries may become entitled to medicare based on esrd. Benefits on the basis of esrd are for all covered services, not only those related to the kidney failure condition. Medicare is the secondary payer to group health plans ( ghps ) for individuals entitled to medicare based on esrd for a coordination period of 30 months regardless of the number of employees and whether the coverage is based on current employment status. Medicare is secondary to ghp coverage provided through the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act ( cobra ), or a retirement plan. Medicare is secondary during the coordination period even if the employer policy or plan contains a provision stating that its benefits are secondary to medicare. The ghp may not differentiate in the benefits it provides to individuals who have esrd. Specifically, ghps are prohibited from terminating coverage, imposing benefit limitations, or charging higher premiums on the basis of the existence of the individual's esrd. When the beneficiary first enrolls in medicare based on esrd, medicare coverage usually starts: 1. On the fourth month of dialysis when the beneficiary participates in dialysis treatment in a dialysis facility. 2. Medicare",

Lottolotto creator brett jacobson tells cnn that he filed public-records requests around the country and found that just over $ 2 billion in lottery winnings went uncollected last year — which works out to more than $ 38 million a week, or enough to create five new millionaires every day. The app records the numbers when a user takes a photo of a lottery ticket, lets them know which old ones are winners, and alerts them when a ticket wins. Some huge prizes go unclaimed — somebody missed out on a $ 16.6 million powerball jackpot in florida last year, according to the tampa tribune — but most of the unclaimed winnings are amounts as low as $ 2 or $ 4, says jacobson. He says the app has had plenty of support from retailers, and with more lottery tickets sold every year, the amount of unclaimed cash is likely to keep growing. \" the retailers and even the state lotteries want people to cash in secondary prizes, \" he says. \" you're not going to take $ 4 and go home.

According to mass live, prosecutors say carter spoke to roy on the phone while he was in the kmart parking lot and told him to get back in his truck when he got scared, as evidenced by this text allegedly sent from carter to a friend after roy's death: \" his death is my fault like honestly i could have stopped him i was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared and i [ expletive ] told him to get back in. \" the ap notes that some legal experts question the manslaughter charge against carter as massachusetts has no law against assisted suicide.",

        "summary": "Greta lindecrantz was sent to jail due to her religious convictions, and now, after two weeks behind bars, those religious convictions, as well as a \" dramatic change in circumstance, \" will apparently set her free. Lindecrantz, a criminal defense investigator, was held in contempt of court feb. 26 for refusing to testify for the prosecution in a colorado death penalty case. As a mennonite, lindecrantz opposes all violence and feared testifying might help send robert ray, whose defense team she worked on, to his death. Now, however, the 67-year-old has had a change of heart and will testify, her lawyer says in a statement, per the denver post. But it's not because the prosecution swayed her — it's because lindecrantz got wind that ray's defense team thinks her not testifying will hurt his appeal. \" ms. Lindecrantz must take them at their word and reevaluate her position, \" reads the statement, which the ap notes was filed on saturday. \" based on this dramatic change in circumstance, she has concluded that her religious principles honoring human life now compel that she must testify. \" ray, convicted in 2009 of killing two people and sentenced to death, now has a new defense team, and its appeal case is partly resting on the claim that his original legal team ( which included lindecrantz ) was incompetent. Prosecutors had hoped to nullify that claim by showing how competent lindecrantz is through her testimony. But possibly putting ray's life on the line by not testifying \" changes everything, \" her lawyer's statement reads. On friday, lindecrantz's emergency motion to be released had been denied, per nbc news. It's unclear when she could now be set free to testify.",

The wards complained to the neighborhood homeowners association that the structure detracted from their \" tranquil quality of life \" and produced \" noise issues as well as visibility issues for them and their pets, \" per hoa minutes obtained by cbs. The city also fielded a complaint regarding the location of the structure in relation to the property line; the family removed part of the playhouse roof to appease the city, and the hoa signed off on the structure. That's when, according to the counts, the wards began blasting the music when her four kids, ages 2 to 10, played outside. \" i don't feel comfortable in my own backyard, \" she tells cbs. Counts says the wards wouldn't have a conversation about the issue, so she and her husband filed a civil suit in october, fox 4 reports. The music stopped — and then the wards in december sued the countses, \" alleging loud and obnoxious noise, \" per the morning news, and claiming they and their property have been damaged; they want the structure taken down. The parties will be in court this month and next. ( this woman, bothered by noisy neighborhood kids, allegedly made a darker move. )",

In those tests, the device didn't completely prevent migraines or reduce their intensity, but those who used the headband suffered fewer headaches per month than those who used a placebo. The battery-powered device delivers an impulse that stimulates the trigeminal nerve, which has been linked to migraines, explains the la times. The cefaly headband will be available by prescription only, and the fda cautions that it should be used only once a day for no more than 20 minutes.

The image of the honduran girl, seen crying on the cover in front of a digitally added president trump, was originally taken by getty photographer john moore. He captured the photo as the girl and her mother, sandra sanchez, were being detained in mcallen, texas, where sanchez has applied for asylum, per reuters. The photo soon came to be seen as a powerful representation of the border separations — it was even the inspiration for a fundraiser that brought in more than $ 18 million — but there's a bump: denis valera, the girl's father in honduras, says she was never separated from her mother. Plus, a border agent tells cbs news that the search of sanchez took about two minutes, that he personally asked sanchez how she and her daughter were doing, and that the girl stopped crying when her mom picked her back up. White house press chief sarah huckabee sanders was one of the first to address the news, tweeting friday: \" it's shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. \" in a washington post interview earlier this week, moore never says the mother and daughter were definitely separated, but he does say that, after he watched the child and mother climb into the border patrol van and be driven away, he thought: \" i fear they were split up. \" the time piece on what moore witnessed has since added a correction that notes the original article \" misstated \" what had happened and that the toddler \" was not carried away screaming by us border patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together. \" the girl and her mother are being held together at a facility in texas while her asylum request is processed, per cbs.",

One of the women who spoke to cnn, however, says she told her mentor at abc when halperin forcibly kissed her, grabbed her breasts, and pressed his penis against her in his office. The mentor told her he wanted to notify management, the woman says, though it isn't clear if he ever did.

So laurie rimon learned when she spotted a gold coin while hiking in the galilee area of northern israel last week, npr reports. Amazingly, the coin was minted by roman emperor trajan in ad107 and may shed light on rome's military presence there at the time. \" it's extremely exciting, \" says israeli antiquities expert donald ariel. \" [ trajan's ] gold coins are extremely rare. \" this one was from a series made by trajan honoring previous emperors: it shows augustus and calls him \" divus augustus \" ( meaning \" augustus the divine \" ) because he was considered divine after he died, says ariel, per cnn. The coin's flipside shows trajan's name next to symbols of roman legions, another expert tells the jewish press. Only one other trajan-minted coin of augustus is known to exist, at the british museum. So what does this one tell us? it may have been part of a soldier's pay to help quell the bar kochva revolt of jews against the roman empire near galilee, says ariel. But the payment was hard to spend, because one gold coin equaled a month's salary ( of 75 silver coins ) and couldn't easily be used in town markets. As for rimon, she admits it was \" not easy \" to give up the find. \" it's not every day one discovers such an amazing object, \" she says. The israel antiquities authority plans to give her a certificate of appreciation and hopes the coin will soon be shown publicly, the jerusalem post reports.

But the los angeles times points out that north korea has tried for similar launches three times already — and western experts say all three attempts failed. North korea first claimed a successful launch in 1998, but experts say no evidence of a satellite was actually found. The second attempt, in 2006, \" was more or less a catastrophe, \" says one analyst; the rocket failed 40 seconds after lifting off. The last attempt, in 2009, is believed to have been an improvement but still to have failed in the final stage and fallen into the ocean. When this fourth attempt occurs, the ap offers things to watch, including: will it actually get into orbit? the three stages take about 10 minutes; if all goes well, the satellite will be in orbit at that point. Will it stay on course? experts believe the probe will need to achieve some difficult navigation very quickly after liftoff in order to get into its proper orbit. If it veers toward japan or south korea, the two nations have promised to shoot it down. Will we detect any broadcasts? the satellite is supposed to be broadcasting music in celebration of north korea's founder. If the launch is successful, western australia could pick up the broadcasts within 20 minutes.",

Experts say it is probably a mix of both, since the technologies are nearly identical. Here are some things to watch for once the countdown begins. Getting into orbit the \" unha-3 \" rocket has three stages, or parts. If all goes well, the first will burn out and fall in waters off the west coast of south korea in about 2 minutes. The second will separate 4 to 6 minutes after the launch, then splash down in the pacific off the northern philippines. The third will burn up in the atmosphere after boosting the satellite into orbit.",
            "This isn't the first time that north korea has announced it is launching a satellite into space, alarming world leaders who believe the isolated regime is actually testing its ballistic missile technology. But it would be a first if it actually works. North korea has attempted similar launches three times before. Western experts say none has succeeded. Three years ago, the last rocket launch is believed to have failed in its third and final stage, which is supposed to propel the satellite into orbit, said david wright of the union of concerned scientists. Instead it landed in the pacific ocean. North korea nonetheless announced that the launch had been a success. The video above includes footage released by north korea of the last launch, including a satellite photo of it streaking over the korean peninsula. That last failed launch was still seen as a marked improvement over what happened three years"

            "The five-day window for north korea's rocket launch opened thursday, meaning liftoff could come any morning between now and monday, weather and technology permitting. The u.s. And others have condemned the launch as a test of missile technology. North korea claims it is merely seeking to put a satellite in orbit. Experts say it is probably a mix of both, since the technologies are nearly identical. Here are some things to watch for once the countdown begins. Getting into orbit the \" unha-3 \" rocket has three stages, or parts. If all goes well, the first will burn out and fall in waters off the west coast of south korea in about 2 minutes. The second will separate 4 to 6 minutes after the launch, then splash down in the pacific off the northern philippines. The third will burn up in the atmosphere after boosting the satellite into orbit.",
            "This isn't the first time that north korea has announced it is launching a satellite into space, alarming world leaders who believe the isolated regime is actually testing its ballistic missile technology. But it would be a first if it actually works. North korea has attempted similar launches three times before. Western experts say none has succeeded. Three years ago, the last rocket launch is believed to have failed in its third and final stage, which is supposed to propel the satellite into orbit, said david wright of the union of concerned scientists. Instead it landed in the pacific ocean. North korea nonetheless announced that the launch had been a success. The video above includes footage released by north korea of the last launch, including a satellite photo of it streaking over the korean peninsula. That last failed launch was still seen as a marked improvement over what happened three years",
            "North korea's first chance at a rocket launch came and went thursday with no word of a liftoff, but also with no sign that pyongyang intends to call off what the u.s. And its allies consider an attempt to test long-range missile technology.

        "summary": "For a man more accustomed to choosing reality-tv show contestants, donald trump seems to have done a superb job of picking conservative-pleasing potential supreme court nominees. The candidate released a list of 11 possible antonin scalia replacements on wednesday, and it's been praised by leading conservatives and denounced by liberals, suggesting trump made good on his promise to let the conservative heritage foundation do most of the choosing for him. A roundup of coverage: the list of nominees, most of whom clerked for scalia or other conservative scotus justices, is \" pretty much everything a conservative activist could hope for, \" writes scott lemieux at the guardian. He notes that all the nominees are white and only three of them are women, but since all the current justices went to either harvard or yale, trump deserves credit for including graduates of the university of chicago, marquette, the university of minnesota, duke, washington university, tulane, and the university of michigan. Nan aron, chief of the liberal alliance for justice, says trump has released a \" dangerous \" list. It \" includes some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today, \" she tells the new york times. \" their opinions demonstrate open hostility to americans ' rights and liberties, including reproductive justice and environmental, consumer, and worker protections. They have ruled consistently in favor of the powerful over everyone else. They would move the needle even further to the right on the supreme court. \" at the staunchly anti-trump conservative site redstate, leon wolf argues that the candidate has released the list to \" allay conservative fears, \" but anybody who believes trump is likely to actually nominate any of them may have just fallen off the turnip truck. \" trump has lied or flip-flopped about literally everything during the course of this primary, \" he writes. Michigan supreme court justice joan larsen tells the ap that her inclusion on the list came as a \" complete surprise. \" she says she's honored to be included and would definitely be interested in serving, though she won't discuss her opinion of trump. Another candidate, don willett of the texas supreme court, has made numerous tweets mocking trump, reports reuters. In one, he jokes about \" darth trump \" building the death star. Another is a haiku about trump choosing supreme court nominees. \" who would the donald name to #scotus? the mind reels. *weeps — can't finish tweet* \" he writes.",

        "summary": "\" rent is too high even if you could find a place. So be adventurous and think about it. \" so writes robert allen in an ad posted to craigslist last week. The san francisco chronicle reports allen is hoping young tech workers fed up with ballooning rents in the bay area will instead consider living out of his fleet of five customized vans. The 68-year-old retiree has been making rental vans since 2012, mostly focusing on customers taking road trips, according to his website. Now he's focusing on a new market. \" eat google food, use their gym, and sleep in the van, \" reads allen's craigslist ad. His idea is that tech workers can park in the company lot and sleep in the van while using their company's showers, cafeteria, and other amenities. While it's unclear if google is cool with that idea, allen says he's heard workers are already sleeping in their cars there. And his vans are likely a whole lot more comfortable. The customized vehicles feature a two-person bed; kitchenette with a stove, cooler, and table; folding chairs; slide-out storage; and more. They cost between $ 30 and $ 45 per day ( more if you want to drive them yourself ), and allen will even deliver them to the parking spot of your choosing. And if tech workers decide the van life is for them, they can purchase their own from allen for $ 25,000. Not bad for a one-bedroom in san francisco.",
