Man guilty of making off with $ 165k of gold in his butt: leston lawrence set off the metal detectors at his employer, the royal canadian mint, nearly 30 times in three months, but other workers could never find evidence of anything on him. Wednesday, however, he was found guilty of smuggling out 22 gold pucks worth $ 165,000, and the ottawa judge noted \" his locker contained vaseline and latex gloves, which could have been used to insert a puck into his rectum. \" single mom faces jail for selling food on facebook: when california single mother of six mariza ruelas joined the facebook group 209 food spot a few years ago, she and other members would exchange recipes, meet for potlucks, and sometimes swap or sell their dishes among members. So ruelas said yes when a member of the group asked to buy her signature ceviche dish last december. What she didn't know was it was an undercover investigator from san joaquin county. Cops find baby koala in woman's backpack: a woman was arrested \" on outstanding matters \" during a traffic stop in brisbane on sunday with a rather cute companion. Asked if she had anything to declare, the 50-year-old woman handed officers a canvas backpack, claiming a baby koala was inside. \" not quite believing their ears, the officers cautiously unzipped the bag and found this gorgeous boy, \" police say. There's a problem with that. Earnhardt jr. Speeds in the wrong place: some people just can't leave work at the office. Take dale earnhardt jr., for instance, who was pulled over for speeding sunday. His girlfriend, amy reimann, was in the car with him and tweeted a picture of a sheepish-looking earnhardt, along with the caption \" my little speed racer. \" where he was headed was somewhat ironic. Alleged burglars'downfall: the getaway driver: two alleged burglars essentially directed police to their apartment in new jersey when they failed to pay their taxi driver, authorities say. Kenneth burke, 46, and timothy foote, 38, took a taxi to a home in deal on friday, went inside, then allegedly emerged with a tv and liquor bottles. Then they told the taxi driver to drive on.

        "summary": "An examination of ancient remains from a cave in spain turned into an episode of csi: middle pleistocene when scientists found evidence of what they say is the first known murder. The skull found in the \" pit of bones \" site belongs to a young adult who lived around 430,000 years ago and bears what researchers say are unmistakable signs of deadly violence, reports forbes, which notes that the scientists have assembled enough evidence to convince a modern jury that the early human was likely killed by a right-handed attacker who hit the victim in the head twice with some kind of object — and it wouldn't take a prehistoric columbo to deduce that the murder weapon was probably a rock. This is the \" earliest evidence of lethal interpersonal violence, \" the researchers write in the journal plos one — and they note that the evidence of murder could explain why that body and 27 more were lying at the bottom of a cave shaft, apparently placed there by others. Given what's known of human behavior in the intervening 430,000 years, the scientists weren't too startled to find that the early humans they're studying were bashing each other over the heads with rocks. \" violence is a very usual behavior for animals, \" the lead researcher tells the guardian. \" it's not surprising that interpersonal violence took place. \" ( another ancient spanish cave yielded the burial site of a \" queen of the stone age. \" )",

Here we report the earliest evidence of lethal interpersonal violence in the hominin fossil record. Cranium 17 recovered from the sima de los huesos middle pleistocene site shows two clear perimortem depression fractures on the frontal bone, interpreted as being produced by two episodes of localized blunt force trauma. The type of injuries, their location, the strong similarity of the fractures in shape and size, and the different orientations and implied trajectories of the two fractures suggest they were produced with the same object in face-to-face interpersonal conflict. Given that either of the two traumatic events was likely lethal, the presence of multiple blows implies an intention to kill.

        "summary": "Learning a new language might help you fight the effects of aging, but new research out of the university of arizona suggests at least two factors affecting your quality of life are out of your hands — and in those of your spouse. Over six years, 8,000 married couples with an average age in their early 60s self-reported their physical health and quality of life and underwent cognition tests measuring verbal fluency, word recall, and delayed word recall. Researchers found a person's quality of life seemed to rely on the physical health and cognitive functioning of their partner. \" if you have people whose physical health is low — maybe they're suffering from an illness or unable to walk — those kind of physical health issues not only impact the individual but the person they're married to as well, \" the study's lead author says, per science daily. \" their husband or wife is the one who may have to adjust and help with their partner's new lifestyle. \" over the course of the study, changes in one spouse's quality of life were often reflected in the survey responses of their partner. When it came to their spouse's physical health, husbands and wives were equally affected. Wives ' cognitive abilities had just as much influence on their husbands ' quality of life as their own cognition, though the husbands ' cognitive function had a smaller, but still significant effect on wives. It isn't just an interesting find: \" as we build public health interventions for our aging population when it comes to quality of life, we need to take a more dyadic approach, looking at both partners, \" an expert says. To emphasize the pressure on spouses who are also caregivers, the huffington post reports almost 60 % of alzheimer's and dementia caregivers say the emotional stress of the job is high or very high, while 40 % suffer from depression.

Heraldo javier callupan, a 39-year-old man from argentina, had no visible signs of trauma and \" appears to have died of unknown medical issues, \" the national park service says. Callupan, a veteran climber and a guide for a brazilian travel agency, began his ascent of the 20,237-foot peak on may 1 and was found dead on may 10, according to the nps, which did not announce the death until his identity was confirmed. An nps spokeswoman tells cnn that callupan's gear was found next to his body, but he apparently died before he started setting up his tent. He is the first fatality this year on the mountain, and the nps says his remains will stay at the camp until park rangers are \" safely acclimatized \" and weather conditions allow them to get there by helicopter, nbc reports. The alaska state medical examiner's office will conduct an autopsy when the body is retrieved, which cnn reports will probably be this weekend.

        "summary": "With the gop now running congress and donald trump looking for a full repeal on his first day in office, obamacare appears to be in dire straits, and the new york times explains how republicans could use a process called budget reconciliation to streamline its dismantling. Although the rewriting procedure — an expediting of legislation related to taxes or spending that typically needs only a simple senate majority to pass — is sometimes deemed \" arcane, \" it's also \" probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to congress for a large portion of the budget, \" per the nonpartisan congressional research service. The gop attempted a reconciliation bill against the aca in 2016, but president obama vetoed it. More on obamacare's possible fate: the cbc runs through the aca's potential fast-track demise, offering a refresher on what the federally managed insurance exchange is, why the gop wants to take it down, and how soon that could happen. The new york times lays out the four-step blueprint republicans are likely to use to start the repeal process, starting with a democratic filibuster-shielding resolution and capped off by whatever alternative the gop has to offer. And that gop alternative? the washington post points out there doesn't seem to be one right now and that \" unanswered questions \" remain, including whether health care taxes will immediately get the ax. \" if you are repealing, show us what you ' ll replace it with. Then we ' ll look at what you have and see what you can do, \" senate minority leader charles schumer said wednesday after meeting with vp-elect mike pence. Npr tries to suss out the truth between what the democrats and the gop are claiming, noting \" both sides are trying to position themselves as the protectors of americans ' health care, while branding the other party as a dangerous threat. \" sign-ups on healthcare.gov hovered near 8.8 million as of saturday, per nbc news, about 200,000 more than last year's open-enrollment period. \" it is clear that americans want and need this vital coverage, \" hhs secretary sylvia burwell says.

Further, podesta claims it's \" reasonable \" to conclude that \" the trump campaign had advance warning \" that wikileaks planned to release the hacked emails; he cites an august tweet by longtime trump associate roger stone claiming that \" podesta's time in the barrel \" was coming. In other developments: trump would be \" dangerous from an international point of view \" as president, united nations human rights chief warned wednesday. Zeid ra ' ad al-hussein, a jordanian prince, said he was not \" intent on interfering in any political campaign, \" but he found some of the republican's remarks, especially on torture, \" deeply unsettling and disturbing, \" the ap reports. Russia's ambassador to the united nations has told zeid that he shouldn't criticize foreign leaders. Cbs miami reports that trump, who says he has been \" unshackled \" by dozens of leading republicans turning their backs on him, saved most of his anger for hillary clinton instead of fellow gopers at a panama city beach rally tuesday. \" the election of hillary clinton would lead to the destruction of our country, \" he said, addressing the latest email leak. Earlier in the day, trump targeted \" weak and ineffective \" house speaker paul ryan. Sources tell the hill that as chief of breitbart.com, trump campaign ceo steve bannon ordered his staff to do everything they could to destroy ryan, whom he sees as part of an elitist conspiracy to bring in a world government. The new york times reports that as the split within the gop deepens, the democrats are doing their best to take advantage, stepping up efforts to regain control of the senate and possibly even the house. Insiders say that the clinton campaign now sees arizona and georgia as winnable. The guardian reports that president obama was campaigning for clinton in north carolina tuesday, where he slammed trump over lewd remarks in a 2005 recording. \" the guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-eleven, \" obama said, mocking republicans who are still standing by him — especially those who think trump's personality is going to change.

Two researchers in the remote canadian arctic found the bottle tucked into a mound of rocks on ward hunt island, reports popular science. The note inside had a simple request: measure the distance from the rocks to a nearby ice shelf, and then report back either to the note writer or to a colleague in boston, reports the halifax chronicle herald. It had names and addresses for both and was dated july 10, 1959. The modern-day researchers conducted the measurement and found that the ice sheet had retreated more than 200 feet since 1959, one tells the la times. But the story is about more than that particular scientific experiment. It turns out that the note writer was then-25-year-old paul walker and the colleague he mentioned was albert crary, both of whom are now renowned in polar research. \" i recognized the two names instantly, \" says one of the two who found it. ( he mentions \" goose bumps. \" ) part of the fascination is that walker suffered a stroke just weeks after writing the note and died later that same year. \" i was just so pleased because it brought paul back, in a way, and the work he had done, \" says a historian who knew him. \" he had a brilliant career as a glaciologist and all of a sudden, to be cut short that way. \" and the finale: the two present-day researchers took photos of the note but put it back where they found it, along with another from themselves asking future researchers to conduct the same measurement, reports the cbc.

            "In the northernmost reaches of the canadian arctic, 500 miles ( 800 kilometers ) away from the nearest human settlement, researchers discovered a literal message in a bottle, halifax's herald news reports. It begins just like the worst examples of cover letters on the internet: \"to whom it may concern. \" but the rest of it is pretty awesome. It turns out it's a note buried by paul walker, an american geologist well known to those in his field today. He built two rock \"cairns \" in this remote spot, as the discovering scientist, warwick vincent of laval university in quebec, described them. Walker asks scientists of the future to measure the distance between the two cairns, one of which is located on the ward hunt ice shelf. Walker wanted to know whether the ice shelf, the artic's largest, was growing or retreating. The note is dated july 10, 1959. Vincent and his colleagues carried out walker's request and discovered that the rock piles are now 333 feet ( 101.5 meters ) apart. In walker's day, the distance was just 4 feet. The findings jibe with vincent '",
            "For about 15 years, warwick vincent has visited what he calls canada's most remote spot. The average temperature there is -18 c. The nearest human settlement is 800 kilometres away.

            "In the northernmost reaches of the canadian arctic, 500 miles ( 800 kilometers ) away from the nearest human settlement, researchers discovered a literal message in a bottle, halifax's herald news reports. It begins just like the worst examples of cover letters on the internet: \"to whom it may concern. \" but the rest of it is pretty awesome. It turns out it's a note buried by paul walker, an american geologist well known to those in his field today. He built two rock \"cairns \" in this remote spot, as the discovering scientist, warwick vincent of laval university in quebec, described them. Walker asks scientists of the future to measure the distance between the two cairns, one of which is located on the ward hunt ice shelf. Walker wanted to know whether the ice shelf, the artic's largest, was growing or retreating. The note is dated july 10, 1959. Vincent and his colleagues carried out walker's request and discovered that the rock piles are now 333 feet ( 101.5 meters ) apart. In walker's day, the distance was just 4 feet.

        "summary": "E-cigarettes might spare the heart and lungs, but not so much the brain. Columbia university researchers who theorized in the 1970s that nicotine can lead to drug addiction are reiterating that point in light of the e-cigarette's popularity, reuters reports. Though tobacco-free, \" they are pure nicotine-delivery devices, \" says the updated study's co-author. In lab studies, rats and mice with a nicotine habit were found to be \" more addicted to cocaine \" once exposed, says one expert, as nicotine lowers the brain's addiction threshold. It \" clearly acts as a gateway drug on the brain, and this effect is likely to occur whether the exposure comes from smoking cigarettes, passive tobacco smoke, or e-cigarettes, \" the study claims. With 466 brands and flavorings — including candy — the $ 3 billion e-cigarette business has caught on with kids, adds reuters. And that's a problem, the scientists say, because the addiction risk may be higher \" during a period of brain development; \" adolescent rats and mice proved even more addicted than the adults. \" the emergence in our society of new recreational pharmaceuticals such as e-cigarettes and legalized marijuana, while justifiable on one level, may have adverse consequences of which we are not fully aware, \" says another columbia scientist. Researchers want prevention programs and advocate for e-cigarettes to be regulated by the fda. ( e- cigs may be tobacco-free, but apparently they contain formaldehyde. )",

        "summary": "After five years of research, scientists have developed the first genetic map of the \" human microbiome \" — the more than 10,000 distinct microbial species that reside on and in your body. To do so, they collected tissue samples from 242 healthy americans from different sites ( or \" habitats \" ) like the skin, nasal and oral passages, and even feces. The map for the first time identifies what the bacteria are, where they are, and how they differ — between two areas of the body, and two people, explains the wall street journal. Here are some highlights of their fascinating work, published yesterday in 16 papers, per the washington post: guess which are more different: the microbial species that inhabit different regions of your body, or that inhabit you versus another person? answer: the former. For example, the microbes living on your skin are quite different than the microbes living on your tongue. Temperature, acidity, and other factors influence the number and variety of microbes in any given habitat; for example, the diversity of microbes in the vagina decreases during pregnancy, in order to provide a healthier birth passage. Different microbes can do the same job; for example, the microbes breaking down carbohydrates in your intestine may vary over time. The findings should give a boost to researchers studying bacteria-related diseases. One biologist not involved in the project tells the journal that new treatments could be created for ailments like crohn's disease, diabetes, and eczema.",

        "summary": "Approximately 46 million people in britain could one day be $ 400 richer thanks to a massive $ 18.6 billion lawsuit filed thursday against mastercard, cnn reports. It's one of britain's first class action lawsuits. Walter merricks, the former head of britain's financial ombudsman service who filed the lawsuit, alleges mastercard was charging stores too-high fees when customers used their credit cards between 1992 and 2008. According to reuters, the lawsuit claims the stores would then pass those fees on to customers — and not just mastercard users — in the form of higher prices. Merricks calls it \" almost an invisible tax \" and says mastercard \" behaved disgracefully. \" the lawsuit alleges mastercard charged stores transaction fees of more than 1 %. In comparison, the eu recently capped fees at 0.2 % for debit cards and 0.3 % for credit cards. The lawsuit is seeking damages for anyone who bought anything at a store during that 16-year period, no matter how they paid. And those estimated 46 million people will all be claimants in the lawsuit unless they specifically opt out. That works out to about $ 400 a person. Mastercard denies it did anything wrong and plans to fight the lawsuit. The ap reports there's currently a similar lawsuit seeking $ 6 billion from mastercard and visa working its way through the appeals process in the us.",

It's a goal that shocks some who knew saipov, 29, who grew up in a \" normal, secular, and peaceful family \" in uzbekistan, a former neighbor tells cnn. Authorities now believe saipov was radicalized online after coming to the us in 2010. He reportedly told police he decided to carry out an attack a year ago after seeing a video of islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi calling on muslims worldwide to avenge the killings of muslims in iraq. But saipov — who spent the last year and a half living in paterson, nj — reportedly told investigators it was only two months ago that he settled on using a truck, inside of which were arabic notes declaring saipov's allegiance to isis, per the post. Though evidence suggests he acted alone, authorities continue to examine whether saipov had help. The fbi hasn't said why it sought to locate 32-year-old muhammad kadirov on wednesday. However, a source who describes kadirov as saipov's cousin says kadirov is cooperating with police and is \" horrified \" by the attack. Meanwhile, the muslim community in paterson fears a backlash, reports the post. A mosque near saipov's home has already received calls threatening death and destruction, per usa today.",

Search and rescue officials say debris including parts of the fuselage and the possessions of passengers has been recovered from the area, but there is no sign of any survivors. The passengers included at least 20 employees of indonesia's finance ministry, who had been returning to ministry offices in pangkal pinang after spending the weekend in jakarta, the bbc reports.

' \" aniston, who married justin theroux last year, says they're harassed daily \" by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home who will go to shocking lengths to obtain any kind of photo. \" she says recent coverage, which has included yet more false claims that she is pregnant, \" has illuminated for me how much we define a woman's value based on her marital and maternal status. \" \" the way i am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty, \" aniston writes. She says the intense coverage of whether or not she is pregnant perpetuates the \" notion that women are somehow incomplete, unsuccessful, or unhappy if they're not married with children. \" aniston says she resents \" being made to feel ' less than ' because my body is changing and/or i had a burger for lunch and was photographed from a weird angle and therefore deemed one of two things: ' pregnant ' or ' fat. ' \" she says it's painful and awkward to be congratulated, sometimes dozens of times a day, on a fictional pregnancy. She says if she does become pregnant, she ' ll be the first to let the world know. She concludes that the tabloids aren't going to change, but we can all change how we react to the \" toxic messages \" in their \" seemingly harmless \" stories. Read the full column, which a source tells cnnmoney was published exactly as aniston submitted it, including her headline: \" for the record. \" ( one columnist wants to know why we're still calling aniston the world's most beautiful woman. )",

        "summary": "The jarring image from 1930 remains a seminal one in civil rights history — it shows a white crowd mingling in front of two black teenagers lynched in front of the jail in marion, indiana. At buzzfeed, syreeta mcfadden explores a facet to the lynching that may surprise many who have come across the photo: the crowd began to lynch a third teenager that day by the name of james cameron, but cameron lived to tell the tale. In fact, he would dedicate the rest of his life — he died in 2006 at age 92 — to educating americans about racism, most notably by opening the american black holocaust museum in milwaukee and writing a memoir. Drawing on that book, a time of terror, and other sources, mcfadden recounts his brush with death. It began when cameron, then 16, and the two other teens — thomas shipp, 18, and abram smith, 19 — tried to rob a white couple at a local lover's lane. Cameron says he left mid-robbery, only to hear gunshots in the distance. The white male was killed, and police soon had the three black teens in jail. After the white woman in the incident accused the three of rape — an allegation she would later recant — a mob stormed the jail. The crowd beat and lynched first shipp, then smith, and then came for cameron. The rope was around his neck when, as he recalled, a \" feminine \" and \" sweet \" voice spoke up. \"take this boy back. He had nothing to do with any raping or killing. \" amazingly, the crowd did just that. Just who spoke up — if anyone — remains unclear to this day. Cameron would serve time for accessory to manslaughter, but he was freed at the age of 21. His museum is now shuttered, but a movement is afoot to open it again. Click for the full article.",

Three african american teenagers: tom shipp, abe smith, and james cameron — huddled inside their cells, charged with the murder of a white man and the rape of white woman. Some among the thousands of people in front of the jail formed a mob. They beat down the jail doors, pulled the three youths from their cells, brutally beat them, and dragged them to a tree on the courthouse square.

            "On a hot august night in 1930 a crowd gathered in front of an indiana jail — men, women, and children shouting and jeering, demanding that the sheriff release his three prisoners. Three african american teenagers: tom shipp, abe smith, and james cameron — huddled inside their cells, charged with the murder of a white man and the rape of white woman. Some among the thousands of people in front of the jail formed a mob. They beat down the jail doors, pulled the three youths from their cells, brutally beat them, and dragged them to a tree on the courthouse square. At the last minute the mob spared cameron, the youngest and most boyish of the trio. Smith and shipp died, lynch ropes around their necks, their bodies hanging as the town photographer captured one of the most famous lynching photographs in american history. They weren",

He devoted the rest of his life not just to civil rights, but to memorializing the moment of his near death. Lawrence beitler was sitting on the front porch of his home in marion, indiana, when someone asked him to tote his 8x10 view camera to the town square. It was past midnight on august 7, 1930, and beitler, 44, was a professional photographer who mostly shot portraits of weddings, schoolchildren, and church groups. That night, he would be photographing a lynching. He \"didn't even want to do it, \" according to a later interview with his daughter, \"but taking pictures was his business. \" by the time beitler arrived on the square, a jubilant mob of nearly 15,000 white men,",

        "summary": "For as long as we have been gathering the data, more babies have died before reaching their first birthday ( so-called infant deaths ) than those who died in the second half of pregnancy ( aka stillborns ). Until now. Researchers with the national center for health statistics yesterday released a report that shows while infant deaths have declined by 11 % since 2006, the mortality rate of fetuses between 20 and 40 weeks gestation has stayed put in that time. Which means that in 2013, the number of stillbirths ( 23,595 ) actually surpassed the number of infant deaths ( 23,446 ) for the first time. Still, the difference is small. \" there was less than 1 % more fetal deaths, \" report author elizabeth gregory tells the new york times. Between 1990 and 2006, the rate of stillbirths actually declined rapidly, falling nearly 20 % from 7.49 deaths per 1,000 to 6.05, according to the child health usa 2013 report. And while genetic abnormalities, infections, and complications from placental or umbilical cord problems are often implicated, many of these deaths remain a mystery. Race seems to play a role, with black moms twice as likely as whites and asians to have a stillborn — a disparity that persists even with access to early prenatal care. Stillbirths are also more common in women 35 and older, and most common in teens 15 and younger. And there are slightly more male stillbirths than female ones. ( this woman chose to bathe and change her stillborn, whom she delivered at 38 weeks, because \" that's all you have. \" )",

            "Fetal mortality is defined as the death of a fetus prior to birth, regardless of gestational age. Based on survey data, more than a million fetal losses are estimated to occur annually in the united states, most of which are early fetal losses, also called miscarriages.1 only fetal deaths at 20 or more weeks ' gestation — often called stillbirths — are generally reported by states in the national vital statistics system. In 2006, the latest year for which national data have been reported, there were 25,972 fetal deaths at 20 or more weeks ' gestation, for a rate of 6.05 fetal deaths per 1,000 live births plus fetal deaths. The number of fetal deaths is similar to the number of infant deaths ( 28,509 in 2006 ).2 similar to trends for infant mortality, fetal mortality rates have generally declined over time. Since 1990, fetal mortality rates at 20 weeks or more have fallen by nearly 20 percent from 7.49 to 6.05 per 1,000 in 2006. Most of this decline is attributed to reductions in fetal mortality at 28 weeks or more, which declined from 4.30 to 2.97 per 1,000 between 1990 and 2006. As with infant mortality, there are large differences in fetal mortality by race and ethnicity.

The majority of this disparity ( 64 percent ) was due to higher non-hispanic black fetal mortality rates at 20- 27 weeks ' gestation.

Courtroom, according to people in washington familiar with the matter. Over the past year, u.s. Prosecutors have discussed several types of charges they could potentially bring against mr. Assange, the people said. Mr. Assange has lived in the ecuadorean embassy in london since receiving political asylum from the south american country in 2012....",

Bridesmaids fussed over it without any success and so ventured next door to look for tools that might help. It turns out that the neighbors were hosting a refugee family from syria who'd arrived four days earlier, and the father, ibrahim haltl ( or halil ) dudu, just happened to be a master tailor, reports the cbc. Within minutes, and with a little help from google translate, he identified the problem and du was sewn seamlessly into her dress. \" i was so excited and so happy, \" dudu said through a translator, per ctv news. \" i like to help canadian people from my heart. \" du and her husband, earl lee, meanwhile, said they were especially moved being immigrants ( from china ) themselves. \" we're so lucky that happened to us, and so grateful, \" says lee. It turns out that dudu had a tailor business in syria years ago that was destroyed by bombs, says the neighbor now hosting him and his family. Wedding photographer lindsay coulter's facebook post about the day has been shared more than 10,000 times. \" every weekend i take photos of people on the happiest days of their lives, and today one man who has seen some of the worst things our world has to offer came to the rescue, \" she writes.

The guy was initially oblivious, buckland explains. \" i approached it by asking him if he'd had a good commute that morning. We laughed it off and in a very british way i somehow ended up apologizing. \" the guy didn't get the position, which mashable reports was for a python developer role, though buckland maintains it's not because of the events of the morning. His tweet has since been retweeted more than 19,000 times, and tweeters have been proving buckland's experience isn't a singular one: they've been sharing their own similar encounters. ( for instance: \" i was once knocked off bike by van driver. Police prosecuted. He lost job &amp; home. Then needed rehousing - by me. \" ) buckland says the interviewee is ok about the tweet, though he wants to remain anonymous.

            "A couple of weeks after revealing some of its yoga pants were too revealing, lululemon has come out with two announcements this afternoon: first, chief product officer sheree waterson will be stepping down in mid-april, and second, the company seems to have gotten to the bottom, pun intended, of its quality problems. Statement from lululemon: after an evaluation of lululemon's previously disclosed black luon production issues, the company concluded that the current specification and testing protocols for the signature fabric luon that were developed in 2006 have not materially changed. However, production of luon is a complex process with a number of different inputs, and fabric is the key factor. While the fabric involved may have met testing standards, it was on the low end of lululemon's tolerance scale and we have found that our testing protocols were incomplete for some of the variables in fabric characteristics. When combined with subtle style changes in pattern, the resulting end product had an unacceptable level of sheerness. Lululemon had taken steps prior to the black luon issue to bolster its internal product expertise, including the addition of senior level capabilities in quality, raw materials and production. This new team was instrumental in determining the root cause of the issue and has initiated three work streams to address what we believe are the contributing causes. Work streams and actions include: 1. Testing &amp; processes: lululemon's quality team is assessing all luon products in the production pipeline according to newly implemented rigorous testing and quality processes that includes revised specifications for modulus ( stretch ), weight and tolerances. 2. Factory oversight: lululemon employees have been stationed in factories to monitor and test products and will educate internal teams and manufacturing partners on new testing standards and methodologies. 3. Leadership and structure: lululemon is building a stronger internal structure with new leadership and cross-functional team capability that we believe will create a more robust organization to support our long-term growth strategy. \"our stand for differentiation is the quality of our product.

        "summary": "The creation of a vast new national park in peru is excellent news for jaguars, tapirs, sloths, and probably quite a few species completely new to science. The sierra del divisor national park, which holds a connecticut-sized chunk of largely unexplored rainforest, is home to thousands of species and has been dubbed the \" yellowstone of the amazon \" for its stunning landscapes and variety of wildlife, reports the mother nature network. The area is also home to dozens of indigenous communities, some of them almost completely isolated, and making it a national park gives the region an extra layer of protection from loggers, illegal miners, and drug traffickers, the guardian reports. The move has been in the works for nearly a decade. The new protected area borders another one over the border in brazil. Peru president ollanta humala signed a decree creating the park on sunday, securing what the rainforest trust says is the final link in \" an immense protected area complex that extends for more than 1,100 miles from the banks of the amazon in brazil to the snowy peaks of the peruvian andes, \" and what the director of the andes amazon fund tells mongabay is a \" huge win for the planet. \" mnn reports that the park not only holds what is believed to be a large number of previously unknown plants and animals, it captures carbon dioxide equivalent to about 40 % of peru's daily output. ( earlier this year, brazil arrested the man authorities say was the amazon's biggest deforester. )",

The statue depicts a woman's hand holding an apple, a snake wrapped around her arm; it's a reference to the biblical story of the garden of eden, in which satan, in the form of a snake, tempts eve into eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. It was placed in the capitol rotunda by the chicago branch of the satanic temple, the state journal-register reports. \" we see satan as a hero in that story, of course, spreading knowledge, \" a spokesperson for the group explains. He further explains of the satanic temple itself, \" not only do we not worship a literal satan, but we don't believe one actually exists. Satan for us is a metaphor.... Throughout literary history, ( it's ) been used as a character that represents rebellion in the face of religious tyranny. \" despite that, the group's actions often spark an uproar, as they have in this case. The bbc reports that illinois family action tweeted that the satanic temple fails to realize \" that the little baby in the manger has crushed satan's head and the gates of hell will not prevail. \" the group had to apply to the secretary of state's office to put up the display, and the spokesperson for that office notes, \" under the constitution, the first amendment, people have a right to express their feelings, their thoughts. This recognizes that. \" the capitol rotunda is a public space, and the government can't censor what is displayed there. The belleville news-democrat notes that the sculpture is being called \" snaketivity \" and also includes the phrase, \" knowledge is the greatest gift. \" a gofundme raised more than $ 1,600 to put it up.

The virus produces cold-like symptoms and a rash that gives the appearance of \" slapped cheeks, \" but the 30-year-old from south wales was unconcerned; as the bbc reports, the virus typically has a \" minor \" effect on children. She did, however, mention it at her 12-week checkup to her midwife, who also didn't seem worried — but ordered a blood test to make sure davies had immunity to the syndrome. She didn't, meaning the twins she was carrying could be stricken with the virus, which can have a severe effect on fetuses. She was told an affected fetus will fight the infection or fill with fluid that it ultimately chokes on. Five weeks later, that fluid was spotted in one of her girls, reports the telegraph. At week 20, davies learned the afflicted twin wasn't showing the fluid; but four weeks later, the baby was in critical condition. Davies was told a blood transfusion could save the unborn child — but it could kill the other, and there was no guarantee it would work. Doctors also couldn't assure her that the virus wouldn't also attack the other twin. \" to know that there was a child drowning inside of me was horrible, \" says davies, but she decided, \" i couldn't risk losing both of my girls. \" at 28 weeks, the child died; seven weeks later, davies gave birth to the stillborn girl along with daughter cadi via c-section. \" the birth was bittersweet, \" she says. \" it was heartbreaking to see such a perfect baby who would never have a future. \" cadi is now 5 months old.

Amniotic cells had entered her bloodstream and caused her to go into anaphylactic shock, she reports on yahoo health. For a full 37 seconds, her heart stopped. But what makes her already rare story so remarkable is that she says she had premonitions throughout her pregnancy that she would die during delivery, and from something she'd never heard of before. It \" made the hair on the back of my neck stick out and it never let up, \" she tells wgn of the premonitions, which began after she learned she had placenta previa, meaning her placenta was growing on top of her cervix. \" it was every day, it was when i was walking, when i was dreaming, it was when i was shopping... It was relentless. \" one anesthesiologist listened to her concerns and flagged her file. That meant extra blood was on hand during her delivery, which came in handy as doctors fought to resuscitate her; she spent six days in a coma. The blood \" is 100 % what saved my life. No question, \" she told cbs chicago in 2013. Now promoting her new book, 37 seconds, arnold said thursday in a lengthy interview with wgn that at first she \" didn't remember anything \" but months later underwent hypnotherapy. \" i remembered things that happened in the operating room after i flatlined, \" she says of the therapy experience. \" there is no way that i could have seen where people were, what they were doing, what was happening down the hall, and the doctors said it was completely accurate. \" today arnold is alive and well in chicago with her husband, daughter, son, and stepdaughter.

Cortez's plight had drawn international attention: the 20-year-old was charged with attempted murder after giving birth to a premature infant in a bathroom. Cortez, however, says she hadn't even known she was pregnant, only that she felt something pass and then went to the hospital in pain. Authorities soon found the baby in the latrine, still alive, and prosecutors say cortez's failure to summon help for the birth amounted to attempted murder. The other big part of the case: cortez says she must have become pregnant by her stepfather, who she says had been sexually abusing her for several years. The stepfather is now under arrest and facing trial, reports the bbc. El salvador has among the world's toughest laws on abortion, outlawing it in cases of rape and even when the woman's life is in danger. Those laws played a role in the charges she faced, but on monday, prosecutors reduced them from attempted murder to abandonment. Then a court cleared cortez of any crime at all, reports the guardian. The judge ruled that she could not be blamed for what happened, given the \" emotional and psychological damage inflicted by the sexual violence she suffered since childhood, \" in the words of the guardian. Says a member of her legal team: \" it took the whole world to make the judges and prosecutors see what we've been saying for years: an obstetric emergency is not a crime. \"",

For $ 11.99, a search on his website — which was a year in the making — will dig through multiple sources to see if anyone spent their last days at your address. Coast to coast am says the site scours millions of records.

The fossils discovered by hublin had many features we associate with modern humans, including their facial structure. \"the face of the specimen we found is the face of someone you could meet on the tube in london, \" hublin says. However, the brain case was more elongated than in modern humans. This is evidence the modern human brain evolved in homo sapiens and wasn't inherited from an ancestor. However, there is disagreement between scientists not involved in the find whether homo sapiens really were living all over africa 300,000 years ago and if hublin's fossils are even homo sapiens in the first place and not some earlier species, the los angeles times reports.",

The column of wax was almost a foot long. \" it's kind of got that icky look to it, \" says sascha usenko, an environmental scientist at baylor university who was involved in the study. \" it looks kind of like a candle that's been roughed up a bit. It looks waxy and has got fibers. But it's pretty rigid — a lot stronger and a lot more stable than one would think. \" there are light and dark layers within the column, each layer corresponding to six months of the whale's life, usenko says. Historically the rings have been used to estimate the age of the whale, he says, \" very similar to counting tree rings. \" but age"

Cyndi scruggs purchased the shake from a location in mckinney, near plano, on may 10. But when she put the maraschino cherry into her mouth, she discovered that it had not been \" properly de-pitted, \" as the legalese of her petition states. When scruggs chomped down on the pit, she fractured two teeth below the gumline. That led to gum infection and sepsis, which in turn led to a heart attack, according to her lawsuit. Scruggs, who has since moved to colorado, is suing both the chain and its cherry supplier ( dell's maraschino cherries co. Inc.

        "summary": "Textbooks have long offered students an explanation of volcanoes that's totally wrong — or so say scientists who are offering a very different theory, caltech reports. The standard explanation depends on the existence of long, narrow columns or jets of magma known as mantle plumes. Since about 1990, they've been largely accepted among geologists, caltech professor don anderson tells the huffington post. The thinking was that molten rock near the earth's core shot up to the planet's mantle in these plumes, believed to be less than 186 miles wide. Gizmodo explains what was thought to happen next: \" where those columns sit in the mantle, there are hot spots — and when the earth's stiff crust fractures slightly, the magma can burst up and out as a volcano. \" thing is, those mantle plumes just don't exist, the experts say; indeed, the plumes have \" never had a sound physical or logical basis, \" says anderson. \" they are akin to rudyard kipling's just so stories about how giraffes got their long necks. \" so what's really happening? according to anderson's team, the new data indicates that there aren't narrow columns at all, but slow-moving \" upwellings \" that can be thousands of miles across. And instead of heat from the planet's core causing the motion, cooling at the surface is responsible for the movement: the cooling causes chunks of mantle to sink, and the less-dense magma is displaced and pushed upward. Thanks to cracks and stresses in the earth's plates, the magma can be squeezed out of the earth like a sponge. ( click to read about another unusual volcanic discovery. )",

But that picture is wrong, according to a new study from researchers at caltech and the university of miami in florida. New seismology data are now confirming that such narrow jets don't actually exist, says don anderson, the eleanor and john r. Mcmillian professor of geophysics, emeritus, at caltech. In fact, he adds, basic physics doesn't support the presence of these jets, called mantle plumes, and the new results corroborate those fundamental ideas. \" mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis, \" anderson says. \" they are akin to rudyard kipling's ' just so stories ' about how giraffes got their long necks. \" anderson and james natland, a professor emeritus of marine geology and geophysics at the university of miami, describe their analysis online in the september 8 issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.

In a tweet, trump said he could \" never support bailing out \" insurance companies, referring to the deal struck between republican sen. Lamar alexander and democratic sen. Patty murray to restore subsidies to big insurers for two years. Trump's opposition would all but doom chances of getting it passed, notes politico, but it's difficult to gauge exactly how opposed he is, given the \" mixed signals \" he's been sending over the last two days, per the washington post. Alexander, for one, suggests there's not much reason to worry because trump phoned him wednesday and said he's still open to the deal, subject to his final review. Meanwhile, a strategy is emerging on how to slip it through congress. Politico reports that a stand-alone bill seems unlikely and that democrats may instead tuck it into the year-end spending bill. The new york times lays out the thinking: \" in december, the government will run out of money, and no bill to keep it funded can pass without democratic votes, \" write robert pear and thomas kaplan. \" at that point, supporters of the alexander-murray measure can insist on its inclusion in any spending bill and threaten to shut down the government if they do not prevail. \" conservative republicans may oppose the measure, favoring a repeal of obamacare instead, but it could well attract enough gop support to succeed.

            "Washington — president trump on wednesday backed away from his endorsement of a bipartisan senate proposal to stabilize health insurance markets, throwing the legislative effort into doubt even as the chief architect of the deal predicted that it would become law before the end of the year. The latest actions by the white house confused republicans on capitol hill and irked democrats — but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in december, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by senators lamar alexander, republican of tennessee, and patty murray, democrat of washington, will have the most leverage. The mixed signals began tuesday, when mr. Trump appeared to give his blessing to the deal to restore subsidies to health insurers that he said days before he would cut",
            "President trump became the subject of an unusual public lobbying campaign over the fate of the affordable care act on wednesday as senate democrats and a key republican sought to salvage a bipartisan health deal while conservatives pressured the president to disavow the agreement. In a morning tweet, trump appeared to distance himself from the compromise, which would authorize payments to insurers that help offset millions of lower-income americans ' health costs in exchange for granting states greater flexibility to regulate coverage. But the president later told reporters that he was not closing the door on a deal altogether, and proponents of the plan authored by sens. Lamar alexander ( r-tenn. ) and patty murray ( d-wash. ) sought to keep him on board. The convoluted campaign, in which senate minority leader charles e.

Walmart provided a statement to fox 11 los angeles, noting that \" no retailer is immune to the challenge of crime, and walmart is not exempt. \" the statement added that the products that are determined to need a closer watch are \" made on a store-by-store basis, and often at the discretion of the store manager. \"",

Delta has been testing fingerprint technology to let certain skymiles members enter its sky club lounges at ronald reagan washington national airport. Meanwhile, jetblue is about to start its facial recognition test this month, but in a very limited capacity for people boarding flights from boston's logan international airport to aruba. Customers can opt out of jetblue's program and don't need to register, but the process will allow jetblue employees equipped with ipad minis to leave the counter behind and help check in passengers, reports business insider. The process is straightforward: in lieu of a boarding pass, passengers are photographed; the image is sent to the us customs and border protection database to be matched with a passport, visa, or immigration photo and to verify the passenger's flight details. Once cleared to board, passengers will be alerted on the screen. Delta also plans to use facial recognition to allow passengers to check bags at automated kiosks in minneapolis/st. Paul beginning this summer. ( facial recognition tech is being hailed as both useful and problematic. )",

The usps-amazon deal, announced yesterday, starts immediately, and the struggling postal service is planning similar sunday-delivery deals with other retailers. Unlike first-class mail delivery, package deliveries actually bring in money, and this way the usps gets a leg up on fedex and ups, neither of which offer regular sunday delivery. For now, sunday deliveries will only be made in los angeles and new york ( and some surrounding areas ), the new york times reports. Next year, it will roll out to dallas, houston, new orleans, phoenix, and other cities. There will be no extra fee for sunday deliveries, the la times notes. Meanwhile, the usps is still wrestling with congress over its plan to stop delivering mail on saturdays, but even if that comes to pass, it would continue to deliver packages on saturdays.",

For the postal service, which lost nearly $ 16 billion last year, first-class mail delivery, particularly on saturdays, is often a money loser, whereas package delivery is profitable. The deal, announced on sunday and taking effect immediately, in time for the holiday shopping season, gives the postal service a chance to take some business from united parcel service and fedex, which do not deliver on sundays. Now, some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for monday delivery will go through the postal service and arrive on sunday. The postal service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants, seeking a larger role in the $ 186 billion e-commerce market. Amazon.com would not say if it would try to arrange sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers. Photo for this holiday shopping season, sunday delivery of amazon products will be limited to the los angeles and new york metropolitan areas, which in new york's case includes parts of new jersey and connecticut. In 2014 it is expected to expand to other cities including dallas, houston, new orleans and phoenix. Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be amazon prime members, who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items, said kelly cheeseman, a spokeswoman for amazon. \"now every day can be an amazon delivery day, \" ms. Cheeseman said. Postal service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit. \"consumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week, and we are glad to be in a position to partner with amazon on providing this service, \" said patrick r. Donahoe, the postmaster general. Neither amazon nor the postal service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from sunday deliveries.

The verge very simply lays out the capabilities of and concerns with the project, which the fbi and national institute of standards and technology launched in 2014 as tatt-c and is moving into a new phase called tatt-e: the tattoo data gained can function as a \" recognition system, \" much the way that fingerprints do now, but the project is also looking to use algorithms to flag information held in the tattoos, such as a specific criminal affiliation or belief. The eff is concerned about the technology being used to profile people based on their tattoos, which would raise \" significant first amendment questions. \" also, the eff charges that the research is \" lacking basic privacy safeguards \" ( it cites one instance in which 15,000 photos were distributed to third parties, \" with little restriction on how the images may be used or shared \" ) and that images of tattoos have been obtained under duress. Describing it as \" awfully orwellian, \" gizmodo notes that the project is in line with other technologies being used by police, such as facial recognition. In a 2015 interview, mai ngan of the nist told business insider that 20 % of americans have tattoos, but the figure swells among criminals, which fueled law enforcement's interest in tattoo-based recognition technology.

Archaeologists recently uncovered one of their 4,000-year-old homes in lorain county and say it belonged to hunter-gatherers who visited periodically during the fall and winter, the cleveland plain dealer reports. \" there's nothing like this anywhere in ohio, \" says team leader brian redmond. \" it's very significant....

In other words, it was \" long-term \" and \" rather comfortable by late archaic period standards, \" says new historian. There are also cooking pits, storage holds for hickory nuts, and a shallow clay basin that captured redmond's imagination. It was found with a primitive bone tool and deer anklebone inside, but \" the purpose of this construction remains a mystery, \" he writes in a blog. \" perhaps the basin held plant material.... Maybe it was a water dish for the family dog! we really don't have a clue. \" whoever lived there, he says, they migrated from the southeast, hunted small game and deer, and caught fish from lake erie and black river; pottery and farming hadn't been invented yet.

That's why a study from london's natural history museum is surprising — and pretty disgusting. Of the 50-some sets of remains analyzed from a cave in morocco, dating between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago, 94 % had severe tooth decay that could include excruciating toothaches and pus-filled, swollen gums — by far the earliest case of widespread dental decay, researchers say. \" it is unexpected to find this level of tooth decay in a hunter-gatherer population because, typically, they are not thought to consume such large quantities of carbohydrate-rich foods, \" louise humphrey tells nbc news. \" they were eating on the polished roots of their teeth. I think they would have been in pain. \" it turns out the ancients had a thing for nuts — pine nuts and acorns in particular — that were high in carbs and led to bacteria that \" essentially dissolves away the enamel, \" humphrey explains. That could spell trouble for modern adherents of the paleo diet, but not necessarily. \" there's not one kind of paleo diet, \" she says. \" i think wherever people lived, they had to make best of the wild food resources available to them. \"",

The women, both said to be in their 20s, will now get the chance to tell their side of the story in a courtroom in malaysia, as a judge has just ruled there's ample evidence for the women to go to trial, the bbc reports. Judge azmi ariffin said thursday enough information has been presented to suggest it could have been \" a well-planned conspiracy between the women \" and four north koreans who've been charged but still not found. The women's lawyers claim that in the days before kim's death, the women had been pulling pranks on many other people, wiping them with liquid in a variety of public venues. In his decision, however, which cnn notes took more than two hours to read, ariffin says if it had been just a joke, there would've been a hidden camera crew and the women would've been seen letting kim in on the prank afterward. The women could face death by hanging if they're convicted.",

The amendment from schumer — who complains that \" it costs you an arm and a leg just to have room for your arms and legs \" — was attached to a broader aviation bill. It would have banned airlines from reducing seat size and the distance between rows for 30 days while the faa worked on setting seat size and row spacing requirements for us airlines, reports cnnmoney. It would also have required airlines to post seat sizes on their websites. The amendment \" would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on seat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a can on every flight, \" said schumer, who blamed airline lobbyists for the defeat. \" flying is not pleasant anymore. You're crammed in. \" the washington post notes that the width of the average economy seat has shrunk to 17 inches from 18.5 inches since the ' 70s, rows are now more than 4 inches closer together, and the proportion of americans considered obese has soared to 35 % over the same period. A similar amendment introduced in the house earlier this year was also shot down.",

The bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement announced monday that it issued a permit to noble energy inc. To continue work on its santiago well about 70 miles ( 112 kilometers ) southeast of venice, louisiana. Drilling will resume nearly one year after bp's blowout created the worst offshore spill in u.s. History. Noble started drilling the well four days before the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20. The project was put on hold on june 12 after the u.s. Placed a moratorium on exploration in waters deeper than 500 feet ( 152 meters ). No new deepwater permits had been issued since the moratorium was lifted in october. Regulators have been under pressure from the oil industry and some lawmakers to get drilling projects started again in the gulf while ensuring that new safeguards are in place. That pressure increased last week as the price of oil spiked above $ 100 per barrel and the price of gasoline hit its highest level in two and a half years. Environmental groups want the government to hold off on permits and force oil companies to further study the effects of drilling on fragile marine habitats. At 6,500 feet ( 1,980 meters ) below the surface, noble's well is deeper than bp's blown out macondo well. In a worst-case scenario, the company told regulators its well could spill nearly 3 million gallons ( 11.36 million liters ) of oil per day into the gulf.
