One system uses multiple cameras and the other relies on a microchip inside the ball. Assuming all goes well, one should be in place for the 2014 world cup in brazil. Helping prompt the move was a notorious blown call in the 2010 world cup, when a shot by england's frank lampard crossed the line but did not get awarded. \" i have changed my attitude toward technology because of lampard's kick in south africa, \" says fifa chief sepp blatter. \" that was the moment for me to say, ' you are the president of fifa and you cannot afford that in the next world cup something similar will happen.

The kim regime has never lacked chutzpah. It must have known this was high-risk. After all, two earlier rockets – identical to a taepodong icbm, hence the world's concern – in 1998 and 2009 flew far, but failed to put satellites in orbit as pyongyang claimed. Another missile in 2006 exploded 40 seconds after launch. Yesterday's did a bit better: it lasted 90 seconds. At least this time the regime told its people, which is progress. Admissions of failure are rare indeed in pyongyang, and this one could not have been worse timed. The centenary of north korea's founding ' great leader ' kim",

That slim rocket was meant to launch the nation's first satellite into orbit. But starting in august 1957, four static firings of its engines failed. Pressure soared as moscow successfully sent its first satellite into orbit that october. Reporters descended on cape canaveral, fla. On dec. 6, the countdown reached zero, and vanguard lifted off the launching pad. It rose four feet before settling back in a churning ball of smoke and fire. The vanguard satellite fell clear and \"came comfortably to rest nearby, chirping innocently, \" according to \"the heavens and the earth, \" a history of the early days of the american space program. Early the following year, the united states was able to launch a satellite with a different rocket, and less than three months later"

Fortune laments the online \" carnage \" that played out on twitter as radioshack offered a massive liquidation sale over the weekend, in which it opted for \" unadulterated bleakness \" as it tried to answer a question spurred by today's social media: \" how do you toast a brand's final days when the world is watching? \" tweets included photos of empty store display equipment now up for purchase, as well as products with hugely slashed prices and \" grab-bag \" events. \" this could be your last chance to shop at #radioshack.

She has been the best possible katniss, \" he raves. But lawrence isn't all there is to enjoy. The film is \" explosive, mostly true to the text, complex, and chock full of action. \" it \" should more than satisfy the franchise's many fans. \" sara stewart is on an entirely different page. \" it hurts to see the girl on fire go out on such a lukewarm note, \" she writes at the new york post. Mockingjay part 2 \" manages to give us everything we've been waiting for and still underwhelm. \" stewart is particularly perturbed that the final book was split into two films, as well as a major plot point that \" is downplayed here to an extent that, i felt, betrayed or at least misread collins'story. \" but at least \" there's still the pleasure of watching jennifer lawrence. \" \" i feel more exhausted than fulfilled, \" writes james berardinelli at reel views. Mockingjay part 2 is \" more polished \" than part 1, but \" the pace is uneven and there's a sense that the series has hung around too long. \" it \" feels like every other dystopian motion picture \" and though \" an anticlimactic ending … makes a strong political point about the moral ambiguity of war, \" it's \" not cinematically satisfying. \" though \" all the individual story lines are wrapped up and there's a nice little epilogue. \"",

Billed as \"the next big thing \" 3 1/2 years ago with the release of the first hunger games movie, the series has lived up to its hype. The movie adaptation of the final book of suzanne collins ' best-selling trilogy, mockingjay, has been bifurcated and, although there's little doubt this was a financially savvy move, the creative results are dubious. Mockingjay part 1, released a year ago, was a disjointed, incomplete affair and, although mockingjay part 2 is more polished, the pace is uneven and there's a sense that the series has hung around too long. In keeping with the tone of the source material, mockingjay part 2 is bleak. There's nothing wrong with this - plenty of the best sci-fi movies have been dark. The problem is that, in addition to removing the light and hope, mockingjay has robbed the series of its uniqueness. Suddenly, it feels like every other dystopian motion picture - and there are a lot of them out there. It's impossible to distinguish large stretches of mockingjay part 2, with characters running around in subterranean tunnels being chased by zombie-like creatures, from similar segments of the maze runner movies or the divergent series. They all blend"

The land, including a 77,000-square-foot main building, was being sold by a roman catholic diocese that needed cash after being sued by abuse victims. But the college, which has around 70 students, was unable to attract enough new students to justify the $ 10 million purchase and ended up in deep financial trouble even after selling all but 8 acres of the land, politico reports. \" i believe the vision was enrollment would grow, which it did, but not at the level that would have allowed us to manage the financial debt we had incurred, \" dean of operations coralee holm told reporters on monday. \" so here we are. \" neither holm nor college president carol moore criticized sanders, who reportedly received a $ 200,000 severance package, for her role in the college's financial problems.

Presidents always give better speeches when they help write their remarks and strike out any sentences that don't match what is in their hearts. Go through obama's text, and you won't find a single line that fails to reflect his views. 2. George w. Bush could have delivered every sentence.

In his november editor's letter for vanity fair, carter wrote that over the years, and as recently as last year, trump would send him the occasional photo, \" generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. \" those photos did little to convince carter, and now marco rubio has apparently taken up the mantle. Politico quotes rubio as saying the following on sunday: \" [ trump is ] like 6-2, which is why i don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5-2. Have you seen his hands? you know what they say about men with small hands — you can't trust them. \" while in ohio on tuesday, trump swung back, trotting out one of his favorite adjectives in the process: \" actually i ' m 6-3, not 6-2 — but he said i had small hands.... I never heard — i never heard that one before. I've always had people say,'donald, you have the most beautiful hands. ' \" in noting rubio's new tactic, the washington post writes he \" may be on to something. \" it reports on recent polling that identified the type of attack that would be most likely to raise serious doubts about trump among gop voters. The winner: attacks framing trump as an \" egomaniac and entertainer that cares more about gaining power and fame than helping the country. \" more policy-minded attacks — think immigration, climate change, big oil — were far less effective.

Which he succeeded in doing in the only way he knew how: by putting his name in oversize type on anything he was associated with — buildings, yes, but also vodka, golf courses, starchy ties, and even a sham of a real-estate school.

In a regulatory filing, tesla says it churned out 5,031 of the sedans — marketed as the company's entry to mass sales — in the last week of the second quarter, reports cnn. The milestone came after a series of well-publicized problems and musk's own admission of a \" production hell. \" monday's news pleased investors, with the stock up 5 %. In a lengthy story, meanwhile, the new york times provides a look at the extremes musk has gone to in order to ramp up production, including installing a third assembly line under a tent at its plant in fremont, calif. One nugget of the story getting attention is that tesla's engineers did away with 300 of about 5,000 welds in the model 3 underbody after concluding they were unnecessary. That involved reprogramming the robots assembling the underbodies to skip them. Musk also has hired hundreds of workers to replace robots who turned out to be inefficient at certain tasks, such as guiding bolts through holes as part of the rear brakes. \" we believe in rapid evolution, \" musk tells the times in an interview — it took place at 3am thursday, the only time the company said he'd be available. \" it's like, find a way or make a way.

        "summary": "The intelligence chief for the us navy is named twig branch, and he hasn't been allowed to see any major intelligence for more than two years. This isn't a lost chapter from the satirically bizarre catch-22 — it's the truth behind the scenes of a major military corruption investigation, the washington post reveals. Vice adm. Ted branch ( \" twig \" is his nickname ) has been barred from accessing classified info since november 2013, which is when the navy got wind from the justice department that branch may be entwined with a case involving bribery of navy officials by a malaysian defense contractor. Deciding it was too risky to keep him abreast of the most top-secret info, the navy stripped him — and one of his deputies, rear adm. Bruce f. Loveless — of that access in anticipation of his possible indictment. Meanwhile, the investigation drags on. While loveless was moved to a lower-level position, branch was kept in place — a move that has baffled military analysts. \" i have never heard of anything as asinine, bizarre, or stupid in all my years, \" historian norman polmar tells the post. ( polmar has begged the navy to rethink this arrangement. ) it does seem, at the very least, unwieldy: not only is branch barred from meeting with other top us intelligence officials about sensitive projects, he can't hear updates about them, either — and even strolling into a co-worker's office to say hi means that colleague has to \" make sure any classified documents are locked up, \" per the post. A navy spokeswoman simply says that the bribery probe \" has not impacted the navy's ability to manage operations \" and that branch's sensitive tasks are managed by his deputies.

The scheme revolves around a bank that's closely linked to putin and his allies. The bank, bank rossiya, apparently received huge, unsecured loans from russian state-owned banks and funneled billions into offshore transactions. About $ 1 billion went through a shell company created by mossack fonseca; among other things, the company bought a $ 6 million yacht and loaned $ 11.3 million to the owner of the igora resort.

Their idea — which didn't win, yet might seem familiar: a taco shell made out of... Doritos. Of course, taco bell ultimately came out with just that roughly 17 years later, and its insanely successful line of doritos locos tacos has netted the firm more than $ 1 billion in sales. Andrea watt, one of the former interns, tells the huffington post she doesn't want money ( \" i ' m sure i signed away that anything i pitched to them was their property anyway \" ), but she wouldn't mind at least some credit — for an idea that she recalls being told wasn't \" really that marketable. \" the huffington post has all sorts of proof of their idea, including promotional materials the team created. They suggested calling the product \" dorito tacos, \" charging 79 cents, and having matthew perry shill for the item. Another team member, mark rader, adds that the two flavors the team pitched — nacho cheese and cool ranch — ended up being the first two flavors offered by taco bell. A former account supervisor for the ad agency at the time says \" the client certainly saw all the pitches. \" but others have claimed to be the brains behind the taco, including a man whose 2013 obit widely touted him as having pitched the idea to frito lay in 2009, and a former prison inmate who's actually suing over the matter; he claims a mystery person stole a letter containing the idea from the usps and gave it to taco bell. In response to the new claims, a rep for taco bell pointed out that concept and execution are two different things. Indeed, it ultimately took years of unusual testing to bring the taco to life.",

The driver then left her for dead, police say; a passerby later found her body in a ditch after spotting her crumpled bike. Authorities pleaded for the public's help, tweeting a photo of a black car part the vehicle left behind in the hopes someone could identify it. That's when reddit stepped in: the photo was posted on the subreddit / r/whatisthisthing, leading to hundreds of comments, yahoo news reports. Car enthusiasts, mechanics, and other experts weighed in; ultimately, someone identifying himself as a maryland state vehicle inspector determined it was a headlight part from a 1980s chevrolet truck, komo news reports. Then police received an anonymous tip with the license plate number of a 1980s chevy pickup truck with front end damage to the right-side headlight assembly. Investigators ultimately found and arrested jeremy simon, who drives a 1986 chevrolet k-10; police say he confessed to hitting rainwater. Simon, 37, allegedly told police he fell asleep at the wheel, thought he hit a mailbox and pulled over, but drove off in a panic when he saw the mangled bicycle because he didn't want to see a dead body, the news tribune reports. Troopers allegedly found a small bag of heroin and a plastic straw in his pocket when he was arrested.

The new york times reports republicans are expected to release a tax reform plan sometime in the next few weeks, and that plan could include a drastic reduction in the amount of money workers are allowed to put into 401( k ) accounts. Workers are currently allowed to contribute $ 18,000 annually to 401( k ) accounts ( $ 24,000 if they're over 50 years old ), but sources say republicans are considering capping contributions at $ 2,400 annually. It's unclear if the cap would also apply to iras, which are currently limited to $ 5,500 annually ( $ 6,500 for workers over 50 ), according to the wall street journal. The idea is that because income put into a 401( k ) or ira isn't taxed until it's withdrawn years later, lowering contributions would generate immediate tax revenue for the government — an estimated $ 115 billion in 2018. But that represents less than 8 % of the tax cut planned by republicans, and industry groups worry it will reduce the amount of money americans save for retirement. One person working to preserve retirement savings during the tax reform process tells the hill capping contributions at $ 2,400 could be \" devastating for long-term retirement security. \" it would also likely be massively unpopular with middle-class workers. \"republicans are so determined to cut taxes on the wealthy that they're willing to tax the retirement accounts of millions of middle-class americans, \" sen.

( cnn says it has confirmed the story. ) trump did not take the advice and went on to make flynn his national security adviser, only to fire him three weeks later when it emerged that flynn had misled the white house about his conversations with the russian ambassador. Obama's concerns, however, were more about flynn's temperament, reports nbc, which notes that the obama administration fired flynn in 2014 from his post as head of the defense intelligence agency. Obama reportedly told trump that flynn was not suited to such an important position. The revelation comes on the day that sally yates, who served briefly as acting attorney general between the two administrations, is expected to testify before congress about her concerns over flynn's contact with russian ambassador sergey kislyak. Trump himself addressed both aspects of the story on monday: \" general flynn was given the highest security clearance by the obama administration - but the fake news seldom likes talking about that, \" he tweeted. ( spokesman sean spicer previously blamed the obama white house, citing flynn's clearance to run the dia. ) and on yates, trump tweeted: \" ask sally yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to w.h.

The final entry on the list read, \" a man lives the same day over and over. \" after the no. 2 idea on rubin's list got sold and made into hear no evil starring marlee matlin, an agent wanted another script, and rubin chose that no. 10 idea — which became groundhog day. Why did rubin choose to center the movie around a holiday, which he decided to set on feb. 2? he was hoping, as s.i. Rosenbaum explains in an extensive piece for the new yorker, that the film would become a \" holiday cable perennial. \" it worked. Rosenbaum traces the film's journey, from rubin's first draft to the final draft, from the movie's initial modest success to its current cult status. Despite its insane popularity, rubin never went on to have another hit. Hollywood people kept trying to get him to make another movie, but he didn't want to make just a standard rom-com, and he turned them all down. \" i was always thinking, i ' m not a one-hit wonder, i ' m not a one-hit wonder! \" he tells rosenbaum. \" but even if i am — ok, that's more than most people get. \" then, in 2012, rubin's own life began to resemble groundhog day when tim minchin and matthew warchus approached him about turning the film into a musical. They had to convince him they weren't going to ditch him along the way, and they didn't — rubin has been a part of the entire process, which resulted in the beloved movie becoming a beloved musical. \" i ' m the guy who wrote groundhog day, \" rubin says, but he's not bitter about it. \" it's delightful to be so associated with something so well loved. \" the full piece is worth a read.",

        "summary": "The deaths of three children have been linked to parents who reportedly own a popular but controversial spanking book by a tennessee preacher. The book, to train up a child, by michael pearl of the no greater joy ministry, promotes using a switch on babies as young as 6 months and plumbing tubing on older children to keep them in line — much like \" stubborn mules \" are disciplined. Some 700,000 parents, many of them home-schoolers, have purchased the self-published tome, including parents who are either currently serving prison time or have been charged in the abuse and beating deaths of three young children in the last 5 years, reports the new york times. Pearl says it's unfair to blame his book for the actions of unstable parents, but physicians and law enforcement authorities have expressed concerns about the book's role in child abuse. \"my fear is that this book, while perhaps well intended, could easily be misinterpreted and could lead to what i consider significant abuse, \" a pediatrician who examined one of the dead children told the times. The book threatens to escalate violence against children because it advises that \"if you don't get results, the only thing to do is to punish harder and harder, \" says a woman who runs a christian-based blog opposed to corporal punishment. Parents worried about the book have organized to pressure outlets like amazon.com to stop selling it. One of the pearls ' five children, now 28, recalls having a \" wonderful \" childhood, even though her dad says she was spanked some 50 times as a toddler. Click for more from the times ' piece.",

Pearl notes, \"can be rolled up and carried in your pocket. \" advertisement continue reading the main story the furor in part reflects societal disagreements over corporal punishment, which conservative christians say is called for in the bible and which many americans consider reasonable up to a point, even as many parents and pediatricians reject it. The issue flared recently when a video was posted online of a texas judge whipping his daughter. Mr. Pearl, 66, and mrs.

They say that their methods, properly used, yield peace and happy teenagers. \"if you find a 12-step book in an alcoholic's house, you wouldn't blame the book, \" mr. Pearl said in an interview.

        "summary": "Apple is hoping its new, cheaper iphone can make plastic cool. As expected, apple unveiled two new iterations on its popular smartphone today, the premium 5s, and the budget-friendly 5c. \" the iphone 5c is beautifully, unapologetically plastic, \" designer jonathan ive said, according to the washington post. Here's everything you need to know from the unveiling: the advent of the new iphones will put the iphone 5 out to pasture, but, curiously enough, not the 4s. As predicted, the 5s will come with a new stainless steel fingerprint-reading home button. You ' ll be able to use it to unlock the phone or make purchases. The fingerprint data will not be stored on apple's servers, which means that \" presumably the nsa can't tap it, \" the telegraph observes. The 5s will be available in not just gold, but silver and \" space gray \" as well. Black will no longer be an option. The 5c, meanwhile, will come in what the huffington post quips are \" candy colors \": white, blue, green, rose, and yellow. The 5s will boast a powerful a7 chipset, and run 64-bit software. It's five times as fast as the iphone 5 and 40 times faster than the original iphone released six years ago. But not everyone's impressed: \" they're talking about specs because they fear smartphones are becoming good enough, \" matthew yglesias argues. The 5c will have the same screen, camera, and a6 chip of the iphone 5. \" looking at the specs of the 5c, it becomes clear why the 5 was retired, \" analyst carolina milanesi observes. \" this is not the cheap product that many expected. \" the 5c will start at $ 99, while the 5s will start at $ 199, with a new contract. The 4s will be available for free, again, with a new contract. Apple stock is plunging following the event, and business insider writer steve kovach thinks it's because the market is disappointed that the 5c, which will cost $ 549 without a contract, will be too expensive for emerging markets.",

He says: fingerprints can be a useful addition to security but their value depends highly on the type of fingerprint reader and how it's is being used - for example the best use of a fingerprint is to provide a convenient way to unlock something in a medium to low security scenario. Pros: - you always have your finger print with you. - a high entropy fingerprint reader is better than a 4 digit pin code. - it's easy to use. Cons: - it is already possible to lift and duplicate fingerprints and this technology is only going to improve with time. As such its suggested that fingerprints should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a pin",

With just four books to his name – although his long-awaited fifth the lost symbol is published next month – brown did well to see off competition from john grisham, author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers",

The aides say they were told by the department of veterans affairs that the va will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to dec. 2019. Under the forever gi bill signed into law by president trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school's main campus is located. Tanya ang, vice president of veterans education success, tells the military times that the va's excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn't good enough. \" that could be hundreds of dollars for some students — per month, \" she says. \" if this was a disability benefit, this would never fly. \" the issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the va's outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the tennessean reports. The agency is still working to process more than 58,000 claims, reports the star tribune. The paper's editorial board calls the delays a \" national disgrace. \" \" those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they've earned, \" they write.",

The national security agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted mr.

            "The n.s.a.'s evolution: the national security agency was founded in 1952, and its surveillance capabilities were limited by legislation in 1978. But with the attacks of september 2001 came a new sense of urgency. When ban ki-moon, the united nations secretary general, sat down with president obama at the white house in april to discuss syrian chemical weapons, israeli-palestinian peace talks and climate change, it was a cordial, routine exchange. The national security agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted mr. Ban's talking points for the meeting, a feat the agency later reported as an \"operational highlight \" in a weekly internal brag sheet. It is hard to imagine what edge this could have given mr. Obama in a friendly chat, if he even saw the n.s.a.'s modest scoop. ( the white house won't say. ) but it was emblematic of an agency that for decades has operated on the principle that any eavesdropping that can be done on a foreign target of any conceivable interest — now or in the future — should be done. After all, american intelligence officials reasoned, who's going to find out? from thousands of classified documents, the national security agency emerges as an electronic omnivore of staggering capabilities, eavesdropping and hacking its way around the world to strip governments and other targets of",
            "Mr. Obama found himself in september standing uncomfortably beside the president of brazil, dilma rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of n.s.a. Eavesdropping. Since then, there has been a parade of such protests, from the european union, mexico, france, germany and spain. Chagrined american officials joke that soon there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them. Advertisement continue reading the main story james r. Clapper jr., the director of national intelligence, has repeatedly dismissed such objections as brazen hypocrisy from countries that do their own share of spying. But in a recent interview, he acknowledged that the scale of eavesdropping by the n.s.a., with 35,000 workers and $ 10.8 billion a year, sets it apart. \"there's no question that from a capability standpoint we probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of russia and china, \" he said. Since edward j. Snowden began releasing the agency's documents in june, the unrelenting stream of disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency's mission since its creation in 1952. The scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the n.s.a., the nation's largest intelligence agency, and the white house has ordered a review of both its domestic and"

It wasn't to be, but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602, they did find something staggering: a \" great settlement \" some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people, an ancestral wichita indian town called etzanoa. But french explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people, sowing confusion among latter-day historians. Donald blakeslee, an archaeologist with wichita state university, says he's cleared it all up: etzanoa did exist, he claims, once thriving where the walnut and arkansas rivers meet in arkansas city, kansas. Per a university press release, things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old spanish documents by the university of california, berkeley's cibola project. Prior translation errors caused \" many archaeological discoveries in the area [ to be ] misinterpreted, \" per the release. In 2015, blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined. And, indeed, a search there turned up small iron cannon balls, reported the kansas city star at the time. If blakeslee is right, the \" long-lost city \" would be second only to cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric native american sites, reports the wichita eagle. That would be a boon for arkansas city and its 12,000 residents; some 400,000 flock to the remains of cahokia, in illinois, each year. The kansas house of representatives thinks blakeslee is onto something; earlier this month it approved a resolution that formally recognizes etzanoa based on \" the evidence, \" reports the courier traveler.

A lower ratio — where the second digit is shorter than the fourth — indicates \" greater androgen exposure. \" in the journal clinical anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: in their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found \" significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio... In both hands, \" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: the right-hand 2d: 4d ratio was \" significantly higher \" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was \" significantly lower \" — suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone \" affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain, \" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients. ( a recent study found that schizophrenia isn't actually one disease. )",

Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand — think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils — has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. \" it's a double-whammy for weight gain, \" one researcher tells npr. \" we've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong. \" what's more, the researchers say there was no increase in total or bad cholesterol between the groups, which has been feared would be the case in higher-fat diets, reports reuters. It remains unclear precisely why people on lower-carb diets not only lost more weight but had lower heart disease risk factors.

Verizon ditched its unlimited plans not long after it launched its version of the iphone 4 earlier this year, notes roger cheng at cnet, who recommends that sprint users hop on unlimited data plans now to get \" grandfathered in \" before the sprint iphone arrives.",

Sprint ceo dan hesse, as seen in one of the company's much-played black-and-white television commercials. ( credit: cbs/sprint ) if history is any indication, sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if apple's blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It's something the other carriers have done, and it's part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iphone users, at&t; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took verizon wireless a few months after launching its version of the iphone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. Sprint, which the wall street journal reported today will be getting the iphone 5 at the same time as at&t; and verizon in october, will likely follow the same path.

On the flip side, though, those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts.

            "And, contrary to popular belief, people in open or polyamorous relationships aren't more sexually satisfied: 71 % of people in polyamorous or open relationships are satisfied with their sex life compared to 82 % of people in monogamous relationships and 80 % of people who are married, in civil unions or partnerships. The least sexually satisfied people are those who are single and looking for a relationship; only 40 % are satisfied. Single people are also more likely to choose not to divulge information about their sex life. The survey also shows that general satisfaction increases with age among men but stays relatively stable among women. However, for both men and women, 25-30 year olds are most likely to report that they are 'very satisfied ' with their sex life.

            "Ann arbor, mi - while monogamous relationships are considered by many to be the cornerstone of love and happiness, a new university of michigan study indicates that those in consensual open relationships are just as satisfied. The study, led by um associate professor of psychology and women's studies terri conley, showed that heterosexuals in consensual open relationships reported high levels of satisfaction and trust, as well as low levels of jealousy. \" overall, the outcomes for monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants were the same - indicating no net benefit of one relationship style over another, \" said conley, in a news release. Conley and colleagues conducted analyses of different relationships among participants older than age 25. The sample included 2,124 people - including 1,507 individuals in monogamous relationships and 617 individuals in committed non-monogamous relationships. The group rated relationship components: satisfaction, commitment, trust, jealousy and passionate love,",
            "Sex is a big part of most romances, whether a marriage or a more experimental union. A recent survey of europeans shows that people in the most sexually liberated partnerships aren't having the best time. Monogamous couples reported that they were the most sexually satisfied of all the groups in a large, representative survey conducted in march 2017. Among the 1,885 people who said they were in monogamous relationships, 82 % reported that they were broadly satisfied with their sex life. That compared to 80 % of people in a marriage, civil union or other legal partnership, while 71 % of people in open or polyamorous relationships said they were fulfilled. The survey, conducted by dalia, a berlin-based research company, included over 11,000 people from the 28 countries in the european union aged 14-65, though for the purposes of reporting they then excluded those aged under 18.

            "Allison ng, one of the major characters in cameron crowe's recently released aloha, is asian-american. Emma stone, the actress the director chose to portray her, is not. The casting decision raised eyebrows and drew criticism from groups who said that by using stone to play a character who explicitly states her racially mixed background throughout the movie, crowe was whitewashing the role. Now crowe, in a post on his own site, has offered a \" heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice. \" the director says that he was \" grateful for the dialogue \" the backlash provided, but also took the time to defend his decision to cast stone as ng. \" as far back as 2007, \" crowe writes, \" captain allison ng was written to be a super-proud one-quarter hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one. \" crowe, who has described aloha as a film about hawaii, says that her half-chinese father was meant to symbolize \" the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent \" on the islands.

            "Allison ng, one of the major characters in cameron crowe's recently released aloha, is asian-american. Emma stone, the actress the director chose to portray her, is not. The casting decision raised eyebrows and drew criticism from groups who said that by using stone to play a character who explicitly states her racially mixed background throughout the movie, crowe was whitewashing the role. Now crowe, in a post on his own site, has offered a \" heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice. \" the director says that he was \" grateful for the dialogue \" the backlash provided, but also took the time to defend his decision to cast stone as ng. \" as far back as 2007, \" crowe writes, \" captain allison ng was written to be a super-proud one-quarter hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one. \" crowe, who has described aloha as a film about hawaii, says that her half-chinese father was meant to symbolize \" the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent \" on the islands.

        "summary": "Cedric anderson had threatened his estranged wife before, but nobody realized how dangerous he really was until he opened fire in her san bernardino classroom on monday, police say. San bernardino police chief jarrod burguan said tuesday that anderson, 53, who killed karen smith and an 8-year-old special-needs student before shooting himself, was allowed to go to smith's classroom at north park elementary school because staff members recognized him, the san bernardino sun reports. Burguan says smith, who separated from anderson in march after less than three months of marriage, only told close family members that he had threatened her. \" she effectively kept her private life private, \" the chief says. The chief adds that smith, who had moved back in with her adult children, believed anderson's threats were only a cry for attention. The 8-year-old boy killed as he stood behind smith has been identified as jonathan martinez, who had the genetic condition williams syndrome, which causes developmental delays, the desert sun reports. School district superintendent dale marsden says jonathan's parents, who described him as a happy boy, want his death to spread awareness of the disease. A gofundme campaign to help the boy's family raised nearly $ 100,000 by the end of tuesday. Marsden says a 9-year-old boy hit in the upper body by a bullet who was hospitalized in critical condition is \" up and watching cartoons \" and is expected to make a full recovery.",
