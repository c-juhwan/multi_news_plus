A total con job, playing the fake news media for fools ( but they know it )! \" now daniels is suing the president over that tweet. The adult film star filed a defamation suit against the potus monday in federal court in manhattan, nbc news reports. \" mr. Trump used his national and international audience of millions of people to make a false factual statement to denigrate and attack ms. Clifford, \" the complaint says. Daniels is seeking damages in excess of $ 75,000, per the hill. According to the complaint, trump essentially accused daniels, whose real name is stephanie clifford, of fabricating the threat against her — and that by doing so, he exposed her to more threats. The lawsuit also claims trump basically accused daniels of committing a crime, as it is illegal under new york law to falsely accuse someone of committing a crime against you, bloomberg reports. \" regardless of who you are or what position you hold, you are not permitted to fabricate statements in an effort to deceive people, \" says daniels ' lawyer, michael avenatti. \" there are consequences for doing that. \" ( meanwhile, a federal judge recently put daniels ' other lawsuit against trump on hold for 90 days. )",

What wasn't fake: the us visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. \" the criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored, \" the us state department said in a nov. 2 statement ( per the washington post, the news is only being widely reported now ).

The process of obtaining a visa legally in ghana is a \" dreadful experience, \" per the ghana business news, which is how these con operations flourish. This initiative was discovered after an informant tipped off an investigator involved in a larger trafficking and fraud probe in the area; the fraudulent business was shuttered over the summer.

The sport \" does not leave much room to let your mind wonder on things that may be going on in your life — you have to focus on not falling. \" researchers divided more than 100 people in germany diagnosed with depression, or who received low scores on a depression on a who depression scale, into two groups, the first of which immediately began climbing rocks or walls at a moderate height for three hours a week. Most were new to the sport. Over eight weeks, early participants showed a 6.27-point improvement in their score, while those in the second group who didn't climb saw a boost of just 1.4 points. When the sedentary group got the green light to climb in a second trial, their scores increased as well. Some german hospitals are using bouldering to treat depression, inverse notes.

The fatal shooting of lacie larose took place last month at a graduation party, when about two dozen people were playing beer pong in a garage about 1am. A witness says a dispute broke out over the rules, and it led to a fight between two groups — the party's host and his friends, and a neighbor and his friends. Police say neighbor ronald mcneil, 39, left the party, returned with a gun, and opened fire. \" we're a bunch of college kids, \" landon duke tells the newspaper. \" we didn't think anything was really going to happen. Just to be safe, we closed the garage door. \" two other partygoers were injured by the gunshots, and mcneil told police that he meant only to scare the guests, not shoot anyone, reports the houston chronicle.

Work began march 30 on the pit, which sits adjacent to the tomb mound of qin shi huang, an emperor who conquered much of modern china before his death in 210 bc. That pit has seen previous excavations, between 1994 and 2008, reports the xinhua news agency, and gave up statues whose coloring led archaeologists to conclude the clay warriors were originally painted. What they expect a 2,150-square-foot section of the pit to give up now: as many as 1,400 warrior and horse statues, 89 war chariots, and 116 mounted soldiers, the ap reports by way of the emperor qinshihuang's mausoleum site museum. Those warriors would add to the 7,000 that were found at the site — the world's biggest underground mausoleum — since 1974. The no. 2 pit is thought to be a more archaeologically interesting site than the already excavated no. 1, with archaeologist yuan zhongyi describing the no. 2 as holding \" the true essence of the terracotta army, \" noting the \" colorful paint is also relatively well preserved. \" national geographic's file on the terracotta warriors reports there are four pits that have seen some excavation, including one that was found to be empty, \" a testament to the original unfinished construction. \" qin's tomb mound hasn't been touched, and it's unclear whether china will ever decide to disturb a space that ancient texts describe as one filled with treasures.

Jon and linda grant picked up the souvenir, a 15- to 18-inch giraffe bone onto which a herd of elephants had been carved, at a game reserve in south africa after being assured by the clerk that it was perfectly legal. That may have been the case in south africa, but the grants ran into trouble when the safari took them to tanzania. They were jailed after being informed at the airport that the giraffe was tanzania's national animal, reports abc7. Anti-poaching officials were called to the scene, and the grants were suddenly facing a 20-year sentence and a $ 150,000 fine. Eventually, the charges were reduced to failure to have an export permit, which carries a still-hefty $ 30,000 fine. \" they said, ' are you willing to pay it? ' \" jon grant, a 72-year-old retired dentist, tells ktvu. \" we said, ' absolutely. ' cost us $ 30,000 for buying [ the ] souvenir plus another $ 30,000 in bribes to get out of the country. \" local congresswoman jackie speier, who helped get the original charges reduced, thinks this was likely more than a mix-up — that the grants were targeted as wealthy americans. \" this is pretty egregious, \" she tells abc7, adding that us officials should be on the lookout for a pattern and that american tourists should be on alert. The grants, meanwhile, \" never knew \" they could \" be that afraid. \" ( the uk wants joan of arc's ring back over an export licensing issue. )",

But the completed necropsy dealt two additional blows: first, the orca was pregnant. \" when you have 78 animals and you lose an animal... That has the potential to contribute for decades — that's a huge loss to this population, \" says paul cottrell of the canadian department of fisheries and oceans. The fetus was full term, and while results from tests to be performed on tissue samples won't be available for at least a month, king 5 news reports the leading theory is that the calf may have actually spurred the mother's death. The theory posted to facebook last night by the victoria marine science association: that the calf died and caused an infection that ultimately killed, or had a hand in the death of, its mother. King 5 news notes that a calf birthed by an orca in the j, k, or l pod hasn't survived longer than a year in the last three years. The second blow: between friday evening, when the carcass was placed on a boat launch, and saturday morning, in advance of the scheduled necropsy, a number of its teeth were removed, some sawed off \" right to the gum, \" cottrell tells the canadian press. He notes that rhapsody's jaw and teeth were otherwise \" in great shape and solid. \" the department is investigating. The puget sound orca population was listed as endangered in 2005, notes the ap.

But just days before the procedure, it was canceled, because aetna, the family's insurance company, denied the coverage, saying the surgery is \" experimental \" for epilepsy and \" the effectiveness of this approach has not been established. \" instead, aetna approved a more expensive temporal lobectomy, despite laser ablation being fda approved and a mayo clinic neurosurgeon saying the procedure is a well-regarded one. \" there's a lot of data out there to suggest it's effective for epilepsy, \" dr. Jamie van gompel says. Plus, patients who have laser ablation recover more quickly than those who undergo traditional brain surgery — in less than two weeks, instead of up to three months — and have less pain and less risk of complications, per van gompel. \" it's just so frustrating for us to know there's … a way to fix our daughter, and some bureaucratic machine is preventing this from happening, \" cara's dad says.

Conceptual artist jonathon keats says his device will actually show 10 centuries of change in a single shot: \" the photograph not only shows the skyline, but also records how it develops over time, \" he says in an arizona state university press release. \" for instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them. \" so why invent such a camera? because, he says, he wants us to consider the image and reflect on how our choices will affect the environment. \" you can look at the scale of time beyond the human life span, \" he says in another arizona republic piece. That can help you look \" reflectively back on yourself from the context of the future, putting what you're doing today in the context of that longer term, \" he adds. Unlike those words, keats ' camera is simple: made from solid metal, it has a pinhole in a 24-karat-gold plate that lets light hit colored pigment, and slowly create an image with oil paint instead of film. If all goes well, the asu art museum ( which houses the camera ) plans to display the image in 3015, discovery reports. Keats has also helped people make simpler, tin-can cameras that capture 100-year images for future generations.

The hotheaded musician is under investigation for assault after brawling with r&b singer frank ocean outside of a los angeles recording studio sunday night, officials said. Witnesses told investigating deputies that the fight was over a parking space – and that brown threw the first punch. Those statements conflict with initial reports of the fight, with other witnesses telling tmz that someone attacked chris as he tried to shake ocean's hand. Ocean, who cut his finger in the fight, took to twitter following the melee: \"got jumped by chris and a couple guys. Lol. I only wish everest was there, \" he wrote. Everest is the name of the singer's bernese mountain dog. He also hinted that the injury could impact his performance at the grammys. The pair had previously battled online in 2011, back before brown deactivated his twitter"

            "Ever since health care reform flamed out in the 1990s, democrats thought lots of things might derail their longtime dream this time around. Losing a senate seat in liberal massachusetts was not on the list. But that is the harsh reality sinking in among democrats — that a republican victory tuesday could spell the end of health reform because there is no good option to rescue the plan from this latest brush with political death. Publicly, the white house and top democrats held firm to their stance that health care reform will pass this year.

Patrick baccari, a fellow health inspector who shared a cubicle with the san bernardino suspect, says the 28-year-old seemed to be \" living the american dream \" and had returned earlier this year from saudi arabia with a wife he met online, report the los angeles times and the ap. That wife was tashfeen malik, who was shot dead with farook after a police chase, hours after the couple allegedly opened fire on the san bernardino county public health department's holiday party, killing 14 people. ( the details on their marriage and that trip to saudi arabia are still clarifying — the new york times reports they were married two years, but other reports say it's been for a shorter time. ) colleagues tell the times that farook disappeared from the party just before a group photo was taken. In other developments: police have not discussed a motive, though terrorism has not been ruled out. The ap notes that at a wednesday night press conference, a council on american-islamic relations spokesman said: \" we don't know the motives. Is it work, race-related, is it mental illness, is it extreme ideology? \" the cair rep says that according to family members, the couple left their baby girl with farook's mother on wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, and relatives didn't realize what had really happened until a reporter called. Farook was born in illinois to parents from pakistan, reports the new york times. Colleagues tell the la times that he was a devout muslim, but that he didn't talk about his religion at work. \" i haven't heard anything, \" farook's father told the new york daily news, speaking before his son's name was made public. \" he was very religious. He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He's muslim. \" a brother-in-law conveyed the same sentiment: \" i have no idea why he would do that, why would he do something like this, \" said farhad kahn at a cair news conference. \" i have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself. \" early reports suggested three shooters, but chief jarrod burguan of the san bernardino police department says police are now \" reasonably confident that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects. \" in a cbs news interview, president obama said the us now has a pattern",

The rodents were introduced to california in 1899 for their fur, but officials thought they got rid of the last of them in 1978. It's unclear where this new population of nutria came from — it's possible one colony escaped eradication only to emerge recently — but officials say their numbers will explode if something isn't done. A single female nutria can give birth to up to 200 offspring a year, and they have no natural predators. Nutria are 2.5-feet-long, weigh around 20 pounds, and can eat up to 25 % of their body weight a day. \" they burrow in dikes, and levees, and road beds, so they weaken infrastructure, ( which is ) problematic for flood control systems, \" california fish and wildlife spokesperson peter tira tells kcra.

It was a curious scene, with goblins, monsters and characters of all kinds mingling around real-life secret service agents.

For example, the afsluitdijk is right up trump's alley: it's a massive wall that, in the narrator's view, \" we built to protect us from all the water from mexico. \" \" this dutch video on trump has gone viral because, well, just watch it, \" urges mashable. Another choice line: \" we've got ponypark slagharen, which has got to be the best ponypark in the world, \" the narrator says over footage of tourists romping with ponies at an amusement park. \" it's true. They're the best ponies, they are. You can ride them, you can date them, you can grab ' em by the pony. It's fantastic. \" adweek calls the video \" hilarious, \" noting that the netherlands itself isn't left unscathed by the satire.

The newspaper notes that one twitter user even claims, \"you can literally sing the original over this one. \" nitsuh abebe went into his first listen of the track completely prepared to analyze its deeper meaning, especially in regards to the gay community, but was soon overwhelmed by the fact that the song is \"bonkers mecha-disco, \" he writes in new york. \"the song's so disco that the line about people being 'orient-made ' barely even registers, because it sounds like something nobody would have thought twice about saying in 1978. \" the huffington post notes that some believe this will become \"a legendary anthem. \" one of those people is elton john, who told rolling stone he believes \"born this way \" will \"obliterate ' i will survive.

According to his will, 17-year-old victoria and 21-year-old marlena will get $ 10 million apiece at age 35 but can only touch the dough earlier if they provide trustees with evidence of a rather traditional lifestyle. To wit: marlena gets $ 500,000 for getting married, as long as the groom signs an agreement saying he won't touch the cash. She gets $ 750,000 more for graduating from an \" accredited university \" and writing up to 100 words on what she ' ll do with the money. In five years, marlena and victoria each receive a yearly check for 300 % of their annual income. Uncle sam will love the date when they get it: april 15. If either becomes a stay-at-home mom with kids, she gets 3 % of the trust's value each year, providing the children are \" born in wedlock. \" their mother, 58-year-old ewa laboz, isn't so lucky: maurice offered her nil, citing a prenuptial agreement.

As reuters reports, the move to block south koreans from going to their jobs at the kaesong industrial park, dubbed the \" last remaining symbol of detente \" between the rivals by the ap, puts a vital source of revenue for the north at risk.

However, reuters notes that the south transports all supplies to the complex, so food stocks could begin to dwindle. Entry to the park, which is home to 123 factories, was previously blocked three times in 2009, once for a three-day period.

        "summary": "Nature giveth, and nature taketh away. In addition to bringing much needed rain to southern california this winter, el niño is apparently also a harbinger of something much less desirable: venomous sea snakes. A yellow-bellied sea snake was seen on a beach near malibu twice this week, quartz reports. It's the first time since 1980 — another el niño year — the snake has been reported in california. It's also the furthest north the snake has ever been reported along the pacific coast, according to the los angeles times. In a facebook post on the sightings, environmental nonprofit heal the bay says the warmer pacific ocean waters caused by el niño — in addition to the rising ocean temperatures brought on by climate change — are likely the reason for the snake's migration. The state wildlife department was called after the second snake sighting — it's unclear if it was the same snake — friday, ktla reports. The snake died soon after, and its body was given to the natural history museum of los angeles. According to the times, the yellow-bellied sea snake lives its entire life in the ocean, so if it's spotted on land it's likely sick or hurt. Beach-goers are warned not to touch the snakes, which heal the bay points out are \" highly venomous \" and descended from asian cobras and australian tiger snakes. But the nonprofit helpfully advises there's \" no need to panic. \"",

That is, the congressional budget office hasn't had time to assess the american health care act and score it. \" i wish that we had it, all right? \" said rep. Fred upton, a key figure who switched from no to yes when the white house agreed to add $ 8 billion for pre-existing conditions. But upton said any such cbo estimate is probably weeks away, adding that the measure could be changed, perhaps by the senate, at that point. At vox, sarah kliff writes that the rush to vote is a risky move for the gop. \" the cbo score will come out sooner or later, and republicans might be faced with defending a bill they don't like much at all. \" the sticking point over pre-existing conditions had threatened to derail the measure, and critics say the $ 8 billion amendment still won't do enough to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions will be adequately covered. An analysis by the fact checker blog at the washington post says the issue is so nuanced that the simplistic talking points coming from both sides on the issue are useless. \" if the bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states — and then how those decisions are implemented. \" meanwhile, the wall street journal reports that even if the vote is successful, it would \" face uncertain prospects \" in the senate.

        "summary": "Global overfishing might be much worse than previously thought, discovery reports. A new study finds that un figures have vastly understated the problem and that yearly fish hauls are declining three times faster than realized. According to the study, the un — using numbers from the food and agriculture organization — stated that global fishing peaked in 1996 at 86 million metric tons, but the researchers say it was actually closer to 130 million metric tons. Since then, the study claims the total amount of fish caught has declined by 1.2 million metric tons per year — not 0.4 million metric tons as the un had said, the guardian reports. \"our results indicate that the decline is very strong and is not due to countries fishing less, \" study author daniel pauly says. \" it is due to countries having fished too much and having exhausted one fishery after another. \" the study, which was published tuesday in nature communications, is based on a decade of work by 400 researchers around the world. The numbers used by the un come from the self-reporting of more than 200 countries and territories, and governments might not always be inclined to give accurate fishing counts, notes the guardian. Researchers undertook a \" herculean task \" to get more accurate counts for the years from 1950 to 2010, says one professor not involved with the study. \"the world is withdrawing from a joint bank account of fish without knowing what has been withdrawn or the remaining balance, \" pauly tells discovery. And while the food and agriculture organization disputes the study's new numbers, it does agree with its conclusion that countries need to improve their reporting, according to science.

The estimate, drawn in part from a painstaking effort to gather statistics on poorly documented subsistence, recreational, and illegal fisheries, suggests that the world catch has also declined more steeply since the 1990s than official figures indicate. Overall, fishers caught an estimated 109 million metric tons ( mt ) of fish in 2010, researchers report today in nature communications. That's well above the 77 million mt that nations reported to the food and agriculture organization ( fao ) of the united nations, which keeps global catch statistics. The reconstructed 2010 catch"

        "summary": "Whether marco rubio's aggressive performance in thursday's debate translates into success on super tuesday remains an open question, but the upshot blog has some hopeful news for his campaign: even if donald trump sweeps all the states in play — and polls suggest he has a decent chance of doing that — rubio remains very much alive. The main reason is that republicans forbid winner-take-all contests prior to march 15, meaning rubio ( and ted cruz ) can still pile up delegates for second and third place. The blog floats the possibility of trump winning the day with a 34-25-25 percent split over the other two, in line with his previous victories. That would give him 279 delegates and rubio 164. \" it's a respectable tally for mr. Rubio, even though he loses every state, \" writes nate cohn. Ideal? no, but it keeps him afloat until march 15, when big winner-take-all states such as illinois, ohio, missouri, north carolina, and rubio's home state of florida come into play. At this point, rubio would have to win some of those to have any hope of beating trump. If not, his \" chances of winning a majority of delegates would all but evaporate. \" of course, rubio hopes to pull off some victories on tuesday, and fivethirtyeight notes that his campaign is spending heavily in virginia and georgia to make that happen. He's also spending big in texas, which has the most delegates at stake, for a different reason. Because it's cruz's home turf, texas is where rubio is most vulnerable to failing to receive 20 % of the vote, the threshold for receiving any delegates at all.",

Trump could sweep to the nomination over a divided field. But that's not so true before march 15, when party rules prevent states from apportioning their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. Most states wound up splitting their delegates, awarding a pool of at-large delegates proportionally by the percentage of the vote and awarding other delegates to the candidates who lead in each congressional district. As a result, it will be difficult on super tuesday for mr. Trump to amass a significant majority of delegates if the other two major candidates — mr. Rubio and ted cruz — clear the thresholds ( at highest 20 percent ) for earning proportional delegates. It seemed quite possible a few weeks ago that mr. Trump could build a big lead on super tuesday, but jeb bush's exit from the race and the big bump in mr. Rubio's poll numbers make it far less likely that mr. Trump can pull that off. Imagine, for a moment, that the candidates fare about as well on super tuesday as they have through the first four contests. Given the types of states in play on super tuesday, perhaps that yields something like a 34-25-25 percent",

This summer, fusion put together a timeline of the phrase's history, from its apparent first use on twitter in 2009 ( \" i ' m about to log onto netflix and chill for the rest of the night \" ) to other, similar phrases ( \" hulu and chill \" ) to, finally, the phrase's new meaning in 2014 ( \" netflix and chill never means netflix and chill now a days lol \" ) and its current-day \" catchphrase \" status.",

But in december, the wolf's journey came to an end after a hunter there mistook her for a coyote and shot her dead, the san francisco chronicle reports. Using dna testing, the us fish and wildlife service confirmed the 3-year-old collared animal was the same one seen at the grand canyon, the republic notes. \" it is nothing short of a tragedy that this wolf's journey across the west was cut short, \" eva sargent, a director for defenders of wildlife, tells the chronicle. \" this brave and ambitious female gray wolf … had already become a symbol of what gray wolf recovery should look like: animals naturally dispersing to find suitable habitat. \" gray wolves weren't always isolated to certain parts of the country: all of north america used to be their home, defenders of wildlife notes, but they were killed off throughout much the us in the 1930s. What's worrying some animal advocates is that the federal government is considering removing endangered-species status from gray wolves in all regions: when they were delisted from the northern rockies, mass killings of the creatures took place in multiple states, including montana, idaho, and wyoming. \" sadly, with the us fish and wildlife service preparing to remove all protections for gray wolves, except for mexican gray wolves, in the near future, it will become harder and harder for wolves to travel safely, and less … likely that we will hear their howls echo through places like the grand canyon, \" sargent tells the chronicle.

Trump argued that mueller had multiple conflicts of interests, including an alleged dispute over fees that caused him to resign his membership at the trump national golf club years earlier and his work at the law firm that represented jared kushner, the sources say. The white house has repeatedly denied that trump tried to fire mueller after his investigators began looking into whether the president had obstructed justice, the times notes. ( on friday at davos, trump called the new report \" fake news. \" ) sources tell the washington post that before the order to mcgahn, aides including steve bannon and reince priebus tried in vain to persuade trump that firing mueller could trigger efforts to remove him from the presidency. Republican rep. Charlie dent tells the post that mcgahn prevented an \" archibald cox moment, \" referring to richard nixon's 1973 firing of the special prosecutor investigating watergate.

They think they can attempt the feat in the next 12 months using existing technologies. What ' ll happen in general: two particles of light ( photons ) will be smashed together to create an electron-positron pair, known as a breit-wheeler pair in honor of the earlier researchers, americans gregory breit and john wheeler. The specifics of the process: first a stream of electrons will be fired into a slab of gold, creating a high-energy photon beam; then, a high-energy laser will be fired into a gold can called a hohlraum, creating light akin to what stars emit. The first beam will then be directed into the center of the can, and the two photon sources will collide. What emerges from the can: electrons and positrons. It is \" a very clean experiment: pure light goes in, pure matter comes out. This experiment would be the first demonstration of this, \" says physicist oliver pike.

Steve israel, n.y., agreed to stay on as head of the party's campaign committee. Republicans reacted with derision. \" there is no better person to preside over the most liberal house democratic caucus in history than the woman who is solely responsible for relegating it to a prolonged minority status, \" said paul lindsay, spokesman for the national republican campaign committee. \" this decision signals that house democrats have absolutely no interest in regaining the trust and confidence of the american people who took the speaker's gavel away from nancy pelosi in the first place, \" he said. Pelosi, 72, has represented a san francisco area district in the house includes becoming the first woman in history to serve as speaker. The tea party-fueled political wave of 2010 forced the gavel from her hand to rep. John boehner, an ohio republican. Holding a news conference wednesday morning with women members of her caucus, pelosi said \" we're very, very proud \" of how large a role women played in the nov. 6 election. \" we don't have the gavel \" of majority status in the house, she said, \" but we have unity. I think our caucus this morning demonstrated that very clearly. \" \" we must have the further empowerment of women, \" said pelosi, who noted that when she came to congress there were 23 women in the house"

        "summary": "Catherine halsey, a character in the video game halo, is a scientist and atheist who considers herself smarter than her parents. The same can be said of patricia dickson, a ucla associate professor of pediatrics — and she claims that's no coincidence. Dickson, who had a romantically tinged friendship with halo creator jason jones when they were both students at the university of chicago in the 1990s, tells the los angeles times she's the inspiration behind halsey and other aspects of the game. Her reasoning: she says she once told jones she felt like the character halsey in ayn rand's the fountainhead, as well as gave him the idea for an alien invasion triggered by religion. Jones denies her claim, but dickson insists that some similarities are too exact to be accidental. In her college dorm, for example, was a snow globe and a matterhorn-shaped piggy bank; the halsey character has a snow globe of the matterhorn. That leaves dickson convinced she was jones ' muse, though she says she wants nothing from him. Rather, she says she's speaking out to lend credence to the idea of repressed memories. For 23 years, dickson says she repressed various conversations with jones, including one in 1992 in which jones allegedly told her she inspired two of his video game characters. It was during that conversation that dickson says she realized jones was only using her. \" i shut down at that point and had a panic attack, \" she says. She notes the memories only resurfaced through therapy last year.",

According to the stephenville empire-tribune, state authorities were investigating bryant for allegedly cheating on his continuing education training by having a deputy take a course for him. Documents obtained by the paper state that bryant was one of 190 texas law enforcement personnel reprimanded earlier this year for failing to complete the 40 hours of training intended to keep them up to date with changes in the law. Bryant, sheriff since 1997, was re-elected this year with around 70 % of the vote. The texas rangers division of the state's department of public safety say the death is being investigated.

He tried to get permission from the nfl to accessorize with pink for the entirety of this season — a request that's been denied due to the league's uniform rules; his hair, dyed pink at the tips, apparently does not violate those rules. \" pink is not a color, it's a culture to me, \" he says in the video, which is accompanied on twitter by the hashtag #weareinthistogether.

( still, he's \" glad to be home. \" ) some related reading: an innovative music fan filed what boing boing calls \" the best foia ever \" over the $ 2 million wu-tang clan album that shkreli famously bought. The fan was hoping that the fbi had seized the never-heard album during the arrest, and that he could then make it public through his freedom-of-information request. Sadly, it turns out the fbi didn't seize it. But maybe there's still hope for the album? vice floats some possibilities. As for the charges shkreli faces, they don't involve his price-hiking strategies; he's essentially accused of running a \" [ ponzi ] scheme during his early adventures in the worlds of hedge funds and, eventually, pharma, \" according to this slate explainer. His alleged partner in crime, lawyer evan greebel, helped the winklevoss twins start an exchange fund for bitcoin, notes the wall street journal. Shkreli seems to have been \" surprisingly good at fraud, \" observes this analysis of the sec case at bloomberg. But another analysis at the los angeles times thinks the case shows that shkreli was \" an investment hotshot who couldn't get anything right. \" thursday's big theme on twitter after the arrest was \" schadenfreude, \" says this salon roundup.

Mary ella \" mae \" purvis was due in september, but a 27-week doctor visit in june revealed that the 29-year-old mom-to-be had elevated blood pressure. Doctors at savannah's memorial health university medical center diagnosed her with preeclampsia, and an ultrasound showed the blood flow had been cut off to the placenta. Doctors decided an emergency c-section was needed. Mae was born safely on june 16, weighing 2 pounds 8 ounces — but purvis'doctor also discovered that the \" cysts \" that they had been monitoring were something else entirely. Purvis writes that her doctors initially thought the cysts \" were of no concern \" and were even \" getting smaller. \" immediately after birth, two sizable tumors and much of purvis ' ovaries were removed, and even then \" we were initially assured that it would most likely not be anything to worry about. \" the prognosis came back four weeks later: ovarian cancer. Though it was a rare form, purvis learned that the rate of successful treatment is \" higher. \" what followed was chemotherapy — four rounds, with two more to come. She ' ll then have a hysterectomy, and, hopefully, return to teaching around the new year.

A year after the survey began, just 11 % of participants thought homosexual sex was a-ok. By 1990, that figure had barely risen to 13 %. As of 2014, however, 49 % said \" sexual relations between two adults of the same sex \" was \" not wrong at all, \" researchers explain in archives of sexual behavior, per nbc news. Young americans aged 18 and 19 were much more accepting, with 63 % agreeing with the above statement. Though there was \" little consistent change in those having sex exclusively with same-sex partners, \" the change in sentiment is apparently encouraging more americans to change it up between the sheets, researchers say. Those who reported having at least one same-sex partner as an adult doubled between the early 1990s and early 2010s from 3.6 % to 8.7 % for women and 4.5 % to 8.2 % for men. The jump was even larger among whites and those in the south and midwest. The number of americans engaging in bisexual behavior rose from 3.1 % to 7.7 %. \" these large shifts in both attitudes and behavior occurred over just 25 years, suggesting rapid cultural change, \" a study author says, per the huffington post. \" americans now feel more free to have sexual experiences they desire. \" one interesting tidbit: women — particularly millennials — were most likely to have a same-sex experience at a young age, \" suggesting there is some truth to the idea that some women are ' lesbian until graduation, ' \" a researcher says. No such trend was seen among men. ( this study found almost a third of young americans are bisexual. )",

Mcauliffe broke that silence today, saying, \" although the battle flag is not flown here on capitol square, it has been the subject of considerable controversy, and it divides many of our people, \" per the post. His decision to ditch the plates also comes a week after the supreme court decided texas could get rid of its license plates bearing confederate symbols because the plates are state owned. Sen.

Gawker just went all woodward and bernstein on donald trump's \" inscrutable hairdo. \" a tipster, french patents, multiple lawsuits, an archived website, and more have led the ashley feinberg to pen a 3,479-word piece that is \" perhaps the first plausible \" answer \" to the riddle of donald trump's hair. \" that answer is, essentially, a $ 60,000 weave. The trail starts with a customer ( that tipster ) of ivari international telling gawker that trump was also a client. Ivari international specializes in \" microcylinder intervention. \" these microcylinders are made of strands of donor hair that \" mingle with your own hair \" after being attached with thread and small metal clamps. In 2007, the treatment cost $ 60,000 and required near-monthly maintenance for up to $ 3,000 a pop. Strengthening the source's claims: in 1997, the ivari international website listed trump tower as its new york city location. What's more, it claimed to be located on the 25th floor, home to trump's offices and apparently nothing else. While ivari international continues to exist, its only public location is in paris, though it appears difficult to impossible to actually get an appointment. Gawker says it's possible the whole enterprise is kept afloat by \" mega-client \" trump. Ivari international and its founder, edward ivari, have been the subject of multiple lawsuits. In one, a judge called the results of microcylinder intervention \" exorbitantly priced hairpieces \" and the \" functional equivalent of wigs. \" another suit alleged ivari basically held a client's hair hostage while demanding loans between $ 250,000 and $ 1 million for \" various highly suspicious and illegal operations. \" read the entire hair-raising story here.

Massey energy co. Could have prevented the west virginia mine explosion that killed 29 workers last year and the company failed to disclose some hazards in reports it provided to government inspectors, federal safety officials said wednesday. Patricia smith, the u.s. Labor department's top lawyer, said not recording hazards where required was a potential criminal violation of the mine act and \" we have notified the u.s. Attorney of that. \" the justice department's probe of the accident is continuing, it said recently. Its investigation has so far resulted in a criminal indictment against the former head of safety at the upper big branch mine for allegedly attempting to destroy evidence. He has pleaded not guilty. The april 2010 explosion at massey's upper big branch mine in montcoal, w.va., was the worst u.s. Coal-mining disaster in 40 years. It resulted in several wrongful-death lawsuits against massey and led to the resignation of the company's chief executive and the sale of massey to alpha natural resources inc. Of abingdon, va.

        "summary": "Could ethanol someday essentially be produced out of thin air? a group of scientists has published research in nature detailing a new method of making ethanol out of carbon monoxide gas, instead of corn or sugarcane, reuters reports. Researchers saturated water with the gas, then zapped it with a novel device featuring two electrodes, one made of what they're calling \" oxide-derived copper, \" to convert it into fuel. \" i emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today, \" lead researcher matthew kanan says. He expects to have a prototype device ready in two to three years. The environmental implications are profound. Critics of ethanol say it drives up food prices and consumes loads of land and water. It can take more than 800 gallons of water to grow enough corn to make 3 gallons of ethanol, phys.org points out. What's more, researchers envision a two-step process in which the carbon monoxide is derived from carbon dioxide in the air, providing an \" economic incentive \" for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere, the mit technology review reports. The new process could also work on a far smaller scale than biomass methods; the review envisions rooftop solar panels generating fuel that's kept in water heater-sized tanks.

Using data from the society of thoracic surgeons — which encourages hospitals to self-report on its website — cnn figured out that death rates among all 109 hospitals range from 1.4 % to a disconcerting 12.1 %. \" some surgeons have impeccable records, and some have patterns of complications that are outrageous, \" says a professor of surgery at johns hopkins university school.

        "summary": "Martin pistorius was a kid so into electronics his mom had no doubts about his ability to fix a broken plug for her when he wasn't yet 11 ( which he did ). But shortly after turning 12 in january 1988, things changed. He started sleeping more, barely eating, and ultimately effectively disappeared, unable to move or talk. The daily mail reports he was treated for cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculosis, but a final diagnosis was never determined. As npr's new program invisibilia reports, his parents were told \" he's a vegetable. \" and for much of the decade-plus he spent in that state, pistorius was treated like one. He passed his days at a care center, turned toward a television that played hours of barney and friends reruns. \" i cannot even express to you how much i hated barney, \" explains pistorius — yes, pistorius, who was fully aware for most of those years, even the moment when his despairing mother said to him \" i hope you die. \" he tells his story to npr via a keyboard that allows him to select words on a computer that communicates them. He believes he \" woke up \" sometime between ages 14 and 16, likening the experience to seeing a blurry image that slowly comes into focus. After realizing he couldn't communicate with the world, he was first dogged by a stream of awful thoughts ( \" alone forever \"... \" you will never get out \" ), then trained himself to be detached from them, taking him to a \" dark place [ where ] you are allowing yourself to vanish. \" but then those hours of barney began driving him mad, so he began studying the sun and its shadows in the room in an effort to determine what time of day it was. As npr host lulu miller puts it, \" it was his first semblance of control.... Life began to have purpose. \" as time passed, his faculties slightly returned: he could sit upright, for instance. At the urging of a worker at the center, he was assessed by a communication center at the university of pretoria in july 2001. His family became aware he was aware; his mother quit her job and spent hours a day working with him. The washington post reports he's now 39, married, and living in harlow, england. He published a memoir in 2011.",

Reuters/gary cameron earlier this month north korea said it had conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ), and that it had mastered the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on the missile. But general paul selva, speaking before the senate armed services committee, said the july 4th test stopped short of showing north korea had \"the capacity to strike the united states with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success. \"",
            "The second-highest ranking military officer in the u.s. Told congress on tuesday that while north korea \" clearly \" has missiles with the capability to reach the united states, it does not have the capacity to strike accurately or successfully. On july 4, north korea successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ), which traveled into a high-altitude trajectory of 1,730 miles and flew horizontally about 575 miles into the sea of japan. \" i... Am not sanguine that the test on the fourth of july demonstrates that they have the capacity to strike the united states with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success, \" gen. Paul selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the senate armed services committee. \" on range, they clearly have the capability, \" he added.

        "summary": "You have until tomorrow to vote on the winner of this year's \" america's best restroom \" contest, but rick paulas has news for you — nearly all of the bathrooms in america are complete failures. He runs down his reasoning at pacific standard: the toilet: it's actually easier on our bodies to defecate in a squatting position, rather than hunching over, which tends to \" kink \" up the works, garden-hose-style. ( one study found that while it takes squatters an average of just 51 seconds to have a bowel movement, it takes people in the hunched-over posture 2 minutes and 10 seconds. ) rather than creating products you can buy to fix this problem, why not redesign the toilet itself? the sink: its entire purpose is to clean your hands, yet it quickly and easily becomes dirty itself. In 1976, a cornell professor named alexander kira published a treatise on the bathroom, and he suggests a different sink design that would eliminate this problem. He also calls for higher sinks that we don't have to bend over to use. The toilet paper: it's time, paulas argues, for the bidet to catch on in the us as it's already done overseas. For one thing, it does a better job of cleaning up; for another, you actually use less water when you use a bidet, because of how much water is required to make tp. The bath or shower: or, more accurately, the lack thereof in most public restrooms. What with water and money both currently in short supply, \" a return to public bathing [ is ] more an inevitability than a possibility, \" paulas writes. Click for his complete column.",

In a recent gettysburg national military park blog post, park ranger maria brady describes how the park sometimes receives packages of stones from people who took them from the site of the pivotal civil war battle — only to have their lives fall apart. \" we didn't know how the removal of the stones would affect our lives, and we didn't know they were cursed, \" wrote one man who sent back three small stones earlier this year. He wrote that soon after he visited gettysburg with his wife and took the stones, he lost his wife, his son, and his house — and ended up in prison for nine years. Upon his release, he found the stones and remembered reading in prison that they were cursed. Another tale of woe came from a man who returned a stone and small twig, saying he wanted them to be put back \" on top of the devil's den area \" where he found them nine years of \" nothing but horrible times \" earlier, the evening sun reports. Brady says that curses aside, taking rocks from gettysburg is not only illegal, it's a practice that could destroy the park's historic stone walls, many of which existed before the battle or \" were thrown up in haste by soldiers looking for cover. \" she says the people who took the rocks would have been fined $ 100 if they were caught, which \" they may have preferred \" to the misfortunes they experienced. If you have any cursed rocks you want to return, the gettysburg address you need is: 1195 baltimore street, gettysburg, pa 17325.

One paper that simply repeated the phrase \" get me off your f --- ing mailing list \" ad nauseam was accepted by the open-access journal of advanced computer technology in 2014. In this case, bartneck may have simply scammed a scam; one commenter on his blog says the conference isn't legit and only exists to \" phish larger conference fees. \" the christian science monitor agrees that, \" between its poorly designed website, open calls for abstracts, and vague location, the conference smacks of a scam. \" bartneck says it does indeed smell like \" a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science, \" but he's tempted to ask for the reviewers ' comments for a laugh.
