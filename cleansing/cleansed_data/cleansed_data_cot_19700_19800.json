        "summary": "This year's respect for the aged day in japan is fast approaching, but this time the country's government won't be commemorating the september holiday with its usual wares. Every year since 1963, japan's newly inducted centenarians have received a sakazuki, a special commemorative silver sake cup ( estimated value: about $ 65 each, per the bbc ). But with so many people now reaching that milestone, the government is considering downgrading the gift to save money — or dumping the idea altogether, kyodo reports. Last year the cups, which are meant to thank these super-seniors for their contributions to society, cost the government $ 2.1 million — a large figure that raises even more eyebrows once you consider some of the recipients die before they even receive their gifts, the guardian points out. While the japanese enjoy one of the world's longest life spans — an average of nearly 87 years for women, 80 years for men, per kyodo — that's a big part of the problem: there were only 153 centenarians to hand sake cups to in 1963, but that number grew to around 59,000 last year and is expected to rise even more this time around, which will make it the 45th consecutive record-breaking year for the 100-and-over set, per asahi shimbun. The japanese government tried to cut costs on the sake cups a few years back by reducing the cup's diameter, but it's now considering more drastic measures, including using a cheaper material, producing an entirely different type of gift, or simply sending a congratulatory letter, per the guardian. \" we are reviewing it, but we have not made any firm decisions, \" a health ministry official tells afp.

In a new study in the journal jama psychiatry, researchers explain how they crunched data from 53,000 army soldiers who were hospitalized between 2004 and 2009 with some kind of psychiatric disorder. Those who were deemed high risk, about 5 % of the sample, were 15 times more likely to commit suicide in the year following their discharge than others in the group. Among the telltale traits were obvious ones such as a previous suicide attempt or access to guns, but also things such as enlisting after the age of 26 and having a higher iq. \"there's this group that comes to the army later in life — they're smart, they have skills, they tend not to be married and they have no career or have left a career to join, \" the harvard professor who led the study tells the new york times. \"we don't know why they should be at higher risk, but they appear to be. \" an army spokesman says more study is needed before the model is used as standard procedure, citing \" complex privacy and ethical concerns, \" reports usa today.

            "It may be possible to identify which army soldiers are at high risk for suicide by using a new mathematical model, a new study suggests. Researchers analyzed information from more than 40,000 army soldiers who were hospitalized for a psychiatric condition between 2004 and 2009. It's known that people who are admitted to hospitals with a psychiatric diagnosis are at increased risk for suicide after they are released. But even among this high-risk group, suicide is relatively uncommon, and so it would not be practical for everyone released from a psychiatric hospitalization to undergo an intensive suicide prevention program, the researchers said. It would be more feasible to target intensive programs to those most at risk for suicide. In the new study, 68 soldiers died by suicide within a year of being released from the hospital. That translates to a rate of 264 suicides per 100,000 hospitalized soldiers per year, compared with the rate of 18.5 suicides per 100,000 soldiers per year among all u.s. Army soldiers.

A mexican judge has ruled that guzman, who was recaptured in january after a stunning 2015 prison breakout, can be extradited to the states. If that happens, officials say he ' ll go to brooklyn on federal charges — but his extradition isn't a slam dunk. As the new york times explains, the ministry of foreign relations in mexico first has to approve the move over the next 30 days. \" the ball is now in the foreign ministry's court and they have a month to execute the process or not, \" says a spokesman for the mexican judiciary. \" they have been notified and received the file. \" \" there is nothing, legally speaking that could impede the extradition, from the judicial system point of view, \" adds the spokesman. But one of guzman's attorneys calls the move a human rights violation and says there are nine appeals pending against it, reuters reports. Government officials say it's mostly a political decision and will depend on president enrique peña nieto. Meanwhile, guzman was transferred over the weekend to a prison in ciudad juárez, a city just south of el paso along the texas border. Why isn't clear, but the move might ease his eventual extradition; it also comes a month after guzman's top lawyer complained that conditions at altiplano lockup in central mexico were making guzman ill.",

        "summary": "After failing to do away with the affordable care act earlier this year, republicans will now try to kill two birds with one stone by adding a partial obamacare repeal to their tax package, the wall street journal reports. Sen. Mitch mcconnell says getting rid of the aca's mandate that most americans purchase health insurance will be part of the tax package being unveiled tuesday. According to the washington post, mcconnell says he's \" optimistic \" that adding the mandate repeal to the tax package will \" be helpful. \" and republican sen. John thune says the money saved from getting rid of the mandate will be put toward lowering taxes for the middle class. Those savings, approximately $ 338 billion over a decade, would come from the government not paying subsidies to help some low and middle-income people buy insurance, the los angeles times reports. While mcconnell may be optimistic, the move could cost the tax package the support of some republican lawmakers who opposed the aca repeal earlier this year. A cbo estimate found that getting rid of the mandate will increase the number of uninsured americans by 13 million over the next decade, and premiums for everyone else would rise about 10 % in most years. Democratic sen. Ron wyden says americans will be losing their insurance or paying more for it \" all to pay for more tax breaks for multinationals. \" the insurance industry and medical groups, including america's health insurance plans, the blue cross blue shield association, and the american medical association, wrote to congress on tuesday asking it to preserve the mandate.",

The package is expected to be released later tuesday. Gop senate members met to discuss the repeal measure, which president donald trump has said should be part of the tax plan....",
            "Senate republican leaders moved tuesday to include a repeal of the affordable care act's individual mandate in their tax bill, a major change of strategy as they try to accomplish two of their top domestic priorities in a single piece of legislation. They also announced that the individual tax cuts in the plan would be made temporary, expiring at the end of 2025 to comply with senate rules limiting the impact of legislation on the long-term deficit. A corporate tax cut, reducing the rate from 35 to 20 percent, would be left permanent. The changes introduce volatile variables into what was already a challenging political enterprise for republicans. And it's unclear whether they will help or hurt the bill's chances. Repealing the mandate, which compels most americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine, would free up more than $ 300 billion in government funding over the next decade that republicans could use to finance their proposed tax cuts, but it would result in 13 million fewer people having health insurance, according to projections from the nonpartisan congressional budget office. The cbo has also projected that repealing the individual mandate would drive up insurance premiums for many americans by roughly 10 percent. Eliminating the individual mandate and having far fewer people signed up for insurance saves money because many of those people receive federal subsidies to buy coverage. Senate leaders are using those savings to address the concerns of anxious members from across their caucus who complained that the tax plan's benefits for the middle class were too modest compared with benefits received by the wealthy and corporations. Changes to the bill released tuesday night by the senate finance committee indicated that the savings would be used in part to allow individuals to claim a larger $ 2,000 child tax credit, a priority of ivanka trump, the president's daughter. They would also be used to modestly reduce income tax rates for middle-income taxpayers. Senate republicans also are seeking to deliver expanded benefits to \" pass-through \" firms that send profits to their owners to be taxed as individual income. \" we're optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful, \" senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) said tuesday after meeting with party members during a closed-door lunch.

Moore — who described his job as checking ids for entrance into the white house — apparently failed to realize even after he had been suspended that the person he had been communicating with was an undercover agent, the new york daily news reports: hours before he surrendered on monday, he told the officer they would have to stop chatting online.

The deficit for the 2014 fiscal year beginning in october would drop to $ 744 billion, the smallest since 2008, according to administration projections. Still, that's bigger than the cbo-projected $ 616 billion, the washington post notes. Some $ 50 billion in infrastructure spending. The $ 40 billion \" fix it first \" project would go toward improving roads and bridges, as well as public transit and airports. The budget also sets aside some $ 1 billion for institutes to push manufacturing innovation. A call for preschool for all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families, paid for by a tobacco tax hike. Deduction limits for the wealthiest 2 % of families, bringing in $ 580 billion, plus the \" buffett rule \": families making more than $ 1 million would have to pay at least 30 % of their incomes in tax. Defense spending cuts of $ 100 billion, $ 400 billion in cuts to medicare over a decade, and reduction of farm subsidies and retiree programs, resulting in $ 200 billion saved.

            "President obama found himself weathering bipartisan broadsides wednesday as he sent congress his 2014 budget proposal, which in its effort to please both sides of the aisle has ended up angering both. The budget arrived on capitol hill wednesday morning, delivered 65 days after the legal deadline. The $ 3.77 trillion spending plan, which is over 2,000 pages, tries to curb deficits by further raising taxes on top earners and reining in the growth of social security. Obama called his plan \" a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle class jobs and growth, \" during remarks he made wednesday morning in the white house rose garden. \" if you're serious about deficit reduction, then there's no excuse to keep these loopholes open, \" he said.

( the washington post ) in the first budget of his second term, president obama set aside the grand ambitions that marked his early days in office and sent congress a blueprint aimed at achieving a simple goal: ending the long partisan standoff over the national debt. The 10-year budget request obama unveiled wednesday calls for nearly $ 300 billion in new spending on jobs and public works.

Some 54 % would opt for the former imf chief currently charged with attempted rape, according to the independent, which notes that the result is almost certainly due to an \" anyone but sarko \" sentiment instead of a surge of support for dsk — despite the hopes of his supporters. Another poll found that 61 % of french voters wouldn't want strauss-kahn to run for president even if he is cleared of charges of sexual assault and attempted rape. Even if the socialist party decides to extend the primary nomination deadline to give strauss-kahn a chance, the former front-runner would likely struggle to beat current and former party leaders martine aubry and francois hollande, the bbc notes.",

That fact alone should mean a mood of eager confidence. In theory, the socialists are poised to retake power from the right after a gap of 17 years. But something is not quite right, and the socialists themselves feel it. Deep down they know that the struggle to unseat president nicolas sarkozy will be much harder than they thought. As nominations close on wednesday for the october primary, all eyes are on two frontrunners: the current and former party leaders martine aubry and francois hollande. There are four other declared candidates: segolene royal, who lost against mr sarkozy in 2002; two leaders of the younger generation, manuel valls and arnaud montebourg; and the head of the radical left party, jean-michel baylet. In addition there is the great might-have-been across the atlantic. Dominique strauss-kahn, disgraced then partially rehabilitated in the new york chambermaid scandal, cannot be ruled out as a last-minute entrant.

That's an absurd-sounding 99.72 % discount on the phone's original price of $ 350.99. \" promotional pricing is common in the mobile industry, \" argues htc, which is true, but as mashable points out, 99 % discounts are not. For its part, facebook is keeping its head held high, even promoting the deal on its own, er, facebook page. In other struggling smart phone news, the once-mighty nokia has just released its $ 99 asha phone, made for indian and other \" emerging \" markets, in an effort to reclaim some of its former market share, the wall street journal reports. The company says the phone is targeted at \" young, socially inspired \" people, whatever that means, and offers limited smart phone functionality like social media apps and a touch screen. India is the second-largest phone market in the world, but nokia has been losing ground to local competitors, says reuters — from a 50 % share three years ago to 23 % today.",

It surrounds india's first female tv mogul, indrani mukerjea, whose 25-year-old daughter, sheena bora, vanished in 2012. Mukerjea said bora disappeared while studying in the us. However, her burnt remains were found in a raigad forest and mukerjea is now accused of her murder, per the times of india; police say two accomplices have confessed; one is reportedly mukerjea's chauffeur, who allegedly said he was paid $ 1,500 and bought containers of gas around the time, reports the indian express. Police say mukerjea operated social media and email accounts in bora's name throughout 2012 to make it look like she was in the us and allege she also tried to kill son mikhail bora with poison in 2012, the indian express reports; he survived. Police tell india today that sheena bora was getting \" greedy, \" asking her mother for money, and that mukerjea finally had enough. Media outlets, now investing in what a former employee calls a \" tabloid gold mine, \" say the case shows the damage done by materialism. Born to a middle-class family, mukerjea married mumbai-based media tycoon peter mukerjea after her first marriage and together they started a tv network, per the guardian. They lived in one of the city's most exclusive areas and by 2008, mukerjea had landed on the wall street journal's 50 \" women to watch \" list, notes the guardian. Dilip bobb, writing in outlook magazine, calls her \" the female equivalent of jay gatsby, \" whose life is \" illustrative of the social mores and motivations in the upper reaches of indian society. \" ( in georgia, two brothers are accused of trying to kill their parents — for reasons unknown. )",

The test is assumed to have taken place on friday near sinpo south shipyard on the east coast. Kcna said in a separate report that kim visited a fishery complex at the shipyard on the same day. Intelligence sources in seoul and washington believe the north is developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile ( slbm ) that could pose a new threat to the korean peninsula. The sources believe the north has installed the missile launcher on the submarine ― which is believed to weigh about 2,500 tons ― after several land-based and underwater tests. North korean observers fear that pyongyang may be planning to equip the missiles with miniature nuclear bombs.

Researchers from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and boeing teamed up to locate the uss independence, an aircraft carrier that saw action in the war and then became a nuclear lab rat of sorts, reports nbc news. The navy scuttled the ship itself, and the search team used 3d sonar to discover it \" amazingly intact \" on the ocean floor in the gulf of the farallones — maybe even with a plane on top. After its military service from 1943-45, the independence joined a flotilla of ships that was deliberately blasted with radiation in nuclear tests in the bikini atoll. The navy then brought it to a shipyard san francisco to study how it fared, before towing it out to sea in 1951 and sinking it. \" this ship is an evocative artifact of the dawn of the atomic age, when we began to learn the nature of the genie we'd uncorked from the bottle, \" says the noaa's james delgado.

Upon returning to the mansion, knapic claims to have found it littered with enema kits and sexual devices, along with unfortunate stains all over the house. In the suit, knapic claims that a woman identifying herself as \"anna \" said she wanted to rent the property for vacation with a group of friends. In reality, according to the suit, anna was andrei treivas — aka michael lucas — a porn actor, director, and producer. Treivas, knapic claims, said he was anna's brother-in-law when picking up the keys for the mansion. Knapic has since had the linens replaced, the hot tub drained and bleached, the walls repainted, and pretty much everything else shampooed and steam-cleaned. She is seeking unspecified monetary damages, and she wants to prevent treivas from distributing the porno filmed at the mansion.

Out of the dirt came... A roughly 250-year-old pretzel. \" this is definitely the oldest pretzel ever found, \" silvia codreanau-windauer of the bavarian bureau for the conservation of historic monuments said in announcing the \" archaeological sensation. \" remnants of a bread roll and croissant were also found nearby, \" suggesting that someone missed out on quite the historical breakfast buffet in the 18th century, \" the local quips. In reality, the meal probably wouldn't have been so tasty back then: researchers say the food is so well-preserved because it was originally burnt, and they speculate that a baker threw out the creations in frustration. Carbon dating placed the items in the 1700 to 1800 time period. \" this discovery is really extraordinary, because it depicts a snippet of everyday life, \" regensburg's mayor says. The bavarian state's pretzel last year secured a place on the eu's \" protected origins \" list, which nbc news explains means only pretzels made there can be labeled \" bayerische brezn \" ( \" bavarian pretzel \" ).

            "Small pieces of burnt bread, discovered in a pit at yarnton in oxfordshire, uk, have been dated and found to be 5,500 years old. This makes the neolithic bread the oldest ever found in britain. The pieces turned up when the soil from the recently-excavated pit was mixed with water, allowing light material to float and be removed. Initially, the burnt fragments were mistaken for pieces of wood charcoal, but when dr mark robinson from the oxford university museum examined them through a microscope, he could clearly see partially crushed grains of barley. The material was analysed at the oxford university radiocarbon accelerator unit and at rafter radiocarbon laboratory, new zealand. From the amount of radioactive carbon in the sample, it is estimated that the bread was baked between 3,620 - 3,350 bc. A flint knife was also found in the pit, along with over 200 flint flakes, some of which had been sharpened and serrated. Crumbs of pottery were also discovered, along with hazelnut shells and apple cores. Archaeologists speculate that it may have been a rubbish deposit, but the presence of a knife in good condition and the bread suggests it was a religious offering. The bread was made by the first farmers to arrive in central england having migrated from mainland europe. They cleared the extensive forests and planted wheat and barley as well"

        "summary": "Americans and their sensitive bellies bought $ 10.5 billion worth of gluten-free food products in 2013, but a new study indicates that, with the exception of people with celiac disease, the real gastrointestinal culprit may be something else entirely. Instead of gluten — a protein found in cereal grains like wheat and rye — researchers peter gibson and jessica biesiekierski are pointing the finger at short-chain carbs known as fodmaps. The fact that gibson and biesiekierski are behind the assertion is notable: their 2011 research tied gluten to gastrointestinal distress in people without celiac disease, and helped spur the gluten-free trend, reports real clear science. But lacking an understanding of why gluten caused these reactions, they repeated the experiment in an even more exacting fashion: participants were provided with every single meal, which was free of anything that could cause gastrointestinal distress, from lactose to preservatives. What they found ( the results were actually published a year ago ) was that the presence or absence of gluten wasn't a reliable trigger, but fodmaps — npr specifically calls out the fodmap fructan, which just so happens to be found in wheat — may very well be. Says biesiekierski of the study's participants, \" reduction of fodmaps in their diets uniformly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms. \" for those who want to try a low-fodmap diet, the daily mail has a guide to foods that are high and low in them.",

            "Objectives: despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. Methods: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. Results: a total of 34 patients ( aged 29-59 years, 4 men ) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56 %",
            "In 2011, peter gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at monash university and director of the gi unit at the alfred hospital in melbourne, australia, published a study that found gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley, to cause gastrointestinal distress in patients without celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder unequivocally triggered by gluten. Double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled, the experiment was one of the strongest pieces of evidence to date that non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( ncgs ), more commonly known as gluten intolerance, is a genuine condition.

            "Objectives: despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac individuals and to examine the mechanism. Methods: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored. Results: a total of 34 patients ( aged 29-59 years, 4 men ) completed the study as per protocol. Overall, 56 %",
            "In 2011, peter gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at monash university and director of the gi unit at the alfred hospital in melbourne, australia, published a study that found gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley, to cause gastrointestinal distress in patients without celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder unequivocally triggered by gluten. Double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled, the experiment was one of the strongest pieces of evidence to date that non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( ncgs ), more commonly known as gluten intolerance, is a genuine condition. By extension, the study also lent credibility to the meteoric rise of the gluten-free diet.

Advertisement the space rock, known by the very dull name of 2014 jo25 will safely fly by earth on april 19, according to nasa. The chances of it pounding our planet and leaving us for the dead? zero, experts say. \" although there is no possibility for the asteroid to collide with our planet, this will be a very close approach for an asteroid of this size, \" nasa said in a statement. What size are we talking about? measurements taken by nasa's neowise space probe indicate the asteroid is about 2,000 feet ( 650 meters ) in size. That's about 670 yards ( 613 meters ), or about the length of six nfl football fields. And how close is \" very close \"? nasa says this rock will come about 1.1 million miles ( 1.8 million kilometers ) from earth. That's about 4.6 times the distance from earth to the moon. The moon, by the way, is about 239,000 miles ( 384,400 kilometers ) from earth. While several small asteroids pass within this distance of earth a few times a week, this is the closest by any known asteroid of this size or bigger in 13 years -- since asteroid toutatis in 2004, according to the space agency. Can you see asteroid 2014 jo25? well, maybe. This asteroid has a reflective surface and you might be able to see it with a telescope. \" the asteroid will approach earth from the direction of the sun and will become visible in the night sky after april 19, \" nasa said. If you don't have your own telescope, you can watch the asteroid online. Astronomers discovered 2014 j025 three years ago ( you guessed it in 2014 ). This will be its closest encounter with earth for the last 400 years. Nasa said telescopes around the world will be trained on it during the flyby to try to learn more about it. \" radar observations are planned at nasa's goldstone solar system radar in california and the national science foundation's arecibo observatory in puerto rico, and the resulting radar images could reveal surface details as small as a few meters, \" nasa said. If you head out to try to spot the asteroid, you might also want to check",

In a telegraph op-ed, johnson argued the face-covering veil shouldn't be banned in britain as it is in denmark, but had unkind words for female wearers. It's \" absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes … looking like a bank robber, \" johnson wrote, per the globe and mail. After dozens of complaints, an independent panel is investigating whether his comments violated the conservative party's code of conduct, which says mps should \" foster respect and tolerance \" and avoid using their position \" to bully, abuse, victimize, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others, \" reports the bbc. Though she avoided describing the comments as islamophobic, prime minister theresa may was among the first to rebuke johnson for language that \" offended people. \" she's called on him to apologize, as has party chairman brandon lewis, among others. Johnson, believed to be vacationing in europe, has yet to do so. Some suggest that's because the possible candidate for future party leader meant to appeal to right-wing voters. \" i sincerely hope that he doesn't continue to use muslim women as a convenient political football to try and increase his poll ratings, \" former tory chairman sayeeda warsi tells the guardian.

But why is it that covering up our eyes creates this effect? believe it or not, there is an expert on the topic ( it was the subject of her phd ), and uk professor vanessa brown explains the situation to science of us. The guardian notes brown's research spun out of her catching sight of her own reflection one day — walking into a supermarket in scruffy painting clothes but looking, she believed \" quite cool, \" thanks to her sunglasses. That may be because, first of all, symmetry makes us look better, and sunglasses hide asymmetry around our eyes. They also suggest a more attractive bone structure: one that's \" chiseled \" rather than \" soft. \" sunglasses also add an air of mystery. \" the eyes are such a tremendous source of information, \" observes brown, and without a way to view them, others are shielded from making judgements about what we're thinking or feeling — or even how intelligent we are. ( plus, science of us notes that research suggests mystery is hot. ) finally, brown points to history: in their initial early-20th-century days, sunglasses were donned by daring aviators and athletes; in the ' 50s and ' 60s, hollywood stars wore them in hopes of avoiding recognition. We still attribute that glamor to them. These days not only can shades make the wearer look cooler to the world — they can also make the world look cooler to the wearer.

The women of the wall organization has sought equal prayer rights at the sacred jewish site for 27 years, the guardian reports. \" we were the catalyst for something revolutionary, \" the group's chairwoman tells the new york times, adding that approval of the new prayer space amounts to an acknowledgment \" that there is more than one way to be jewish. \" currently the western wall ( or kotel in hebrew ) has segregated prayer areas for men and women, per the times. The site — the last remnant of the retaining wall of the temple mount — is managed by rabbi shmuel rabinowitz of the orthodox rabbinate.

Researchers took hundreds of infants between 4 and 11 months old considered at high risk of developing peanut allergy and split them into two groups, with one group avoiding peanuts entirely and the other group eating peanut products three times a week. By the time they were 5 years old, less than 1 % of the peanut-eating group had developed a peanut allergy, compared to 17.3 % of the peanut-avoiding group, king's college london says in a press release. But while experts say the results — which they categorize as \" without precedent \" — are a major breakthrough, they warn parents that the children in the study were skin-tested first to make sure they didn't have a life-threatening reaction to the peanuts. They also stress that peanuts are a choking hazard, so infants should have products like peanut butter instead, the ap reports. But even among infants who reacted to peanuts on the skin test, researchers found that only 11 % of peanut eaters developed the allergy, compared to 35 % of those who avoided peanuts. Despite the promising results, it may be hard to change the habits of parents who have the \" highest fear of introducing peanuts, \" a northwestern university professor of pediatrics tells the new york times.

The judge in the case asked the maricopa county sheriff's office if armendariz might have been \" shaking down \" illegal immigrants. \" that is part of our understanding, \" chief deputy jerry sheridan replied. \" he very well could have. What's mysterious to me is why we didn't get any complaints from those people. \" armendariz was involved in a nine-hour stand-off with police after being arrested on drug charges on may 1, resigned from the department on may 2, and was found dead on may 8, after apparently hanging himself.",

As the ap sees it, the spy chief was senior enough to convey a message of respect, but was able to beg off from any unrelated political demands by north korea. At 38 north, robert carlin puts it slightly differently: \" it may be that the decision to send clapper has mostly to do with allegorical concerns on both sides — the north wanted someone ' high level, ' but the obama administration did not want anyone of political consequence, and so clapper was picked as the lowest common denominator. \" meanwhile, dennis rodman is, not exactly surprisingly, taking some of the credit.",

The state's \" personhood \" debate has even divided conservatives, christians, and, in tupelo, two obstetrician-gynecologists who are partners in a medical practice and who both consider themselves anti-abortion, cbs finds.

( associated press ) the arrests came five months after federal authorities announced they would investigate former guards at auschwitz and other nazi-era death camps. Their effort was inspired by the precedent-setting trial of former ohio autoworker john demjanjuk, who died in 2012 in a bavarian nursing home while appealing his conviction on charges he served at the sobibor camp. \" this is a major step, \" said efraim zuroff, the head nazi hunter at the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem, when told of the arrests. \" given the advanced age of the defendants, every effort should be made to expedite their prosecution. \" ukrainian-born demjanjuk was the first person convicted in germany solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in any specific killing.

        "summary": "New research has shed a little more light on one of america's longstanding mysteries: the disappearance of more than 100 colonists on north carolina's roanoke island. The british settlers disappeared in 1590, three years after their arrival. Two hints persisted as to their fates: the word \" croatoan \" was carved on a local fort, and \" cro \" was carved into a tree, national geographic explains. A series of recent finds, however, offer more detailed clues. When researchers examined two ink and paper patches on a map by the colony's governor, they found beneath one a miniature red and blue symbol, perhaps pointing to some sort of emergency shelter, the magazine reports. \" our best idea is that parts of raleigh's exploration in north america were a state secret, and the map ' cover-up ' was an effort to keep information from the public and from foreign agents, \" says a historian on the case. Experts say \" the only way ( the colonists ) could have survived \" would have been to split up. Historians long believed that many went south to what was then called croatoan island, now hatteras island — but now researchers speculate that some colonists could have joined a tribe living to the west, at the mouth of the chowan river. Researchers have been employing ground-penetrating radar in that area to test their theories, and they've found some previously-unknown structures — one of which could be a fence — underground. That would suggest colonists lived there, but it's unclear if the structures belonged to later colonists or the roanoke island crew. \" we have to go in and dig some holes, i guess, \" says a researcher.",

Cnn and the ap report that eight members of the country's emergency services team died when a national search and rescue chopper went down while on its way to help out. Injury reports are still murky, with the antara news state agency saying four tourists at the volcano were hurt during the eruption, while abc australia reports at least 10 were injured. The number of visitors at the scene at the time has been listed as being between one and two dozen. \" we were all panicking, \" one sightseer tells the jakarta post. \" it was terrifying. \" the helicopter slammed into a cliff on nearby mount butak, just three minutes before it was set to arrive at the dieng plateau, the guardian reports. Four navy officers and four rescue workers died, per an nsr director, who added the dauphin as365 made in indonesia was safe to fly. The jakarta globe, which notes the helicopter crashed at around 5pm local time, reports a group of journalists had been on board the helicopter earlier in the day, but they were dropped off at an airport before the chopper headed to the eruption site. The bodies of those who died are said to have been retrieved by their families from a semarang hospital. The volcano is closed for now to tourists due to the eruption, which antara says was caused by \" gas pressure, \" per cnn. ( there's an italian supervolcano scientists are keeping a wary eye on. )",

In brief, her seven-day experiment for vice, in which she chowed down on worms, grasshoppers, roasted crickets, black ants, and even tarantulas earned an \" absolutely awful \" rating, especially as she admits she's \" deathly afraid \" of bugs. She purchased her fare for about $ 130 from a website called edible insects, though she had to pick up her dry-roasted fly larvae — said to offer crunch to salads or pastas — from a separate maker called karma3. And, with the help of some expert advice along the way, she was off. Skujins, usually a vegan, details each day of her gastronomical journey, which initially drove her to tears after she consumed a maggot stir-fry and a cricket powder shake that tasted like sand. She got more into it as her trial continued ( the beer-battered tarantulas she cooked up were \" undeniably gourmet \" ), though her vegan sensibilities and natural revulsion to what showed up on her plate often left her feeling angry, frustrated, and hungry, as she often couldn't finish the whole dish. By the fifth day, her diary entries included \" i wish i was dead \" and \" i hate everyone \" — but she does admit to moments of \" pride \" and \" confidence \" that saw her through the weeklong experiment. Still, by the end of her attempt, \" i wasn't any closer to adopting bugs into my diet. And with that realization, i decided the world has no hope. \" chew on more of her entomological adventure here.",

        "summary": "Following chuck hagel's exit as defense secretary, the obvious question is who might replace him. One leading possibility: former undersecretary of defense for policy michèle flournoy — the defense department's highest-ranking woman ever, abc news reports. She stepped down in 2012 and now heads a nonpartisan national security think tank thought to have played a big role in president obama's policymaking, the washington post reports. Some administration officials, however, believe she has sided too readily with the uniformed military, which could lead to disagreements with the president, the post notes. But her perceived hawkishness could play well with republicans during the senate confirmation process, politico reports, and she was on obama's shortlist the last time around. Other top names in the running: former deputy defense secretary ashton carter oversaw budgeting amid tough times for the pentagon between 2011 and 2013, abc notes. He was a rhodes scholar and harvard professor, the post reports, but he hasn't been hugely influential politically. Sen. Jack reed of rhode island is set to be the democrats'top official on the armed services committee. He recently won re-election and became known after criticizing the handling of the iraq war in a response to a state of the union speech by george w. Bush. But he doesn't want the pentagon job, says a rep: he \" loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of rhode island. \" robert work is currently in the no. 2 position at the pentagon, politico notes. The retired marine colonel has dealt extensively with the department's budget, the post notes, and he has headed the same think tank flournoy now leads. And politico raises the possibility that the likes of former generals david petraeus or stanley mcchrystal could get the job. Both faced scandals before leaving their posts, but \" they command a lot of respect with the military as well as with the republicans, \" and they \" worked with ( the ) obama administration, \" says an analyst.",

Researchers on cape cod in massachusetts, setting of the movie jaws, say atlantic great whites were previously thought to be coastal huggers who migrated from maine to mexico, lead author gregory skomal tells the ap. But a study that tracked 32 sharks by satellite tag for five years found the creatures swam as far as the azores, some 2,300 miles away. Thought to be surface dwellers, the sharks in fact dive to depths of 3,700 feet, though why they do that is a mystery. \" when they're out there, they're kind of wandering, almost nomadic in behavior, \" skomal tells the boston globe. Writing in the journal marine ecology progress series, skomal's team say the results dash assumptions the sharks follow a set migration pattern. Although they stayed close to the northeast coast in summer, their whereabouts the rest of the year were not confined, as expected, to heading south to warmer waters. Skomal tells the globe younger sharks tended to stay closer to shore but would likely venture out as they got older. The findings could lead to increased protections for great whites, such as extending the 200-mile safe zone around the us coast in which it is illegal to hunt them. \" we need to engage other countries fishing in these waters to talk about putting similar protections in place, \" skomal tells the ap.

Its concerns about black unemployment are not cleaver's only frustration these days. One member of the caucus, democratic rep. Andre carson of indiana, recently said that tea party members of congress \" would love to see you and me"

The book, 13 hours, was obtained by the new york times and fox news in advance of its release. \"it had probably been 15 minutes i think, and … i just said, ' hey, you know, we gotta — we need to get over there, we're losing the initiative, ' \" one of the authors, john tiegen, tells fox. \" and bob just looks straight at me and said,'stand down, you need to wait.

Two of the commandos were killed in subsequent fighting. The book — written by five commandos with boston university journalism professor mitchell zuckoff — suggests the station chief ordered the commandos to wait because he wanted local militia to put down the attack instead, perhaps to avoid blowing the cover of the cia base. That meshes with previous accounts by us officials, but the book provides the most detail to date about the initial delay, reports the times. An intelligence official tells the newspaper that \"a prudent, fast attempt was made to rally local support for the rescue effort \" and that \" there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support. \" the book is out next week.",

            "Manuel balce ceneta/associated press months before mf global teetered on the brink, federal regulators were seeking to rein in the types of risky trades that contributed to the firm's collapse. But they faced opposition from an influential opponent: jon s. Corzine, the head of the then little-known brokerage firm. As a former united states senator and a former governor of new jersey, as well as the leader of goldman sachs in the 1990s, mr. Corzine carried significant weight in the worlds of washington and wall street. While other financial firms employed teams of lobbyists to fight the new regulation, mf global's chief executive in meetings over the last year personally pressed regulators to halt their plans. The agency proposing the rule, the commodity futures trading commission, relented. Wall street, which has been working to curb many financial regulations, won another battle.

Pablo escobar built himself a zoo in the 1980s, smuggling in a host of exotic animals, including one male and three female hippos. Now, 20 years after the drug boss's death, the hippos have found a welcoming climate — free of the drought that helps curb herd size in africa — and apparently an appetite for sex. Estimates say there are now between 50 and 60 hippos ( in 2006, the lat pegged their population at 16 ), most living in one of 12 man-made lakes at escobar's former ranch. But a dozen have been confirmed as having broken away and into the nearby magdalena river, meaning there could be many more; in 2009, one hippo was located 62 miles away. While hippos in africa tend to become sexually active as early as age seven for males and nine for females, the hippos in colombia are breeding as early as three, the bbc reports. \" it's just like this crazy wildlife experiment that we're left with, \" says a san diego university ecologist. \" gosh! i hope this goes well. \" so far, it doesn't seem to be. The beasts are terrifying fishermen, wreaking havoc on crops, and even crushing small cows. They can't be moved back to africa due to the possibility they carry disease, zoos aren't interested in the adults, a reserve with hippo-proof fences would cost about $ 500,000, and castration would be expensive and risky for both the vets and the creatures, who the ecologist notes are highly sensitive to sedation. So how would a biologist working in the amazon region solve the issue? \" i think they should barbecue them and eat them, \" he says. He isn't kidding.",

He claims members of a secretive \" knights templar \" organization in london model themselves after the fighters in their violent plots against muslims. In fact, breivik says his \" mentor \" is a member who refers to himself as richard or lionheart, an apparent reference to crusader richard the lionhearted. \"god will revive the ancient order of the knights templar and count me worthy to die amongst them in service of my god in protection of the christian and jewish world, \" writes a british blogger who calls himself lionheart, reports the telegraph. He's actually paul ray, a founding member of the right-wing english defense league who was once busted for violence-promoting hate speech, according to the newspaper. He has distanced himself from breivik, calling the killer a \" crackpot. \" breivik used the templar knights'trademark white tunic and red cross on the cover of his 1,500-word manifesto discussing his terror attack in norway, notes the washington post. Bizarrely, other new \" knights templar \" have arisen in mexico: that's the name of a new drug cartel which supposedly follows a knights ' \" code of conduct \" involving fighting poverty and upholding knightly values.",
