As a lawyer at a rhode island law firm specializing in asbestos litigation, warner says she has previously come across \" contaminated \" cosmetics and decided to check out her own daughter's makeup, purchased from a claire's store in providence, per wjar and usa today. \" you just assume that a children's product would be safe, \" says warner. Instead, a north carolina lab found the product tested positive for tremolite asbestos, as did all 17 makeup products warner later purchased from claire's stores in nine states, per wjar. Exposure to asbestos is linked to certain cancers, including mesothelioma. Though chrysolite asbestos is more common, asbestosnews.com notes that \" tremolite is just as toxic as chrysolite, if not more so, \" per the miami herald. \" the fact that the majority of the products came from the store shelves in the last two weeks means that there are other children being exposed, \" warner says. An investigation is ongoing, but claire's has announced it will recall nine products as a \" precautionary measure. \" they include multiple makeup sets, an eye shadow and lip gloss palette, and a glitter cell phone makeup compact.

Tremolite not the most common form of asbestos tremolite is not the common form of asbestos found in most of the asbestos products that were so popular during the twentieth century. There are six forms of mineral deposits that are referred to as asbestos: chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite. Chrysolite is by far the most common, comprising perhaps ninety five percent of the asbestos products found in buildings in the united states today. Ironically, chrysolite is the only form of the mineral that has curly fibers. Tremolite and the other variations are all needle-like in form, perhaps even more likely to damage lung tissue.

        "summary": "Theresa may appears set to stay on as prime minister despite the spectacular failure of her attempt to increase the conservative party's majority with an early election in the uk. The bbc reports that may, whose party lost 12 seats in parliament, leaving it without the majority needed to govern alone, is planning to form a government with northern ireland's democratic unionist party. With 326 seats needed to form a majority, the dup's 12 seats would give 330 or 331 votes on legislation, depending on how the final undeclared race turns out. The opposition labour party says it is also ready to form a minority government, though there is little chance of it forming a coalition with 326 seats. The latest: sources tell the guardian that may has cut a deal with the dup and will meet with the queen friday afternoon to confirm her plan for a new government. \" we want there to be a government. We have worked well with may. The alternative is intolerable, \" a dup source says, adding that the party will try to ensure there is a conservative prime minister as long as leftist jeremy corbyn leads the labour party. Other sources, however, tell the bbc that the dup is still examining the \" messy \" situation and talk of a coalition is premature. Corbyn's labour party came second, but vastly outperformed expectations by picking up dozens of seats and denying may a majority, reports the washington post. \" the prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate, \" corbyn told supporters, urging may to step down. \" well, the mandate she's got is lost conservative seats, lost votes, lost support, and lost confidence. \" the surprise result cast doubt both on the brexit negotiations, which are scheduled to start in just 10 days, and on plans for a second referendum on scottish independence, the ap reports. The pro-independence scottish national party lost 20 of its 54 seats. Paul nuttall, leader of the pro-brexit ukip party, resigned after losing the party's only seat in parliament. He told supporters the party has a \" great future \" as the \" guard dogs of brexit. \" the results in full can be shown here. Ukip's share of the vote is down more than 10 % since the 2015 election, which resulted in gains for both labour and the conservatives. The independent looks at the dup and the implications of the small party holding the balance of power. In northern ireland, the party has fought hard to block same-sex marriage and the lifting of the ban on abortion.",

Abc news says the gel ultimately solidifies and describes the end result as \" inaccessible for illicit use. \" research has shown that surgery patients often end up with leftover opioid painkillers and store the drugs improperly at home. Forbes cites a 2016 government survey that found 53 % of people who abuse opioids get pills from relatives or friends. Walmart says the powder also works with other prescription drugs. The company says its pharmacy customers can request a free packet at any time. ( read about how a doctor prescribed this former journalist percocet — and how it was all downhill from there. )",

As doris truong explains in the post, it began when someone posted video of an asian woman at the rex tillerson confirmation hearing on wednesday and accused her of taking photos of the secretary of state nominee's notes. Somehow, someone then decided that the woman was truong, who was not, in fact, even at the tillerson hearing. Videos like this one falsely identifying her began to spread, and conservative sites were soon demanding to know why a post editor was snooping on tillerson. The well-trafficked gateway pundit picked it up, as did the drudge report, and even sarah palin tweeted about it with the word \" busted. \" \" i ' m perplexed and, honestly, shocked by how quickly the narrative went from someone trying to identify a woman in a video to another person attaching a name to hordes seizing upon that information as the truth, \" writes truong. She and the person in the video have just one thing in common: they're both asian women, but that was apparently good enough for a positive id. Who is the actual woman? that's still unknown. Was she actually taking photos of tillerson's notes? also unclear. Truong, who was personally bombarded with angry accusations online, writes that she's not going to disengage from social media over the incident. \" but i hope the ridiculousness of what happened to me in less than 12 hours makes others think critically before sharing something that can be easily disproved. \" click for her full post.",

Jones ' video of the nov. 14 incident, which he posted yesterday, already has nearly 4 million views. It shows him prepping, then making the jump, then turning onto his back and convulsing shortly after the one-minute mark. The text under the video says the seizure started when jones tried to make a left-hand turn at 9,000 feet; he passed out and hurtled through the air until his instructor, sheldon mcfarlane, was able to reach him and pull the parachute rip cord. Jones says he regained consciousness at 3,000 feet and safely landed. \" possibly the scariest moment of my life, \" he writes under the video. Jones has epilepsy, but he had a doctor's note saying he was cleared for skydiving ( \" i'd been seizure-free for four years, \" he tells abc australia ). However, the ceo of the epilepsy association of western australia tells the station that even though people with epilepsy are usually allowed to drive if they haven't had a seizure in a year, he wouldn't recommend skydiving for someone with the condition, since such an extreme sport could be stressful enough to trigger a seizure. The one person unfazed by the incident is mcfarlane, who says even if he hadn't cloud-bounced over to jones, a remote device would have automatically pulled jones ' rip cord. \" it was fine, \" he tells the guardian. \" we don't do it all day every day, but part of our training is to look after students. \" ( a teen skydiver survived a harrowing 3,500-foot fall. )",

The 56-year-old arkansas man was drinking 16 glasses of the stuff daily, amounting to a gallon every day, the ap reports. Black tea contains a lot of a compound called oxalate, which can lead to kidney issues, livescience reports. \" with 16 cups of tea daily, the patient's daily consumption of oxalate was more than 1500mg — a level that is higher than the average american intake by a factor of approximately three to 10, \" say doctors, who outline his case in the new england journal of medicine. The man was hospitalized last may, and his urine contained lots of the calcium oxalate crystals involved in kidney stones. He was put on dialysis and he may be on it for life, doctors note. \" we are not advising against tea consumption, \" a researcher says. \" if you are healthy and drink tea with moderation, it should not cause damage to your kidneys. \" in fact, past studies have suggested that a more reasonable amount of tea can actually fight kidney stones, an outside researcher tells reuters. Still, many of us apparently consume too much oxalate, which can be found in spinach, chocolate, nuts, and wheat bran, among other foods. While experts don't recommend going beyond 50mg per day, the average american consumes 152mg to 511mg, researchers note.

        "summary": "Houston police believe they nabbed a suspected serial killer with the tuesday morning arrest of jose gilberto rodriguez. A deadly crime spree began in the area on july 9 with a home invasion and robbery followed by the murder of a 62-year-old woman whose car was stolen. On saturday, a 28-year-old employee of a mattress store was shot dead in the store's back office. In two separate shootings monday, a 22-year-old bus driver was left in critical condition and a 57-year-old man was killed in another mattress store. Rodriguez, 46, is suspected in all of the crimes. He was arrested after someone spotted a suspicious vehicle in the cypress area tuesday morning and alerted authorities, who captured him after a 14-minute chase. He was found in a car stolen from one of the victims, and a pistol was found in the car, the houston chronicle reports. Rodriguez has a violent history dating back to at least 1989, with felony convictions for crimes including attempted sex assault, burglary, and auto theft. He was paroled in september 2017 and deemed a high-risk sex offender. Days before the police announced the manhunt for rodriguez monday, he allegedly cut off his ankle monitor. \" we are very relieved this morning, \" harris county sheriff ed gonzalez told reporters. \" we're very relieved, again, very thankful, to the citizens of harris county for calling in, being diligent and reporting this to us so that we could take action. \" authorities, who believe rodriguez was on the hunt for his next victim when he was caught, have not offered details on the evidence allegedly linking him to the crimes. They believe the victims were chosen randomly, abc news reports. He's been hit with two capital murder charges and a third is expected.",

In fact, one in six nfl players will file for bankruptcy within 12 years of leaving the league, according to a study published earlier this year, per the washington post. About 2 % of players filed for bankruptcy two years after retirement, despite making an average of $ 3.2 million over their careers. \" this is one group that you might think ought to be able to avoid bankruptcy.

But laura poitras? she's a 49-year-old documentary filmmaker from the us who is working with greenwald and is crucial to the snowden saga, reports peter maass in a fascinating new york times magazine piece. Greenwald himself sums it up with a reference to the kevin spacey flick the usual suspects: \"i keep calling her the keyser soze of the story, because she's at once completely invisible and yet ubiquitous. She's been at the center of all of this, and yet no one knows anything about her. \" turns out that greenwald initially ignored snowden's \" annoying and complicated \" emails, prompting snowden to turn to poitras. He knew she was making a documentary about surveillance, and she used her expertise in encryption technology to begin a dialogue with him — and eventually sell greenwald on the story. If the name rings a bell, it's because poitras has made a number of controversial documentaries about iraq and abu ghraib, earning herself a spot on a us watch list and thus dozens of airport interrogations. ( greenwald wrote about her travails in salon. ) the full times piece details their first meetings with snowden ( they were shocked at how young he was ) and the resulting chaos when the first stories appeared. \"our lives will never be the same, \" says poitras. \"i don't know if i ' ll ever be able to live someplace and feel like i have my privacy.

        "summary": "General motors has been cruising along since 1908, but the automaker recently decided it would rather celebrate another birthday: july 10, 2009, making it just a tad over seven years old instead of 108. And the reason gm picked that specific date: that was the day it was \" born again \" as a new company in a bankruptcy reorganization, a fact it now hopes will get it out of further lawsuits for its ignition switch debacle, the wall street journal reports. The company made the request via a petition tuesday to use this shield in what salon is calling a \" hail mary pass \" to the us supreme court, asking the high court to overturn an appellate court's decision that the company is fair game for legal complaints against it, even if they were from before 2009. The faulty switches caused 124 deaths and at least 275 injuries, reuters reports. Gm's main argument is that in 2009 it initiated a \" 363 sale, \" a bankruptcy reorg that allowed a company to scoop up a debtor's assets and then be \" free and clear \" of all that debtor's liabilities. But gm effectively \" bought \" itself — \" general motors corporation \" moved its assets to the newly organized \" general motors company \" — and a harvard law school expert in corporate bankruptcy says this facet of the law is meant to protect third-party buyers, not a company like gm in this case. \" it was general motors selling to a reorganized version of itself, \" he says. \" the factories were the same, the employees were the same. \" the journal notes unblocked lawsuits could translate to \" billions of dollars \" in claims; gm has already paid up around $ 2 billion in settlements and penalties tied to the ignition switches.

The report looked at the national institutes of health's adolescent brain cognitive development ( abcd ) study, in which more than 11,000 9- and 10-year-olds will be followed for a decade \" to see how childhood experiences impact the brain, \" per bloomberg. The study began in 2013. 60 minutes reported on the \" first wave of information \" from the study, which involved brain scans of 4,500 children, per afp. Some key findings: children who spend more than seven hours per day on screens may experience premature thinning of the cortex, the outermost layer of the brain that processes sensory information, and kids who spend more than two hours per day on screens score lower on thinking and language tests. But the telegraph notes that the second finding came from an observational study, meaning it wasn't possible to prove a link between the extra screen hours and the lower cognitive skill scores, and as for the premature cortical thinning ( a natural process that typically happens in later development ), \" we don't know if it's being caused by the screen time, \" a researcher explains. \" we don't know yet if it's a bad thing. \" axios notes that these are preliminary results that have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and at the new york times, science reporter and author benedict carey notes that the early results from the nih study are actually a \" mixed bag. \" researchers, he says, have yet to find hard evidence of screen time causing \" meaningful \" changes to the adolescent brain. For 60 minutes ' full report, including outside experts talking about screen time, see here. ( here's one thing you may not have to worry about when it comes to screens. )",

Anchorage, alaska a mysterious disease, possibly a virus, has afflicted ring seals along alaska's coast, killing scores of them since july, local and federal agencies said on thursday. The diseased seals have been beaching themselves on the arctic coastline since july, with numbers picking up in subsequent months, biologists with the north slope borough department of wildlife management and other agencies said. About 100 of the diseased animals have been found near barrow, the nation's northernmost community, and half of those have died, the borough biologists reported. Elsewhere in the sprawling borough, villagers have reported 146 ringed seals hauling themselves onto beaches, and many of those were diseased, the biologists said. Ringed seals rarely come ashore in normal circumstances, spending most of the year in the water or on floating ice, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's fisheries service. Biologists said they believe the illness was caused by a virus. Symptoms include sometimes-bleeding lesions on the hind flippers, irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the animals ' fur coats. They said the mystery outbreak may not be limited to ringed seals. Some dead walruses at point hope, a village on alaska's northwest coast, were found with similar lesions, borough biologists said. Local hunters also reported finding skin lesions on two bearded seals, the biologists said.

        "summary": "When the federal government's new dietary guidelines come out later this year, the nation's top nutritional panel wants them for the first time to include a recommendation that americans keep the planet in mind when deciding what to eat. That's the panel's advice, at least, and its inclusion in its 571-page report, issued yesterday, is quite controversial. In december, congress warned the dietary guidelines advisory committee not to touch on anything other than nutrition, but the report urges americans to eat more plant-based foods and fewer animal-based foods in an effort to have a smaller environmental impact, the washington post reports. The report calls out red meat in particular as harmful to the environment, and it also notes that americans should cut back on it for health reasons. Members of congress and the meat industry lobby were quick to criticize the report. \" politically motivated issues such as... Environmental sustainability are outside their purview, \" says a spokesman for gop rep. Robert b. Aderholt; the head of the largest meat-trade association said the recommendations \" appear to be based on... Social agendas. \" but the american institute for cancer research applauded the report's meat advice, nbc news reports. And, national geographic adds, the report does include the footnote that \" lean red meat \" can be included in a healthy diet. The department of health and human services and the agriculture department could simply ignore the report, which is meant to provide a scientific basis for the guidelines, when they issue the official guidelines, but the post reports the recommendations are rarely altered. Americans can, of course, ignore the guidelines once they come out, but as they can impact things like school lunch menus, they could have an effect.

The song \" is a self-empowerment anthem recorded at a time when the roles women were expected to play in pop were more commonly submissive and adoring, as typified by hits like ' he's so fine ' by the chiffons, \" writes dan deluca at the philadelphia inquirer.

As she slowed to look for its mother, \" i looked back to my left and the mama bear was already coming toward me, \" she says in a new interview about the attack. The grizzly knocked her down, picked her up by the thigh or buttocks, carried her across a road, then dropped her and \" went to town, \" gamboa says, per the alaska dispatch. \" i paused then for a few minutes... Maybe two, laying there, and telling myself, ' i think pretty much this is how i ' m going to die. ' \" she played dead, but when the bear finally left, \" i could see blood just everywhere, \" gamboa says. \" i could feel pulsing out of my neck. I knew i was in bad shape. \" she called for her husband, but the faster runner had gotten too far ahead of her. She eventually made it to a road and met sgt. Collin gillikin, who thought she was a tired runner. \" she didn't seem to be in distress. \" once in his truck, however, he noticed how badly she was injured. \" i was in pure amazement this woman was still talking, \" he says. Gamboa suffered gashes all over her body, a neck fracture, puncture wounds, and bruises, and \" they had to reattach almost all of my ear, \" she says.

Throughout the may 18 attack, gamboa lay in a fetal position and remained silent. That action likely saved her life. \" i actually can't even believe this actually really happened, \" the 25-year-old woman said in a videotaped interview released by the army on thursday. \" it seems still surreal, just for the fact that i ' m still alive — seems unreal. \" in the interview taped tuesday at her hospital bed, gamboa said she surrendered herself to the bear during the attack at joint base elmendorf-richardson in anchorage after she encountered the animal and her two cubs. Gamboa, of sacramento, california, is married to a soldier assigned at the base to the 4th infantry brigade combat team ( airborne ), 25th infantry division.

In this case, playing dead was the wrong thing to do because the bear had not taken an offensive action before the children laid down. But gamboa responded just as she should have, said sledge, who participates in briefings introducing newly arrived j-ber service members to life in alaska, including dealing with bears and moose. Gamboa's actions showed the bear she was not a threat. \" all that sow was worried about was the protection of her babies, \" sledge said.

        "summary": "Shirley manson, better known as the frontwoman of the band garbage, is only happy when it rains — and, perhaps, when she's not thinking about wrinkles. The singer/former calvin klein model took to facebook late last month to admit that while she's \" at odds with plastic surgery, botox, filler, and surgical enhancement, \" she's also \" 44 years old. That is ancient in the world of entertainment. That is even older in the world of music. I feel like if i stay true to myself. I am screwing myself out of a job. \" and that led emma cowing to pick apart the admission in the scotsman. Manson has spent two decades as a great example of what a confident woman is ( this is the singer who \" once told a journalist she bought an orange fender stratocaster because it matched her pubic hair \" ). So what turned manson \" into a nervous-sounding woman seriously considering plastic surgery in order to stay popular? \" cowing talked to manson's friends and industry experts and contemplated the role that manson's admitted body dysmorphia may play in all this. But after hearing plenty of \" she's crazy \" and \" there is massive pressure now, \" cowing ultimately doesn't come to any real conclusion. Manson seems equally unsure, concluding her post with, \" i am confused. Deeply confused. Please help me process or understand. \"",

        "summary": "The upside to former president obama's landmark deal to normalize relations with cuba is that the cuban people have benefited, says secretary of state rex tillerson. The downside, he says, is that they haven't benefited enough. While commending the increased commercial activity in cuba, tillerson told the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday that \" we have achieved very little \" in regards to how the cuban government treats its people, per the wall street journal. To fix that, president trump is expected to unveil an updated cuba policy friday that will \" allow as much of this continued commercial and engagement activity to go on as possible \" but also encourage cuba to end human rights violations, tillerson says, per the guardian. An anonymous white house official tells the ap that the us embassy in havana will remain open but that trade with cuban companies with ties to the military will be outlawed. The journal also reports on a possible tightening of travel restrictions since much of cuba's tourism industry is controlled by its military. In this way, the us is \" inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime, \" tillerson says. At the same time, \" political opponents continue to be imprisoned, dissidents continue to be jailed, women continue to be harassed. \" the us is also expected to request the release of prisoners and the return of us fugitives from cuba.

In fact, you'd need 1.5 times that much water, or 11 trillion gallons, to do so, according to nasa satellite findings. Another way to put it in perspective: it's 130,000 rose bowls ' worth of water, usa today notes. It's also more water than california uses every year, even with 38 million residents. This is the first time the amount of water needed to end a drought has ever been calculated, nasa reports. The study involved two satellites tracking the planet's gravitational field; small changes in the field are associated with changes in the water supply, mashable reports. Each year since 2011, the sacramento and san joaquin river basins have lost about 4 trillion gallons. What's more, the snowpack in the sierra nevada mountains is just half of what earlier estimates suggested, and it's \" one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when california's population was half what it is now, \" a researcher says. That means less snow melt and more absorption of sunlight into the ground, helping warm the planet and leading to drier conditions that make it more difficult to get snow water to reservoirs, he adds. \" it takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it, \" says the water study's leader.",

            "Newly released images created from nasa satellite data illustrate the staggering effect the california drought has had on groundwater supply in the state. The images show the amount of water lost over the past 12 years, with different colors indicating severity over time. According to nasa, the sacramento river and san joaquin river basins have been hit the hardest by the water loss, in part because of the increasing volume of groundwater being pumped out for farming. For the last three years, these regions have been losing a total of 4 trillion gallons of water per year. The sun is reflected off the water remaining in an irrigation canal that is drying up near yuba city, calif. Image: rich pedroncelli/associated press the data was compiled from two satellites that have been orbiting the earth since 2002 as part of the gravity recovery and climate experiment ( grace ) mission, a collaboration between nasa and german space agency dlr. The satellites measure small fluctuations in earth's gravitational field that are most often caused by variations in water supply. In a podcast interview with science magazine, uc irvine hydrologist james famiglietti used the analogy of a bathroom scale to explain how grace uses highly sensitive gravity measurements to track changes in the amount of water stored underground in soil and rocks. \" each [ satellite ] is about the size of a squashed minivan,",

            "Newly released images created from nasa satellite data illustrate the staggering effect the california drought has had on groundwater supply in the state. The images show the amount of water lost over the past 12 years, with different colors indicating severity over time. According to nasa, the sacramento river and san joaquin river basins have been hit the hardest by the water loss, in part because of the increasing volume of groundwater being pumped out for farming. For the last three years, these regions have been losing a total of 4 trillion gallons of water per year. The sun is reflected off the water remaining in an irrigation canal that is drying up near yuba city, calif. Image: rich pedroncelli/associated press the data was compiled from two satellites that have been orbiting the earth since 2002 as part of the gravity recovery and climate experiment ( grace ) mission, a collaboration between nasa and german space agency dlr. The satellites measure small fluctuations in earth's gravitational field that are most often caused by variations in water supply. In a podcast interview with science magazine, uc irvine hydrologist james famiglietti used the analogy of a bathroom scale to explain how grace uses highly sensitive gravity measurements to track changes in the amount of water stored underground in soil and rocks. \" each [ satellite ] is about the size of a squashed minivan,",

Joseph miller, who resigned from the state police wednesday, told dispatchers during the 911 call in 2014 that he was preparing to clean his gun when he released the slide and pulled the trigger, not realizing there was a round in the magazine at the time. His wife was sitting on the floor nearby sorting baby clothes, per cbs philadelphia, and was shot in the head; their daughter, who was at 24 weeks gestation, was delivered via emergency c-section. Neither survived. Miller, now 36, was initially cleared in the shooting, but subsequent investigation revealed that he lied to authorities, police say. He has been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Tests found that joanna miller, 34, was shot from 3 to 6 inches away; thus, miller \" lied to police when he stated he did not know where joanna was at the time of the shooting \" and \" also lied \" when he told police he was 8 to 10 feet away from her, then \" lied again when he changed his answer \" and said he was about 2 feet away from her, per the affidavit of probable cause filed last week. \" miller should have been aware that his wife was seated right next to him, and that the muzzle was pointed directly at her head, when he pulled the trigger and shot her to death, \" it states, adding that he also disregarded safety measures with which, as a state trooper, he should have been familiar. The millers had two other children together, and joanna miller also had two children from a previous relationship. Joseph miller can be heard consoling children on the 911 recording, abc news reports.",

Sash nemphos, 16, intended to kill his parents, then go to school and kill the police officer stationed there, court documents say. Afterward, he planned to take the cop's gun and \" kill as many teachers and students as he could. \" but when the boy arrived at the george washington carver center for arts and technology in towson — apparently without having killed his parents — he felt he'd had too much whiskey to follow through with his plans, and he postponed them to monday, police say. But on saturday, nemphos was arrested in a different case, this time for alleged theft. Workers at a restaurant near the boy's home said items had been stolen from their cars; the trail allegedly led to nemphos. Despite initially denying he'd stolen anything, he \" broke down \" and acknowledged responsibility, according to police. After his father raised concerns about a handgun stolen from his work, nemphos told police about his attack plans, they say. They found a suicide note along with a handgun and homemade bombs, reuters reports. The boy told police he'd been bullied, but he said teachers had done nothing about it, the baltimore sun reports. He's now been charged as an adult over possession of a destructive device and weapon possession at school, among other charges.",

        "summary": "This summer, an indianapolis teenager was abducted, strangled, and set on fire — a horrifying crime made all the more tragic by her story of a troubled girl gone good, the indianapolis star reports. Dominique allen was 15 when someone apparently kidnapped her outside a neighbor's house, killed her on an abandoned property, and burned her body ( presumably to destroy dna evidence ) in someone's backyard. Now police detectives are struggling to solve the nearly two-month-old case while people in dominique's community march the streets, wish-tv reports. \" we're jeopardizing the community by keeping this person out there, \" says one of her sisters. \" somebody knows something. \" one thing we do know is that allen rejected the very kind of violence that claimed her life. Distraught by her mother's death to crohn's disease, dominique turned angry in seventh grade and got in a fight that injured another girl. In high school, after two friends died to street violence, she turned over a new leaf and reached out to a guidance counselor for help: \" will you be my mom at school for me? \" dominique asked. Soon her algebra grades were improving and she was less downcast — but she died about a month later. \" she pretty much had gone from a caterpillar to a butterfly, \" says her guidance counselor. Police have some sense of her killer — that he was older, knew the neighborhood, and had likely served time — but without hard evidence, the case is falling on community activists. \" i know your conscience is bothering you, \" dominique's uncle, a reverend, tells the killer via wxin. \" so i would ask also that you do the right thing and come forward. \"",

They paint the picture of a grain merchant and landowner who got rich by buying and storing grain, malt, and barley, which he resold at higher prices during times of famine, the ap reports. He then \" pursued those who could not ( or would not ) pay him in full for these staples and used the profits to further his own money-lending activities, \" according to the paper. Shakespeare was actually prosecuted in 1598 for hoarding grain during a food shortage, and that's not all: he was also wanted for tax evasion. He was fined for both, and threatened with jail over the tax issue, reports the telegraph, citing the sunday times. The ap notes that these details weren't entirely unknown, and one of the researchers says critics and scholars tend to ignore this information because they \" cannot countenance the idea of a creative genius also being motivated by self-interest. \" but, she adds, these details actually inform shakespeare's work: in coriolanus, for example, the people complain when rich merchants exploit the famine in order to maximize profits; and in king lear, \" there is a very subtle depiction of how dividing up land also involves impacts on the distribution of food. \"",

Three actually did have sex with matt, including then-19-year-old allysia bishop, who slit her wrists afterward in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Now it appears the whole thing was an elaborate hoax. After some online sleuthing that involved examining ip addresses, the women say matt created the fake stwalley profile and impersonated her. The stranger identifies him as freelance tech journo matt hickey, who has done work for the seattle newspaper. \" i agree it's weird and also ridiculous, but i ' m sorry to say that at this point i can't talk about anything specific, though i may in the future, \" hickey tells the paper in an email.

Counterterrorism agents arrested 18 pakistani and afghan nationals in seven provinces today in \" one of the most important operations we ever conducted, \" the lead investigator tells nbc news. \" we are talking people with connections with al-qaeda at the highest level \" who police say intended to stage terror strikes in pakistan and afghanistan and funneled money to pakistan using an ancient trust-based transfer system called hawala. Most of the businessmen appeared to be leading normal lives, but two are believed to have once been part of osama bin laden's network of guards, reuters reports. In a wiretapped conversation, another claimed bin laden personally sent him to italy. \" we believe they were in touch with people who knew the whereabouts of bin laden, to the point that they would frequently ask over the phone about his health while he was in hiding, \" the investigator says. Some members had allegedly planned an attack against pope benedict xvi at the vatican in 2010 — which never came to fruition — while police say others were involved in a 2009 market bombing in peshawar, pakistan, which killed more than 100 people. The cell, headquartered in sassari, sardinia, reports cnn, allegedly had \" an abundant amount of weapons \" and wanted to support attacks that would erode the pakistan government's support of us forces in afghanistan. A press conference is scheduled for later today.",

Seems a clergyman at st. Leonard's church in beoley, redditch, asked to have the skull there removed for a quick dna test and saw his request denied. \" the curiosity as to the skull at beoley has no factual base whatsoever to justify exhumation, removal, or investigation, \" says church lawyer charles mynors, who issued the denial in a nearly 7,000-word report. \" the whole enterprise is entirely speculative. \" shakespeare scholars are on his side, but local folklore and two mysterious articles tell a different tale. Dated 1879 and 1884, the anonymous articles claim that a doctor dug up shakespeare's skull to win a reward offered by an art historian in 1769, the telegraph reports. But after the doctor couldn't get his money, the skull was buried in a vault under st. Leonard's church. With the rev. Paul irving's request for a dna test now denied, area clergymen are licking their wounds: \" there is this skull sitting there on its own and we would love to know who it is, \" says a reverend who oversees the beoley church. \" the problem for us now is that the failure to conduct a detailed investigation will result in a higher level of uninformed speculation. \" as it happens, shakespeare's tombstone epitaph at stratford-upon-avon includes a warning against grave-robbers: \" bleste be the man that spares thes stones, \" it reads in part. \" and curst be he that moves my bones. \" ( researchers have credited shakespeare with a new play. )",

The des moines register reports the suspect is cristhian bahena rivera, 24.

An autopsy is scheduled for wednesday, and should reveal more on how and when she died, though the register notes it could take as long as six weeks to get the results.

        "summary": "Using thermal cameras, researchers in australia uncovered the science behind a habit that seems, well, cute: koala bears hug trees to cool themselves. It turns out that tree trunks can be up to 12 degrees cooler than the air, and with australia's recent hot spells rising well above 100 degrees, koalas get extra huggy. Conversely, in the cold of winter, the marsupials tend to climb higher into trees, closer to the leaves they eat. The scientists came to their conclusion after using thermal cameras on a particularly hot day. \" if we had thermal vision, it would have been an obvious thing, \" a university of melbourne researcher tells the bbc. \" you could see the koala sitting on the coolest part of the tree trunk with its bottom wedged right into the coolest spot. \" and in doing so, koalas manage to conserve a substantial amount of water: they typically cool themselves by panting, livescience explains, with heat escaping their bodies by way of the moisture leaving their mouths. Modeling showed tree hugging halved the amount of water that would otherwise be lost. The study also explains why the marsupials have been spotted in acacia trees, which aren't a food source: those trunks get cooler than eucalyptus trunks, notes australian geographic. As for why the trees in general are cooler, researchers say it's possibly because they pull in nearby groundwater, whose temperature doesn't fluctuate as much as air temps do. ( earlier this year, australia's heat caused thousands of dead bats to fall from the sky. )",

Police say the cousins, ages 9 and 11, were playing in a parking lot across the street from their apartment complex when a snow plow buried them in a mound of snow; they were trapped there for at least four hours, reports nbc new york. A frantic search began when the boys weren't home by 10pm, and they were finally found under more than 6 feet of snow at 2am after a police officer spotted a small shovel partially sticking out of the snow mound. The boys were both conscious. They were hospitalized for exposure and are now in good condition. Police say the plow driver was on the other side of the mound and wouldn't have seen the boys. They were unable to move their arms and legs while trapped, but a dome of air helped them survive in what relatives are calling a thanksgiving miracle, cbs reports. \" all i see was the feet, \" says a neighbor who helped dig the boys out. \" when i got over there, the little boy's feet was hanging out of the thing, and he was shaking, and his mother was like, ' it's all right, he's there, he's there.

            "Libya has demanded an explanation for the \" kidnapping \" of one of its citizens by american special forces, hours after a separate us military raid on a terrorist target in somalia ended in apparent failure and retreat. In tripoli the us army's delta force seized alleged al-qaida leader nazih abdul-hamed al-ruqai, known by his alias abu anas al-liby and wanted for the 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed more than 220 people. The new york times reported that liby was being held in military custody and interrogated on board a navy ship, the uss antonio, in the mediterranean. But us navy seals suffered a major setback when they launched an amphibious assault to capture an islamist militant leader said to be ahmed godane, described as africa's most wanted man and the architect of last month's attack on the westgate shopping mall in kenya. The elite seals were beaten back by heavy fire and apparently abandoned equipment that the somali militants photographed and posted on the internet.

A group of researchers came to this conclusion by digging up two victims of the black death in germany and studying dna fragments in their teeth. They reconstructed the disease's genome and compared it to more than a hundred contemporary strains of plague, but no luck — the black death was an evolutionary dead end. This \" generates new questions, \" says the study's top author. \" for example, why did this [ justinian ] pandemic, which killed somewhere between 50 and 100 million people, die out? \" maybe people built up an immunity to the bacteria, afp notes, or natural climate variation could have stopped the germs from spreading. Either way, plague remains a threat in some countries, like madagascar, where people live in closer proximity to flea-carrying rodents. Even the us has a few bubonic plague infections each year. \" fortunately we now have antibiotics that could be used to effectively treat plague, which lessens the chances of another large scale human pandemic, \" says a co-author of the study.",

        "summary": "In 1936, ernest hemingway told a friend he'd never kill himself, the charlotte observer reports. The great author was dead by his own hand 25 years later. According to smithsonian, hemingway scholars have long blamed the writer's decade-long decline and eventual suicide on some combination of alcoholism and bipolar disorder. But a psychiatrist in north carolina says the actual culprit is something more associated with modern football players than authors: cte. Andrew farah has been studying hemingway for 20 years, fox 8 reports. By reading hemingway's letters, memoirs by his friends and family, and the fbi file on him, farah was able to trace what he believes is the source of hemingway's downfall: at least nine concussions. Those concussions came from boxing, car crashes, exploding shells during two world wars, and more. \" his injuries and head traumas were frequent, random, and damaging, \" farah writes in his newly published book, hemingway's brain. For example, following a plane crash that had likely already concussed him, hemingway used his head to bash out a door and escape the plane. While we likely will never know for sure if hemingway suffered from cte, farah says he showed symptoms in his final years, such as paranoia, anger, and violence. He also got worse following electroconvulsive therapy. \" it didn't take long to connect the dots, \" farah tells smithsonian. He says he hopes his conclusion will allow the focus to shift from the \" mythology \" of hemingway's death to the greatness of his work. ( how sports destroyed a young man's brain. )",

John ratcliffe is backed by conservative groups with strong tea party ties in the republican primary runoff and he says he is the stronger conservative, the ap reports. But hall, who first won his dallas-area seat in 1980 and switched from democrat to republican in 2004, says the younger man is \" running against my birth certificate. \" the contest will be a test of whether hall's old-school, face-to-face campaigning style can hold up against his opponent's modern, digital, and data-heavy techniques, the ap noted last month. Hall — who once sold cigarettes and coca-cola to bonnie and clyde when he worked in a pharmacy as a boy — served in the navy from 1942 to 1945 and if he does prevail, he will be the last world war ii veteran in congress, reports the new york daily news. There are no veterans of the war still serving in the senate and the only other world war ii vet in the house is michigan democrat john dingell, who is not seeking re-election.",

A new study from norway found that mice given steroids were able to regrow muscle mass more rapidly months after the drug was withdrawn.

Three months may not sound like a lot, but it is 15 % of a mouse's average lifespan, notes the australian. The new research raises the question of how long athletes should be banned from competing after being caught doping. Standard doping bans are two to four years, but the leader of the study says that may not be nearly long enough. \" if it is sufficient to build muscle mass, i think it would be sufficient to give you this long-term effect, \" he says, per the bbc. \" i think it could last 10 years but i don't have the data to back that up.

Some of the devices openly marketed by these companies – including electric shock stun batons, metal spiked batons, and weighted leg cuffs – are intrinsically cruel and inhumane and therefore should immediately be banned.

        "summary": "With a midnight deadline looming, iran and the six nations it's conferring with in switzerland have reached a deal — to continue talks for a deal on tehran's hotly contested nuke program. The nations are expected to release a joint statement today announcing they ' ll enter a \" new phase \" of negotiations that will end with a full-fledged agreement by the end of june, according to two unnamed officials, per the ap. While headway had been made, key sticking points mean the language is being revised to say today's talks will end in an \" understanding, \" with \" technical \" issues to be resolved in coming months, the ap notes. What's going on: iran wants all un sanctions lifted immediately; the six-country bloc is willing to make other concessions — including nixing banking limitations and getting rid of the eu oil embargo — but wants some sanctions in place until iran makes good on its promises. That looks unlikely, with supreme leader ali khamenei posting yesterday, \" sanctions must be lifted in one go, not as a result of future iranian actions, \" per the guardian. Although iran has said it will acquiesce to restrictions on its centrifuge development over the next decade, beyond that is fair game. The other countries at the negotiating table want to cut down iran's \" breakout time \" ( the time it would take to construct a bomb ) by adding five more years onto the 10-year moratorium. Iran argues that would keep the country under the thumb of other nations'technology, the guardian notes. The question of iran's uranium stash remains on the table, with tehran's main negotiator saying iran has no intention of shipping its fuel out, and the us state department conceding that there's still a lot of back and forth on this issue. \" the bottom line is that we don't have agreement with the iranians on the stockpile issue, \" a state rep said yesterday, per the new york times.",

Shares responded by dropping almost 15 % in after-hours trading yesterday. The company's decision to separate its dvd-by-mail service from its streaming service, thus increasing the subscription fee for customers who want both, ended up costing it 850,000 dvd-only subscribers in the second quarter in the us. Meanwhile, more than half a million us streaming subscribers came on board. \" their subscriber gains just weren't impressive, \" an analyst tells the wall street journal. Though netflix was once again profitable, with a net income of $ 6.2 million after losing $ 4.6 million in the first quarter, a letter to shareholders warns that a number of challenges are ahead — including a return to the red in the fourth quarter. And more bad news: hbo quickly squashed the idea of a partnership that would allow netflix customers to stream the network's shows. Netflix ceo reed hastings had raised the idea of a partnership in the letter to shareholders, but hbo says no deal is in the works, reuters reports.",

Hbo rushed to pour cold water on the possibilities that the netflix ceo raised in a letter to shareholders, making it clear it had no intentions of making a deal with hastings, who often singles out hbo as a chief competitor. \" we are not in discussions and have no plans to work with netflix, \" hbo spokesman jeff cusson said.

The caveat ( for now ): recipients need to live in munich, have a select audi equipped with special technology, and be amazon prime members, per mashable. The program, set to launch in may, will partner with dhl, which will get temporary access to customers ' car trunks to make drop-offs; customers would also be able to place packages in their car for dhl pickup. An audi spokesman tells the times that the initiative is the first between an online retailer, delivery service, and carmaker; he adds it likely won't be available for most customers until next year. Usa today explains how the delivery works: an audi owner who orders goods using amazon prime would greenlight delivery to her car, giving the dhl driver an electronic access code for a limited time. Using gps, the driver finds the car, pops the trunk, and drops the package; once the trunk is closed, the code won't work again. Mashable brings up the possibility of the service being used for \" nefarious purposes \" ( sending illegal packages, for instance ), and the times mentions the logistical matter of only being able to deliver to cars that remain in one place for a good portion of the day. Still, the service's creators hope it will cut back on deliveries thwarted when customers aren't home to receive them. ( amazon still wants to make drone delivery a widespread service. )",

But the 40-year-old, who was working with his brother-in-law mark rouco, soon wasn't feeling well — and it turned out he was having a heart attack, per abc news. His wife, melissa work, called 911, and about a half-dozen firefighters arrived to rush gene work to the hospital. But while he was drifting in and out of consciousness, his wife says he could only focus on one thing. \" he kept begging me to figure out the sod and have it put down because he didn't want it to go to waste and die, \" she writes in a facebook post. \" it's all he kept asking about literally during a massive heart attack. Lol. \" he relayed his same fears to the first responders on his way to the hospital, and they were obviously listening. Per the tampa bay times, rouco, who'd stayed behind in the yard to try to finish the job, suddenly saw the emergency vehicles that had just been there returning. Rouco thought they were coming to check on him, but they were there for a different reason: to help him put the rest of the sod down. All together, they got the job done in an hour. At a ceremony tuesday honoring the first responders, gene work told them he cried when he was shown a picture of the finished sod job after his emergency surgery. \" on paper, we've been dealt a lot of difficulties, \" melissa work, who will be receiving a bone marrow transplant next month, tells the times. \" but we teach our kids to look for the positives, and that is what this was. \" an extra gesture of kindness: after seeing melissa work's facebook post, the sod company refunded all of the family's money.

Epicenter, a new swedish office block, is offering employees a miniscule rfid ( radio-frequency identification ) chip to provide various kinds of access. Not all are accepting it, but it's been offered to some 400 workers, the independent reports. \" we already interact with technology all the time, \" says bio-hacker hannes sjoblad, the \" chief disruption officer \" at the office block. \" today it's a bit messy — we need pin codes and passwords. Wouldn't it be easy to just touch with your hand? that's really intuitive. \" a bbc journalist had one inserted and said it wasn't too painful, but neither was it intuitive: his hand needed some twisting to activate an office photocopier. Yet sjoblad and the swedish biohacking group ( which is behind the technology ) sees this as just the beginning. They already hold chip-insertion parties at a stockholm tattoo parlor, which the bbc depicts as part of a trend that's blending humans with technology — including smart watches, glucose-monitoring contact lenses, and the digital biostamp tattoo that collects data on a person's health. \" some people are horrified by this, \" admits one advocate. But \" years ago there was fear over vaccinations and now it seems perfectly normal to have cells injected into us.

A total of 43 people, including one police officer, were killed in the confrontation in the western state of michoacan on may 22, 2015. The national human rights commission says five people were killed when a police black hawk helicopter fired 4,000 rounds at the ranch house after the officer was shot, the bbc reports. Another 22 were arbitrarily executed, while the circumstances of the other 15 deaths are still unclear, according to the commission. The lopsided death toll had led to suspicions that officers might have arbitrarily killed people during the operation against suspected members of the jalisco new generation cartel. Eighteen of the victims were found barefoot and one just in his underpants, leading the commission to conclude most were asleep when police arrived. Thirteen of the 22 people the commission says were executed had been shot in the back. Mexico's national security commissioner denies the accusations of what the commission called \" grave human rights violations, \" saying federal police ordered the suspects to drop their weapons and surrender, but were answered with gunfire.",

Spokane city council voted 6 to 0 yesterday to remove dolezal from the police ombudsman commission after a report found evidence of wrongdoing by dolezal and two other commission members. An investigation following a female city employee's complaint on april 15 found dolezal, kevin berkompas, and adrian dominguez were guilty of workplace harassment; taking on duties not assigned, like attempting to draft and adopt policies; changing official meeting minutes; criticizing the woman who filed the complaint in public; and intimidating her by suggesting she'd get a poor evaluation, krem reports. Investigators say dolezal, one of 20 witnesses interviewed, showed a bias against police, and her role in protests against law enforcement showed a clear conflict of interest. The report also found dolezal didn't keep confidential the names of individuals who were participating in police misconduct probes. Spokane's mayor and city council president asked the three officials to resign prior to the meeting, which berkompas did. The council allowed dominguez a week to respond to the allegations. Dolezal had refused to step down, questioning both the \" timing and intentions of the investigation. \" \" i have done nothing wrong, \" she said in advance of the vote, per nbc news. \" the level of harassment and sabotage by city government is completely undeserved and inappropriate. \"",

In a monday appearance before india's supreme court, which was hearing a case on the stone, solicitor general ranjit kumar said the koh-i-noor diamond \" was neither stolen nor forcibly taken away. \" in recommending the government relinquish its claim, kumar said maharaja ranjit singh bestowed the gem — \" the most famous diamond in the crown jewels, \" per its current profile on the british royal palaces website — on queen victoria in 1849 for britain's help in the sikh wars. It isn't clear what brought about the change of heart, though kumar said pressing india's claim might result in other countries \" claiming their items from us. \" the telegraph notes kumar also referenced a 1970s law that says only those items removed illegally from pre-independent india may be pursued by the government. While the royals are likely thrilled — the jewel is embedded in a crown that was worn by the queen mother and will be sported by kate as queen consort — the man who petitioned the supreme court is less so, per reuters: \" the british rulers looted india and the government is making a mistake by not supporting our claims. \" the diamond is said to have surfaced in the 1300s and \" passed through the hands of conquering mughal princes, iranian warriors, afghan rulers, \" some of whom met a fate that gained the diamond a reputation as cursed and \" unlucky for men to wear, \" writes the guardian.

He ran inside and found two little girls, ages 3 and 5, and helped them out of the house. That was in 1951, and the canadian man always wondered what happened to them. Then, this november, malone moved into the house next door to margaret fowler — and while trading stories about their lives one day, they realized fowler was one of the two little girls malone had saved 65 years ago. He has since also been reunited with the other little girl, fowler's sister barbara earle, and the trio told their story to the cbc's st. John's morning show this week. \" she just looked at me and nearly fainted, \" malone says of the moment fowler told the story of the little girls he'd saved. He found fowler first, but she refused to leave because her little sister was still somewhere in the house. Malone searched until he finally found earle under a bed, then led both girls to safety, the telegram reports. The fire killed the girls ' grandmother, and left the girls, their six siblings, and their parents homeless. In the years since, their parents as well as malone's parents have died. \" it's a miracle as far as i ' m concerned, \" fowler says of the sisters'reunion with malone. \" i think it was meant to be.

Ivana also runs down the times marla has publicly apologized and ivana has, in turn, rejected those apologies. Last but not least, she slams marla's appearance on dancing with the stars last year. \" the showgirl appeared on dwts when ( because ) her ex-husband was running for president! it was disrespectful to do the show. I never would have embarrassed donald that way, \" ivana writes. \" no class! \" she adds that she herself has been offered quite a bit of money to appear on the show, but she refuses to go on tv \" dancing in those tiny dresses with the boobs and butt hanging out \" and that the fact that marla did so is a \" disgrace. \" the book was released tuesday. Also tuesday, an ivana interview aired on fox news in which she said there's \" absolutely no problem \" between her and donald's third wife, melania, but that interview was recorded before ivana called herself the \" first lady \" and the actual first lady hit back, politico reports.",

        "summary": "Amanda knox has once again been found guilty of the 2007 murder of meredith kercher, but will she be sent back to italy to serve a 28-year sentence? legal experts say any attempts to extradite the seattle resident are unlikely to begin until the appeals process has finished, and since she was retried after being found innocent of the same offense, the american ban on \" double jeopardy \" convictions could help keep her out of an italian prison. If italy does decide to extradite her, they will have to make a formal request to the state department, where officials will consider it. But if they choose to reject the request, there could be diplomatic consequences, a lawyer specializing in extradition tells abc. \" the us often wants italy to extradite all kinds of people, so if the us refuses to even process the case, especially a case involving violence, that could have some adverse consequences for bilateral relations, \" he says. The american review of any extradition request could, however, be quite limited in scope and will focus mainly on paperwork, another expert tells the seattle times. \" it's not a retrial of the case, and it's not a retrial of another country's justice system. \" knox, who has said she won't return to italy willingly, slammed the fresh guilty verdict and said it would not be a consolation to the kercher family, cnn reports. \" this has gotten out of hand. Most troubling is that it was entirely preventable, \" she said in a statement. \" i beseech those with the knowledge and authority to address and remediate the problems that worked to pervert the course of justice and waste the valuable resources of the system, \" she said. Knox's co-accused, ex-boyfriend raffaele sollecito, was also found guilty again and sentenced to 25 years. After the verdict, police found him at a hotel near italy's borders with slovenia and austria, the ap reports. He was taken to a police station, where a stamp was put in his passport stating that he cannot leave the country.",
