James cameau, 34, had been working at jacksonville granite for less than a month and had seemed down recently, employees say. Then on monday, he left work around 10am and returned shortly after noon with a semi-automatic pistol and found 11 employees gathered at the back of the building, report wmaz and wxjt. \" you better run, \" he allegedly said before trying to open fire. His gun jammed twice, giving employees time to run through the front of the building and toward their cars, police say. Cameau followed and eventually fired several bullets, but he hit only vehicles. He then chased co-worker dean hagins jr. And shot him in the backside before hagins jumped a fence and escaped, police say. \" thank you jesus for being with me today, \" hagins wrote on facebook on monday; he's listed in good condition at a hospital, per the new york daily news. Other employees say they didn't take cameau seriously at first. \" he was pointing right at me telling me to run, \" says one. \" i thought it was a toy gun or something. I didn't think he would do something like that. He didn't seem like that type of person. \" when police arrived, they found cameau dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a closet. \" at least two people that he was at point-blank range with could have lost their life, \" an officer says. \" he was shooting at all of them, \" he adds, per the florida times-union. Authorities have yet to pinpoint a motive. Cameau, who was staying at a hotel and had no wife or kids, was previously charged with dui and driving with a revoked license.",

And you didn't have the problems that you have. \" boulineau says there has been a wide range of responses from parents, from total approval to \" oh my goodness i can't believe you are doing that. \" after a third offense, the student will \" be taken into an office behind closed doors, \" a consent form obtained by wrdw states. \" the student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle, \" the form states, adding that \" no more than three licks should be given \" with the 24-inch wooden paddle. Students whose parents who do not consent to paddling — which is still legal in georgia and 19 other states — will be given five-day suspensions instead. ( alabama paddled 19,000 children in a single year. )",

If i had been able to see the camera, i would have remembered that i was talking to the whole world, not just the man. \" interesting, writes ed kilgore at washington monthly, who thinks the explanation captures the entirety of romney's 2012 run. \" throughout the primaries he was always in effect talking to some angry if not entirely coherent republican voter or donor or media opinion-leader, and trying to'reflect back'to their pov, which mitt did not entirely share but had to take very, very seriously, \" writes kilgore. \" it's an almost impossible habit to break, and at a crucial moment, he couldn't. \" at the washington post, sean sullivan sees romney's lesson as one that all modern candidates must absorb. \" all they have to do is look at how much destruction ( it ) caused his campaign and simply assume the camera is on at all times when they are speaking. \" ( former running mate paul ryan, meanwhile, told charlie rose on pbs yesterday that the \" 47 % \" comments were \" wrong, \" reports business insider. )",

The next day, when she learned of the shooting, rousseau was hopeful for hours that her daughter may have survived. Of the next \" lost week, \" she writes, \" i remember that nightmare time as one in which our happy past was a blur and our future a troubling fog. \" but the family has been comforted by hearing from other people whose lives have been touched by lauren's story, and rousseau realizes that grief is \" required of multitudes of people every day, \" not just sandy hook families. \" one's own grief is lessened by recognizing other people who are hurting and reaching out to help them, \" she writes. \" at christmas and all year long, do the right thing, be unreasonably generous, cherish your family, choose love, chase joy, don't hold grudges, ignore life's little irritations. \" her full column is worth a read.",

The investigative team, headed by deans steve coll and sheila coronel, will examine \" the editorial process that led to the publication of this story, \" which has been accused of featuring shoddy interviewing and reporting and a possibly misleading first-person account by \" jackie, \" the story's victim. Wenner says once the school has completed its audit, he ' ll publish the resulting report in its entirety on the magazine's website, with a condensed version in print. This third-party audit is in addition to the magazine's own detective work, which a rolling stone spokeswoman told the post last week would include \" a thorough internal review of the reporting, editing, and fact-checking \" involved. Coronel says wenner was the one who approached them and that they're not being paid: \" we're doing it on our own time, \" coronel tells the post. She also notes that they don't have a completion deadline and have already received a ton of files from the magazine, saying, \" they've given us the interviews, the email, a lot of other things — we have a lot. \" as the huffington post notes, it's not typical for news organizations to happily hand over materials for independent review when a story is under fire, though cbs news did so in 2004 to flesh out how the network allowed a dan rather report on george w.

It's also a summary of events that could easily apply to the famed and discredited 2004 bush national guard records story aired by \"60 minutes ii \" just before that year's presidential election.

That they both happened at the same news organization — and under the \"60 minutes \" banner — is notable in itself. What's similar failure of a key source. Both times, there was a single source that set off the key reporting.

Our housing arrangements are not racist. They are not exclusive.

A study published in the journal nature links asparagine — an amino acid found in many foods, including asparagus, beef, poultry, nuts, and potatoes — to the spread of secondary cancers in mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Researchers say they sharply reduced the ability of the cancer to spread in the animals by putting them on a low-asparagine diet, though using a drug called l-asparagine to block the compound had even better results, the guardian reports. The human body can make its own asparagine, which is an ability some cancer cells lack. The team says the next step will be to place human volunteers on a low-asparagine diet to see if it reduces the level of the compound in the body, the australian reports. Researchers say that while it's far too early to recommend drastic changes in diet, the findings are a big step toward fighting cancer using its own \" culinary addictions. \" \" we're seeing increasing evidence that specific cancers are addicted to specific components of our diet, \" lead researcher greg hannon tells the bbc. \" in the future, by modifying a patient's diet or by using drugs that change the way that tumor cells can access these nutrients, we hope to improve outcomes in therapy. \" ( this drastic diet helped mice live longer. )",

        "summary": "President trump unveiled neil gorsuch as his supreme court nominee tuesday night, and if the process goes very smoothly, the court could finally be back to nine members as soon as april — but you won't find many people willing to bet on the process going smoothly. The washington post predicts that gorsuch's confirmation hearings in the senate will be the most heated in more than a decade. Democrats have already signaled that they plan to filibuster the nomination as retribution for the gop's blocking of obama nominee merrick garland. \" this is a stolen seat, \" democratic sen. Jeff merkley said in a statement. A roundup of coverage: the new york times, which predicts that the process will drag on for months, looks at the next steps in the process for the conservative judge, including tight scrutiny of gorsuch's entire career, meetings with senators, mock questioning from a republican \" murder board, \" and the televised hearings joe biden once likened to a \" kabuki dance. \" the hill reports that other democrats lining up against gorsuch include sen. Elizabeth warren, who slammed trump for failing to choose a consensus nominee. \" instead, he carried out his public promise to select a nominee from a list drawn up by far-right activist groups that were financed by big business interests, \" she said. The los angeles times looks at the \" nuclear option \" republicans might use if democrats filibuster the nomination. When democrats controlled the senate, they changed the rules to eliminate filibusters of presidential nominees — except supreme court justices. Republicans could now change the rules to get rid of the exception, a move trump says he supports. Politico looks at five cases it considers key to understanding gorsuch's judicial philosophy, including one involving a seventh-grader arrested for burping. The new york daily news rounds up some controversial moments from the nominee's education and career, including columns he wrote attacking anti-apartheid protesters in the 1980s. In an op-ed at the conservative national review, ed whelan praises gorsuch, a former review contributor, as an originalist and a worthy successor to antonin scalia.",

        "summary": "Whales are known for their intelligence — and now they may become known for their emotions and parental instincts, too. A study in the journal of mammalogy has found that at least seven species of toothed whales — including killer, sperm, and short-finned pilot whales, as well as four dolphin varieties — have been found swimming close by and touching and pushing the bodies of dead younger whales, offering evidence that they mourn their young when they die, national geographic reports. \" they are in pain and stressed, \" says study co-author melissa reggente. \" they know something is wrong. \" the findings add these marine mammals to other animal species — including elephants, giraffes, and chimps — that have been witnessed exhibiting grieving-type behavior. The scientists involved with this study examined ( mostly unpublished ) reports pertaining to these seven species and their apparent mourning habits in three different oceans, observed by other researchers on the open water. One scientific expedition in the red sea, for example, witnessed an indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin push the corpse of a smaller dolphin through the water; another case showed a female killer whale carrying a deceased newborn whale in her mouth. The researchers noted these cases involved an adult grieving for a calf or juvenile whale and that they were probably related. While it may be tempting to say the whales were just acting out of curiosity or couldn't turn off their nurturing instincts, national geographic points out that following a dead whale like this can put the living whale in peril because it's not eating or maintaining social relationships with other whales. Instead, researchers say, the study lends credence to the fact that \" adults mourning their dead young is a common and globally widespread behavior in long-lived and highly sociable/cohesive species of mammals. \" ( sperm whales can also use their heads as battering rams. )",

A former employee of wells fargo merchant services, which is 40 % controlled by first data, tells cnnmoney he was instructed to \" go out and club the baby seals: mom-pop-shops that had no legal support \" while working for the business between 2011 and 2013.

One of the plaintiffs in the suit, a business owner in north carolina, says he was charged $ 500 to terminate the contract after being hit with monthly fees of $ 20 to $ 35. Those fees were the result of not meeting a minimum number of credit card transactions per month, though the account holder says wells fargo told him there would be no such fees. The bank has denied the claims in the suit filed in us district court. It adds its \" negotiated pricing terms are fair and were administrated appropriately. \" nevertheless, a \" shake-up \" of wells fargo's board is coming, with chairman stephen sanger likely to step down in the coming months, reports the wall street journal.",

Trump never established a deep personal connection with zinke but appreciated how he stood tall against criticisms from environmental groups as he worked to roll back protections. But the white house concluded in recent weeks that zinke was likely the cabinet member most vulnerable to investigations led by newly empowered democrats in congress, according to an administration official not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters who spoke on condition of anonymity.",

This is actually an incorrect statement. We would call it fake news. \" he's then shown a clip of him from 2015 in which he said \" there are cars being burnt, there are politicians that are being burnt...

Though waza's code of ethics calls for the \" highest standard of animal welfare, \" activists say handlers threaten animals with sticks at sri lanka's dehiwala zoo, where a hippo, lion, and all the zoo's penguins died recently, the guardian reports. Evidence of poor living conditions and abuse were also reported at other zoos within the world's top zoo body.

Waza's code of ethics notes that if standards aren't met, waza \" would support the closure of such zoos and aquariums. \" however, a rep says none of the zoos have been booted from the organization and only a man caught beating an elephant at a zoo in india was fired. Waza has also been linked to the dolphin slaughter in japan and is accused of cutting a deal with fishermen who select dolphins for captivity, the guardian reports. The chairman of the japanese association of zoos and aquariums, a waza member, says jaza gets the first pick of the dolphins from \" drive hunts, \" which many consider inhumane, conducted separately from similar hunts where dolphins are slaughtered. \" we select the dolphins and the rest are released, \" he said, noting there's no limit on the number of dolphins fishermen can trap in a bay in taiji each september. Waza's executive director says the group \" is not in any way or form participating in the drive hunts \" and has pressured jaza to change its practices. The head of australia for dolphins, which is suing waza, says the body doesn't take its code of ethics seriously and \" they've either got to do their job or stop pretending to be a policeman for zoos and aquariums. \"",

        "summary": "The specter of a financial crisis came back to haunt italy on tuesday, as its markets plunged on fears that the eurozone's third-largest economy is heading toward an election that will be a referendum on whether to stay in the common currency. The wall street journal notes that the crisis is spooking world markets as well, and business insider has a primer on what's going on, with this key point: \" perhaps the simplest way to imagine the eurozone is as a three-legged stool, \" writes will martin. \" germany, france and italy are the legs holding up the rest of the project. Remove any one of those three pillars and the stool falls over. \" the political situation is convoluted.

Us district court judge paul l. Friedman says hinckley can get a place of his own if it's within 75 miles of williamsburg, va., where his mother lives, and if his doctors approve of the location. He also can't have a gun, can't drink or use drugs, and has to carry a cellphone with the gps turned on when he's not at home ( usa today notes he won't have to have a tracking device on his car, however. ) also mandated: he can't make contact with his victims or their families or go anywhere near where past or current us presidents, vps, or members of congress are located. The internet is allowed, though he can't use social media or do searches for himself. And, of course, he still has to meet regularly with a social worker, therapist, or psychologist. \" this court finds that mr. Hinckley will not pose a danger to himself or others if he is permitted to continue residing full-time in williamsburg, virginia, on convalescent leave under the proposed conditions, \" friedman noted in his decision. Hinckley's longtime attorney hopes this is just the next step to complete freedom for his client: he hopes to eventually ask for unconditional release. \" it would be the complete restoration to life as you and i know it, \" barry levine said friday, per the ap. ( meanwhile, john lennon's killer recently revealed he intentionally chose a specific type of bullet. )",

Researchers in massachusetts found that those who drank at least one artificially sweetened beverage per day were about three times as likely to experience a stroke or dementia compared to those who did so less than once a week, reports the guardian. Specifically, daily diet soda drinkers were 2.96 times more likely to experience an ischaemic stroke and 2.89 times more likely to develop alzheimer's, per the study in the american heart association journal stroke. The study was based on questionnaires filled out by more than 4,300 adults as part of the framingham heart study at boston university. \"to our knowledge, our study is the first to report an association between daily intake of artificially sweetened soft drink and increased risk of both all-cause dementia and dementia because of alzheimer's disease, \" write the co-authors. They emphasized that they found just an association, not a causal link, and say more research is necessary to expound on the results.

A series of negotiations appeared to make headway toward a deal to avoid the conflict, but ultimately trump decided to move ahead with the crackdown, at least temporarily scuttling any hope of an agreement. The chinese tariffs of 25 % will hit 659 goods worth a total of $ 50 billion according to chinese news agency xinhua. The first set of tariffs, worth $ 34 billion, will go into effect on july 6 and focuses on agricultural goods and cars. The rest of the tariff will be announced later. The two tariff set is nearly identical to the us's dual-phased tariffs. China also appealed to other countries to pressure the us to end recent protectionist trade policies. Trump recently hit us allies including the european union, canada, and mexico with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that have already taken effect. \" in today's era, launching a trade war is not in the",

A palace spokesperson tells reuters that the palace contacted burger king to let the company know \" we were not happy with them using an image of the king in their campaign, \" and that it is not lawful to depict him for commercial reasons without approval. A brand spokesperson says burger king is measuring how to respond: \" we are deliberating on how to proceed. Should we make a change to our campaign we would communicate that. \"",

Sentenced to two years at attica correctional facility in upstate new york for attempted robbery, he was clearly unwell in 2015, searching the yard for half-smoked cigarettes and claiming to shoot orbs of light. His diagnosis: \" schizoaffective disorder, \" a kind of schizophrenia. And cardo wasn't alone in the us prison system, which houses about 90 % of psychiatric patients under government care. As prison journalist john j. Lennon writes in esquire, it's a strange plan: treating mental illness in prison is twice as expensive as using community care ( state prisons spend $ 5 billion annually to house nonviolent offenders with disorders ), and mentally ill parolees often fall back into legal trouble. Back in the 1800s, america largely moved the mentally ill from penitentiaries to asylums for similar reasons, but by the mid-1900s asylums had become corrupt and the strategy was abandoned. Now, in the era of mass incarceration, almost 400,000 of america's 2.2 million prisoners are mentally ill. Some receive mental-health care behind bars, but critics see a contradiction between mental healing and prison life. \" we're not psychiatrists, \" a corrections officer says in insane, a book reviewed by the new york times. \" we don't know how to take care of people with mental illness. \" or as cardo put it after a fight erupted in the notorious a-block yard at attica, \" oh, man. This place is crazy. \" he was released into public housing in 2016, but still says he can shoot orbs of light. Click to see lennon's full piece.",

            "One florida man vacationing in switzerland was forced to hang on to his hang glider for dear life after the pilot reportedly forgot to attach the man to the aircraft, compelling him to clutch onto the glider with his bare hands at 4,000 feet for more than two minutes, in order to avoid what would likely have been a fatal fall. The incident unfolded on the first day of chris gursky's recent trip abroad to interlaken, footage which he jokingly titled \"swiss misshap \" and shared to youtube on nov. 26. The clip has since gone viral with over a million views. \"my first time hang gliding had an unexpected twist when i left the ground unattached from the glider, \" gursky captioned the clip of his \"near death experience, \" the sun reports. \"warning - content may by disturbing to some, including my wife. \" passenger's 'terrorist ' joke gets him removed from flight, detained \"for 2 minutes, 14 seconds i had to hang on for my life! \" he wrote of the scary scene, in which he hangs onto the glider as the aircraft soars at top speeds over a verdant valley, before coming to a crash landing. Gursky tore his left bicep tendon in the crash, and had to have surgery on his wrist in the wake of the accident.

The sun reports that syed's current lawyer, justin brown, argued that gutierrez, who died in 2004, was too ill to represent him properly in 2000 because of stress and health problems, including multiple sclerosis. Deputy maryland ag thiru vignarajah used notes from gutierrez's case file to counter that she was of sound mind and had decided against using mcclain's testimony because it raised \" warning signs and red flags \" and didn't match syed's account of his movements the day hae min lee was murdered.

The start was delayed 24 minutes; the show was paused five times for technical problems; an actress hung upside down in the air for six minutes. Yet none of it was enough to dissuade many of the fans, who tweeted throughout expressing delight at the aerial stunts. Samples from the wall street journal: \" my heart was racing, \" said one audience member; \" wow on flying thru theater, \" said another. Still, not everyone was impressed. During one pause, a woman shouted, \" i don't know how everyone else feels, but i feel like a guinea pig today — i feel like it's a dress rehearsal, \" the new york times reports, but she was booed. The $ 65 million musical, long delayed due to financial difficulties, has garnered quite a bit of attention thanks to the score, written by u2's bono and the edge, as well as the flying stunts — which injured two actors during rehearsals.

More details on the fallout and the pipeline itself: one on one: after the initial public comments, trump and merkel met one on one and emerged with much nicer diplo-speak. Trump described his relationship with the chancellor as \" very, very good \" and \" tremendous, \" report the wall street journal and the bbc, while merkel said, \" we are good partners and we wish to continue to cooperate in the future. \" democrats including chuck schumer blasted trump's original marks, notes the washington post. \" an embarrassment, \" said schumer.",

Cnn reports that in monday's episode of his no spin news web series, o'reilly noted: \" you know, am i mad at god? yeah, i ' m mad at him. \" he added, \" i wish i had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. Yeah, i ' m mad at him. \" o'reilly, who's denied accusations against him, also called a recent new york times piece on him a \" bunch of garbage \" and said what helps get him through is how \" much rougher \" other people have it, mentioning murder victim kate steinle. As for his foes: \" if they could literally kill me, they would. \" meanwhile, two former fox hosts who seem pretty annoyed at o'reilly: megyn kelly, who tore into him monday, and eric bolling. O'reilly said in an interview with the times posted monday that the past year has been a \" horrendous experience \" for himself and his family, adding that \" eric bolling's son is dead … because of allegations made in my opinion — and i know this to be true — against mr. Bolling. \" bolling retorted in a statement that his son, who died in september, was off-limits, that it was \" beyond inappropriate \" for o'reilly to mention him, and that the coroner had actually indicated his son's death was an accident ( not a suicide, which was o'reilly's implied message ). O'reilly has since apologized on twitter, noting, \" the message i tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more. \" to which cnn's jake tapper wondered aloud in a tweet: \" not to be annoying but isn't the root of the problem really more the actual acts of sexual harassment — not the women objecting to them? \"",

They urinated behind the building, where lochte pulled a metal advertisement from the wall. Bentz says he saw no one enter the bathroom, let alone trash it, as brazilian police have said. They returned to their vehicle, but two security guards ordered them out and on the ground. Both guards eventually pulled their guns. \" i cannot speak to his actions, but ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards, \" bentz wrote. \"after jack and i both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made. \" a passerby stopped to interpret, and the swimmers paid $ 50 for the damage before leaving.

Brand insiders tell the daily mail that it was all about family: he wanted her to leave work behind to focus on raising kids, but she wasn't ready. \" this wasn't one of those occasions when russell was mucking about; he wanted to settle down and have a family, \" says the source. But \" i don't think that's what katy wants. \" there may be more to the story, however. Tmz reports that the two were often seen arguing in public, with their social lives being a particular point of contention: where katy loved to party, brand preferred to head home early. There's also been talk of religion causing a divide. Still, the two are apparently on good terms. \" they've been speaking a lot, \" says the insider. Brand may be particularly happy if he ends up getting more than $ 30 million from his wife, which the daily mail notes is a possibility thanks to the lack of a prenup.

In new zealand, one of the few industrialized countries unscathed by the financial crisis, the suicide rate didn't rise after 2007, the researchers note. But there were some notable exceptions to the trend, which the researchers say show how suicides could be prevented during the next downturn. The suicide rate stayed flat in austria, finland, and sweden, which were hit hard by the recession but have strong social programs in place to help people who have lost their jobs or are struggling financially. \" the social welfare aspects of economic downturns like this can't be ignored, \" a columbia university professor of epidemiology tells usa today. \" when our economic belts get a little too tight, we shouldn't be cutting things that help the average joe. \" the study also found that the increase in the suicide rate was four times higher among men, a trend the researchers say could be because unemployment is a greater \" status threat \" for men, and could be changed with \" greater gender equity in the workplace, \" the los angeles times reports.",

Heather havrilesky agrees that the team's \"signature brand of straightforward storytelling \" does the job in the pacific. \" the battle scenes are suspenseful and riveting, the dialogue is reasonably sharp. \" but she finds herself wishing for more. \"if you're hoping for that extra bit of dramatic flair, if you're expecting one or two unusual choices, a little innovation, some imaginative filmmaking? \" she wonders out loud on salon. \" you won't find it here. \"",

        "summary": "Albert woodfox's time behind bars is not over. An order barring his release was extended today by a federal appeals court, nbc news reports. The timeline: a federal judge this week ordered woodfox's \" immediate \" and \" unconditional \" release and barred the state from trying him a third time in the 1972 death of prison guard brent miller. But the state appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals temporarily blocked his release. That panel today extended the order until the state's appeal plays out. The judges ordered an expedited appeals process, with final legal briefs in the case due aug. 7. Woodfox was placed in solitary in 1972 after the death of miller, whose body was found in an empty prison dormitory; he has spent four decades there. State officials have objected to the term \" solitary confinement \": they say woodfox is allowed to watch tv through the bars of his cell, talk to other inmates in his tier, read books, talk to visiting chaplains, and leave his cell every day for an hour. How polarizing the back-and-forth surrounding woodfox's possible release has been: miller's widow, teenie roger, is convinced woodfox is innocent. \" i wish the state of louisiana would stop spending all this money paying lawyers to keep albert in prison for even longer than the 43 years he has already been there, \" she said in a statement this week, per the advocate. But wanda callender, miller's sister, told the advocate in a phone call this morning that rogers had been married to her brother for just two months before he died ( \" she is not part of our family and never has been \" ) and that woodfox \" has a debt to pay to society, as well as our family. \"",

        "summary": "Yes, corpses smell awful — but more careful scrutiny of that stench may help investigators learn just when a person died, the royal society of chemistry reports. Apparently the trick is to measure volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) like sulfurs, alcohols, and nitro compounds that change in combination and quantity as a body decomposes. So far an international research team has only done it with pig cadavers, but it's a start: \" an odor fingerprint can be created for each stage of decomposition and possibly be used as an additional tool \" to estimate time of death, or post-mortem interval ( pmi ), says study author jean-francois focant. Other forensics experts have made progress trying to pin down pmi, phys.org reports: they've identified five or six bacteria often found in cadavers that may help estimate pmi. They want to create a kit \" so that within two hours any crime lab or medical examiner's office can estimate \" the time of death, says baneshwar singh, a forensic entomologist in virginia. They've learned that certain bacteria could also reveal a body's race or ethnicity. Others attract or repel the black soldier fly to lay eggs in a cadaver. A singh colleague worked on the casey anthony case, where investigators couldn't tell if a nasty smell indicated body decomposition or came from garbage in the back of a vehicle. Now singh and others are trying to nail down the chemical composition of smells that come only from cadavers. On the lighter side, chemist raychelle burks says a good zombie-repellant kit would include two \" chemicals that smell really stinky \": cadaverine and putrescine, which are used to train cadaver dogs, mother jones reports. \" you could make up a death cologne \" to trick zombies into thinking you're dead, she says on an inquiring minds podcast.

City spokesman grant brown tells the ap the band had just entered the parade route tuesday morning when a car behind the group lurched forward into the group and struck multiple people. The driver of the car was a 73-year-old man who appears to have unintentionally hit the gas, with the local police chief noting it looks to be \" a tragic accident by an elderly man. \" drugs and alcohol don't appear to have played a part, brown adds. Fox news reports the victims from gulf shores high school are between the ages of 12 and 17. Witnesses tell fox10 the vehicle was a white suv with \" moaa \" ( for military officers association of america ) on the side; officials are trying to confirm whether the vehicle was actually part of the mardi gras parade, which ended up being canceled.

It's too much, and frankly it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea. \" the post notes that his call to diminish us involvement in nato breaks with almost 70 years of consensus in washington.

Keith kellogg, energy exec carter page, energy consultant george papadopoulos, terrorism expert walid phares, and former pentagon inspector general joseph e. Schmitz. \" taken as a group, it's a fairly obscure set of individuals, \" brookings institution national security expert michael o ' hanlon tells reuters.

        "summary": "As congress debates a strike on syria, the regime and its allies have been given plenty of time to prepare strikes of their own, american officials warn. The us has intercepted an order from iran to iran-supported shiite militias in iraq to launch attacks on the us embassy and other american targets in the event of a syria strike, the wall street journal reports. American officials also fear a strike could lead to attacks on targets inside turkey and jordan, as well as \" a vicious offensive \" against the opposition inside syria. The state department has warned american citizens to avoid nonessential travel to iraq, reports reuters. In related developments: intelligence has also revealed that the syrian regime is moving troops and military equipment — including that used to deploy chemical weapons — to civilian neighborhoods, reports the new york times. In response, president obama has ordered to pentagon to expand its list of about 50 targets inside syria; plans are being drawn up to involve american and french aircraft as well as cruise missiles in the potential strike. Syrian rebels can be added to the list of those preparing lists of targets, the los angeles times finds. Opposition leaders say they are preparing for a nationwide offensive to coincide with the expected launch of american strikes. A spokesman says the free syrian army has been told it will receive advance warning of a us attack but it is not coordinating targets with the americans — though another commander says coordination is under way with \" supporting countries \" including the us. It's not clear whether the us will share information ahead of a strike with other rebel groups — and some groups fear the us will attack al-qaeda-linked insurgents at the same time it hits the regime. Meanwhile, in congress: democratic senators joe manchin and heidi heitkamp are developing an alternative resolution that could delay any us military action, politico reports. The resolution would give syria 45 days to sign an international ban on chemical weapons. If bashar al-assad refuses to sign, then \" all elements of national power will be considered by the united states government, \" the draft reads. In that same 45 days, the president would be required to submit a strategy to congress on how to deal with syria.",

Gingrich's win upends the race heading into the jan. 31 florida primary, and his victory speech to supporters focused more on barack obama than his rivals. \" president obama is a president so weak he makes jimmy carter look strong. \" for romney, his plan to appear on fox news sunday tomorrow — a rare sit-down interview for him — shows that damage control may have already begun, politico notes.

        "summary": "For uruguayans, today's semi-final world cup match is more than a soccer match; it's a symbolic return to glory, writes uruguayan eduardo kaplan in the wall street journal. Uruguay's last period of soccer greatness — the country won gold at the 1924 and 1928 olympics, and world cup victories in 1930 and 1950 — happened to correspond with a golden age of economic prosperity and social freedom. When a junta took over in 1973, the country's soccer fortunes plummeted; it's only qualified for three cups since. Unfortunately, experts don't expect uruguay's magic ride to last much longer. The dutch — who haven't been to the semis since 1970 — are a strong, possession-dominating side, espn reports. Uruguay has relied on defense and counterattacking, but it's missing key defenders and its most creative scorer to cards and injury. Still, coach oscar tabarez is optimistic. \"we are at a party and a celebration to which we were not invited, \" he tells the boston herald. But \"we will enjoy it … the scoreboard has not yet been written. \"",

Whoopi's most prominent accessory to go with the black dames of new york gown was her giant shoulder tattoo, which didn't escape the sharp eyes of those running total beauty's twitter feed. Except the company, which claims it \" brings you expert advice \" on beauty products and deals, made somewhat of a snafu in tweeting a picture of whoopi on the red carpet. \" we had no idea @oprah was tatted, and we love it, \" gushed the now-deleted tweet, which remained up for about 45 minutes while twitter tore it apart. Besides the calls for total beauty to fire its social media manager for not only posting it but also taking so long to yank it, there were many irate posters noting the timing of such a tweet when there's such an uproar over the lack of diversity in hollywood. \" #oscarssowhite they think all black people look the same, i guess, \" lamented one commenter.

The network said four of its journalists were notified by the information ministry that they are no longer allowed to report in the country. Maduro yesterday threatened to expel cnn from venezuela if it doesn't \" rectify \" its coverage of unrest that he says is part of a campaign to topple his socialist government. Colombian news channel ntn24 was suspended from venezuelan cable tv packages a week ago. The government's near-complete control of domestic broadcasters has made cnn en espanol a source of information for many venezuelans trying to follow the unrest. At least six people have died in the violence, reports reuters. Meanwhile, jailed opposition leader leopoldo lopez has urged his supporters to continue peaceful protests. \" i ' m fine, i ask you not to give up, i won't, \" the harvard-educated economist wrote in a note posted online by his wife.

No specific budgeted amounts are given for food or clothing, though after paying the bills ( including a $ 150 car payment and a $ 600 mortgage ), $ 800 worth of monthly \" spending money \" is left over, so apparently the groceries ( and car maintenance, and gasoline, and co-pays, and actual medical expenses, and any number of other things not allowed for on the budget ) come out of that.

But now three professors of psychology have combined for a rebuttal in the los angeles times. \" happiness does matter for your health, \" write ed diener, sarah pressman, and sonja lyubomirsky. \" a lot. \" the findings in the lancet were drawn from the ongoing million women study in which women ages 50 to 69 were surveyed. The happiness factor is based on a single question, no. 306 of 316, in which women were asked how often they felt happy from \" rarely/never \" to \" most of the time. \" about 4 % of the respondents have died so far, and the researchers drew their conclusions based only on those deaths. That methodology is weak, write the professors, especially the use of one simple question, late in a long survey, to gauge happiness. What's more, the study looked at other factors, including stress, and found they had no relationship to longevity, either. \" yet stress is a noncontroversial, established correlate of nearly all health problems, \" they write. \" if the study's stress measure doesn't show a relationship to longevity, \" it should have raised red flags about drawing a similar conclusion in regard to happiness. So ignore the headlines, they advise. The million women study might well have something to tell us about happiness, but not until there's data on far more than 4 % of participants. \" we are happy researchers, \" they conclude, \" and so we plan to be around when that happens. \" click for the full column.",

After all, a woman's happiness for the first six decades of her life could have affected her health, yet the analysis essentially took that out of the picture, as though the middle-aged subjects were a blank slate.

The polygenic hazard score test was created using genetic data from 70,000 people and is based on 31 genetic markers, the guardian reports. Scientists behind the study found that thousands of small genetic variations can add up to a substantial risk for alzheimer's. People the test ranked in the top 10 % for risk of alzheimer's were more than three times as likely to develop the disease during the study. They developed alzheimer's 11 years before those in the lowest 10 % for risk ( 84 years old vs. 95 years old, on average ). There's currently no treatment for alzheimer's, but experts believe that when one is found, it will have to be administered very early on, the telegraph reports. This new test could help doctors identify patients for treatment before it's too late. But one expert not involved in the study says genetics is only one part of determining alzheimer's risk; exercise, diet, and mental activity level all play a part.

Document 3 talks about the new genetic test based on 31 genetic markers and its ability to calculate an individual's yearly risk for Alzheimer's onset. Document 4 presents information about the development of the genetic score for predicting Alzheimer's risk. All documents are relevant to the summary. None.",
            "The summary discusses a new genetic test for predicting Alzheimer's risk based on 31 genetic markers. Document 2 provides information on the development of a genetic risk score for Alzheimer's. Document 3 talks about the test based on 31 genetic markers for calculating the yearly risk of developing Alzheimer's. Document 4 details the development of a genetic score for calculating age-specific risk of Alzheimer's. Document 1, on the other hand, discusses the importance of evaluating genetic risk scores but does not directly relate to the new genetic test mentioned in the summary. Therefore, the irrelevant document is: Document 1",
            "The summary discusses a new genetic test that can predict the age of developing Alzheimer's and the risk of the disease. Document 2 contains technical information about the development of a polygenic hazard score for Alzheimer's risk. This information is not directly related to the new genetic test discussed in the summary. Therefore, the irrelevant document is: Document 2"
