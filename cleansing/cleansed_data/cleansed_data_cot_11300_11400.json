Cummins and elizabeth were found this week at a cabin in northern california, weeks after they disappeared from tennessee. While anthony thomas says he hasn't had a chance to speak to his daughter yet — he hopes to soon — he says she is going to need therapy to recover from the ordeal. It remains unclear whether elizabeth went with cummins willingly, according to the new york daily news. Meanwhile, authorities say cummins ' actions prior to going on the lam show he was planning on kidnapping elizabeth, apparently for sexual purposes.

Cnn reports cummins told his wife he needed to borrow her car for a ( nonexistent ) job interview and took out a $ 4,500 loan \" to meet their financial needs. \" cummins had been suspended from his teaching job for conduct with elizabeth.

        "summary": "Mohamed morsi blasted a court as having no jurisdiction and twice declared that he is egypt's president in the first day of his trial — which was quickly adjourned until jan. 8. The bbc describes a highly charged scene: morsi was flown in from a secret location via helicopter, marking his first public appearance since his july 3 ouster. Once there, he refused to trade his blue suit for a white prison uniform. He was then asked to give his name, and reportedly had this to say: \" i am dr. Mohammed morsi, the president of the republic. I am egypt's legitimate president. I refuse to be tried by this court. \" proceedings were halted after this statement, and the case was subsequently adjourned to allow his attorneys time to go over documents. Morsi ( along with 14 co-defendants, senior brotherhood members ) faces charges of incitement of violence and murder, and could face the death penalty if convicted. The trial comes amid a highly charged atmosphere in a bitterly polarized nation, with a deepening schism between morsi's islamist supporters on one hand and egypt's security establishment and the nation's moderate muslims, secularists, christians, and women on the other. Globalpost has a good primer on why the trial is so significant, with louisa loveluck noting, \" it is still vital that egypt provide some sort of legal basis for the decision to remove morsi from office. \" more here.",

        "summary": "Elon musk has switched his attention from rooting out saboteurs to arguing on twitter about the rights to an image of a farting unicorn. The saga began in february last year, when the tesla ceo tweeted an image of one of colorado potter tom edwards ' mugs, featuring a unicorn farting electricity. The 61-year-old potter, who says he is a fan of musk, was flattered and enjoyed extra sales because of the publicity. But he was dismayed when the company continued to use the image without compensating or even crediting him, the guardian reports. A version of it was used to promote a tesla sketch pad feature, appeared as an icon on the tesla operating system, and was also used in a company christmas card. \" i love the fact that it's in the cars, but i just want them to do the right thing and pay me adequately for it, \" edwards tells the guardian. Musk \" can be a hero for standing up for artists ' rights. \" after the potter's lawyer sent tesla a letter seeking a \" mutual decision \" on the value of the image and local paper westword reported on the issue, his daughter tweeted at musk, and received a snarky response. \" he can sue for money if he wants, but that's kinda lame. If anything, this attention increased his mug sales, \" the ceo tweeted, adding that edwards made \" thousands of dollars as a result. \" the potter, who estimates that he sold an extra 100 mugs because of the initial tweet, says he'd like to be on musk's good side. \" he's really really interesting, \" edwards says. \" but he isn't above copyright law. \"",

            "Tom edwards wants to clear the air with elon musk. The evergreen potter says it's been over a year since the multi-billionaire genius behind tesla first lifted one of his most popular designs: a whimsical drawing of a unicorn passing rainbow-colored gas into a tube that seemingly powers a small electric car. Edwards learned that his art had been lifted when a friend who'd bought a tesla broke the news: edwards's magical, farting unicorn was being used to show off tesla's new sketch pad, embedded in every one of musk's electric cars. Ka-ching, right? wrong. Since discovering that his farting unicorn had been pilfered, edwards has gotten exactly zero dollars from musk. Edwards dreamed up the image back in 2010, as a design for one of the ceramic pieces he sells on wallypots.com. Written on the mug: \"electric cars are good for the environment because electricity comes from magic. \" it's a joke, he explains, because lots of people don't understand where electricity comes from. The $ 28 mug has been one of edwards's biggest sellers. Musk clearly",
            "Tom edwards was thrilled to hear the ceo was a fan of his work, until he saw tesla using a copy without permission tom edwards, a colorado potter, was thrilled when elon musk tweeted a photo of one of his original mugs featuring his cartoon drawing of a unicorn farting electricity.

            "Tom edwards wants to clear the air with elon musk. The evergreen potter says it's been over a year since the multi-billionaire genius behind tesla first lifted one of his most popular designs: a whimsical drawing of a unicorn passing rainbow-colored gas into a tube that seemingly powers a small electric car. Edwards learned that his art had been lifted when a friend who'd bought a tesla broke the news: edwards's magical, farting unicorn was being used to show off tesla's new sketch pad, embedded in every one of musk's electric cars. Ka-ching, right? wrong. Since discovering that his farting unicorn had been pilfered, edwards has gotten exactly zero dollars from musk. Edwards dreamed up the image back in 2010, as a design for one of the ceramic pieces he sells on wallypots.com. Written on the mug: \"electric cars are good for the environment because electricity comes from magic. \" it's a joke, he explains, because lots of people don't understand where electricity comes from. The $ 28 mug has been one of edwards's biggest sellers. Musk clearly",

Upi reports the fossil was dug up at canada's kwataboahegan formation back in the mid-1990s and had been in storage at the royal ontario museum since then. When scientists finally got their hands on it, they found a water-going relative of earthworms and leeches that had the biggest jaws ever seen in a bristle worm, according to a press release. Most bristle worm jaws are a scant few millimeters long and require a microscope to see; this worm's jaws were longer than a centimeter and could be seen with the naked eye. Scientists published their findings tuesday in scientific reports. While the fossils of ancient worms typically contain only their jaws, as their bodies are too soft to be preserved well, scientists can extrapolate that this new species of aquatic worm grew to more than 3 feet long. The giant, large-jawed worm has been named websteroprion armstrongi after derek armstrong, who originally found the fossil, and alex webster, bass player for death metal band cannibal corpse. It seems the three scientists who discovered the worm are big music fans and amateur musicians. ( this new species looks like an ant and a bee had a baby. )",

Analysis of the rediscovered fossil revealed the massive jawed worm to be one-of-a-kind. The 400 million-year-old specimen boasts the largest jaws of its kind. Based on measurements of the worm's jaw and comparisons to related species, scientists estimate the worm would have grown to lengths in excess of three feet.

        "summary": "The family of a 17-year-old who was fatally shot by a homeowner while allegedly breaking into her miami home doesn't believe she was justified in killing him, cbs miami reports. According to the washington post, the state will likely see it differently. Gwendolyn jenrette rushed home last thursday after her security system alerted her to an intruder. There, she shot and killed travon johnson as he was fleeing. There are no signs johnson was armed, and officers arrived just seconds after he was shot. While homeowners who've shot intruders in recent years have been charged with manslaughter and murder, the post believes jenrette is unlikely to face charges, as florida laws strongly protect homeowners in confrontations with intruders. That leaves johnson's family angry and without any easy answers. \"what's wrong with her, \" johnson's sister asks cbs. \"she did not have to shoot him. \" johnson's cousin, nautika harris, echoed that sentiment: \"if she called the police already, why would she shoot him? \" a police spokesperson attempted to answer those questions. \" you have to remember, she's 54 years of age, ok? \" wsvn quotes det. Dan farrin. \" she's a person that obviously is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in. \" the florida attorney's office will decide whether or not to press charges against jenrette. Johnson lived and went to a technical college within blocks of jenrette's home. \"he was not supposed to die like this. He had a future ahead of him, \" harris tells cbs. \" he was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning. \"",

Dr. Ann mckee, director of the cte center at boston university, said she could not \" connect the dots \" between hernandez's severe case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is linked to repeated blows to the head, and his behavior. The 27-year-old hanged himself in april while serving life in prison for murder.

Hernandez inherited a genetic profile that may have made him more susceptible to developing the disease, mckee said. She said hernandez had the most severe case of cte they've seen in someone his age. Hernandez was diagnosed with stage 3, out of 4, of the disease. \" individuals with similar gross findings at autopsy were at least 46 years old at the time of death, \" mckee said.

Coined by entomologist thomas lincoln casey in 1922, \" zyzzyva \" already appears as the last word in several other dictionaries, but it's getting plenty of attention now since the oed is \" the standard-bearer of dictionaries, \" per the washington post. According to the oed blog, \" zyzzyva \" might have been meant as \" an onomatopoeic reference to the noise made by the weevil, \" and it might have been \" chosen deliberately as an alphabetical curiosity. \" other changes to the dictionary: oxford's 2016 word of the year, \" post-truth, \" has been added, along with \" unclick \"; \" swimmer \" ( as it refers to sperm ); the insulting phrase \" son of a bachelor \" which dates to 1657; and various terms for subatomic particles, per time.

John is an art aficionado and loves baroque paintings. \"this one just happened to have a hell of a story, \" he tells the dispatch. While conducting genealogy research, a relative of the serviceman came across photos of the painting and thought it could be stolen, according to an fbi press release. He contacted polish authorities, and the bobbs got a bit of a surprise in july. \"it's not every day we get a phone call from the fbi, \" janis tells the dispatch. The bobbs, who the fbi believes were unaware the painting was stolen, handed it over to polish authorities last thursday.

As rivers swelled, state regulators and environmental groups were monitoring the threat from gigantic hog and poultry farms located in low-lying, flood-prone areas.the industrial-scale farms contain vast pits of manure and urine that can pose a significant pollution threat if they are breached or inundated by floodwaters. Some stream gauges used to monitor river levels failed when they became submerged, but others showed water levels rising steadily, with forecasts calling for rivers to be at or near record levels. The defense department said about 13,500 military personnel were assigned to help relief efforts. President trump says federal emergency workers, first responders, and law enforcement officials are \" working really hard. \" as the storm \" begins to finally recede, they will kick into an even higher gear.

Meanwhile, wardens grew increasingly concerned about gould, particularly as there was open water and thin ice in the area. Gould, however, ended up near a campground in baxter state park, more than 40 miles from camp, where she was able to get into a cabin and build a fire. She stayed the night before encountering snowmobilers who gave her gas on monday morning and met up with game wardens in millinocket around noon, reports the bangor daily news. While the three women are lucky to have survived this \" very dangerous \" incident, \" it is critical to be prepared for an unexpected stay in the woods and those who snowmobile are reminded to bring a communication device, area trail maps, and a means to start a fire, \" macdonald says.",

In fact, the study suggests they were the first people to cross an ocean. \" now we know their relatives are the guys who were the first real human explorers, \" says willerslev. \" our ancestors were sitting being kind of scared of the world while they set out on this exceptional journey across asia and across the sea. \" at some point, they seem to have interbred with an unspecified early human relative whose dna has left a small mark on their modern genetic makeup — it accounts for about 4 % of it. The study, based on analysis of 83 indigenous australians and 25 papuans, found that the group remained largely isolated until about 4,000 years ago, when they encountered populations from asia and then europe. ( a related study found that almost everyone is descended from a single wave of african migrants. )",

Surveillance video shows the girls were in the car about 17 minutes before police arrived, and the girls were ok. One unusual twist: pirlot told officers that when she was a baby, her own mother was arrested for leaving her in a car while her mother watched a packers game. Upon her arrest, pirlot told police she didn't want to deal with hassle of belting the children into a shopping cart. The youngest girl was in an infant carrier with a blanket inside the car, though police say her bare feet were sticking out, reports the milwaukee journal sentinel. Two of the counts pirlot faces are felonies, which could mean jail time if she's convicted. Officers who responded bought diapers for the younger girls.

Reuters/larry downing the assertion, made by republican james lankford, comes as congressional investigators probing moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election are focusing on how russian agents used social media to spread divisive political content. \"we watched, even this weekend, the russians and their troll farms, their internet folks, start hashtagging out #takeaknee and also hashtagging out #boycottnfl, \" lankford, who sits on the senate intelligence committee, said during a hearing on threats faced by the united states. \"they were taking both sides of the argument this weekend... To try to raise the noise level of america and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they are trying to push divisiveness in this country, \" lankford said. Lankford did not provide evidence to corroborate his statement."

Her co-workers filed a missing-person report shortly after that july 1988 gathering, but no matter how much digging police did — both in their probe and literally, in the cellar of the 28-year-old's utah home — their efforts turned up empty, per ksl. That may have changed monday, when the current occupant of her former spanish fork home noticed a sinking dirt floor in the cellar, recalled a neighbor's tale of the missing case, and began digging with a friend. Their discovery, 18 inches down: a human skull encased in plastic mesh and a blanket. Questioned by police when case's disappearance was first reported: case's live-in boyfriend, michael kufrin, who had other troubles with the law, including gun and vehicle theft charges, reported the deseret news at the time. Per the salt lake tribune, cops had previously noted that case allegedly flirted with other men at that 1988 party, and witnesses reported friction between her and kufrin, who's cited in a police release this week as a \" person of interest. \" he was extradited from nevada in 1989 to answer queries about case's disappearance, after which he'd called her in sick to work, then offered a story about how she'd traveled to reno with a friend to buy a car ( that friend denied it ). A neighbor interviewed by police was reinterviewed recently, and recalls an encounter with kufrin just days after case vanished, per kutv. She says kufrin, who's since fallen off the map, banged on her door to show her a machete with blood on it, claiming he'd killed a stray dog.

            "There's a long-running theory that mark zuckerberg has presidential aspirations. It makes sense to wonder. After all, if the civically engaged and ambitious billionaire leader of the most powerful media company on the planet wanted to take on a new challenge, why not try running a country? it's not like he has many other opportunities for a promotion. But only in recent weeks has a zuckerberg run for the american presidency started to seem like a legitimate possibility. First there was his personal challenge for 2017: zuckerberg's aiming to visit and meet with people in all 50 states by the end of the year. And not just that, but he framed the exercise in a way that sounds, well, political: \"going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history, \" he wrote in a facebook post. \"for decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than i have felt in my lifetime.

But national geographic reports that we should all maybe not be scaring our cats with cucumbers. According to upvoted, the first cat-scared-by-cucumber video appears to have been uploaded in may and went viral by july or so. Countless others followed, to the point where reddit has an entire cucumbers scaring cats community. The idea behind these videos is that if you put a cucumber behind a cat, it ' ll freak out when it sees it. But experts say that's bad for the cats, with some calling the videos \" cruel \" and \" despicable, \" national geographic reports. \" if you cause stress to an animal, that's probably not a good thing, \" animal behaviorist jill goldman tells national geographic. \" if you do it for laughs, it makes me question your humanity. \" she says startling cats can cause them to injure themselves or become chronically stressed. But why exactly are cats scared of cucumbers? goldman says it's simply a natural reaction to seeing an object where they aren't used to seeing it. A number of animal experts tell upvoted it could also be because cats associate the cucumbers with snakes, and their brains — like the brains of all mammals — are reportedly predisposed to fear snakes. Veterinary behaviorist dr. Katherine houpt says that's unlikely, as cats hunt snakes in the wild. Regardless, she agrees: stop scaring your cats with cucumbers.

Hampering their efforts is the sheer amount of debris, including the fact that 75 % of the structure has fallen into the basement, cnn notes; there's also water in the basement and smaller fires that continue to burn, abc news reports. The search for victims could take days, investigators say. A crane is being used to move larger pieces, including steel beams weighing up to 7 tons. Capt. Robert howarth of the anne arundel county fd compared the disaster to a commercial blaze rather than a residential one. \" [ you're ] looking at five standard houses put together, \" he tells cnn. \" there are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. \" a fire protection expert at the university of maryland tells the post that functioning smoke alarms — required in all maryland residences — likely would have given anyone inside time to get out. As for the pyles and their grandkids, initial reports indicated they were out of town during the fire, but it's now been determined they're unaccounted for, cnn notes.

Robert pruett, initially sentenced to 99 years in prison as an accomplice to a 1995 murder when he was 15, was then sentenced to death in 2002 over the 1999 killing of guard daniel nagle at a prison near corpus christi, but he maintains he was framed. Pruett, now 35, had been punished for eating in an unauthorized area and the disciplinary report was found torn up near nagle's body with traces of what one dna test revealed was nagle's blood. A judge halted yesterday's scheduled lethal injection so dna testing could be performed on a metal shank used to stab the guard, the guardian reports. The test should be completed by may 28, reuters reports. In halting the execution, judge bert richardson said that though attempts by pruett's lawyers to delay his death \" appear to be unreasonable, it is not clear they, in fact, are unreasonable. \" a texas department of criminal justice rep tells the ap pruett was \" excited to hear the news. \" pruett argues he was framed for nagle's murder just as he was about to file a grievance describing corruption and safety concerns at the prison. His blood or fingerprints have not been found on the shank so far, nor was nagle's blood found on pruett, though several inmates testified against him; some were rewarded with better treatment. Pruett's lawyers say their client wasn't given adequate legal advice during sentencing and allege evidence was damaged because it wasn't properly stored.",

The new york times, however, says the prospect of leaving millions of americans uninsured all but guarantees any such vote would fail. In its recap of monday night's turn of events, politico reports that trump was \" blindsided \" by the decision of sens.

The problem is summed up in the headline: \" black girls don't get to be depressed. \" as a kid, she was classified as \" moody \" or \" angry, \" or as someone with an \" attitude problem, \" but she was never diagnosed with depression because \" that's something that happened to white people on television. \" in her world, it didn't exist. Even after a suicide attempt in 1993, she was told merely, \" lol, toughen up, \" and went back to school as usual on the following monday. Irby finally sought medical help as an adult after a panic attack so severe she thought she was dying of a heart attack. She ended up in the hospital and felt nothing but humiliation and weakness while talking to a young doctor. \" i was sure i was letting rosa parks and harriet tubman down by talking about my silly little feelings. \" and it's not just her: \" if you're african-american and female, not only are you expected to be resilient enough to just take the hits and keep going, but if you can't, you're a black bitch with an attitude. \" ( click for irby's full column, which manages to be wickedly funny as well as poignant. )",

She entered the restaurant with a man, the same person seen on surveillance video putting his arm around her after she apparently got lost on foot after a night out with friends. He bought alcohol, and they left after about 15 minutes, say police. Authorities think graham left the mall with the unidentified man in his car. Police searched the vehicle yesterday, along with his condo. \" i ' m not calling him a suspect, \" says police chief tim longo, as quoted in the daily progress. \" we're interested in him. \" the man — described by police as a 6-foot-2, 270-pound black man, age 32 — is not in custody. \" people saw hannah.

        "summary": "Air safety investigators have a \" high degree of confidence \" that aircraft debris found in the western indian ocean is of a wing component unique to the boeing 777, the same model as the malaysia airlines plane that disappeared last year, a us official said yesterday. Air safety investigators — one of them a boeing investigator — have identified the component as a \" flaperon \" from the trailing edge of a 777 wing, the us official said. While it's too early to know if the piece belongs to mh370, nbc news does have this to say: \" they believe it is a piece... From a boeing triple 7 and there is only one 777 missing in the world right now — mh370. \" here are 7 things to know about the possible clue and where it was found: the last primary radar contact with malaysia airlines flight 370 placed its position over the andaman sea about 230 miles northwest of the malaysian city of penang. The french island of reunion is about 3,500 miles southwest of penang, according to a google map. The sea-crusted wing part is about 6 feet long. Investigators have found a number on the part, but it is not a serial or registration number, per australian transport minister warren truss. It could be a maintenance number, which may help investigators figure out what plane it belongs to, he says. How long will it take to determine if mh370 is it's source? malaysian deputy transport minister aziz kaprawi had this to say, by way of the ap: \" the shape and size of the flaperon is similar to that of a boeing 777. It will take less than two days to verify if it is so and whether it is from mh370. \" malaysia's prime minister today announced the debris will be sent to france for investigation, per the ap. The discovery is unlikely to alter the seabed search, says australia's transport safety bureau chief commissioner. If the find proves to be part of the missing aircraft, it would be consistent with the theory that the plane crashed within the 46,000-square-mile search area, 1,100 miles southwest of australia, he says. If confirmed as from mh370, a former ntsb member tells the ap the debris is unlikely to provide much help in tracing the oceans currents back to the location of the main wreckage. \" it's going to be hard to say with any certainty where the source of this was, \" he says. \" it just confirms that the airplane is in the water and hasn't been hijacked to some remote place. \" but the piece could provide valuable clues to investigators trying to figure",

        "summary": "The first study of its kind shows that newborns ' brains grow fast — figure a staggering 1 % a day immediately after birth, though it slows to about half that rate by the end of three months. Using mri scans of 87 newborns ' brains, researchers discovered that the first weeks of life see the fastest growth — those little brains grow by 64 % in three months. The cerebellum, responsible for movement, grows the fastest and the memory-forming hippocampus the slowest, livescience reports. Researchers from uc san diego and the university of hawaii took more than 200 mri scans of full-term and preemie babies, starting when the kids were just 2 days old. The scans found that preemies ' brains are 2 % smaller than average at the end of 90 days, suggesting that medically unnecessary induced labor can stunt a baby's brain development, says uc san diego's dominic holland. \" the brains of premature babies actually grow faster than those of term-born babies, but that's because they're effectively younger — and younger means faster growth, \" he adds. Researchers say using mri or ct scans will prove to be a much more effective way to track development. Scans should lead to more exact growth charts — replacing the old method of measuring the skull with measuring tape — and help identify disorders such as autism or brain injury early. Researchers plan to look further into how alcohol and drug use during pregnancy affects brain development. ( meanwhile, scientists dispel the notion that we use only 10 % of our brains. )",

Babies ' brains grow by 1 percent each day beginning right after infants are born, according to a new study that aimed to map newborns ' brains during their first three months of life. Researchers scanned the brains of 87 healthy newborns 211 times, starting when the babies were only 2 days old. They found that the newborn brain grows extraordinarily fast right after birth, but slows down to a growth rate of 0.4 percent per day by the end of three months. Overall, infants ' brains grew by 64 percent in the first 90 days, according to the study. The average brain size was 20 cubic inches ( 341 cubic centimeters ) at birth, and 34 cubic inches ( 558 cubic cm ) at 90 days. In other words, the brains of newborns grew from about 33 percent of the average adult brain size to 55 percent of it in three months. The researchers noted that the brains of the infants who were born one week earlier than the average in the study ( about 38 weeks ), were 5 percent smaller than the average. By the end of the three months, the difference between these babies, which the researchers said were preterm, and the full-term babies",
            "News_release a recent study conducted by researchers at the university of california, san diego school of medicine and the university of hawaii demonstrates a new approach to measuring early brain development of infants, resulting in more accurate whole brain growth charts and providing the first estimates for growth trajectories of subcortical areas during the first three months after birth. Assessing the size, asymmetry and rate of growth of different brain regions could be key in detecting and treating the earliest signs of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or perinatal brain injury. The study will be published in jama neurology on august 11. For the first time, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the newborn brain to calculate the volume of multiple brain regions and to map out regional growth trajectories during the infant's first 90 days of life. The study followed the brain growth of full term and premature babies with no neurological or major health issues. \"a better understanding of when and how neurodevelopmental disorders arise in the postnatal period may help assist in therapeutic development, while being able to quantify related changes in structure size would likely facilitate monitoring response to therapeutic intervention.

The average brain size was 20 cubic inches ( 341 cubic centimeters ) at birth, and 34 cubic inches ( 558 cubic cm ) at 90 days. In other words, the brains of newborns grew from about 33 percent of the average adult brain size to 55 percent of it in three months. The researchers noted that the brains of the infants who were born one week earlier than the average in the study ( about 38 weeks ), were 5 percent smaller than the average. By the end of the three months, the difference between these babies, which the researchers said were preterm, and the full-term babies",
            "News_release a recent study conducted by researchers at the university of california, san diego school of medicine and the university of hawaii demonstrates a new approach to measuring early brain development of infants, resulting in more accurate whole brain growth charts and providing the first estimates for growth trajectories of subcortical areas during the first three months after birth. Assessing the size, asymmetry and rate of growth of different brain regions could be key in detecting and treating the earliest signs of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or perinatal brain injury. The study will be published in jama neurology on august 11. For the first time, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the newborn brain to calculate the volume of multiple brain regions and to map out regional growth trajectories during the infant's first 90 days of life. The study followed the brain growth of full term and premature babies with no neurological or major health issues. \"a better understanding of when and how neurodevelopmental disorders arise in the postnatal period may help assist in therapeutic development, while being able to quantify related changes in structure size would likely facilitate monitoring response to therapeutic intervention. Early intervention during a period of high neuroplasticity could mitigate the severity of the disorders in later years, \" said dominic holland, phd, first author of the study and researcher in the department of neurosciences at"

In a research paper published thursday in science, nasa reveals its cassini spacecraft discovered molecular hydrogen in the plumes of vapor that erupt into space from the huge ocean sitting below enceladus ' layer of ice. The plumes themselves are evidence of hydrothermal vents in enceladus ' ocean. On earth, microbial life thrives near such vents and feeds on molecular hydrogen. On enceladus, saturn's sixth largest moon, that molecular hydrogen would be formed by reactions between hot water and rock, space.com reports. Hunter waite, lead author of the paper, says the discovery has them \" very excited, \" and nasa's director of planetary science tells the new york times there's a \" tremendous opportunity \" to \" see if there's life \" on enceladus, which is now believed to have all the components need for life, including organics, water, and an energy source. Astronomers believe similar conditions also exist on europa, one of jupiter's moons.

The parents of seth rich — fatally shot in what police say was an attempted robbery in washington, dc, in july 2016 — allege the network, reporter malia zimmerman, and frequent fox guest ed butowsky \" intentionally exploited \" the 27-year-old's death in an attempt to discharge allegations that president trump colluded with russia. Following rich's death, butowsky, a wealthy businessman and trump supporter, hired private investigator rod wheeler to look into the case. His investigation was then cited in a may 2017 article by zimmerman, retracted days later, suggesting rich's death came after he leaked dnc emails to wikileaks. Though intelligence officials say russia was behind the leak of 20,000 dnc emails, sean hannity went on to suggest people linked to hillary clinton had murdered rich. Wheeler later sued fox, claiming the network worked with the white house and invented quotes attributed to him to support the conspiracy theory. In their own lawsuit seeking $ 75,000 for emotional distress and negligence, joel and mary rich agree the article was a \" sham story \" containing \" false and fabricated facts \" meant to portray rich, a voter-expansion data director, as a \" criminal and traitor, \" per abc news and nbc washington. The actions of the defendants went \" beyond all possible bounds of decency and are atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community, \" the suit adds, per cnn.

Sekar kathiresan puts it. While the analysis of health data on some 55,000 people did reveal that \" bad \" genes can double your heart disease risk, researchers found that participants who had high genetic risk but led a \" favorable \" lifestyle can halve their risk. On the flip side, those dealt a good genetic hand who led an \" unfavorable \" lifestyle lost about half the genetic advantage, reports the new york times. So how to move into the favorable category? the study's authors focused on four indicators of a healthy lifestyle: no current smoking, no obesity, regular physical activity ( the times defines this as at least once a week ), and healthy diet. Adhering to at least three of the four factors places one in the favorable column; unfavorable is one factor or less. \" patients may equate dna-based risk estimates with determinism, a perceived lack of control over the ability to improve outcomes, \" the researchers write. \" however, our results provide evidence that lifestyle factors may powerfully modify risk regardless of the patient's genetic risk profile. \" but since a favorable lifestyle was tied to a reduced risk across each stratum of genetic risk, even those with \" good \" genes should take note.",

So, he wondered, why not look at lifestyles and genetics in the same populations and see how much each contributes? the researchers began about a year and a half ago, analyzing data from four large studies that not only had genetic data on participants but also had information on lifestyles and on which participants developed heart disease. The investigators developed a genetic score based on 50 genes associated with heart disease. They developed a lifestyle score based on whether people smoked, whether they exercised at least once a week, whether they followed a healthy diet — one with fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains and nuts — and whether they were obese. An optimum lifestyle score was defined as having three or all four of these elements, which is important, dr.

The study looked at 86 tree species between 1980 and 2015, smithsonian reports. Over those 35 years, 73 % of the trees saw their population centers move westward, and 62 % saw them move northward. According to science alert, westbound trees moved by about 9.5 miles per decade; northward trees moved about 6.8 miles per decade. The trees themselves weren't moving, groot-style; instead their population centers shifted as saplings sprouted up in new areas and trees in older areas died off, the atlantic explains. Scientists have long expected tree populations to move north in search of cooler temperatures as the effects of climate change increase. However, the move west was unexpected — and difficult to explain. \"when the result came out that trees are moving westward, our eyeballs opened wide, \" study author songlin fei says. \" like, 'wow, what's going on with this? ' \" researchers hypothesize that climate change-related shifts in precipitation are causing the westward movement. The great plains have received much more precipitation than normal over the past few decades, while the southeast has received much less. But, the researchers admit precipitation can only account for about 20 % of the westward movement. ( newly discovered forests could cover 60 % of australia. )",

        "summary": "Now that the final whistle has blown and a champion has been crowned, it's time to reflect on the lessons of the 2014 world cup. Here are some of our favorite takeaways: fifa needs to address concussions. We saw numerous people take hard shots to the head and keep on playing, in part because soccer's substitution rules are so stringent — one of those players was germany's christoph kramer, and he looked \" unquestionably dazed and confused \" when he fell again 15 minutes after getting hit in the final, amy bass at cnn notes. That could be us. The philosophy that led to germany's football turnaround was instituted by none other than current us coach jurgen klinsmann, gil lebreton at the star-telegram points out. \" who's to say he won't make the us team a more legitimate global force by 2016? \" he asks. After all, the us may not have been as good as argentina — but both teams lost to germany by the same score. Teamwork matters. \" one man, even if he is the greatest soccer player of his generation, can't beat the best team in the world, \" lebreton adds, reiterating the narrative that while argentina had the best player in lionel messi, germany had the better team. Again, that's a lesson that bodes well for the us. Talent matters. Tomas chamorro-premuzic at forbes writes that the big moments \" were all marked by predictable differences in talent. \" had argentina's gonzalo higuain or rodrigo palacio had the technique of germany's mario götze, argentina could have won.... But not without personality. Despite his mvp award, few believe messi was the best player, despite being the most gifted. \" his performance during the big games confirmed what half of argentina already knew: messi needs a personality transplant, \" chamorro-premuzic writes. He was \" largely absent from yesterday's game. \" the us sort of loves soccer! sort of! \" to be sure, more than ever before, american fans got on the world cup wagon, \" bass writes, and not all of them stopped watching after the us went out. But the familiar refrains of naysayers were as loud as ever. \" there is only one thing we can count on in four years: there will be those who yet again claim that soccer has finally arrived and those who say that it hasn't and never will. \"",

        "summary": "There is no link between the controversial hpv vaccine — derided as a \" license to have sex \" by critics — and increased sexual activity in vaccinated girls, a new study finds. Researchers examined the medical records of more than 1,000 girls who were vaccinated at age 11 or 12, looking for \" markers \" of sexual activity like stds, pregnancy, or requests for birth control advice over the following three years, cbs reports. They found very low rates of the markers, and no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls. Hpv is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the us and can cause several kinds of cancer, but vaccination rates remain low despite recommendations from health officials, the new york times reports. Risky sexual behavior \" has been raised as a concern around hpv vaccination and invoked as a reason for not vaccinating, but has no support empirically, and is clinically and ethically wrong, \" a pediatrics professor at indiana university school of medicine tells usa today. The new study \" really demonstrates that getting the hpv vaccination is not somehow a signal to start having unprotected sex, \" he says.",

Fortune reports the australian app-development company re-engineered its approach after calculating that only about half its hires ended up working out. Fast company details the current hiring process: it all begins with the company imagining an ideal hire. Then, an hr person sifts through résumés and holds phone interviews; some 10 % to 20 % of applicants will be sent on to the next step. Some 70 % of those people will then be cut in competency tests that require them to score in that top 5 % bracket, co-founder josiah humphrey tells fast company. Next is a half-day interview, followed by an additional three-to-five-hour one. In that second meeting, one of the two interviewers spends the time examining your body language. And you might be asked to come in and do a trial workday. Of course, the team is also investigating your references behind the scenes, and the process involves about 22 hours of work for them per candidate. \" you start seeing glimmers of people's personalities they can't hide, things you would never be able to see in a traditional job interview, \" co-founder mark mcdonald told business insider in november. The goal, he says, is to ensure hires ( 50 of its 130 employees joined in the past three months ) stay on for the long haul, and about 90 % now do.

Koch, the master showman of city hall, who parlayed shrewd political instincts and plenty of chutzpah into three tumultuous terms as new york's mayor with all the tenacity, zest and combativeness that personified his city of golden dreams, died friday. He was 88. Mr. Koch's spokesman, george arzt, said he died of congestive heart failure at 2 a.m. At newyork-presbyterian/columbia hospital. The former mayor had experienced coronary and other medical problems since leaving office in 1989.

The $ 500 million lawsuit by the oglala tribe centered on these numbers: the neighboring town of whiteclay, nebraska, has only a dozen residents, but it has four stores that sell more than 4 million cans of beer a year. Tribe leaders charged that anheuser-busch, molson coors brewing company, millercoors, and pabst brewing company stocked the town knowing full well that the beer would end up in the hands of residents of the supposedly dry reservation. The judge's conclusion: there's \" little question \" that the booze sold in whiteclay plays a big role in the reservation's alcohol abuse. \" and it may well be that the defendants could, or should, do more to try to improve those conditions for members of the tribe. But that is not the same as saying that a federal court has jurisdiction to order them to do so. \" he left the door open, however, for the tribe to pursue the matter in state court, reports ap, and the judge's sympathetic language might bode well.",
