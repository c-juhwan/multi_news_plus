        "summary": "Hillary clinton briefly became emotional while testifying before the senate foreign relations committee today, tearing up as she recalled the aftermath of the benghazi attack. \" to me this is not just a matter of policy. It's personal, \" clinton said in her opening statement. Her voice broke as she went on: \" i stood next to president obama as marines carried those flag-draped coffins off the plane at andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children. \" other highlights so far include: \" as i have said many times since september 11, i take responsibility, \" clinton said earlier in her prepared remarks, according to politico. \" nobody is more committed to getting this right. \" that didn't stop republicans from pushing clinton. \" it's my sense that as a nation we were woefully unprepared, \" bob corker said. He asked why security changes weren't made when officials were \" screaming out \" for help, according to cnn. Clinton said they had been, and outlined many steps she'd implemented or proposed to prevent future incidents. Clinton was also pressed on susan rice's infamous talk show assertions that the attack was a spontaneous protest. \" i personally was not focused on talking points. I was focused on keeping our people safe, \" clinton said. \" it was an intelligence product. \" she said she \" absolutely \" stood by her initial statement, within 24 hours of the incident, that it had been the work of \" heavily armed militants. \" when republican ron johnson pressed clinton on why officials couldn't have ascertained immediately that there hadn't been a protest, she got angry. \" we had four dead americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some americans? what difference at this point does it make?! \" clinton cried, slamming the table. She said she'd rather focus on capturing those responsible than figuring out their motives. John mccain was combative as well, saying that the us hadn't provided enough security for libya, and that her answers were \" not satisfactory \" regarding rice's comments. \" the american people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don't deserve false answers, \" he said. Clinton responded that \" we just have a disagreement \" regarding what happened in explaining the events to the public. She also said congressional holds were partly to blame",

Authorities say the trooper detected drug activity inside the vehicle and found 14 grams of marijuana, four amphetamine pills and 3 grams of mushrooms. Von wittkamp was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, a felony. Penn — who had an acting role in 2017's war machine — was charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession of marijuana. Both were taken to the hamilton county jail. Last year, penn discussed his struggle with meth with the evening standard, noting an ultimatum from his dad led him to rehab. \" i woke up in hospital and my dad said,'rehab? or bus bench?

What we do is do away with the gun show loophole, where people now are buying guns from unlicensed dealers. What we do is do away with the straw man provision, where you can buy a gun legally and then sell it to somebody"

            "The door to the principal's office opened suddenly. Mercy álvarez turned and watched a miami-dade schools police officer enter to take her 7-year-old son into custody. Pain pierced her heart when her son was handcuffed. \"do not worry, my love, \" she muttered to him, her voice choked with tears. It was the second time in less than three months that school authorities punished her son by calling the police for behavioral problems. On this occasion, the boy supposedly hit the teacher after a scolding, according to the police report. A tantrum, for sure. But a sanction that álvarez considers disproportionate and outrageous. \"this is police abuse; a whim of the officer, because my son was calm when they came to look for him, \" says the mother, an independent television and radio producer, speaking to el nuevo herald. \"the principal, the counselor, and two other people tried to prevent that action and the officer took the child anyway. \" never miss a local story.

Malachi love-robinson looked a little young to be a doctor. That's because he's only 18 years old — and he isn't a doctor. Police say the doogie howser wannabe was arrested after an undercover officer posed as a patient and received a physical exam and medical advice from the teen, nbc news reports. He has been charged with practicing medicine without a license, and authorities say he was cited by the state health department for doing the same thing a few months ago. On the medical office's website, love-robinson poses in a white coat and describes himself as a \" well-rounded professional. \" according to wpbf, love-robinson is the same teenager who posed as an ob-gyn at st. Mary's medical center in west palm beach for a month last year. He admitted to the station last month that he was that teen, but he claimed he wasn't impersonating a doctor when he roamed the medical center wearing a lab coat and stethoscope. \" i requested to shadow physicians — next thing i know, cops are there, that's all i know, \" he said. Love-robinson also apparently made house calls: a palm beach county sheriff's office spokesman tells wpbf that an 86-year-old woman alleges that love-robinson visited her house when she was sick, told her she needed to go to a hospital — and stole her checkbook.

Agents used a sledge hammer and power saws to bust into the school, reports the san francisco chronicle. The entire building was surrounded with yellow crime scene tape as agents exited the building with trash bags filled with potential evidence. Everything's \" under seal, \" said a spokesman for the irs, referring to the search warrant and court documents relating to the probe. \" we're not able to comment as far as the nature of this ongoing investigation. \" members of the drug enforcement administration and the us marshals service were also involved in the raid. Agents also swept into the home of oaksterdam founder richard lee, but he was not arrested, reports ap.

The raid comes just weeks after oakland city officials issued preliminary approval for four new medial marijuana dispensaries.

The 18-year-old says administrators at kaifukan high school in osaka threatened to expel her in 2015 if she didn't dye her hair black, then kicked her out after she obliged because streaks of her naturally brown hair were still visible. The lawsuit filed against the osaka prefectural government says the unidentified teen went on to dye her hair multiple times only to suffer a rash on her scalp and damage to her hair, per the guardian. The lawsuit seeking $ 20,000 also alleges mental suffering, reports quartz. The osaka prefecture is asking the court to reject the claim, with the head of kaifukan high school saying the school forbids students to dye or bleach their hair, per reuters. However, the rule appears aimed at preventing students from lightening their hair, and he declined to comment on whether it would be ok to do the reverse and dye brown hair black. Highlighting a \" stigma against ' un-japanese ' characteristics \" in japan, quartz notes several other schools have strict rules regarding appearance, including how girls can wear their hair and eyebrows.

( associated press ) in this wednesday, feb. 6, 2013 photo, bystanders watch as a woman accused of witchcraft is burned alive in the western highlands provincial capital of mount hagen in papua new guinea. The 20-year-old... ( associated press ) a mob stripped, tortured and bound a woman accused of witchcraft, then burned her alive in front of hundreds of horrified witnesses in a papua new guinea town, police said friday. It was the latest sorcery-related killing in this south pacific island nation. Bystanders, including many children, watched and some took photographs of wednesday's brutal slaying. Grisly pictures were published on the front pages of the country's biggest circulating newspapers, the national and post-courier, while the prime minister, police and diplomats condemned the killing. In rural papua new guinea, witchcraft is often blamed for unexplained misfortunes. Sorcery has traditionally been countered by sorcery, but responses to allegations of witchcraft have become increasingly violent in recent years. Kepari leniata, a 20-year-old mother, had been accused of sorcery by relatives of a 6-year-old boy who died in the hospital the day before. She was tortured",

The shadow world of spirits is ever-present - and available for manipulation by those with the arcane keys. These are sanguma men or meri - male or female sorcerers, people who for the most part conceal their skills cunningly. There are benign sorcerers, who are available to help heal, improve food garden productivity, obtain good exam results or, of course, lure an attractive person to fall in love with you - for a consideration, of course. Some offer a tariff list. In a remote world lacking scientific explanation, in which life could be brutish and short, it was natural that people sought not only a way to understand how their world worked, but also to find a way to take a measure of control over it. But that magic retains the degree of influence it does in png disappoints the mainstream churches, which claim the allegiance of most of the seven million population, and points to the failure both of the education system and of economic development.

In the month following the death of boyfriend david wilson, mccready's father told the court she didn't get out of bed for three weeks and started mixing alcohol and prescription pills. She slept all day, stopped bathing, and wasn't caring for her two children, one age 6 and the other — her son with wilson — just 9 months, father tim said, in an effort to have those children removed from mccready's care. She was eventually ordered into a treatment facility, where she stayed for two days before leaving for an outpatient treatment center, radar reports. She had placed her children in foster care. Mccready had also been working on a song for wilson, according to a private investigator who had been working with mccready. Danno hanks tells e! that courtney dashe, a fan of mccready's as well as a singer in her own right, wrote a song called \" i ' ll see you yesterday \" and brought it to mccready; mccready then brought it to hanks and asked him to help her with a video for it. \" she said she wanted to put together this video to help people deal when someone had suffered a suicide in their life and god, she was literally having me write her suicide note, \" he says. Two mccready exes are also weighing in: billy mcknight, the father of mccready's older child, tells today her suicide is \" sad \" but not \" a major shock because she's just been battling demons for so long. \" and one of those demons, of course, was roger clemens, with whom mccready was involved when she was a teenager. In a statement apparently devoid of emotion, the baseball star says, \" yes, that is sad news. I had heard over time that she was trying to get peace and direction in her life.

This week, mr. Obama commuted the sentences of 46 such prisoners and gave a speech calling for legislation revamping sentencing rules by the end of the year. He came to the federal correctional institution el reno, about 30 miles west of oklahoma city, for a firsthand look at what he is focused on. Accompanied by aides, correctional officials and a phalanx of secret service agents, mr. Obama passed through multiple layers of metal gates and fences topped by concertina wire gleaming in the oklahoma sun to enter the facility and talk with some of the nonviolent drug offenders who he argues should not be serving such long sentences. El reno, a medium-security prison with a minimum-security satellite camp that together house 1,300 men, was locked down for the visit. The campus of two-story brick buildings separated by neatly trimmed grass remained eerily silent and empty, with no one in sight other than a few security officers peering through binoculars from a rooftop. Rather than bursting at the seams, it had the antiseptic feel of an abandoned military base, except for the cattle being raised on the property.",

Mandatory minimum sentences and other harsh drug laws are responsible for prison overcrowding and punishments that don't fit the crime, he has said.

As live science notes, it's impossible to say conclusively what is behind the death of any individual bear, but nicklen says the answer is obvious in this case: climate change. Melting sea ice has made it difficult for the bears to gain access to a staple of their diet, seals. In the video, shot in late summer, the rail-thin bear is seen rummaging through a trash can. \" when scientists say bears are going extinct, i want people to realize what it looks like, \" says nicklen. \" this is what a starving bear looks like. \" in its coverage of the video, the guardian cites a 2015 study from the international union for the conservation of nature citing rising temperatures as the no. 1 threat facing the global population of 26,000 polar bears. The study documents an increasing number of ice-free days in arctic regions and suggests that the bear population could drop 30 % by 2050 and eventually reach a tipping point after which extinction is inevitable. So why didn't nicklen and the crew help this particular bear? it would have been a futile effort that would only have prolonged the bear's agony, he says. Plus, feeding bears is illegal in canada.

Photo: karen warren, houston chronicle photo: karen warren, houston chronicle image 1 of / 40 caption close 6 members of spring family shot to death in likely domestic dispute 1 / 40 back to gallery six members of a spring family, including four children and two adults, were shot to death wednesday after an apparent domestic dispute at their spring home and a relative was arrested hours later after a police chase and a tense standoff in the cul-de-sac of a nearby neighborhood. Authorities held a news conference about 5: 30 a.m. Thursday to announce that ron lee haskell, 33, had been captured and charged after a slow-speed chase and lengthy standoff. A 15-year-old girl was wounded in the shooting at the home in the 700 block of leaflet lane and was airlifted to memorial hermann hospital where she remained in critical condition late wednesday. Harris county sheriff's office identified the victims as two males, ages 4 and 13, two females, ages 6 and 9, and two adults, a 39-year-old male and a 34-year-old female. Mark herman, assistant chief deputy for the precinct 4 harris county constable, said authorities responded to a report of a shooting about 6 p.m. At the home on leaflet lane. There they found five people dead and two others with gunshot wounds to the head. Both were taken by life flight helicopter to the hospital, where one of them died. Before being flown to the hospital, one of the wounded was able to tell police that the shooting arose from a domestic dispute involving \" someone who had left the family. \" herman said the victim, a female, gave them a description of the person, the type of car he was in, and said he was on his way to kill other family members at another address. Authorities were dispatched to the home of the relatives a short distance away, near ponderosa and anvil, and arrived just before haskell. \" as soon as they got over there, he came driving up, and that's when the chase started, \" herman said,"

Rick perry told a child questioner in new hampshire today that texas public schools teach creationism alongside evolution — a statement that state education experts are refuting in varying degrees. \"no, it is not true, \" said kathy miller, president of the texas freedom network, an interest group that has lobbied the state board of education to keep religion out of public schools. \" texas science standards do not call for teaching creationism in the classroom. \" david bradley, a social conservative member of the state board of education, said he hadn't heard the governor's comments.

        "summary": "It started at a north carolina applebee's more than two years ago: matt nelson presented the idea to his college buddies that people like weird stuff on twitter, and that dogs were internet gold. Nelson's brainchild led to weratedogs, a twitter handle with more than 6.4 million followers that's pretty self-explanatory — nelson rates pics of dogs sent in by followers, with pithy captions including the dog's name and/or any other descriptive characteristics. But as 21-year-old nelson, who also goes by \" the dogfather, \" explains in a profile for money, workflow became unsustainable after his account's first tweet in november 2015 due to the sheer volume of submissions and his tweeting schedule, and he became \" sleep-deprived and burnt out. \" his solution? monetize the account with the help of a social media marketer, and drop out of campbell university, which he did last year. It wasn't the worst decision. Nelson now runs the weratedogs operation out of his parents ' home in west virginia, doing most work from his iphone, along with two remote workers who help sift through submissions and run the online store. He's the only one who does the twice-daily weekday tweets ( except for one time when blake shelton made a guest appearance ), spending 20 minutes or so on each caption. The payoff, which comes mostly from the online store, shows the idea had as much bite as bark: nelson says he makes in the \" low five figures \" each month, meaning an annual salary in the six figures. \" my initial goal was just to make people happy, \" he says. \" now i ' m good at writing like a dog. \" as for why his ratings often exceed 10/10, the washington post notes his retort to a critic who once said nelson's ratings system \" sucks \": \" they're good dogs, \" the weratedogs handle replied.",

The wap report notes that when they're not performing or giving rides, tourism elephants are often kept in subpar conditions, tethered by short chains, not fed well or given adequate medical care, and constantly surrounded by crowds and loud noise — and that's after they've been torn away from their mothers and put through training meant to \" break their spirits and make them submissive. \" \" is it any wonder that some of these gentle animals eventually become fed up and fight back... While confined to small enclosures that are a fraction of the size of their natural habitats? \" peta said in a statement. Somsak, said to be in his mid-50s, had worked for about 10 years with ekasit, who'd never been reported as violent before.

Shkreli has been the subject of plenty of unflattering media attention over the last few months and he appears to be craving more: on thursday, he offered kanye west $ 10 million in a bid to keep his new album from the public. The same day, he tweeted that he is \" now available for motion picture roles ( hollywood only ) \" and took a swipe at hillary clinton when he pondered going on a speaking tour of universities and donating the proceeds to charity, reports the national post.",

The 31-year-old father of three, held prisoner in yemen since 2010, placed a \" rare call \" to his lawyers this week from what he said was a sanaa military base, and things don't sound good, the intercept reports. In a 10-minute audio clip released by his ngo reprieve attorneys, mobley mentioned the military base he's reportedly imprisoned in is being rocked by bombing from saudi-led airstrikes against houthi rebels, and that he's not sure he ' ll make it out in one piece. \" when they're bombing, they're trying to bomb this building, \" he says, noting the anti-aircraft guns stationed on its roof. His location is in the building's basement, he says: \" i haven't seen the sun in months. \" mobley and his wife, nzinga, also say the us is doing little to nothing to free him. His backstory is admittedly sticky: us officials had suspected mobley of having al-qaeda ties, and when he was \" snatched off the streets \" in january 2010 and shot in the leg, men who said they were fbi and dod officers interviewed him in the hospital, the guardian reports. Shortly after that, mobley reportedly made an escape attempt in which he was accused of killing a guard; he was imprisoned shortly after that. Now, mobley's lawyers say, he's been left to fend for himself after the us shut down its sanaa embassy in february, per the guardian. A state department official speaking off the record told the paper in february, \" the united states does not evacuate prisoners in a crisis situation \"; the department cited \" privacy reasons \" to the intercept in refusing to comment.",

        "summary": "The house and senate will soon begin wrangling over their versions of the annual defense bill, and one component in particular is generating lots of heat: whether young women must register for the military draft. The senate bill that passed on tuesday requires them to do so, but the house bill passed earlier does not, reports the new york times. Which side will prevail when the final version emerges is anyone's guess at this point, reports military.com. The senate measure would require women who turn 18 starting on jan. 1, 2018, to sign up for the draft, which hasn't actually been used since 1973. Two competing quotes: ted cruz: \"i am the father of two daughters. Women can do anything they put their minds to... But the idea that we should forcibly conscript young girls into combat to my mind makes little to no sense. I could not vote for a bill that did so, particularly a bill that did so without public debate. \" john mccain, who chairs the armed services committee: \"every uniform leader of the united states military seemed to have a different opinion from the senator from texas whose military background is not extensive, \" he said, per politico. \" after months of rigorous oversight, a large bipartisan majority on the armed services committee agreed that there is simply no further justification to limit selective service registration to men. \"",

Now, as congress pushes ahead with its annual defense budget, the house and senate face brokering a compromise between lawmakers who are deeply divided over requiring women between 18-25 years old to register with selective service -- and potentially forcing them to the front lines of future wars. \" i am the father of two daughters.

A metropolitan state university professor came up with the idea to crowdfund $ 5,000 to pay off the lunch debt at the school where castile worked — but the effort ended up raising, as of this writing, more than $ 155,000. Now, \" no parent of the 37,000 kids who eat meals at school need worry about how to pay that overdue debt, \" reads an update on the campaign's website. \" philando is still reaching into his pocket, and helping a kid out. One by one. With your help. \" the director of nutrition services tells the st. Paul pioneer press castile \" was just a lovely person \" who truly cared about the students, and the professor who started the crowdfunded charity says those traits inspired her. \" it's really fun to write a check that … pays off something so wonderful, \" she tells kmsp. The campaign is ongoing and the money raised will continue to help kids in the future.",

But incredibly, the margin of victory for shelly simonds was just one vote, reports the virginian-pilot. Simonds ousted gop incumbent david yancey by a count of 11,608 to 11,607. Yancey actually led after election day by the razor-thin margin of 11,601 to 11,591, but tuesday's daylong recount in newport news changed that. The final results are expected to be certified by the state supreme court on wednesday. \"i knew it was going to be a roller coaster ride and the counts were going to change and votes were going to shift around, but i had faith in the system and final outcome, \" says simonds. Republicans have controlled the house of delegates since 2000, and simonds ' victory means the parties will now be split at 50-50. The washington post notes that no tie-breaking procedure is in place, meaning that any measure that doesn't get 51 votes does not advance. The gop still controls the state senate, but by a slim 21-19 edge. Politico reports that the surprise development may help state democrats pass medicaid expansion in 2018.

His research, he said, suggested that while america is the world's most religious nation, many americans tend to be ignorant about theology and religious texts. \" america's religion is broad but not deep, \" he said in 2003. \" it's not that americans don't believe anything.

The event, being promoted starting today via social media and pandora, would be the latest jump by \" limited-service \" eateries to attract the decreasing pool of workers, defecting more often to higher-end restaurants paying higher wages, per the journal. Competitors like mcdonald's, starbucks, and cheesecake factory have already raised the bar by offering higher wages and perks such as tuition reimbursement; chipotle has taken a similar tack, upping tuition reimbursement, vacation, and sick days. But it's now enticing candidates with apprenticeships ( where workers can earn an average salary of $ 53,000 a year ) and the status of \" restaurateur \" ( the chain's term for upper management, with an average salary of $ 133,000 ). Chipotle also says candidates don't necessarily need experience, just qualifications based on its 13 main hiring traits, including honesty, curiosity, and being \" infectiously enthusiastic \" ( all 13 are here ). Glassdoor.com reviews indicate the salaries listed by chipotle may be exaggerated, but monty moran, chipotle's co-ceo, insists those assessments are wrong, per the journal.

Blood vessels from the donor body are then attached to the recipient head using silicone tubes before the head's spinal nerves are connected. The bone from the connecting vertebrae is rebuilt with pins, screws, and plates, then the blood vessels, muscle, and skin are joined with microscopic sutures. When ren turns his procedure to monkeys — long-tailed macaques, specially — he will aim to connect just 10 % to 20 % of 100 billion spinal-nerve fibers — enough to allow the monkey to breathe and move muscles voluntarily. Should ren eventually reach the \" next frontier \" with human transplants, a much higher percentage of connections will be needed. ( think the idea is crazy? you're not alone. )",

            "By richard dawkins are there kingdoms of emotion where logic is taboo, dare not show its face, zones where reason is too intimidated to speak? moral philosophers make full use of the technique of thought experiment. In a hospital there are four dying men. Each could be saved by a transplant of a different organ, but no donors are available. In the hospital waiting room is a healthy man who, if we killed him, could provide the requisite organ to each dying patient, thereby saving four lives for the price of one. Is it morally right to kill the healthy man and harvest his organs? everyone says no, but the moral philosopher wants to discuss the question further. Why is it wrong? is it because of kant's principle: \"act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end. \" how do we justify kant's principle? are there ever exceptions? could we imagine a hypothetical scenario in which... What if the dying men were beethoven, shakespeare, einstein and martin luther king? would it be then right to sacrifice a man who is homeless and friendless, dragged in from a ditch? and so on. Two miners are trapped underground by an explosion. They could be saved, but it would cost a million dollars. That million could be spent on saving the lives of thousands of starving people. Could it ever be morally right to abandon the miners to their fate and spend the money on saving the thousands? most of us would say no. Would you? or do you think it is wrong even to raise such questions? these dilemmas are uncomfortable. It is the business of moral philosophers to face up to the discomfort and teach their students to do the same. A friend, a professor of moral philosophy, told me he received hate-mail when he raised the hypothetical case of the miners. He also told me there are certain thought experiments that divide his students down the middle. Some students are capable of temporarily accepting a noxious hypothetical, to explore where it might lead. Others are so blinded by emotion that they cannot even contemplate the hypothetical.

It was communicated to airlines previous to this date and it has already been enacted in 6,000 airplanes across the us commercial fleet as of friday, march 4. But neither the government nor any of these airlines have notified passengers about these changes. According to an official faa note, it and \" other federal agencies \" ( tsa anyone? ) think oxygen generators in lavatories are a \" security risk \". According to these agencies, terrorists may try to use this equipment to take airplanes down, turning the oxygen canisters into explosive devices. The [ faa ] recently required the nation's airlines to disable the oxygen generators located in all aircraft lavatories to eliminate a potential safety and security vulnerability. [... ] the faa, along with other federal agencies, identified and validated the potential threat, then devised a solution that could be completed quickly.

After a failed march 21 inspection, the vehicle was specifically cited for \" brakes out of service, \" indicating 20 % or more of its stopping power was compromised, nbc news reports. The records also noted constricted or obstructed brake lines. And after the most recent failed inspection on sept. 4, the state put a sticker on the limo taking it out of service, usa today reports. State police say they also want to talk to shahed hussain, nauman's father and the owner of prestige, but his whereabouts are currently unknown; he may be in pakistan. The 62-year-old is a former fbi informant who assisted in two cases in which attacks were thwarted in new york; the times reports that he took on the informant role, posing as a recruiter of terrorists, in order to avoid deportation after being caught fraudulently obtaining driver's licenses.",

While there are a few specific exceptions, crossing one's legs at the knee or the ankle doesn't appear to be as bad for our health as some experts have said. Analyzing studies that have looked for links to varicose veins, nerve damage, and elevated blood pressure, the bbc reports that the science shows \" you're unlikely to do yourself any damage, provided you don't stay in the same position until your legs are numb. \" first, sitting in one position for many hours without moving can lead to a condition known as \" peroneal nerve palsy, \" but this is true for any pose. Second, while most studies do find a momentary elevation in blood pressure when crossing one's legs at the knee, it goes away quickly and unless you're at a high risk of blood clots, there doesn't appear to be any long-term harm. As for what causes varicose veins, experts disagree, with some pointing to genetics and others saying that leg crossing can lead to damaged veins into which blood can leak and pool, reports yahoo. Meanwhile, the wall street journal notes that leg-crossing is among the simple solutions to the human fainting response offered up by doctors studying the issue. In other words, the jury's still out, but leg crossing doesn't appear to be particularly pernicious. ( one researcher proposes a series of sitting, standing, and stretching while we work. )",

Dependence on foreign oil. Obama, who first floated the idea of establishing an energy security trust in his state of the union address, detailed his proposal in a speech at the argonne national laboratory outside of chicago on friday. Argonne was chosen, in part, because the laboratory has been at the forefront of research of high-tech vehicle technology.

        "summary": "With the debate about whether the us should accept refugees from syria at high pitch, boing boing digs up a 2007 article from reuters about a famous would-be refugee: anne frank. The story details how her father, otto frank, wrote to a friend asking for money to help with a visa to get his family to america — but it turned out to be a moot point because the visa was never granted. At vox, dara lind sees parallels between the us reluctance to take german refugees from world war ii and the plight of today's syrians. \" desperate people, fleeing a terrifying, bloodthirsty regime, try to find refuge in the us, \" writes lind. \" but the american government and the public don't want to accept them. They worry that accepting refugees would put citizens at risk, and they don't see the refugee crisis as their problem to fix. So they are turned away. \" lind points to two moments in particular — when the us turned away a ship filled with more than 900 german jews trying to dock in miami, and when congress rejected a bill to bring in 20,000 jewish refugee children — and says america's refusal to help remains a \" moral stain. \" in fact, the backlash that resulted when the horrors of the holocaust became clearer prompted the us and other nations to create ways for persecuted refugees to find safe havens. \" but america started being welcoming only after it had been cruel, \" writes lind. \" america's refugee legacy isn't just about our decades-long record of welcoming the stranger and standing up for human rights.

            "It was with a force greater than an atom bomb that mount vesuvius erupted and blotted out pompeii in 79 a.d. Or, not blotted out, exactly. The city's destruction, and the thing that has kept pompeii so fascinating over the centuries, entails a paradox: the surge of ash and hot gas that blanketed thousands of victims also, simultaneously, preserved their bodies — along with their colorful art, sparkling jewelry, wine jugs, scrolls, and other cultural remnants. Now, scientists are using new imaging technologies to examine in detail the bones and teeth of those killed in the blast. Detailed casts of pompeii's victims — made by pouring plaster into the small cavities in their ash-encapsulated remains — have long prevented sophisticated scanning of this nature. The 19th-century plaster is so dense that today's standard imaging technology can't distinguish between the thick outer cast",

Corey dubrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, was personally attacked amid a storm of angry tweets.

That is changing as starbucks and usa today embark on an initiative called race together. As recent racially-charged incidents unfolded across america, starbucks partners ( employees ) gathered in six major cities to share their experiences and ideas about moving the country forward. Below is a video from the first partner meeting in december 2014. \"each story, each voice, offered insight into the divisive role unconscious bias plays in our society and the role empathy can play to bridge those divides, \" said starbucks chairman and ceo howard"
