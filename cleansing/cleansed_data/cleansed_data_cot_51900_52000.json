        "summary": "China is ramping up its military presence on its 880-mile border with north korea in case a nuclear, economic, or military crisis sends millions of north koreans fleeing in search of greener pastures, according to government websites. But as the wall street journal reports, that might not be all china is preparing for. China's defense ministry hasn't referred to north korea as the reason for a new border defense brigade along with a 24-hour video surveillance system, unit upgrades, new shelters and command posts, and recent live-fire and special forces drills in border regions; but experts say china could be preparing to intervene should the us attempt to seize nuclear weapons from its ally on the korean peninsula. Some aren't so sure china would be keen to take on the us and stress that recent enhancements at the border were first discussed last year. However, \" once you start talking about efforts from outside powers, in particular the united states and south korea, to stabilize the north... You're starting to look at a much more robust chinese response, \" argues a former us defense official for east asia. \" if you're going to make me place bets on where i think the us and china would first get into a conflict... It's the korean peninsula. \" others note china will want to prevent us influence there to retain its regional power. In a column in may, retired maj. Gen. Wang haiyun wrote china should not only intervene in a korean conflict but demand no us occupation of north korean territory, though he said he did not speak for the government. He made similar comments in an op-ed in the state-owned global times in march, cnn reports.",

        "summary": "Jon krakauer takes to the pages of the new yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on everest ( the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed ). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: that of himex, a new zealand-based company that krakauer calls the most \" lucrative commercial guiding operation \" on everest — one that on may 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members ( aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $ 60,000 refunded ), and sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner russell brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As krakauer writes, the \" wedge of ice the size of a beverly hills mansion \" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \" that same ice bulge \" and killed 16 sherpas. As for the outsize dangers sherpas face, some standout points: between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter ( and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain ). Krakauer points to an outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of sherpas: us soldiers stationed in iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen.",

Keshia knight pulliam, 38, who played little rudy huxtable on the cosby show, is expected to be in the norristown, pa., courthouse to watch the proceedings against her 79-year-old former boss, with cosby spokesman andrew wyatt telling people that pulliam won't be there to \" proclaim guilt or innocence, \" but simply \" to finally hear the truth for herself. \" wyatt says cosby's wife on the show, phylicia rashad, will also appear in the courtroom at some point, though the new york daily news says it has been told that a rashad appearance monday is \" unlikely \" because she's working. Reports of malcolm-jamal warner, who played son theo huxtable, attending are similarly being bandied about. The new york times offers an overview of what to expect during the trial — \" perhaps america's highest profile celebrity trial since that of oj simpson \" — including expected lines of evidence, the cosby legal team's anticipated strategy, and some juror information. Cnn says the trial has come down to a \" he said-she said \" scenario, with one other alleged victim expected to testify against cosby in addition to constand. \" what cosby is hoping for is that the jury forgets about the other 48 [ alleged victims ], \" a fordham criminal law professor notes. Meanwhile, constand herself is reportedly ready to face intense grilling on the witness stand. \" there's no trepidation, no fear, \" a close friend who's also one of cosby's alleged victims tells nbc. \" she used to play basketball and she prepared for those games like nobody else and that is what she has done here. \" ( vice calls the trial a \" test for america. \" )",

Nbc news reports masaaki osaka was arrested wednesday in connection with the 1971 murder of a police officer; he's accused of killing officer tsuneo nakamura during a street protest in tokyo in november of that year. A member of the japan revolutionary communist league ( jrcl ), osaka was protesting the continued american military presence in okinawa, an island 400 miles south of the mainland. Authorities say osaka, now 67, assaulted nakamura with a steel pipe before lighting him on fire with a molotov cocktail. The bbc reports osaka was first arrested last month for allegedly obstructing police during a raid on an apartment in hiroshima. The jrcl was reportedly using it as a hideout, and police were in search of someone other than osaka. Although osaka refused to give police his name, he was recognized, and his identity was eventually confirmed through dna testing; the japan times explains a new warrant on the murder charge was served wednesday. Osaka has since been moved from hiroshima to tokyo for further questioning, though the bbc says he has yet to say anything. Osaka's time as a fugitive — aided, authorities say, by the jrcl — was the longest among major-crime suspects being sought by japan's national police agency.",

Last june, diaz called 911 tearfully telling cops that a man tried to rape her in her garage. Cops busted hadley, who spent 88 days in jail, but now say diaz, 31, was behind it all. The break in the case came when authorities were able to determine the ip addresses associated with the ads led to diaz's and her father's homes; diaz allegedly used software that made the emails look as if they were sent by hadley. The daily beast reports the emails contained links to images of aborted fetuses and headless humans; one email allegedly read, \" i am his treasure princess, you are nothing. \" another member of the da's office calls diaz a \" serial con artist \" who allegedly faked being pregnant and having cervical cancer.

        "summary": "Kentucky has another high-profile official taking a stand against homosexuality. Two years after county clerk kim davis made headlines by refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples, a judge has declared that he won't preside over adoption cases involving gay parents. Judge mitchell nance announced last week that he would recuse himself from such cases because of his \" conscientious objection to the concept of adoption of a child by a practicing homosexual, \" reports the glasgow daily times. The move shouldn't have too much of a practical effect: nance's 43rd circuit court has two divisions, and the judge who presides over the other division will handle all the gay-adoption cases. Nance says he has no choice because his personal objection constitutes a bias that requires him to recuse himself, per the washington post. Nance's decision has set off a debate similar to the one that arose when davis made her own controversial announcement. Two quotes illustrate the opposite sides: pro-nance: \" when adoption agencies abandon the idea that it is in the best interest of a child to grow up with both a mother and a father, people can't expect judges who do believe that to be forced to bow the knee, \" says family foundation spokesman martin cothran. \" judges have a right of conscience like everyone else. \" anti-nance: if he \" can't perform the basic functions of his job, which are to deliver impartiality, fairness and justice to all families in his courtroom, then he shouldn't be a judge, \" says kentucky fairness campaign director chris hartman.",

Mitchell nance, who sits in barren and metcalfe counties in kentucky, issued an order thursday saying he believes that allowing a \"practicing homosexual \" to adopt would \"under no circumstance \" promote the best interest of the child, he wrote in the order obtained by the washington post. The judge disqualified himself from any adoption cases involving gay couples, citing judicial ethics codes requiring that judges recuse themselves whenever they have a \"personal bias or prejudice \" concerning a case. Nance's \"conscientious objection \" to the concept of gay parents adopting children constitutes such a bias, he argued. The announcement garnered support from some conservative groups, while also spurring intense criticism from some lawyers and judicial ethics experts who viewed the blanket statement as discriminatory, and a sign that nance is not fit to fulfill his duties as a judge. Kentucky state law permits gay couples to adopt children, and the u.s. Supreme court ruled in 2015 that all states must allow same-sex marriage. That ruling came in four cases consolidated as obergefell et al. V hodges, one of which specifically involved a couple who wanted to adopt but was barred from doing so because michigan banned same-sex marriage and adoption by unmarried couples. Nance's recusal drew some comparisons to the case of rowan county clerk kim davis, who was jailed after she refused in the face of multiple court orders to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, saying she couldn't issue the licenses because her name was on them, and it violated her religious beliefs. Eventually, deputies in her office began issuing licenses. Kentucky's governor and general assembly would later remove the name of clerks from the marriage licenses. Reached by phone sunday night, nance told the post he stood by his order, \"based on the law, based on my conscience, \" and to \"minimize any disruption in the litigation, \" he said. He declined to comment further on the order or calls from the public for him to resign. But he gave no indication that he would be stepping down"

        "summary": "A michigan conference called to discuss a possible \" honor killing \" and women in islam has triggered an uproar from local muslims and civil rights groups who say it's an excuse to bash islam. The \" jessica mokdad human rights conference on honor killings \" in dearborn — home to a thriving american muslim community — was immediately countered with a \" rejecting islamophobia: a community stand against hate \" town hall meeting in detroit, notes msnbc. Both meetings took place yesterday. Mokdad, 20, was killed last year by her muslim stepdad, according to police. Though initially reported as a suspected honor killing, investigators now believe mokdad was killed because she was about to tell police her stepfather was sexually abusing her, according to the detroit free press. \" the evidence shows the motive really was not a cultural issue, \" said a lead investigator. \" it's about power, control, and rape. \" the honor killing conference immediately raised suspicions because it was organized by pam geller, critic of islam and nationally known foe of the proposed ground zero mosque. Geller insists mokdad's death was an honor killing, and one more example of \" stealth enforcement \" of islamic shariah law. Geller's group stop the islamization of america has been classified as a hate group by the southern poverty law center. Organizers of the rival meeting said in a statement it's time for \" our community to take a stand, along with those who value america's commitment to diversity and freedom of religion. \" said a female speaker at the town hall meeting: \" as a muslim woman, i stand with pride in my faith. \"",

Naval base in cuba where captives from afghanistan, iraq and other fronts in the so-called war on terror were interned. Leftist groups had also called for a protest on the day of his visit next saturday, leading keren hayesod's organizers to announce that they were cancelling bush's participation on security grounds -- not because of the criminal complaints.

            "President george w. Bush has canceled an event in the famously neutral country switzerland because of expected protests to his presence there. Bush was supposed to give the keynote address at a jewish group's charity gala on feb. 12 in geneva. Leftist groups had planned to protest the visit, according to news agencies. But several human rights groups had also filed criminal complaints against bush, demanding that he be taken into custody if he stepped on swiss soil and investigated for allegations of ordering torture. A right-wing member of the swiss parliament also demanded last week bush's arrest on war crimes allegations if he came to the country, according to reuters. Swiss officials countered that, as a former head of state, bush would be protected with a level of diplomatic immunity, and keren hayesod, the group that had invited bush, said the court actions against the former president did not play into the decision to go forward with the dinner without him. \" we didn't want to put people and property in geneva at risk. The gala is maintained but george bush will not take part, \" the group's lawyer, robert equey told the tribune de geneve. \" the ( criminal ) complaints did not weigh in the decision. \" he noted protests against the g8 summit just across the border in france"

At least 11,420 children, more than a tenth of the conflict's casualties, have been killed since the conflict began in march 2011, including hundreds who were shot dead by snipers or summarily executed, the report from a london think-tank finds. Teenage boys were the most likely to be killed but children as young as just a year old have been tortured and executed, reports the bbc. Bombing and shelling were the cause of most deaths and the report's authors have urged both sides to stop targeting civilians. More than 2.1 million refugees have now fled the conflict and the united nations, which says this is the worst refugee crisis in a generation, warns that there could be 3.5 million refugees by the end of the year, reports the new york times. To make matters even worse for internally displaced syrians, al-qaeda fighters have been making major gains in northern syria in recent months, displacing more moderate opposition groups and imposing strict islamic law in areas under their control, cnn finds. The jihadist groups are even more dangerous in syria than they were in iraq, and are \" more likely to sustainably control territory, project power around the region, possibly sponsor global terrorist attacks, and catalyze a new generation of jihadist insurrection, \" a counterterrorism expert warns.",

While there is consensus that beards enhance perceptions of masculinity, age, social dominance, and aggressiveness, the perceived attractiveness of facial hair varies greatly across women. Given the ease with which facial hair can be groomed and removed entirely, why should some men retain beards and others choose to remove them? we hypothesized that men with relatively sexist attitudes would be more likely to allow their facial hair to grow than men with less sexist attitudes. Men from the usa ( n = 223 ) and india ( n = 309 ) completed an online survey measuring demographic variables, ambivalent sexism, and facial hair status.

Salling, 33, lives alone. Sources say his ex-girlfriend tipped off police and that the actor was \" shocked \" when they arrived at his house; he's said to have already hired a lawyer. In 2013, the actor was sued by an ex for allegedly forcing her to have sex without a condom; he denied it, but ended up paying her more than $ 2.7 million when the case was settled.",

The booklet titled \" mother and child care \" tells the women to \" detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust, \" spurn \" impure thoughts, \" look at \" beautiful pictures \" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the ap and hindustan times. According to one gynecologist in india, the advice isn't just \" unscientific and irrational, \" but it's \" a national shame \" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the us, according to unicef. Since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in indian households, the government should be \" ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet, \" says gynecologist arun gadre. This would also help prevent stunted births; some 48 % of indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight. But \" if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen, \" gadre says. With its advice against lust, the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women, contrary to medical evidence. A government minister charged with promoting traditional and alternative medicine says the booklet contains \" wisdom accumulated over many centuries \" from \" the fields of yoga and naturopathy. \"",

Two of the most common toxins are phthalates — chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and thought to be linked to harmful effects on the endocrine system, which can lower iq and lead to breathing troubles — and highly fluorinated chemicals, or hfcs, used to make items nonstick or waterproof but which are also tied to testicular and kidney cancer, thyroid issues, and liver malfunction, among other problems. In what the study's authors say is the first mega-study of its kind, they scrutinized data from 26 past studies and one unpublished one, with dust containing 45 chemicals collected from homes, schools, and workplaces in 14 states, per scientific american. The toxic substances control act was updated earlier this year, per the atlantic, but the law only requires new chemicals get a green light from the epa — leaving about 1,000 examination-worthy chemicals already on the market that the agency doesn't have the resources to study. \" we think our homes are safe havens, but … the surprising reality [ is ] that our homes are being polluted by the products we have every day, \" co-author veena singla tells cbs news.

In march, 88-year-old donald rickard told film director john irvin that when he was the us vice consul in durban in 1962, african national congress informants told him mandela was visiting the city and he shared that information with police, leading to mandela's arrest at a roadblock as he tried to return to johannesburg, the times of london reports. The anc leader spent the next 28 years in prison. An unrepentant rickard said he and his cia handlers saw mandela as \" a toy of the communists \" who was completely controlled by the soviet union. Rickard — who retired in 1978 and died on march 30, according to an obituary in the pagosa springs sun — claimed mandela was preparing to incite a communist rebellion against apartheid, which could have led to moscow's involvement. \" if the soviets had come in force, the united states would have had to get involved, and things could have gone to hell, \" he said. \" we were teetering on the brink here and it had to be stopped, which meant mandela had to be stopped. And i put a stop to it. \" irvin's movie about the months before the arrest, mandela's gun, will debut at the cannes film festival this week, the guardian reports.

The poll is noteworthy, the hill explains, because gallup has lately been much higher on romney than all the other polls; he was ahead by 3 yesterday, too, but for most of last week, he was up between 5 and 7 points. The results back up a trend nate silver has been seeing: it appears romney's rise has stalled. Yesterday he lost ground in five out of six daily polls. \" this is the closest we've come in a week or so to one candidate clearly having ' won'the day … and it was mr. Obama, \" silver writes. \" it's improbable that mr.

Despite his inventory being 15 cookies short of what he ordered ( did anyone really think someone in love with data wouldn't count every single cookie? ), he made some fascinating and surprising finds. Here, a sample: those lucky numbers aren't not lucky. Hickey calls this discovery \" weird as hell, \" but he admits that, after comparing the numbers on the fortunes to winning powerball numbers over a nearly 20-year stretch, the value of playing the fortunes ' numbers over that time period would have left a hypothetic gambler with a slight profit ( just under $ 175 ), while playing random numbers would leave that same gambler with a $ 2,540 deficit. He's got some common-sense explanations for why that may be. What do the fortunes really tell us? they don't so much tell our fortunes as appeal to our egos and sense of good citizenship, apparently. Only 22.3 % of the themes enclosed within the cookies actually dabbled in prophesy: the vast majority ( 52.9 % ) included the word \" you \" and spit out praise or criticism of one's strengths and weaknesses, while others included basic life advice and well-worn wisdom like \" do onto others as you wish others do onto you. \" hickey even built his own online bot to see what randomly generated fortunes it would churn out.

Following a judge's wednesday ruling, a death certificate has been issued for lord lucan, who the new york times recounts as \" a dashing british aristocrat \" last seen on nov. 7, 1974 — the day that his children's nanny was found dead, allegedly by his hand. The bbc recalls the crime: sandra rivett was beaten to death in the family's london home and her body left in the basement; lord lucan's estranged wife was also attacked but got away, fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling \" he's in the house! he's murdered the nanny! \" per the times. Lady lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker, saying he had thought she was rivett, reports usa today. A june 1975 inquest named him as rivett's murderer, except the man born richard john bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned. The sightings and theories kept flowing, though: in melbourne, australia, and france within the first year; employed as a waiter in san francisco; backpacking on mount etna; dying in goa in 1996. Just last saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger. Lucan was declared dead in 1996, but the rub was that son george bingham was unable to take on his title, preventing him from assuming his father's seat in the house of lords.

Twenty-six years and two days later, falcon and his wife were stopped at an intersection on their bikes when they were confronted by a gaggle of armed us marshals. Falcon, 55, was arrested without incident. \" nobody thought he was in the united states, \" says barry golden, a spokesperson for the us marshals service, which believed falcon was living out his days in mexico or colombia. Instead, he was renting a forgettable home in a suburb near disney world. Authorities were tipped off by a fake driver's license used by falcon during a 2013 car accident. \" we figured this all out a month ago, \" golden says. Falcon is facing charges of conspiracy to import cocaine. His brother, the former kingpin, is scheduled to be released from prison in june.",

To wit, russia's deputy foreign minister today announced that russia is \" categorically against \" military intervention in syria and noted that it would be \" premature \" for the un security council to take any fresh steps. The bbc notes that, in light of russia's veto power on the council, the latest remarks indicate there's little hope for new initiatives.

They bought their st. Peters home in 2002, and in 2008, the board of aldermen adopted a city ordinance requiring 50 % of residents ' yards to be made up of grass turf. Someone eventually filed a complaint about the duffners ' yard; the couple requested an exemption, but it was denied. In 2014, they were granted a variance, but were still required to plant grass on at least 5 % of their property. After various court and administrative battles, in 2016, the duffners filed a civil rights action in federal court, saying they faced up to $ 180,000 in penalties and 20 years in jail for their refusal to comply. Last week, a federal judge ruled in favor of the city, the kansas city star reports. Us district judge john a. Ross ruled that the duffners \" have failed to identify a fundamental right that is restricted by the turf grass ordinance, \" have failed to show that the penalties for noncompliance with the ordinance are excessive, and that the supreme court has held that \" aesthetic considerations constitute a legitimate government purpose. \" he also said the complaint was too general and if a court accepted it, it could place \" many, if not all \" such zoning laws under scrutiny, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. The couple's lawyer, who says \" this is one of the most important property rights cases in the country right now, \" says the couple will appeal. He tells the riverfront times the case could go to the supreme court. \" this is a couple with health problems facing gross penalties for what they've chosen not to plant on their personal property. \"",

The project — called the international thermonuclear experimental reactor, in france — only needs to overcome rock-bottom morale, constant delays, tensions between engineers around the world, grumbling politicians, and a multi-billion-dollar budget that's never quite high enough. \" there is a lot of anxiety here that it is all going to implode, \" says a physicist. Scientists have long dreamed of such a reactor to harness power by nuclear fusion, a cleaner process than fission that produces almost no radioactive waste. First proposed in 1985, iter relies on an oft-squabbling, international cadre of experts who vie for the spotlight and struggle to convince politicians that it's still viable. The us has yanked and recommitted funding over the years, and a family-owned company in san diego is building the all-important solenoid — in this case, a 20-mile-long cable wrapped around a metal column — to harness the plant's plasma in a \" magnetic bottle \" ( because no physical material can contain it ). But engineering challenges remain, and parts made around the world may or may not all fit together. If they do, earth could have a new energy source in about 10 years. \" i think iter is an absolute necessity for the world — otherwise i wouldn't put up with the frustrations, \" says a top iter official.

But brown never found out if his friend lived or died. The two men — who came from the same northwest detroit neighborhood, were drafted on the same day in 1966, trained together at ft.

The footage, which appears to be from a motion-activated camera at the crowne plaza hotel in rosemont, ill, doesn't capture the moment the 19-year-old entered the freezer, but it shows her walking, alone and apparently disoriented, through a disused hotel kitchen on the way there, reports the chicago tribune. The video shows that nobody else entered the kitchen area until her frozen body was found early sunday morning, almost 24 hours after friends said she was missing. Video from early in the evening shows jenkins with friends, but a later clip shows her emerge from an elevator alone and so unsteady that she had to hold on to a wall, the new york daily news reports. Another shows her wandering down a hotel hallway. Police say they have interviewed 25 party guests and they have no reason to believe jenkins was murdered, the chicago sun-times reports. Sam adam jr., an attorney for the jenkins family, says lawyers will carry out their own investigation. The hotel \" never searched, they never did anything while a young, 19-year-old disoriented girl was sitting in their freezer, \" he told reporters friday. \" now there has to be an answer to how that happened.

According to buzzfeed, martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The sheriff's office was unable to find martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so martinez was added to the california department of justice's list of missing people.

            "Morgan stanley's handling of facebook inc.'s ( fb ) initial public offering, a deal that cost investors billions of dollars, broke a decade-old pledge to block investment bankers from influencing analysts, according to massachusetts regulators, who fined the bank $ 5 million. A senior morgan stanley banker wrote a script that facebook's then-treasurer used to update research analysts on the company's revenue outlook before the ipo, according to a settlement document with secretary of the commonwealth william galvin. He faulted morgan stanley for dishonesty, ethics violations and failing to supervise employees -- the first regulatory claims to stem from the bank's handling of the deal. A plunge in facebook's stock after it began trading in may has fueled government probes and more than 40 lawsuits, with some investors claiming the social-network company failed to disclose revised forecasts before the ipo. The small size of morgan stanley's fine relative to investors ' losses shows other regulators may struggle to pin much blame on the bank, said erik gordon, a professor at the university of michigan's stephen m. Ross school of business. \"they paid a little bit of lunch money as a fine, they're not getting disqualified, and they agreed once again to abide by a consent order they agreed to nine years ago, \" gordon said"

More surprising is just how much of an effect those five combined factors have on longevity — an extra 14 years for women and 12 for men, according to the study in circulation. Researchers looked at about 30 years of data on more than 78,000 women and 44,000 men and found that those who were five-for-five on the aforementioned list had a significantly better life expectancy at age 50 than those who didn't abide by any of the healthy habits. For women, it meant an additional 43 years for the healthiest group, compared to 29 years. For men, it meant an additional 37.6 years, compared to 25.5 years. \"when we embarked on this study, i thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer, \" says co-author meir stampfer, per the guardian. \" but the surprising thing was how huge the effect was. \" the two big factors: those with the healthiest lifestyles were less likely to get cancer or heart disease, notes cnn. The harvard gazette provides some specifics: researchers defined regular exercise as 30 minutes or more per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity; moderate drinking is roughly one 5-ounce glass of wine per day for women and up to two for men; and the target body-mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9.

Scott wiener — who represents a district he calls \" ground zero for the hiv epidemic \" — says he takes the daily antiviral pill truvada to lower his risk of contracting hiv. He's urging other gay men to do the same. \" a much larger segment of gay men should be taking a close look \" at what's known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, wiener tells the new york times. Truvada as prep has been very slow to catch on across the country, which wiener writes sees 50,000 new hiv infections each year. Researchers say prep could reduce the risk of hiv infection by up to 99 % if taken as prescribed. The world health organization made a similar case to wiener's this summer, but the san francisco chronicle calls wiener's announcement \" significant because so few people have been willing to talk openly about their use of truvada. \" though the drug's list price is just over $ 1,000 a month, wiener says prep is covered by most health insurers ( he personally pays $ 15 a month ). For the uninsured or those with high-deductible plans, however, the price can be a problem. Wiener's colleague, david campos, says he will ask the city's health department to develop a strategy that \" addresses the educational and affordability issues \" by december. \" we have to start somewhere, \" says campos, who adds that every prevented infection saves $ 355,000 in treatment costs.",

A nov. 29 permit issued by dc's department of transportation allows musk's boring company to dig at an abandoned lot beside a mcdonald's in northeast washington that the company says might eventually become a station on a hyperloop connecting nyc, philadelphia, baltimore, and washington. The system would speed up travel times, using electricity and electromagnetic levitation to send people and cars whipping through tunnels in pods. But before you ditch your car, the washington post points out the permit is only for \" some preparatory and excavation work \" at the site, and more permits are needed before any real construction begins. Dc mayor muriel bowser has visited a test tunnel musk is constructing under los angeles. But though \" we're open to the concept of moving people around the region more efficiently... We're just beginning, in the mayor's office, our conversation to get an understanding of what the general vision is for hyperloop, \" says bowser's chief of staff, john falcicchio. Still, the permit \" is comparable to an athlete stretching before a race \" and shows musk is serious about moving forward with his plans for high-speed travel since claiming \" verbal \" government support for an east coast hyperloop last july, reports techcrunch.

For example, the journey from london to edinburgh - which takes more than four hours on a train - would theoretically take just 30 minutes.

Crystal palace devotees determined to make a literal mark on rival team middlesbrough the night before the two teams faced off descended early saturday upon what they believed to be the middlesbrough bus parked at a hotel in a london suburb. The vandals spray-painted \" crystal palace fc \" on the side of the vehicle in red, white, and blue — a move that did little but serve as an ownership tag, because the bus was actually crystal palace's. A groundsman for the cp team grumbled about the incident on twitter in a now-private tweet, noting, \" £ 40,000 worth of damage on our coach thinking it was the boro coach. Nice one! \" the sun notes that the hotel where the bus was parked, near crystal palace's home stadium, is often frequented by visiting soccer teams. Despite an assertion by sky sports that the vehicle was on loan to middlesbrough from crystal palace because they'd flown to the match, the bbc reports that was not the case. The guardian notes the cp team had to arrange for another bus to take the players to their middlesbrough matchup, which they won 1-0. A crystal palace rep says the cops have been notified. ( this soccer player's national anthem protest was foiled — by the opposite team. )",

Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the wall street journal.

            "Major league baseball is considering eliminating the four pitches it requires to intentionally walk a batter with the goal of making the game faster. If the proposed rule passes, games will indeed be faster. You just might not notice. Last season, teams issued just 932 free passes in 2,427 games. The count randomly sampled 10 of them and calculated they took 37.25 seconds on average. So when you do all the math, the net result is..."

        "summary": "Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew — and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \" closed-mouth vocalization. \" think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal evolution, per ut news, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the washington post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \"a cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times, \" says the lead author. \"that suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays \" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \" a very different jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds. \" but if so, the makers of jurassic park didn't get it all wrong: the hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per vulture.

A science study of 150-million-year-old fossils uncovered in siberia is playing a big role in flipping that perception on its head, suggesting that nearly all dinosaurs actually sprouted feathers. At least five species of feathered dinosaurs have turned up in china over the last 20 years, all belonging to the theropod group of raptors. The latest fossils, however, come from a two-legged dinosaur in the ornithischian group, which national geographic says accounts for about half of all dinosaurs. \" probably that means the common ancestor of all dinosaurs had feathers, \" the study author says. The fossils have \" completely changed our vision of dinosaurs, \" he adds, per the bbc. A paleontologist not involved with the study calls it \" fantastic \" and says it revealed three types of feather imprints different from those of other feathered dinosaurs as well as those of modern birds: \" i don't know \" why they had feathers, he says. \" these animals couldn't fly, that's all we can tell you. \" ( read about a dinosaur that did fly — with four wings. )",

He suggests if you were wrong about 15 or more of these assertions, you might quit talking about politics while trump is in the white house. By adams's standard, most elite \" analysts \" would have to be quiet, because they have been so consistently",
            "When candidate trump first set about the job of redefining politics ( and reality ) back in 2015, people had lots of predictions about how things would turn out. One year isn't long enough to know everything we need to know about his presidency, but it's long enough to to check some of our predictions. As a public service, i put together a list of predictions that various people made about trump that you can use to evaluate your own predictive powers. Count the number of items on the list that you once predicted would be true. I ' ll tell you how to evaluate your score at the end. Did you once believe … trump will never win the gop nomination. Trump will never win the presidency. Stocks will drop if trump is elected. President trump will deport ten million illegal immigrants. Trump will be gone ( impeached, jailed, or quit ) by end of 2017. Trump's immigration ban on several muslim countries will be found unconstitutional. Trump colluded with russia, and that's a crime. Trump obstructed justice ( a crime ) by firing comey. Trump's skills as a \"con man \" might get him elected but it won't transfer into doing the job of president.

Researchers took a close look at four specific sites where wastewater from oil and gas extraction was injected into the ground and found that the process could be linked to swarms of quakes in areas up to 20 miles away from the sites, reports the bbc. The four wells examined have been pumping four million barrels of water a month to a depth of around two miles underground. At one site linked to the wells, a small town called jones, there have been more 2,500 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 since 2008 — a fifth of the total in the central and western us during that period. \" it really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this, \" a study co-author tells scientific american, explaining that wastewater injection can cause quakes by sending out waves of fluid pressure, causing faults miles away to slip. \" most big sequences of earthquakes that we see are either a main shock and a lot of aftershocks or it might be right at the middle of a volcano in a volcanic system or geothermal system.

        "summary": "Wine has been used as a \" social lubricant, mind-altering substance, and highly valued commodity \" throughout the ages. Now, a discovery just south of tbilisi details just how far back through the ages the beverage has existed, the bbc reports. Per a study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, archaeologists found 8,000-year-old pottery shards in the nation of georgia indicating wine was once made there in earthenware jars, the earliest evidence ever of grape-based wine production. Before the discovery of the fragments from eight jars ( the oldest from circa 5980bc ) in the neolithic villages of gadachrili gora and shulaveris gora, the most ancient proof of grape winemaking came from iraq, dating between 5000bc and 5400bc. Testing of the georgian pieces showed evidence of a slew of acids from wine that had been made inside the erstwhile vessels. The jars also featured images of grapes and a man dancing, and national geographic notes the presence of grape pollen in the soil. Scientists believe the jars may have been stored underground during the fermentation process and, based on an intact jar found at a site nearby, were so large they could fit about 400 of today's wine bottles, per a release. There's even a link to modern-day vino production: the old-time jars are strikingly similar to the large qvevri jars used today in georgia. Because wine wasn't crucial to living in stone age times, one scientist not involved in the study tells national geographic that the find shows \" far greater sophistication \" during that time period than previously suspected. China still holds the overall wine record, however: evidence there for a boozy rice-and-honey based concoction dates back to 7000bc.

It encourages users to flag content that concerns them. Among its examples: nudity: genitals are a no-no. But while, for example, some images of breasts won't be tolerated, pictures of breastfeeding or mastectomy scars are allowed, as is artwork showing nudes, a spokeswoman tells the paper. Violence: the site has gone back and forth on beheading videos, finally settling on a ban, the times reports. But images of violence may be allowed if they're aimed at sharing \" information about atrocities in the world. \" hate speech: race-, gender-, and religion-based attacks won't be tolerated, the site says. But \" people can use facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and practices, \" the site notes. \" such discussion can promote debate and greater understanding. \" international differences: the laws of different countries can change what's acceptable where. Facebook points to its global government requests report as a source of information on how official policies affect content and privacy.

        "summary": "The latest in airport security: get ready to have your face scanned if you're flying into or out of florida's orlando international airport on an international flight. Other airports already use facial scanning for some departing international flights, but orlando will be the first airport to require the scans for all passengers on all arriving and departing international flights. The image from a facial scan is compared to a department of homeland security biometric database containing images of those who should be on the flight. At all the airports that use facial scanning, us citizens may opt out, but privacy advocates say not enough has been done to make americans aware of that fact, the ap reports. Plus, a notice about a possible rule change for the program says us citizens \" may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the united states. \" they are also concerned about how any data gleaned from the facial scans will be used, and some are raising concerns about the possibility someone will be mistakenly barred from boarding a flight. \" we're not talking about one gate, \" says one privacy expert. \" we're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up. \" he points out that some research shows the accuracy of the facial scans goes down for racial minorities, women, and children. Two us senators have urged dhs to implement formal rules and ensure a full vetting of the facial scanning program before it's expanded. The scanner works by comparing a passenger's image to their passport photo, which is stored in the database, cbs news explains.",

They say the day after a born killers scene in which the girl sat on sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \" at one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited.

A climber was scaling the park's el capitan granite monolith monday afternoon when he fell, causing a climbing rope to sever his right thumb and send it bouncing down the rock face, the los angeles times reports. Luckily, the severed digit landed on a small ledge 80 feet below, where the climber's buddy retrieved it. Rangers suspended by rope from a helicopter managed to reach the climbers and get the injured man — along with his thumb — to the hospital in time for it to be reattached. \" this was an incredibly technical and complex rescue mission with a lot of inherent risk, \" their commander says, according to the national park service website. \" i was relieved, and thrilled, that this ended successfully. \"",

Two rock climbers were ascending el capitan on the nose route, a popular and difficult climbing route on the 7,569 granite monolith in yosemite valley. After two days of climbing, the climbers were approximately 1,000 feet below the summit. In mid-afternoon, the lead climber sustained a fall that was not life threatening. However, during the fall, a secondary rope became wrapped around his right thumb, severing the appendage clean from the hand. The severed thumb miraculously fell approximately 80 feet and landed on a two foot by one foot ledge. The climbing partner was able to retrieve the thumb and the pair called the yosemite national park emergency communication center seeking emergency assistance. At 3: 50 p.m., the park's contract helicopter, piloted by richard shatto, along with helitec crewmembers jeff pirog and eric small, and yosemite park rangers jeff webb and dave pope, flew from yosemite valley to assess the situation. Although the weather was favorable with light winds, impending darkness was an issue and incident commander, yosemite valley district ranger eric gabriel, made the decision to attempt to extract the climber via short-haul. This is a technique where park rangers are suspended from a rope below the helicopter to remove the climber from the wall. Gabriel, who had consulted with the park's medical clinic, knew of the short window of time in which the thumb could successfully be reattached and felt the complex mission was worth pursuing. The helicopter hovered near the climbers and park rangers webb and pope were successfully short-hauled to the injured party. Once on the wall, the injured climber was transported back to el capitan meadow via helicopter. On the ground,"
