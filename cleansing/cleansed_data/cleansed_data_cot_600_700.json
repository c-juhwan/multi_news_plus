        "summary": "A bar in southern california is feeling the wrath of the internet over a cinco de mayo promotion that invited customers to climb an inflatable \"border wall \" in exchange for a free drink. The stunt at hennessey's tavern in dana point, calif., included handing out free drink \" green cards \" to customers who scaled the faux border wall, reports cbs news. Critics on social media are calling out the promotion as racist and offensive, but owner paul hennessey defended the ploy in a statement on facebook. After thanking everyone for their comments, he writes, \"our intentions were to create a dialogue and show how ridiculous that it is to spend tens of millions of dollars to build a wall and even infer that mexico foot some or the entire bill and have their citizens build it. \" hennessey adds that many have misunderstood his intent, and that he hopes people will spend equal time writing to washington about president trump's proposed border wall as they do criticizing him on social media, ending with, \"let's stop this wall from being built. \" but an employee who asked to remain anonymous said the tone of the event wasn't so politically reflective, claiming the bar handed out mustaches while some customers yelled \" build the wall. \"",

        "summary": "Eating ice cream on a hot summer's day presents something of a challenge — one must tackle the meltiest spots fast enough, before the treat becomes a mess on the ground. But this summer in japan, people are enjoying better living through chemistry with a new type of popsicle that basically doesn't melt, even in super hot august temperatures, reports quartz. The secret, it turns out, is in strawberries, which contain polyphenol — a liquid extract that makes it harder for oil and water to separate, and in turn essentially solidifies dairy cream, a kanazawa university professor who developed the next-gen popsicle tells asahi shimbun. No one set out to make this a reality; it was actually a happy accident. Kanazawa-based biotherapy development research center was trying to use instead of waste the sub-par strawberries coming out of miyagi prefecture, which is still recovering from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The pastry chef charged with using strawberry polyphenol in confections complained that it made dairy cream solidify instantly, which struck the professor as potentially useful. After playing with many variations of milks, creams, and amounts of polyphenol and other ingredients, tomihisa ota hit upon the winning recipe, which has been sold as kanazawa ice since april. At 500 yen, or $ 4.50 a pop, mashable calls it a \" small price to pay for a big luxury. \" ( hangover ice cream is a thing in south korea. )",

In fact, the palm beach post reports more than three times as many fishermen die from lightning strikes than golfers. A study published in geophysical research letters in february and recently getting some attention may explain why. Researchers from the florida institute of technology found that lightning strikes over the ocean can be much more powerful than strikes over land. It's the first independent study to show what others have long believed, according to a press release. Researchers studied lightning over florida and its coasts from 2013 to 2015, measuring the peak currents of the strikes. They found strikes over the ocean carried more charge than those over land. In fact, they estimated that lightning with peak currents of more than 50 kilo amperes is more than twice as likely to occur over the ocean. This could mean people living on or near the ocean may be at greater risk from lightning. Worth noting: deaths from lightning strikes in florida — a state with a whole lot of coastline — regularly outpace those in the rest of the country. Nine people were killed by lightning in 2016 in florida. ( pain is only the beginning of a lightning strike. )",

            "Chicago ( ap ) — last-minute health insurance shoppers called help lines and attended enrollment events monday as a key deadline in the nation's new health law arrived. While some states postponed the cutoff date, most americans were required to sign up by monday night to get coverage starting on jan. 1. The healthcare.gov website that had a disastrous, glitch-prone debut nearly three months ago ran smoothly in the morning despite the load, the government said on twitter. With the deadline looming, more than 1 million people visited the refurbished federal enrollment website over the weekend, and a federal call center received more than 200,000 calls. Thirty-six states rely on the federal website for enrollment. The original deadline was pushed back a week because of the technical problems that plagued the federal marketplace for weeks after its october opening, but hundreds of upgrades to storage capacity and software have cut error rates and wait times. \" it's just nonstop now. Everybody knows about it. Everybody wants it, \" said florida enrollment counselor madeleine siegal. She said her organization in fort lauderdale was slammed with walk-ins and appointments friday, had several weekend enrollment events and planned to open its doors earlier than usual on monday. Ronald bellingeri, a 59-year-old general contractor in florida, signed up friday in 90 minutes with help from an enrollment counselor. Bellingeri said"

        "summary": "Scientists are taking a closer look at uranus after strange patterns turned up in images from 30 years ago. Engadget reports that researchers looking at data from nasa's voyager 2 — which became the only spacecraft ever to fly by uranus when it did so in 1986 — noticed that the amount of material in some of the planet's rings varies from time time. This pattern of shifting material was present in two of the uranus ' 13 rings, according to gizmodo. \" there's something breaking the symmetry, \" researcher matt hedman says in a press release. He and fellow researcher rob chancia believe that something is two undiscovered moons. The idea is that the two new moons — which would bring uranus'total up to 29 — are orbiting outside the planet's rings, leaving wakes behind them, according to a study being published soon. Similar things called moonlet wakes occur in saturn's rings. Researchers estimate the new moons circling uranus are between 2 miles and 9 miles across — smaller than any of uranus ' other moons. \" we haven't seen the moons yet, but the idea is the size of the moons needed to make these features is quite small, and they could have easily been missed, \" hedman says in the press release. The new moons may also be responsible for keeping uranus ' rings in check, which would explain why they are narrower than those of saturn.

Segur was rescheduled to fly on american airlines on wednesday, but it seems he didn't board that flight — and as of reports out this morning, friends and family hadn't heard from him since monday, and his girlfriend had reported him missing. But the chicago tribune reports he has been found \" safe and unharmed \" in texas. It's so far unclear how he got there, though officials had previously noted that segur could have driven home.",

        "summary": "Germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz tested what would be deadly descent settings on the flight that directly preceded the one investigators say he deliberately crashed into the french alps. That detail comes from a 29-page interim report released today by france's bea crash investigation agency; it describes how lubitz, flying from dusseldorf to barcelona, put the plane in a \" controlled descent that lasted for minutes and for which there was no aeronautical justification \" on the same day that he brought the plane down on its return journey. The ap reports the pilot had left lubitz alone in the cockpit, during which time he moved the plane into descent mode five times in less than five minutes. After each descent, he brought the plane back up to regular altitude. \" i can't speculate on what was happening inside his head; all i can say is that he changed this button to the minimum setting of 100 feet and he did it several times, \" says bea's director. The wall street journal specifies that during a 4.5-minute period, lubitz keyed in altitudes ranging from 1,000 feet to 49,000 feet. Investigators say the adjustments were made while the plane was descending from 37,000 feet to 35,000, so they apparently went undetected by the captain and others on the flight; air traffic controllers didn't notice them, per the new york times. The new information comes via that flight's black box. Reuters notes the bea's final report won't be finished for a year.",

It is called, awesomely, elfdalian, reports the local. Those hoping for a tolkien-esque link will be disappointed to learn that it has nothing to do with elves but instead translates to \" river valley. \" about 2,500 people are estimated to speak elfdalian, but only about 60 kids — hence the push to teach it in preschool in alvdalen. Linguists once thought elfdalian was just another swedish dialect, but they have since concluded that it's a distinct language, most likely a descendant of the viking language old norse that broke off from swedish around 1300, reports the financial times in a previous story. One reason: while swedes can understand speakers of different dialects, they're clueless when it comes to elfdalian, in part because it has grammatical characteristics not found in other scandinavian languages. \" elfdalian is a a goldmine, \" says one historian. \" it works almost like a linguistic deep freeze, where one can get a glimpse of old norse traits that have long since vanished in the other nordic languages. \" a conference later this week at copenhagen university will focus on elfdalian, led by a professor at lund university who taught himself how to speak it. He loves the preschool idea: \" in the past, children from this area didn't go far beyond the farms they lived on, but now they go to school and consume so much other media that it is hard for them to keep elfdalian as their main language. \"",

The ordinance in question was passed unanimously earlier this month by san francisco's board of supervisors, and when it takes effect within the next month or so ( the new york times says july; techcrunch says aug. 1 ), airbnb and other online rental marketplaces will have to ensure hosts renting out their homes are registered with the city. If the company doesn't comply, it can be fined $ 1,000 per unregistered host per day or be forced to scrub its site of those listings. But in a blog post, airbnb says \" unfortunately, the rules do not work, \" and cnnmoney notes a registration process that may \" turn off \" some hosts, including a $ 50 fee and a mandate that all paperwork be turned in in person. Specifically, the company claims the law will put some san francisco residents at risk of eviction or foreclosure because of \" confusing \" registration rules, and that the ordinance would violate the 1996 communications decency act and the stored communications act, which, respectively, protect websites from liability due to user content and from having to hand over consumer info without appropriate legal measures. A rep for the san francisco attorney's office tells the san francisco business times the city's not regulating online content — it's regulating the hosts ' business. \" it's simply a duty to verify information that's already required of a regulated business activity, \" the rep says.

        "summary": "For nearly 40 years, iowa held its straw poll for republican hopefuls every summer before the presidential caucuses — but the poll set for this summer is now dead, the ap reports. Iowa gop chairman jeff kaufmann tells the news agency that state gop officials made the decision in a unanimous vote during a conference call this morning, with the ap noting the tradition is ending because some 2016 candidates have already said they won't show up and because it's become nothing more than a \" costly sideshow. \" \" i've said since december that we would only hold a straw poll if the candidates wanted one, and this year that is just not the case, \" kaufmann says, per the washington post. \" this step, while extremely distasteful for those of us who love the straw poll, is necessary to strengthen our first in the nation status and ensure our future nominee has the best chance possible to take back the white house in 2016. \" since 1979, the post explains, the straw poll has served two main purposes: to bring money in for the iowa gop and show off the candidates. But critics say the event has become too expensive, resembles a carnival, and hasn't had a stellar success rate at predicting how well hopefuls will eventually do: the post points out that michele bachmann emerged victorious in the 2011 poll held in ames, then finished last in the 2012 caucuses; it's actually only been right about the gop nominee twice. Some republicans launched an 11th-hour campaign to try to save the poll ( see: this late-may op-ed in the des moines register ), but their efforts weren't enough. One person who likely won't be upset about the poll's demise: iowa gov. Terry branstad, who in 2012 proclaimed the poll had \" outlived its usefulness, \" the hill reported at the time.",

( associated press ) in this frame grab taken from video provided by the syrian anti-government activist group aleppo media center ( amc ), a child sits in an ambulance after being pulled out or a building hit by an airstirke,... ( associated press ) beirut ( ap ) — syrian opposition activists have released haunting footage showing a young boy rescued from the rubble in the aftermath of a devastating airstrike in aleppo. The image of the stunned and weary looking boy, sitting in an orange chair inside an ambulance covered in dust and with blood on his face, encapsulates the horrors inflicted on the conflicted northern city and is being widely shared on social media. Doctor in aleppo on thursday identified the boy as 5-year-old omran daqneesh. Osama abu al-ezz confirmed he was brought to the hospital known as \" m10 \" wednesday night following an airstrike on the rebel-held district of qaterji with head wounds, but no brain injury, and was later discharged. Doctors in aleppo use code names for hospitals, which they say have been systematically targeted by government airstrikes. Abu al-ezz said they do that \" because we are afraid security forces will infiltrate their medical network and target ambulances as they transfer patients from one hospital to another. \" in the video posted late wednesday by the aleppo media center, a man is seen plucking the boy away from a chaotic nighttime scene and carrying him inside the ambulance, looking dazed and flat-eyed. The boy then runs his hand over his blood-covered face, looks at his hands and wipes them on the ambulance chair. Opposition activists said there were eight casualties overall from the air strike on qaterji, among them five children. The image of omran in the orange chair is reminiscent of the image of aylan kurdi, the drowned syrian boy whose body was found on a beach in turkey and came to encapsulate the horrific toll of syria's civil war."

The wedding will be held at windsor castle, the town's most famous landmark and a favored residence of queen elizabeth ii. It is expected to draw thousands of extra visitors to the picturesque riverside town 20 miles west of london, and borough council leader simon dudley kicked off the controversy by tweeting over the christmas holidays about the need to clean up the town's streets. He then wrote to police and prime minister theresa may suggesting action be taken to reduce the presence of beggars and the homeless, reports the ap. Dudley referred to an \" epidemic \" of homelessness and vagrancy in windsor and suggested many of the people begging in the town are not really homeless. He said the situation presents a beautiful town in an unfavorable light. Homeless charities reacted angrily thursday to his suggestion. The bbc reports may was asked about dudley's comments and replied, \" i don't agree, \" though she did allow that \" where there are issues of people who are aggressively begging on the streets then it's important that councils work with the police to deal with that. \" harry and markle will be wed on the closed-off castle grounds but have said they want the public to be involved to some degree.

But house speaker paul ryan is still hanging in there, though he now says trump can't count on him for much help through the rest of the election. Politico reports that in a monday morning conference call, ryan told fellow republican lawmakers he \" won't defend trump \" or show up at any campaign events with him leading up to election day. Instead, he's choosing to set his sights on other matters. \" the speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities, \" his spokeswoman said in a statement, per the washington post. \" you all need to do what's best for you and your district, \" the post source says ryan told lawmakers in his call. And it's a real concern: a national nbc news/wall street journal poll released monday shows dems now have a 7-point lead on congressional preference, cnbc reports. But amid rumors that ryan is thinking of pulling his endorsement entirely, trump campaign manager kellyanne conway appeared on cbs this morning on monday, saying, \" i certainly hope speaker ryan keeps his word and his endorsement of donald trump, \" per politico. As for those lawmakers who've already withdrawn their support, trump doesn't have much hope for them in their own races. \" so many self-righteous hypocrites.

These are advertised prices, which may differ from what insurers fork out after discounts. \" we believe the best means to address affordability of medicines is to reduce the growing out-of-pocket costs that consumers are facing due to high deductibles and co-insurance, and ensure that patients receive the benefit of rebates at the pharmacy counter, \" says outgoing pfizer ceo ian read.

They are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves....

While the magazine said the car has exhilarating acceleration and handling, testers found \" big flaws \" including its 152-foot average stopping distance from 60 miles per hour in emergency braking tests. The magazine said the distance was worse than any modern car it has tested, and is about 7 feet longer than a ford f-150, a full-size pickup truck that weighs about twice as much as a model 3. That was just one of a few unfortunate headlines for tesla monday: forbes reported that the model 3, which is supposed to range in price from $ 35,000 to $ 78,000, may never actually cost just $ 35,000; a bloomberg analyst had noted sunday that a $ 35,000 model 3 \" will be the rarest of the rare. Perhaps the second most collectible tesla ever, behind the one floating around in space. \" meanwhile, in california, a driver was found dead early monday after his tesla model s veered into a pond in castro valley, ktvu reports.

            "Blue is the warmest color has been mired in controversy from the beginning. Even before winning the palme d ' or, the three-hour french lesbian love story was cannes ' most buzzed-about film, largely owing to its graphic, seven-minute-long sex scene. Still, critics were quick to praise the film as a masterpiece, which, despite its nc-17 rating, looked well poised to become the indie darling of this year's awards season. But soon a much less sexy controversy began to emerge. Beginning with claims of poor working conditions by the crew and allegations of anti-feminism against director abdellatif kechiche, the merde really hit the fan after stars léa seydoux and adèle exarchopoulos criticized the director's exploitative shooting practices in an interview with the daily beast. Kechiche shot back angrily, precipitating an ugly back-and-forth media brawl between kechiche and seydoux that shows no signs of simmering. Here's a timeline of how it's all gone down so far: may 23 blue is the warmest color premieres at cannes, receiving largely rave reviews ( and a few audience walkouts ).

Quanell x, the houston activist who led the meeting, said he \"did not come here this evening to jump on an 11-year-old girl, \" but also questioned why the girl didn't report the attack herself.

In his blog, driscoll writes: \" if you make it, we ' ll also give you free copies of my book, doctrine, so you can learn what the bible says about who god actually is, and we ' ll also provide fresh donuts and free coffee, along with smiles and chuckles. Sadly, i won't be able to make the party. This false prophet will be at his son's baseball tournament, enjoying time with his wife and five kids.",
            "This sunday, the infamous westboro \"baptist \" \"church \" ( wbc ) is scheduled to picket our federal way campus in auburn. You can find more about wbc from their very loving and gracious website, affectionately titled, godhatesfags.com. More of a dysfunctional family of religious lawyers than a church, wbc is led by fred phelps, who founded the church in 1955. The \"church \" comprises mostly his family of roughly 70 people. Jon stewart once said, \"the westboro baptist church is no more a church than church's fried chicken is a church. \" instead, they're more of a political hate group who use the name of god to advance their agenda. For the most part, they are self-funded, but they also receive funding from lawsuits. Doctrinally, they are extreme five-point calvinists, or what i like to call crazy calvinists. They basically believe the underlying message of the bible is one of god's hatred and wrath against humankind, and that the bible is properly interpreted through that filter. Therefore, they believe all mentions of god's love in the bible are in reference to god's christian elect and not applicable in any way to others outside god's elect — pretty much a cosmic game of duck, duck, damned. They also believe that, as they wrote in"

But if the book's massive success remains perplexing, its appeal to director david fincher — who has remade the workmanlike 2009 swedish adaptation as a slick and somber hollywood entertainment — is perfectly understandable. Fincher's earlier serial-killer films, se7en and zodiac, evince a scholarly fascination with the infinite varieties of human depravity, along with an unapologetically sick imagination ( remember brad pitt's fedex delivery at the end of se7en? ).

Swimmer brock turner received a sentence of six months in jail — he could have gotten 14 years — after being convicted of raping a passed-out young woman. In a letter written to the judge before sentencing, his father argued for just such leniency, reports the guardian. Brock turner shouldn't have his life ruined over \" 20 minutes of action, \" wrote dan turner, adding that his son had suffered enough already. \"he will never be his happy go lucky self with that easy going personality and welcoming smile, \" he wrote. \"his every waking minute is consumed with worry, anxiety, fear, and depression. You can see this in his face, the way he walks, his weakened voice, his lack of appetite. \" the letter was made public sunday in a tweet by stanford law professor michele dauber, who helped shape the school's new sexual assault policies, and it's being met with a barrage of criticism online. \" tone-deaf, \" says a post at the huffington post. It's a \" near-perfect complement \" to the victim's statement, writes christina cauterucci at slate. \" dan turner defends his son with nearly every thin excuse his son's victim demolishes in her letter; he elevates all the rape-apologist, victim-diminishing tropes she exposes as misogynist garbage. \"",

Danny heinrich, a 53-year-old resident of annandale, minn., admitted in court that he kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered 11-year-old jacob wetterling, reports ap. It was heinrich who had finally led authorities to jacob's body, and on tuesday he recounted the wrenching details of the 1989 abduction, reports the minneapolis star tribune. While driving on a dead-end street, he came across three boys on their bikes, and forced two of them — jacob's brother and a friend — to run away. Then he put jacob in the front seat and handcuffed him. \" what did i do wrong? \" he said the boy asked. Heinrich made jacob duck down in the seat because he had a police scanner and could hear reports coming in about the abduction. He drove to an area near a gravel pit, molested the boy, then told jacob he would drive him part of the way home. When jacob started crying, \"i panicked, \" said heinrich. \" i pulled the revolver out of my pocket.... I loaded it with two rounds. I told jacob to turn around, \" heinrich said. He shot the boy twice and left, but returned later to dispose of his body. He actually buried the boy twice — heinrich said the first location wasn't hidden enough, so he removed the remains and reburied them on a farm. The break in the case came when a review of dna evidence with new technology linked heinrich to another old assault. That led to a search warrant and the discovery of child pornography, and heinrich eventually confessed.",

Those charges stem from violence that erupted after the last presidential election in 2007.

Lake county major crimes task force commander george filenko says the probe points to \" criminal activity on the part of at least two other individuals, \" and a source tells nbc chicago that gliniewicz's wife, mel, and son, dj, are under investigation. Their names surface again in a sun-times report, which identifies them, via a source, as the \" individual 1 \" and \" individual 2, \" respectively, who exchanged revealing texts with gliniewicz. New village administrator anne marrin had been pressing gliniewicz about the explorer program up until the day before his death, and texts allegedly make reference to her. \" this situation right here would give her the means to crucify me if it were discovered, \" gliniewicz wrote. When individual 2 expressed hope that marrin \" decides to get a couple of drinks in her and she gets a dui, \" gliniewicz replied, \" trust me, i've thought it through. Many scenarios, from planting things, to the volo bog \" — the latter being local parkland, per the sun-times. Meanwhile, the 100 club of chicago, which offers money to the families of officers killed in the line of duty, has for the first time in its history asked for its $ 15,000 back. \" in this case it was not a line-of-duty death. That is clear, \" the charity's ceo says, per the chicago tribune. However, four girls who raised at least $ 5,000 for gliniewicz's children say the money will still go to the intended recipients. \" none of this is the children's fault, \" a parent says.",

            "Republican nominee mitt romney's awkward comment during the second presidential debate that he had received \"binders full of women \" as massachusetts governor when he requested more female job candidates went fully viral wednesday, drawing snickers from voters but also fueling a broader fight between the two campaigns over the key support of women. Romney's remark was just a sliver of the discussion tuesday night about issues relevant to women, with the candidates tussling over subjects such as contraception and unequal pay. The battle escalated on wednesday, as president obama worked to reclaim his advantage among women — and as the romney campaign returned to its core argument that the republican is better suited to manage",

Women's issues were prominent in tuesday night's debate as obama and romney clashed over gender equality and contraception. Obama is widely judged to have won the debate, undoing at least some of the damage caused by his painfully poor showing in the first one a fortnight ago. On the campaign trail in iowa on wednesday, obama latched on to some of the remarks made by romney, in particular a bizarre one about being offered \" whole binders full of women",

With some polls offering sporadic evidence that mr. Romney is gaining support among women in the final weeks of the campaign, the president seized every opportunity during their face-off at hofstra university on long island to assert that mr. Romney, the republican candidate, would eliminate financing for women's health services, block access to contraceptives, oppose equal pay and undermine the economic recovery for families in which women are the breadwinners"

The satellite radio company says the glenn beck program has been suspended for a week and may not return because of the remarks by thriller writer brad thor on the may 25 program, nbc news reports. If donald trump oversteps his constitutional authority and the \" feckless, spineless congress we have \" won't remove him, \" what patriot will step up and do that if he oversteps his mandate as president? \" thor asked. \" i don't think there is a legal means available, \" he added. Beck — who endorsed ted cruz earlier this year — told thor he agreed with the comments, which were widely seen as advocating trump's assassination. In a statement, siriusxm said thor's remarks \" may be reasonably construed by some to have been advocating harm against an individual currently running for office, which we cannot and will not condone. \" after the suspension was announced, thor said there had been \" no threat \" to trump implied during the beck interview, politico reports. \" hell no, i wasn't talking about assassination, \" he said. A beck spokesman said the host was already on vacation when he was suspended and that he expects to be back on the air monday.

Per huffpost, the australian actress told degeneres she's glad hollywood is starting to see less-stereotypical roles for plus-size actors, and that \" i ' m proud to be the first-ever [ plus-size ] girl to be the star of a romantic comedy. \" which may have been a simple bit of self-promotion, except for the fact there have actually been other plus-size women to star in such movies, including mo ' nique and queen latifah, as one twitter user pointed out. Yet wilson tweeted back that it was somewhat of a \" grey area, \" splitting hairs on whether the movies those actresses had starred in fell under the \" studio rom-com with sole lead \" category, and whether the actresses had actually been plus-size during filming. Making things worse, per monique judge on the root: wilson seemed to only respond to white women who corrected her on twitter, while blocking black women who did so ( the daily dot notes a #rebelwilsonblockedme hashtag emerged ). Mo ' nique herself responded, tweeting: \" take a moment and know the history. Don't be a part of erasing it. \" wilson issued an apology, per the sydney morning herald, noting that \" in a couple of well-intentioned moments... I neglected to show the proper respect to those who climbed this mountain before me like mo ' nique, queen latifah, melissa mccarthy, ricki lake, and likely many others. \" as for the twitter blocking, she said it was \" because i was hurting from the criticism, but those are the people i actually need to hear from more, not less.

From 2013 to 2014, sea star wasting syndrome hit sea stars from british columbia to mexico. The starfish would develop lesions, then disintegrate, their arms turning into blobs of goo. The cause is unclear, but researchers say it may be a virus, per the ap. Now, however, the species is rebounding. Sea stars are being spotted in southern california tide pools and elsewhere, the orange county register reports. \" they are coming back, big time, \" says darryl deleske, an aquarist for la's cabrillo marine aquarium. \" it's a huge difference. A couple of years ago, you wouldn't find any. \" similar die-offs of starfish on the west coast were reported in the 1970s, ' 80s, and ' 90s, but the latest outbreak was far larger and more widespread, per a report by university of california-santa cruz researchers. Beginning with ochre stars off washington state, the disease spread, killing off mottled stars, leather stars, sunflower stars, rainbows, and six-armed stars. It hit southern california by december 2013. \" when it did [ arrive ], you just started to see them melt everywhere, \" says deleske. \" you'd see an arm here, an arm there. \" the recovery has been promising. Four adult sea stars, each about 7 to 8 inches long, were spotted this month at crystal cove state park in newport beach. The stars aren't out of danger yet, though. The wasting syndrome never completely disappeared in northern and central california, and it's reappeared in the salish sea region of washington, per a recent report. Still, \" it's good to see we have some surviving and thriving, \" an educator at crystal cove conservancy says. \" maybe the next generation will be more resilient. \"",

        "summary": "That archaeologists are exploring what was buried in the ground where a palace once stood in northern india is fairly mundane news — except that they're on the hunt for more than 1,100 tons of gold... That a guru dreamed is located there. The dig began yesterday at the fort of raja rao ram bux singh in uttar pradesh state, three months after swami shobhan sarkar passed along news of his dream to officials, reports the afp. He says he was told by raja rao, who was hanged by the british in 1857, that the gold was there and should be given to the government. And there might actually be something there. The hindustan times reports that a team of officials with the archaeological survey of india was dispatched to investigate last month. What they found, in the words of the times: \" traces of hidden gold pertaining to 19th century \" some 65 feet underground. India today reports that drilling machines that made two holes there last week had hit something that seemed \" different \" at that level. The team intends to dig slowly, so it could take as many as five weeks for it to hit that depth. And according to sarkar, it could take some work. The gold \" will not be found at one place but deep digging would have to be done at several points, \" he says. Of course, if he's right, here's more tempting news: he reportedly also told officials there is roughly 2,750 tons of gold buried in the village of adampur as well.

She said spacey was \" an inestimable comfort \" when they worked on a film shortly after her husband's death. A number of allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against the oscar-winning actor, which he denies. The scandal prompted sir ridley scott to excise his performance as oil tycoon jean paul getty from all the money in the world and reshoot his scenes with christopher plummer. Plummer went on to be nominated for an oscar, a bafta and a golden globe for his contribution to the film. Image copyright getty images/miramax image caption the actress appeared with spacey in 2001 film the shipping news speaking at the san sebastian film festival on tuesday, dame judi suggested that the decision to erase spacey's appearance set a troubling precedent. \" are we to go back throughout history now and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or has broken the law",
            "While judi dench was in spain to receive the san sebastian intl. Film festival's highest award for an individual and to promote her latest feature, \"red joan, \" the dame didn't shy away from bringing up a name that many now prefer to avoid. Asked at a packed press conference on tuesday if there were any particularly memorable moments in her career that she looked back on fondly, she recalled an experience just after her husband had died. \"i went to do 'the shipping news ' with kevin spacey, and kevin was an inestimable comfort and never mentioned he knew i was in a bad way, \" dench told reporters ahead of the evening ceremony at which she was to receive the prestigious donostia award. \"he cheered me up and kept me going. \" in the current industry climate, it was obvious such a name drop wouldn't go unnoticed, and it wasn't long before the oscar-winning actress was asked about her current feelings toward spacey and the fallout the actor has faced in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against him. \"i can't approve, in any way, of the fact that — whatever he has done — that you then start to cut him out of the films, \" she said. \"are we to do what happened when he was replaced with christopher"

The guardian reports that more than 700 people suspected of dealing or using drugs have been killed since duterte, nicknamed \" the punisher, \" was elected after vowing to kill tens of thousands of criminals. Critics including sen. Leila de lima, a former justice minister, say police and vigilantes are using an anti-drugs campaign as an excuse to kill innocent people. \" we cannot wage the war against drugs with blood. We will only be trading drug addiction with another more malevolent kind of addiction, \" she told lawmakers recently. \" this is the compulsion for more killing. \" rights groups believe the rate of killing has reached dozens a day. A group of filipino human rights advocates issued a statement last week condemning the killings and accusing police of \" turning low-income neighborhoods in the country into free-fire zones. \" \" the bloody encounters taking place daily have polarized the country between those who support the president's quick and dirty methods of dealing with drugs and crime, and those who regard them as illegal, immoral, and self-defeating, \" the statement said. Reuters reports that one recent victim was michael siaron, a 29-year-old pedicab driver shot dead in manila by men on motorcycles. After photos of siaron being cradled by his widow went viral, duterte said the pictures were \" melodramatic. \" the widow admitted that siaron used drugs but said he was far too poor to have been a dealer — and that he voted for duterte.",

A global telecom company, however, has decided it's not waiting for mandates from each of its affiliate nations, including the us: vodafone will offer 16 paid weeks of maternity leave, covering new moms in the us, africa, the middle east, the asia-pacific region, and europe, cbs news reports. And once moms are back behind the desk, the company takes its progressive policy one step further, paying a mother's full salary for a 30-hour workweek for the first six months. The changes will be implemented by the end of 2015, the wall street journal reports. Kpmg research commissioned by vodafone estimated that businesses offering 16 paid weeks would dole out $ 28 billion a year globally for the benefits. But it also found that by saving $ 47 billion by not having to recruit and train new employees taking over for moms opting out of the workforce, companies would save $ 19 billion a year collectively. Vodafone ceo vittorio colao also thinks that since fewer moms will permanently off-ramp, his company can boost more women who work there ( 35 % of its employees ) into upper-management roles — only 21 % of its international upper ranks are currently made up of women.

Some early reactions to the historic victory: trump's \" astonishing \" victory \" is the greatest upset in the modern history of american elections — convulsing the nation's political order in ways so profound and disruptive its impact can't even be guessed at, \" writes glenn thrush at politico. He was able to defeat \" a better-funded, better-organized hillary clinton by surfing a tsunami of working-class white rage that her army of numbers crunchers somehow missed, \" thrush writes. What trump \" has done is nothing short of cataclysmic, \" writes chris cillizza at the washington post. \" he has fundamentally reshaped the political map. He has broken the republican party into pieces — and its shards still remain scattered everywhere. He has proven that the political polling and punditry industries need a deep re-examination. \" but beyond that, cillizza writes, the victory shows that \" many of the assumptions that people have long made about who we are as a country and what we want out of our politicians, our political system and each other are, frankly, wrong. \" conor friedersdorf at the atlantic says that he hopes trump will \" rise to the occasion \" — but to be on the safe side, people should start thinking now about how to thwart trump \" misbehavior. \" \" the most important project in american politics for the next four years is safeguarding the rights conferred by the constitution and the norms of a liberal society, \" he writes. \" the effort expended by ordinary citizens will determine the odds of that project's success. \" jim rutenberg at the new york times sees the media's failure to see what was happening leading up to the trump win as not just a failure of polling, but a failure \" to capture the boiling anger of a large portion of the american electorate that feels left behind by a selective recovery, betrayed by trade deals that they see as threats to their jobs and disrespected by establishment washington, wall street and the mainstream media. \" trump didn't just \" vanquish \" clinton, writes gerald f. Seib at the wall street journal. He \" instantly remade the republican party in his own image.
