        "summary": "Turkey acknowledges its f-4 phantom may have crossed into syrian airspace briefly, but it left immediately and had been back in international airspace for 15 minutes when syria shot it down friday, reports the bbc. \" according to our conclusions, our plane was shot down in international airspace, 13 nautical miles from syria, \" says turkey's foreign minister. International airspace begins 12 miles from syria's coastline. The syrian military claims it shot the f-4 just a half-mile from its coast. Turkey's state television announced this morning that the jet had been located in the mediterranean, which could help tell the tale. Turkey is calling for a nato meeting on tuesday regarding the shootdown, citing nato's article 4, which allows for consultations when \" the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the parties is threatened. \" uk foreign secretary william hague has condemned syria, calling the shooting \" outrageous. \" ( for a little background, foreign policy has an amusing post about running a radar unit in the syrian military, noting how just turning it on was called \" the suicide order \" ).",

            "Protests against government austerity measures have been spreading rapidly throughout khartoum today, with reuters reporting at least seven separate demonstrations in the sudanese capital throughout the day. The number of protesters have grown substantially since yesterday, when egyptian journalist salma elwardany reported a crowd of about 200 outside the university of khartoum. 400 to 500 protesters took to the streets after friday prayers in one suburb alone. Elwardany was detained by security forces, as was activist maha el-senosy ( who has been tweeting under the handle @mimzicalmimz ) of the youth movement girifna ( @girifna ), or \" fed up. \" both have since been released. Irin news reported that at least 100 people had been arrested in connection with the demonstrations as of june 20. According to reuters: \" the police fired tear gas and then used batons as they clashed with the protesters, who threw rocks. Witnesses said men in civilian clothes also attacked the demonstrators. \" rumors that internet will be cut off have been circulating among the protesters via twitter, under the hashtag #sudanrevolts, as activists attempt to circulate instructions for accessing social media via mobile phone.

As a profile in priceonomics explains, entrepreneur cindy gallop has a message behind her make love not porn video platform: she's worried about \" the creeping ubiquity of hardcore pornography \" and the effect it's having on men and women and their views about sex. ( gallop explained all this in a popular ted talk in 2009. ) the basic premise of mlnp is that people pay $ 5 a month so they can watch videos of real people having unstaged, normal, healthy sex. And the result? \" today, mlnp has neither failed nor achieved remarkable success, \" writes alex mayyasi. \" two years after its launch, it is in public beta and, according to gallop, earns revenues in the low five-figures each month. \" still, the promise seems to be there. More than 400,000 people have signed up, and a slew of market indicators suggests that \" sextech \" is poised to boom. One huge problem? because mlnp deals in adult content, many of the tools available to other business startups — web servers, credit card processing, email services — are either off limits or prohibitively expensive. Which means that in order for gallop \" and her fellow sextech entrepreneurs to disrupt the sex industry, they ' ll need silicon valley to stop being a bunch of prudes, \" writes mayyasi.

' \" she tells outside. She had a wide mathematical berth: anderson, who goes by the trail name anish in honor of her great-great ojibwa grandmother, beat matt kirk's 2013 record by four days. She was almost exactly 8 days slower than supported thru-hike record holder scott jurek, who was assisted by a support van — containing a bed — driven by his wife, who handed him a protein-packed \" fatty smoothie \" at every stop, per runner's world. Anderson, by contrast, carried all her own gear and slept in a tent she set up nightly over her trekking poles. She also hiked the trail in two thrift store sundresses, which had the advantages of being light and allowing her to pee standing up. Hence outside's title for her: the \" biggest badass you've never heard of. \" this isn't the only record set by the modest hiker and mountaineer, who lives in seattle but grew up in michigan. In 2013, she set the self-supported speed record for the pacific crest trail, hoofing it 2,663 miles from mexico to canada in just under 61 days. With that feat, she also crushed a record set by a man, in this case, scott williamson and his 64-day record. This after backpacker reports she developed 2-inch ankle blisters and sinuses so dry she dripped blood as she hiked — just two days into the feat.

Today, experts think they know where he was buried \" within a few yards \" — but that area is now a prison parking lot, or possibly a nearby nursery school. \"we know from burial records that henry was buried in front of the high altar in the old abbey, \" a historian on the team that's currently searching for the monarch with ground-penetrating radar tells the new york times. \"the aim is to find the footprint of the old abbey. \" \" what we don't know is whether he is still there, \" adds the historian. \" there has been so much development in the area over the years that his bones could be scattered everywhere. But there's a chance he's still there. \" henry i wouldn't be the first british ruler to end up under asphalt: just four years ago, archaeologists found king richard iii's skeleton under a parking lot in leicester that used to house a monastery.

A playboy interview published yesterday discusses the finer points of vaginas, porn, and masturbation, and refers to jessica simpson as \" sexual napalm \" — but all that was overshadowed by mayer's use of the n-word, for which he's now apologized via twitter. \" it was arrogant of me to think i could intellectualize using it, \" he tweeted. What he said in playboy was an elaborate point about how he's credited with having a \" hood pass, \" ie street cred, but \" if you really had a hood pass, you could call it a nigger pass. Why are you pulling a punch and calling it a hood pass if you really have a hood pass? \" back on twitter, he continues: \" i think it's time to stop trying to be so raw in interviews. I wanted to be a blues guitar player. And a singer. And a songwriter. Not a shock jock. I don't have the stomach for it. \" mayer also choked up last night at a nashville show, telling the audience, \" i quit the media game. I ' m out. I ' m done, \" e! adds.

Look now, however, and the figure is back below 7 million, reports bloomberg. Why? to get to the higher figure, the administration quietly changed the way it counted enrollments — instead of just those with medical coverage, it added in people with dental coverage. Previously, health care officials had reported the numbers separately, and the additional 380,000 dental subscribers put the total above the cbo's threshold. When republican fact-checkers noticed the change, the department of health and human services backtracked and reverted to the lower number. \"the mistake we made is unacceptable, \" hhs chief sylvia mathews burwell tweeted today. \"i will be communicating that clearly throughout the department. \" the higher number \" partly obscured \" the fact that the number of people with just medical coverage had dropped by about 1 million, writes alex wayne at bloomberg. \" it seems... That the administration changed the way it talks about enrollment numbers in order to partially mask how steep the decline actually was, \" adds philip bump at the washington post. The bloomberg story quotes a prominent pro-obamacare blogger who is \" appalled \" by the switcheroo and puzzled by the strategy — the original numbers weren't that far off, and this does nothing but give obamacare critics ammo.

And its arsenal includes unmanned drones, lasers, satellites and virtual reality headsets. Mark zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of facebook, announced on thursday that the company was creating a new lab of up to 50 aeronautics experts and space scientists to figure out how to beam internet access down from solar-powered drones and other \"connectivity aircraft. \" to start the effort, facebook is buying ascenta, a small british company whose founders helped to create early versions of an unmanned solar-powered drone, the zephyr, which flew for two weeks in july 2010 and broke a world record for time aloft. \"we want to think about new ways of connectivity that dramatically reduce the cost, \" said yael maguire, engineering director for the new facebook connectivity lab. \"we want to explore whether there are ways from the sky to deliver the internet access. \" it's the second head-spinning announcement from facebook this week and the third this year. On tuesday, the company said it would spend at least $ 2 billion to buy oculus vr, a southern california start-up that is developing virtual reality headsets for playing games and other uses.

            "Facebook plans to bring internet to the third-world via drones, satellites, lasers, and more. Today mark zuckerberg unveiled facebook's connectivity lab which will work on the internet.org project. It's powered by talent acqhired from solar-powered drone maker ascenta as well as poached from nasa. Internet.org, a partnership between facebook and telecom industry giants like nokia and qualcomm, hopes to use these air- and space-born methods to bring internet to the 5 billion people who currently lack it. Zuckerberg says that internet.org and facebook will work on inventing new technologies to complete the mission. While they both have somewhat altruistic objectives, facebook's connectivity lab could compete with google's project loon, which uses huge helium balloon vessels to beam internet to the developing world.

            "Photo san francisco — watch out, google. Facebook is gunning for the title of world's coolest place to work. And its arsenal includes unmanned drones, lasers, satellites and virtual reality headsets. Mark zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of facebook, announced on thursday that the company was creating a new lab of up to 50 aeronautics experts and space scientists to figure out how to beam internet access down from solar-powered drones and other \"connectivity aircraft. \" to start the effort, facebook is buying ascenta, a small british company whose founders helped to create early versions of an unmanned solar-powered drone, the zephyr, which flew for two weeks in july 2010 and broke a world record for time aloft. \"we want to think about new ways of connectivity that dramatically reduce the cost, \" said yael maguire, engineering director for the new facebook connectivity lab. \"we want to explore whether there are ways from the sky to deliver the internet access. \" it's the second head-spinning announcement from facebook this week and the third this year. On tuesday, the company said it would spend at least $ 2 billion to buy oculus vr, a southern california start-up that is developing virtual reality headsets for playing games and other uses. Last month, it said it would buy whatsapp, a messaging app that offers free texting around",
            "Facebook plans to bring internet to the third-world via drones, satellites, lasers, and more. Today mark zuckerberg unveiled facebook's connectivity lab which will work on the internet.org project. It's powered by talent acqhired from solar-powered drone maker ascenta as well as poached from nasa. Internet.org, a partnership between facebook and telecom industry giants like nokia and qualcomm, hopes to use these air- and space-born methods to bring internet to the 5 billion people who currently lack it. Zuckerberg says that internet.org and facebook will work on inventing new technologies to complete the mission. While they both have somewhat altruistic objectives, facebook's connectivity lab could compete with google's project loon, which uses huge helium balloon vessels to beam internet to the developing world.

Pancholi, an aspiring actor, was mentioned in a note found by khan's mother and sister in her bedroom a few days after she died, according to the hollywood reporter. The note alleges pancholi emotionally and physically abused khan, and also mentions that khan had an abortion against her will, reports reuters. But the bombay high court found that pancholi \" cannot be held solely responsible. \" pancholi accused khan's mother of misusing the note, and insisted he was in a consensual relationship with the starlet. The court decided the note may not have even been a suicide note ( it could be diary pages ), and observed that pancholi cared for khan after a previous suicide attempt. On the day she killed herself, the court says it appeared a \" misunderstanding \" between khan and pancholi led the actress to be \" in a rage of fury. \" also, the court stated, khan was very possessive of pancholi and jealous that he spent more time on his career than on their relationship, the times of india reports.

Ar bernard, leader of new york's christian cultural center and member of the president's evangelical advisory board, announced his resignation from the panel friday, citing a \" deepening conflict in values \" with the administration. The ap notes that with only one resignation, trump is thus far faring better with his religious advisers than with those from business and the arts, many of whom quit their positions this week. Outside bernard, members of the evangelical advisory board have condemned white nationalists while praising trump's reaction to charlottesville, in which the president equated hate groups and the people protesting them. Trump also officially lost billionaire carl icahn as a regulatory adviser this week, the new york times reports. Icahn announced he was quitting his position friday, though the white house claims it fired him monday. Icahn's defection had nothing to do with the president's comments on charlottesville, but rather accusations of conflicts of interest. Icahn had used his position to advocate for changes to regulations that would have benefited businesses in which he's heavily invested. Several democratic senators had called for icahn to step down, and he announced he was leaving his position as regulatory adviser just hours ahead of a times report on his conflicts.",

When the company's contract ended, workers could re-apply to stay with bmw, but had to submit to the automaker's unlimited background check policy. Of the plant's 645 employees, 88 were turned away, 80 % of whom were black — even though the workplace is 55 % black overall, cnn reports. The policy is \" a blanket exclusion without any individualized assessment of the nature and gravity of the crimes, the ages of the convictions, or the nature of the claimants'respective positions, \" says the eeoc. In one case, a woman with 14 years ' experience was let go over a 20-year-old misdemeanor conviction, the post reports.

Earlier that day, while moving into the 1,161-square-foot heights bungalow, one saw a gap in the attic's floorboards, peered in with a flashlight, and made a grim discovery, reports abc13: bones in the space between the attic floor and sheet rock of the ceiling below it. The chronicle reports they could belong to mary cerruti, the 61-year-old former owner who hasn't been seen since february or march 2015. The chronicle reports that police did enter the home that summer looking for cerruti, without luck; one neighbor went so far as to engage a private investigator. Now, perhaps, some answers: a pair of red eyeglasses the paper describes as of the type cerruti wore were found with the skeleton. Among the rumors that had swirled since cerruti went missing: that she had been killed, or that things somehow got messy with the luxury apartment complex that shot up next to her home — though she had vocally fought it, perhaps she actually gave in, sold her place, and then bailed on the neighborhood. But the latter doesn't jibe with the mortgage payments that stopped coming. And a neighbor recounts to khou that in 2015 firefighters did enter the home, and \" they said the smell was so bad, \" though the neighbor recalls that being attributed to dead cats found inside. The bones were removed saturday evening, though identity and cause of death have yet to be determined. A houston police detective says the person could have tripped in the attic and plunged into the empty space. ( the remains of a woman missing 40 years were found in this attic. )",

The telegraph reports that researchers at the university of cambridge tested more than 670,000 people and found that when it comes to empathy — the ability to gauge how others are feeling or what they're thinking about — women have more of it, and that guys view the world more through a logical rules-based system. The men and women in the empathy study, published in pnas, were asked to rank 20 statements that measured either empathy — ie, \" i can easily work out what another person might want to talk about \" — or \" systems-oriented thinking, \" such as asking how interested participants were in knowing \" the path a river takes from its source to the sea. \" men, on average, got a score of 9.87 out of 20 for empathy, while their female counterparts scored 10.79; for analytical thinking, men achieved a score of 6.73, women 5.45. What plays a part in determining individual differences in empathy, per varun warrier, one of the study's co-authors: our genes, our environment, and what hormones we're exposed to in the womb. In an accompanying data set to the main study, the scientists also found backup to support what a release calls the \" extreme male brain \" theory of autism: that autistic people are more apt to have \" masculinized \" traits and aren't as likely to get big numbers on empathy, but will score as high or higher on tests of systemizing. Per the sunday times, detractors are calling both theories a form of \" neurosexism \" and claiming that the study relied on too much self-reporting to be valid.

            "Scientists at the university of cambridge have completed the world's largest ever study of typical sex differences and autistic traits. They tested and confirmed two long-standing psychological theories: the empathizing-systemizing theory of sex differences and the extreme male brain theory of autism. Working with the television production company channel 4, they tested over half a million people, including over 36,000 autistic people. The results are published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The empathizing-systemizing theory predicts that women, on average, will score higher than men on tests of empathy, the ability to recognize what another person is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their state of mind with an appropriate emotion. Similarly, it predicts that men, on average, will score higher on tests of systemizing, the drive to analyse or build rule-based systems. The extreme male brain theory predicts that autistic people, on average, will show a masculinised shift on these two dimensions: namely, that they will score lower than the typical population on tests of empathy and will score the same as if not higher than the typical population on tests of systemizing. Whereas both theories have been confirmed in previous studies of relatively modest samples, the new findings come from a massive sample of 671,606 people, which included 36,648 autistic people.

Most of the ingredients were written in chinese, but the girl spent the next three months drinking three cups a day. According to abc news, she had lost only a few pounds when she started suffering from nausea and joint and abdominal pains. She would eventually develop jaundice. \" i was very scared when i was admitted to hospital and had lots of tests, \" the girl says in a report published wednesday in the british medical journal case reports. \" i didn't fully understand what was going on at the time. \" the initial suspicion was a urinary tract infection, but it turns out she had acute hepatitis. Doctors gave the girl intravenous fluids and medication — and made her stop drinking the tea — and she recovered quickly, abc reports. According to the telegraph, green tea has been rumored to be help everything from depression to breast cancer to dementia, thanks to its antioxidants. The report's authors even \" acknowledge that green tea is predominantly a very safe and healthy drink. \" and while they didn't test the girl's tea, they believe chemical additives or pesticides were likely the cause of her hepatitis.

The mcdonald's franchisee from pennsylvania never profited from the achievement, but almost 50 years later, the creator of the big mac had the pleasure of knowing 550 million of his burgers were sold in the us each year. Delligatti died surrounded by family at his home in a suburb of pittsburgh on monday, reports the ap. He was 98. Of his invention, delligatti once said it \" wasn't like discovering the light bulb … all i did was screw it in the socket, \" per the wall street journal. Though delligatti was inspired by double-decker burgers sold by mcdonald's rivals, mcdonald's was quite skeptical of his idea and at first batted down his plan for a double-sliced bun. But without an extra layer of bread, his special sauce — which took weeks to perfect — turned the sandwich into an all-out mess. Mcdonald's eventually approved the sale of the burger for 45 cents at delligatti's franchise in uniontown in 1967. A year later, it was introduced nationally as the \" big attraction. \" \" all i got was a plaque, \" delligatti later said. In 2007, however, mcdonald's helped him open the mcdonald's big mac museum restaurant in north huntingdon, pa., home of the world's biggest big mac. ( coming soon: the grand mac? )",

            "Osama bin laden's youngest widow has told pakistani investigators the al qaeda leader and his family had been living in the compound where he was killed for the past five years, said a senior pakistani intelligence official. Amal ahmed abdulfattah, a 29-year-old yemeni who was injured in a raid on the compound by u.s. Navy seals early monday and is now being treated in a pakistani military hospital, was one of three of bin laden's wives and several of his children who had been living with him in the garrison town of abbottabad, the official said. His account of her testimony offers some of the strongest evidence so far of how long the world's most-wanted man had been living in abbottabad, and in what circumstances, as well as some fresh insight into what happened during and immediately after the raid. Ms. Abdulfattah, whom bin laden married in 2000, was among a total of 17 people taken from the compound by pakistani forces after the raid, the official said. He said only that she was injured in the crossfire, but u.s. Officials have said a woman was shot in the leg trying to protect bin laden.the pakistan intelligence official said u.s. Forces had removed the bodies of bin laden and his 18-year-old son, but pakistani authorities had recovered the corpses of three other men from the compound. Among the",

        "summary": "There was another too-dramatic plane landing last night, this time at new york's laguardia airport, where the landing gear on a southwest plane collapsed. Injury reports vary — the wall street journal puts the figure at \" more than 10 \", and says six passengers and three crew members have been sent to hospital, while four others were treated at the scene. An additional four people also suffered panic attacks. There were 149 people on board. Passengers evacuated the plane via emergency slides and emergency vehicles were on the scene, cnn reports. Witnesses on the scene described things thusly: \" it was just a bang and a bounce, and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling, \" one passenger told anderson cooper. \" it just really felt like the plane could have broken in half, it was such a hard impact. \" \" the aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in a grass area between the runway and taxiway foxtrot, \" the airport's manager says. Observers on the ground tell nbc new york they saw a \" fireball. \" the plane \" was just screeching down the runway, fire on both sides, \" one says. \" there was debris kind of rolling off to the sides. \" \" that nose gear is completely off the plane and the nose is sitting on the ground, \" a passenger on another plane on the runway tells cbs new york. The faa originally said the plane had reported a possible problem with its nose gear prior to landing, but has since stated that a review of air controller tapes found no issues ahead of time. The incident shut down laguardia for several hours, but it's running again this morning, albeit with delays stretching to more than two hours, bloomberg reports. More than 120 arriving flights were canceled. Delta has responded by waiving change fees on most of its new york flights, including those from other new york airports, usa today adds.",

Soon after the debate finished, republican national committee chairman reince priebus said he was disappointed by cnbc and the moderators, who \" did a disservice to their network, our candidates, and voters \" by asking too many \" gotcha \" questions, the ap reports. Cnbc had planned to win over new viewers and show off new anchors with the debate, politico reports, but the network itself turned out to be the target of some of the fiercest attacks. Some candidates used their closing statements for jabs at the network, including donald trump, who boasted that cnbc had crumbled when he threatened to boycott the debate unless it was cut to two hours. \" nobody wants to watch three and a half or three hours, \" he said. \" they lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.

Issued its order thursday and gave russia 48 hours to comply, intensifying tensions between the two countries. President donald trump's administration described its action as retaliation for the kremlin's \" unwarranted and detrimental \" demand earlier this month that the u.s. Cut its diplomatic staff in russia. \" the united states is prepared to take further action as necessary and as warranted, \" state department spokeswoman heather nauert said. Still, she said",

Addressing first-year students at the mgimo university, where many of russia's diplomats and intelligence officers are trained, lavrov said moscow wanted to mend ties with washington. \"we sincerely want the political atmosphere to normalize, \" he said in a speech broadcast live on youtube. \" but, as you know, it takes two to tango and so far we've been seeing our u.s.

State department issued a sept. 2 deadline for the russian consulate in san francisco to close its doors. Activities at consular annexes in washington d.c.

A study out of stony brook university shows as much as 90 % of cancers are caused by external factors, like smoking, drinking, sun exposure, and air pollution, and are thus more preventable than previously thought. \" there are changes that we can all make to our lifestyles to significantly reduce our risk of cancer, \" a rep for the world cancer research fund tells the telegraph, adding some of the most common cancers \" could be prevented by adopting a more healthy diet, exercising more, and maintaining a healthy weight. \" scientists note cancer is too common to be explained by mutations in cell division, as a january study suggested, though external factors can cause high rates of mutations, per the los angeles times. \" intrinsic risk factors contribute only modestly to cancer development, \" a study author says. Researchers reviewed several studies — including some showing those who move from countries with low cancer rates to those with high cancer rates soon develop cancer at rates consistent with their new environment — to conclude that most risk factors are environmental or linked to lifestyle. Almost 75 % of the risk of colorectal cancer is related to diet, 86 % of the risk of skin cancer is linked to sun exposure, and 75 % of the risk of developing head and neck cancers is due to tobacco and alcohol, the study finds. It concludes 70 % to 90 % of cancers \" would not occur if we could magic away all the risk factors \" and shows \" we have to look well beyond pure chance and luck to understand and protect against cancers, \" says a statistician. Researchers also found \" mutations during cell division rarely build up to the point of producing cancer, \" according to nature. ( soon, hardly anyone under 80 will die of cancer. )",

The court appointed provisional administrator nobuaki kobayashi to take control of the company's assets from ceo mark karpeles, reuters reports. Karpeles is likely to be investigated for liability in the once-mighty bitcoin exchange's collapse, kobayashi said. One source tells the wall street journal that several companies are still interested in buying the defunct firm, but japanese bankruptcy experts say that's rare. The company ditched its rehabilitation efforts in part because it would be hard to get approval from 127,000 creditors spread across the globe, and in part because it lacked a credible plan or sponsors, sources tell the journal. An order for karpeles to appear at a us bankruptcy hearing tomorrow apparently sped up the decision. Karpeles won't show, a source says, because he thinks the us would arrest him, either for alleged fraud, or over mt. Gox's possible connections to silk road.

According to abc news, 39-year-old anne monoky goldman was pushing two of her children, ages 4 and 2, in a stroller while her 41-day-old infant was strapped to her chest aug. 15 in central park when a 75-foot-tall elm tree fell on them. Monoky goldman was pinned under the tree for 10 minutes or so before being rescued. \" they had to go take her out with chainsaws, \" a witness told the new york daily news at the time. Her lawyers say she suffered spine and neck injuries and a concussion. Her 2-year-old son was treated for a brain hemorrhage and concussion. In the lawsuit filed this week, lawyers claim the tree fell because it was decayed underground, posed a danger to all park visitors, and hadn't been properly maintained or inspected. Monoky goldman was released from the hospital last week, but her lawyers say she has to lay flat in bed for the next two to three months while her neck fractures heal. They say she may not be able to walk again. \" she can't pick up her baby, she can't breast-feed, she can't do her job \" doing social media for tory burch, one attorney tells the daily news. The city is reviewing the lawsuit. ( a pregnant woman was killed by a falling tree in an nyc park in 2013. )",

When it came out last week, the report included the saudi-led military coalition in yemen among the guilty parties. On monday, however, the un backtracked and removed the coalition from the list. Why? secretary-general ban ki-moon explained on thursday that he'd faced an impossible choice: unless the coalition was removed, the un would lose major funding. \" i... Had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many un programs, \" he said. Some context: ban didn't name names, but it's pretty clear that the saudi government was behind what the un chief described as \" undue pressure, \" reports the intercept. The saudis officially deny it. What's more, saudi clerics were reportedly considering a fatwa against the \" anti-muslim \" un, reports cnn. \" it's worth nothing that saudi arabia is a key funder of un humanitarian agencies, most importantly it is the fourth largest funder of the united nations entity that provides relief for palestinian refugees, \" observes an analysis at un dispatch. \" this was a threat that could not be easily be dismissed. \" human rights watch has written an open letter to ban criticizing the \" capitulating \" move. Before it was yanked, the report said that almost 2,000 yemeni children were killed or injured in 2015, most of them ( 60 % ) because of the saudi-led coalition, which in march of that year began fighting houthi rebels aligned with iran, reports voice of america. The new york times looks at how the incident illustrates the problems faced by un chiefs, just as world powers begin deliberating on ban's possible successor after 10 years.

As politico notes, this is the first criminal case alleging russian interference in the 2018 elections. Khusyaynova is a foreign national who lives in st. Petersburg, and she was not in custody. Khusyaynova works for an oligarch named yevgeny v. Prigozhin, described by the new york times as a close ally of vladimir putin who was previously indicted for interference in the 2016 election. She allegedly spent millions in an operation called project lakhta, buying advertising on social media, acquiring internet domain names, and pushing \" news postings on social networks. \" she and her team also \"took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary american political activists, \" the prosecutors wrote.

The third verse, which is not well-known since it's rarely sung, includes these lyrics: \" no refuge could save the hireling and slave / from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, / and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave / o ' er the land of the free and the home of the brave. \" as schwarz explains, this is a reference to slaves who freed themselves to fight for the british, against america, during the war of 1812.

        "summary": "The general feeling this morning? last night's academy awards ceremony was way too long, and host ellen degeneres didn't do nearly as good a job as anyone was hoping: on the huffington post, david macaray offers up three reasons this year's oscars was \" the worst. \" degeneres is one: \" she ruined it \" by treating the audience like \" a daytime studio audience, a tv game show audience, \" constantly going out into the seats to banter and resorting to \" props \" like pizza and selfies. The interminable length is another: with five minutes left before the ceremony's scheduled end, six important categories still hadn't been handed out. The last reason? there are simply no surprises anymore: \" if 12 years a slave hadn't won best picture, that would've been the oscars ' lead story. That's what it's come to. Our shock at who didn't win. \" at the hollywood reporter, tim goodman is even harsher: the show was \" turgid, badly directed, poorly produced, \" and \" so boring, so long, so self-involved. \" and degeneres offered up an \" endless string of tired or wince-inducing moments \" that ultimately drove the whole thing \" sideways into a ditch. \" her jokes were \" flat, \" the pizza stunt felt \" forced. \" and the producers didn't help: they \" seemed intent to stuff as many useless, time-killing montages into the early and middle sections as possible, making viewers at home continuously glance at that ticking clock. \" but brian lowry thinks a boring ceremony may have been the intent, coming as it did on the heels of last year's song about boobs. This year \" was a ho-hum evening, but not an embarrassing one, \" lowry writes in variety. \" degeneres is in many ways one of the few talents suited to this sort of steadfastly middle-of-the-road take on the oscars. \" one of the few moments critics kinda liked? when cast member darlene love burst into song after 20 feet from stardom won best documentary, but even that wasn't great: at deadline, lisa de moraes calls it the \" best spontaneous expression of joy that starts well and ends badly, \" noting that the song went on \" just long enough off-key to demonstrate why she's a backup singer not a headliner. \"",

A man dressed as an employee bemoans the lack of time available to explain what a whopper is, then leans into the camera and offers this: \" ok google, what is the whopper burger? \" any viewer who had a google home near the tv would see the device activated, and it would prattle off the wikipedia entry for the burger — but things didn't exactly go as planned. As the verge reports, the trouble with relying on wikipedia is that anyone can edit it, and it appears that burger king did just that, perhaps in violation of wikipedia's rules against \" shameless self-promotion. \" a first line that once framed the burger as a \" signature hamburger product \" was altered to reference a \" flame-grilled patty made with 100 % beef, \" and the verge found evidence the edit was made by burger king's marketing chief. But the edits didn't stop there. Gizmodo describes the ad as \" crashing like the... Hindenburg \" in a piece that rounds up some of the more creative edits the masses then made to the line, which variously framed the burger as being made from \" rat and toenail clippings \" and \" 100 % medium-sized child \" and being topped with \" cyanide. \" but the hijinks were to be short-lived. Google, which had no hand in the commercial, apparently disabled the prompt from working within three hours of the ad's debut, reports the verge.

The hamburger version is well known in the fast food industry, with burger king billing itself as \" the home of the whopper \" in its advertising, signage, and in its concept store, the bk whopper bar. Due to its position in the marketplace, the whopper has prompted burger king's competitors to try to develop similar products designed to compete against it. Burger king sells several variants that are either seasonal or tailored to local tastes or customs. To promote the product, the restaurant occasionally releases limited-time variants.

France's privacy watchdog asked google to delay rolling out the new policy, but google refused, the bbc reports. Data regulators in that country have since launched an investigation into the legality of the policy across europe. For now, there's nothing you can do to stop the search giant from collecting information about you whenever you use its services, and then storing all that information together in a sort of \" personal dossier \" — or, as the company put it, treating you \" as a single user across all our products. \" however, the los angeles times and the ap do have some tips: don't log in to google: this will be particularly hard for those who are used to constantly having their gmail or google+ accounts open. But if you're just a casual youtube or picasa viewer, or you like to use google's search engine or maps program, you can do all that without logging in — which means that whatever you search for or watch won't be linked to you for all time. Gmail or google+ junkies should make sure to log out before doing anything else on google. Don't use google: there are many, many other search engines. The best plan of all may be to use a variety, so that no one company knows everything you're searching for. Go ahead and keep using chrome: google's web browser, as well as its mobile payment processor wallet, are still using their own separate privacy policies.

Officials said a man was shot in the head sunday afternoon while speaking to democratic candidate chris rabb and a campaign volunteer about the state's upcoming primary. \" he was enthusiastic about the political process, \" said rabb, who is running for a seat in the 200th district. The man told rabb that he was planning to work at his local polling place on tuesday. \" this impressed us and we were in the process of encouraging him to join our campaign, \" rabb said late sunday in a statement. \" moments after he gave us his contact information he was murdered. \" police say the man was shot twice in the head, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Rabb was able to pull his volunteer to safety in a nearby convenience store. They were not injured. A few hours later in the same neighborhood, police said an 18-year-old man was shot in the back and a 17-year-old boy was grazed by a bullet in a drive-by shooting. The 18-year-old was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The 17-year-old was expected to recover. Police did"

When it comes to the gay voice, medical daily notes that \" as a society we associate \" a lisp with being gay, though the lisp is actually in \" no way linked to a child's future sexual preference. \" now preliminary data from a university of minnesota study may shed some light on where our belief in the so-called \" gay lisp \" comes from: the study found that boys ages 5 to 11 diagnosed with gender dysphoria — they don't identify as boys — are more likely to use \" th \" sounds when pronouncing the letter \" s \" than their peers. While all boys with gender dysphoria certainly don't become gay men, they are \" statistically more likely \" to do so, says researcher benjamin munson, who presented his findings at the biannual meeting of the acoustical society of america. \" the authors speculate that stereotypes of gay adults may be rooted in the speech of boys who go on to identify as gay, \" writes kelly servick at science. Based on the findings, one of munson's theories on the \" gay lisp \" stereotype is that when we were children we recognized the lisp as the speech of \" less masculine \" boys, and so we assume adult gay men will speak the same way. \" it's definitely plausible, \" a sociophoneticist not involved with the study tells science. Discussing the documentary do i sound gay? at decider, tyler coates writes that he's felt the need to deepen his voice throughout his life, even after identifying as gay. \" the film is about finding comfort in one's own skin ( or, at least, comfort in one's sound ). \" ( this dna test may be able to predict who's gay. )",

A report by the nuclear fuel cycle royal commission offered tentative findings that storing spent fuel rods — 429,900 tons now being temporarily stored in areas around the globe, per the sydney morning herald, or what the abc estimates to be 13 % of the world's waste — would be economically beneficial for australia, and such a facility would be ready to accept waste as early as the late 2020s, the guardian reports. The report, which bloomberg notes will be issued in final form on may 6, recommends a state-run fund be established to \" accumulate and equitably share the profits from the storage and disposal of waste. \" and those profits could be hefty: estimates say the operation could generate about $ 3.6 billion ( us ) a year for the first 30 years, then $ 1.4 billion until the end of the project — an estimated $ 183 billion in all, per the herald. The project would also result in plenty of jobs: 1,500 to start, with a peak of 4,500 during the 25-year construction period. Although specific sites for the waste weren't noted in the report, it says south australia would be ideal because it's not terribly prone to earthquakes, boasts a dry climate, and would have the political expediency necessary to carry out the project. There is the worry of radiation emitting into the atmosphere, leading an aboriginal group to call the plan \" immoral, \" per the advertiser. But the report cites facilities in finland and sweden that have set up safe, long-term storage for nuclear waste and says risks could be minimized.

Alyokhina recounts how they got him involved: \" we just went to his house, \" she says. \" we invited him to go with us and he abruptly stood up and sat with us in the taxi.

Sigrid veasey, a sleep professor at u of penn's perelman school of medicine, cuts to the chase: no, not really. Part of this reason is that humans simply need a certain amount of sleep to function properly, per the sleep foundation: last year, the group published a study in sleep health that spells out the average amount people need: for most adults, seven to nine hours seems to be the sweet spot. The problem comes, veasey notes, when sleep deprivation clouds our brains and makes us think we're doing ok after sleeping four hours at a time for weeks on end. \" the more you deprive yourself of sleep over long periods of time, the less accurate you are of judging your own sleep perception, \" she says. And lack of sleep can wreak havoc on more than your perception: it can screw with your metabolism and contribute to a host of medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity, per io9. So how do you figure out how much sleep you really need, without being unduly influenced by your foggy, sleep-deprived mind? go on vacation, advises the times blog.

For many of us with sleep debt, we've forgotten what \"being really, truly rested \" feels like. To further complicate matters, stimulants like coffee and energy drinks, alarm clocks, and external lights — including those from electronic devices — interferes with our \" circadian rhythm \" or natural sleep/wake cycle. Sleep needs vary across ages and are especially impacted by lifestyle and health. To determine how much sleep you need, it's important to assess not only where you fall on the \" sleep needs spectrum, \" but also to examine what lifestyle factors are affecting the quality and quantity of your sleep such as work schedules and stress. To get the sleep you need, you must look at the big picture. How much sleep do we really need: revisited the national sleep foundation released the results of a world-class study that took more than two years of research to complete – an update to our most-cited guidelines",
            "One way to have more time for work and play every day is to sleep a little bit less. But eventually, staying awake for longer periods can have a negative impact on the quality of our lives. So where does the break-even point lie, and can it be shifted? what you stand to lose few things do your body better than a good night's rest. While many of its molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unresolved, we know that sleep helps us consolidate memories, fight infection and manage stress – all while contributing to the maintenance and repair of just about every tissue in our bodies. Meanwhile, a lack of sleep can affect everything from your performance at work to your performance in bed. Foregoing sleep for extended periods of time has been shown to cause your body's metabolism to go haywire. High blood pressure. Obesity. Heart disease. Diabetes. They're all tied to a lack of sleep and crummy sleep habits – what researchers refer to as poor sleep hygiene. \" sleep services all aspects of our body in one way or another: molecular, energy balance, as well as intellectual function, alertness and mood, \" says sleep expert dr.

Moylan tells the marin independent journal that his grandson's death is \" heartbreaking, \" but he doesn't blame it on the bridge or the lack of a barrier. \" the poor kid was a very troubled young man, \" he says. \" he was generous and good natured, but he just had that demon in there.

Uecker, who was riding in the utv, was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital. No details yet on what caused the accident, which authorities are still investigating. Collaborator and bandmate chad barnhill posted a moving tribute to uecker on facebook, writing \"i will always love you abby. I promise to celebrate your life with others. You touched so many lives. \" the musician recently recorded her first single, \" cool, \" and was known throughout nebraska, where she toured extensively. Her official bio says that uecker had been performing since age four, and that she went on to study musical theater at the university of nebraska-lincoln, where she began singing in a local band. Per the daily news, barnhill says uecker spent her final days doing what she loved best — performing and spending time with her family. \"music is a gift that lasts a lifetime, \" he says. \"abby was my most special music gift. \"",

On monday, the fbi searched the property of an 80-year-old mobster linked to the 1990 theft of 13 paintings — including three rembrandts, a vermeer, and a manet — from boston's isabella stewart gardner museum, reports the boston globe. A lawyer for robert gentile says agents searched in and around his home in manchester, conn., using metal detectors and dogs. At one point, they were seen digging within 10 feet of the house after removing siding and a vent pipe reportedly leading to an underground oil tank, per the hartford courant. But \" they ain't gonna find nothing, \" gentile told his lawyer, adding he didn't steal the paintings, isn't hiding them, and has no idea where they are. Two previous searches of the property turned up nothing, though federal prosecutors say gentile offered to sell two of the stolen paintings to an undercover fbi agent for $ 500,000 each in 2015, reports nbc connecticut. He also offered to return the paintings in exchange for a lesser sentence for a friend and told at least three people that he had access to the art, prosecutors say. Agents don't believe gentile actually took part in the theft — those two men are dead, according to the fbi — but the wife of a suspect told police that her husband gave gentile two paintings before his death in 2004. Gentile is now serving a 2.5-year prison sentence for drug and gun charges after an arrest last year, per abc news. The gardner museum, meanwhile, is offering $ 5 million for information leading to the recovery of the masterworks.",

Not one has made it to the top of north america's highest peak alone in the brutal weather of january — until now. Lonnie dupre, a 53-year-old minnesota adventurer, became the first to do so last sunday, reports alaska dispatch news. It was his fourth attempt in recent years, and this one took him 25 days, reports outside magazine, which explains why this bit of \" mountaineering history \" is such a big deal: \" on a mountain that has become increasingly modernized with route markers and safety infrastructure, his journey was more akin to the first attempts on denali that occurred more than a century ago, \" writes shelby carpenter. Dupre tells the ap that once he reached the 20,000-foot-plus alaskan peak, he relayed his gps coordinates to confirm his location, and took three turns to take in the view. \" the whole skyline opened up before me and i could see the entire length of the alaskan range, \" he recalls. \" i could see the shadow of denali that was nicely painted to the north of me.
