        "summary": "Good news for the extremely lazy and people with a moral objection to anything larger than a single serving: keurig has officially entered the soup game. Time reports the makers of the single-serving, pod-based coffee machines partnered with campbell's soup in 2013 and are finally ready to launch a line of campbell's soup k-cups. The chicken soup pods will come in either homestyle or southwest-style and cost $ 1.50 each — more than double the 63-cent cost of a single serving of old-fashioned canned campbell's chicken noodle soup, according to cbs news. A campbell's marketing director tells cbs the new soup pods are for people who \" want to fit soup into different parts of the day, \" and he's confident consumers will pay the extra price for that convenience. He better hope he's right: keurig is currently facing dropping sales and layoffs, and \" soup isn't exactly a growth market, \" as cbs puts it. Apparently, sales of soup as a whole were largely stagnant in 2012 and 2013. But if the campbell's soup k-cups do take off, time reports the companies have one piece of advice: run hot water through the machine between products to avoid soupy coffee or coffee-ish soup.",

The company first announced its partnership with campbell's in 2013, and is only now getting round to selling the pods for use in its coffee machines. The k-cups are 70 calories or less and come in two flavors, homestyle chicken and southwest style. There is a slight chance your coffee could taste like soup, or vice versa, so keurig recommends running a hot water brew cycle without a pod before and after making the soup.

The product is available in two flavors: chicken noodle soup and southwest chicken noodle soup.

In the meantime, keurig has turned its sights to food, with its campbell's effort representing its first foray beyond beverages. While soup might be an obvious extension for keurig, given instant soups and ramen require hot water, soup isn't exactly a growth market. Soup sales were almost flat in 2012 and 2013. No surprise, then, that campbell's sales and earnings are hardly at a boil. The company this month forecast revenue to be flat to up 1 percent for the 2016 fiscal year, while analysts had expected 1 percent growth, according to the wall street journal. The idea to join forces came after data showed that keurig machine owners tended to eat campbell's soup products, said michael goodman, marketing director of innovation at campbell's. \" we designed the proposition to allow consumers who love campbell's and love their keurig machines, and want to fit soup into different parts of day, \" goodman said. \" of course we hope this continues to grow and strengthen the business. \" the challenges of engineering soup for the keurig"

In fact, optimism is associated with greater personal happiness, but could it impart biological benefits as well? researchers at the harvard school of public health suggest it's possible in a new study in the american journal of epidemiology. They analyzed data from more than 70,000 women between 2004 and 2012. Optimistic women, they found, are considerably less likely to die from a handful of diseases than their pessimistic counterparts, possibly in part because of reduced inflammation. \" our new findings suggest that we should make efforts to boost optimism, which has been shown to be associated with healthier behaviors, \" one researcher says. The study is not without flaws. For one, optimism may be calculated differently from one person to the next. And \" reverse causation \" could be at play, where people in better health are more likely to be optimistic, reports live science. But it's a large study, and the numbers are statistically significant. The most optimistic women were 52 % less likely to die from an infection than the least optimistic, and roughly 38 % less likely to die from stroke, heart disease, and respiratory disease. The effect was even seen in cancer, though with just a 16 % reduction. The lead author tells the new york times that studies in twins suggest optimism is 25 % heritable, so it's 75 % \" under our own control, \" while an outside researcher warns npr we should be careful not to blame patients.

The ig nobel prizes were physically handed to the winners by seven genuine nobel laureates: dudley herschbach ( chemistry, 1986 ), rich roberts ( physiology or medicine, 1993 ), jack szostak ( physiology or medicine, 2009 ), roy glauber ( physics, 2005 ), eric maskin ( economics, 2007 ), peter diamond ( economics, 2010 ) and louis ignarro ( physiology or medicine, 1998 ). Professor ignarro was also given away in the win-a-date-with-a-nobel-laureate contest. The event was produced by the science humor magazine \"annals of improbable research \" ( air ), and co-sponsored by the harvard-radcliffe science fiction association, the harvard-radcliffe society of physics students, and the harvard computer society. The ceremony also featured numerous tributes to the evening's theme of \"chemistry, \" including a performance of tom lehrer's classic song \"the elements \", by nobel laureate rich roberts and harvard medical school professor thomas michel. The night included the premiere of a new mini-opera called \"chemist in a coffee shop, \" about a chemist who discovers that coffee shop employees know a lot about coffee chemistry.

        "summary": "Elon musk unveiled tesla's newest electric vehicle, the tesla model 3, thursday night in california, and the hype was strong. Thousands upon thousands of people lined up at tesla dealerships to reserve the vehicle, which isn't even scheduled to be released until december 2017. But that's what you get when you promise a $ 35,000 mass-market electric vehicle. Here are seven things you need to know about the tesla model 3: usa today reports the final tally of model 3 pre-orders reached 198,000 on thursday, with 115,000 people paying the $ 1,000 reservation fee without seeing as much as a picture of the car. Abc news states the model 3 is the vehicle that could finally make tesla \" a key player in the burgeoning market for mid-priced electric vehicles, \" with one expert saying it's a \" much more critical vehicle than any vehicle that has come before. \" how important is the model 3 to tesla? slate reports it will \" make or break tesla, both as a company and as an idea \" while attempting to turn the company from a \" niche luxury brand into a major world automaker. \" vox says there could be a hidden reason buyers are tripping over themselves to reserve the model 3: tax credits. The federal government phases out its $ 7,500 tax credit for buying an electric car when companies produce 200,000 vehicles, and tesla is nearing that cutoff. The wall street journal reports the model 3 represents a huge challenge for tesla, which has only made around 110,000 vehicles in its history. It's now staring down the barrel of nearly 200,000 pre-orders with 20 months to ramp up production. The los angeles times gives consumers five reasons not to believe the model 3 hype, including a history of quality problems at tesla and the company's questionable financial health. Finally, gizmodo throws a bucket of cold water on the whole thing, noting that \" the model 3 cannot be the hero for the us's energy woes if we don't fix a few serious problems with our infrastructure first. \"",

        "summary": "\" does calgary really want the winter olympics? does anyone? \" that's the question posed by the new york times on monday, and it looks like the first question has just been answered. The ap reports that, in a nonbinding referendum held tuesday, 56 % of voters ( more than 170,000 in all ) in the city that hosted the 1988 olympics gave the thumbs-down to a repeat in 2026. Over on the city council, a good number of the board's members had already expressed similarly lukewarm feelings on the alberta city's bid, and that puts the international olympic committee in somewhat of a spot, as it now only has two iffy bids in: from sweden's stockholm and a shared proposal from milan and cortina d ' ampezzo in italy. A handful of other cities nixed their bids, or had their bids rejected, earlier this year. In his piece for the times, michael powell explains that cities vying to host are often plagued by various roadblocks that can make the bids untenable, including financing obstacles, environmental issues, and even the risk of corruption and violence in the poorer parts of metropolitan areas. The canadian olympic committee isn't happy with the calgary vote, saying in a statement, per the ap: \" this would have been a unique opportunity for canadians to be leaders in fulfilling the promise of a renewed vision for the games. \" the calgary city council is expected to get more into the vote on monday, but the ap notes \" there is little doubt the bid seems dead. \" the bbc agrees council will likely respect the voters ' will. The ioc will make its final pick in june. ( not as many people are even watching the olympics. )",

The delay probably means the measure won't reach the full senate by the end of april as planned.

Both sides have reportedly agreed to allow up to 200,000 foreign guest workers into the country per year on special visas to fill jobs such as housekeepers, child care workers, and janitors.

The vest was found by a street cleaner in a pile of rubble in chatillon-montrouge, on the southern edge of paris and a considerable distance from the sites of the attacks on the right bank of the seine to the north. However, authorities say data from abdeslam's cell phone placed him in the chatillon-montrouge area on the night of the nov. 13 attacks, which killed 130 people and injured 350 others.

In the end, the gainesville sun says his attempts to speak were \" mostly drowned out. \" during a q&a session following his speech, one person asked him what it felt like to get punched in the face on camera, to which he responded, \" yeah, it hurts when someone punches you in the face. Is that a real question?... Are you threatening me with violence? \" someone else asked about heather heyer, the protester killed at the charlottesville \" unite the right \" rally, and spencer said the man arrested for her death is a \" scapegoat \" and what really happened to her is \" unclear. \" there was some violence outside, with a man wearing a swastika-covered shirt punched in the face.

Paramedics then rushed her to a hospital, where doctors removed part of her skull to relieve brain swelling. The new york daily news reports she is brain dead. Frierson, 60, who was struck in the ankle and wrist, was admitted to a hospital in serious but stable condition. \" the bricks just came off the building without warning, \" says a doorman. \" i saw the grandma stagger. She was holding the baby in her arms. \" authorities are investigating what caused the debris to fall from the building, built in 1919. There hadn't been any recent complaints about the facade, according to records, but work had been completed on the structure recently and at least two other windows appeared to be missing bricks yesterday, reports the post. In 2010-2011, the building's owner paid a $ 6,467 fine for failing to complete a facade inspection on time. In a statement, per the new york times, the department of buildings says \" a violation has been issued for a failure to maintain the property in a safe and code compliant manner. The department is requiring that the property owner construct a sidewalk shed to protect the public. \" ( a falling gargoyle killed a bride-to-be last year. )",

Monday's interment was no less somber as a lone bugle wailed \" taps \" for some 400 mourners gathered in section 60 of the hallowed cemetery, the final resting place for many soldiers killed in iraq and afghanistan. Country singer lee brice performed songs dedicated to gilbert, who was killed on nov. 27, 2006. The 34-year-old pilot was protecting us troops not far from baghdad when his f-16 crashed. Militants seized his body, leaving only bone fragments to bury at his funeral one month later. \" he was like a trophy, going from tribal leader to tribal leader, \" says his father, ron gilbert. When the military balked at recovering the rest of her husband's body, gilbert's widow, ginger gilbert ravella, began a campaign that reached into the highest echelons of the pentagon, according to stars and stripes. In 2013, gilbert's toe bones were recovered and there was a second funeral. Ravella puzzled about how to explain the multiple burials to the couple's five children, then ages 7 to 17. \" you can imagine what it's like for children to bury their father three times, \" she says. In september, a us special operations team recovered the rest of gilbert's body, which on monday found a final resting place amid a sea of white marble graves bedecked with a quarter-million holiday wreaths.

            "Although many microbial explorations for hadal sediments began in the 1950s, the hadal water is the least-explored microbial biosphere. In this study, unexpected microbial ecosystems associated with the hadal trench water were discovered down to a 10,257-m water depth in the challenger deep of the mariana trench, which is the deepest ocean on earth. We found the enrichment of heterotrophic population in the hadal water ( 6,000 ∼10,257 m ) microbial communities, whereas the chemolithotrophic populations were more abundant in the upper abyssal waters. This observation suggested that the hadal microbial biosphere was supported by the endogenous recycling of organic matter in the hadal waters associated with the trench geomorphology. Abstract hadal oceans at water depths below 6,000 m are the least-explored aquatic biosphere. The challenger deep, located in the western equatorial pacific, with a water depth of ∼11 km, is the deepest ocean on earth. Microbial communities associated with waters from the sea surface to the trench bottom ( 0 ∼10,257 m ) in the challenger deep were analyzed, and unprecedented trench microbial communities were identified in the hadal waters ( 6,000 ∼10,257 m ) that were distinct from the abyssal microbial communities. The potentially chemolithotrophic populations were less abundant in the hadal water than those in the upper abyssal waters.

            "Although many microbial explorations for hadal sediments began in the 1950s, the hadal water is the least-explored microbial biosphere. In this study, unexpected microbial ecosystems associated with the hadal trench water were discovered down to a 10,257-m water depth in the challenger deep of the mariana trench, which is the deepest ocean on earth. We found the enrichment of heterotrophic population in the hadal water ( 6,000 ∼10,257 m ) microbial communities, whereas the chemolithotrophic populations were more abundant in the upper abyssal waters. This observation suggested that the hadal microbial biosphere was supported by the endogenous recycling of organic matter in the hadal waters associated with the trench geomorphology. Abstract hadal oceans at water depths below 6,000 m are the least-explored aquatic biosphere. The challenger deep, located in the western equatorial pacific, with a water depth of ∼11 km, is the deepest ocean on earth. Microbial communities associated with waters from the sea surface to the trench bottom ( 0 ∼10,257 m ) in the challenger deep were analyzed, and unprecedented trench microbial communities were identified in the hadal waters ( 6,000 ∼10,257 m ) that were distinct from the abyssal microbial communities. The potentially chemolithotrophic populations were less abundant in the hadal water than those in the upper abyssal waters. The emerging members of chemolithotrophic nitrifiers in the hadal water that likely adapt to the higher flux of electron donors were also",

The ap reports the judge, army col. Jeffery nance, said monday the court has not been directly affected by trump's criticism of bergdahl. He also ruled that a reasonable member of the public would not have doubts about the fairness of military justice because of trump's comments. He rejected a defense request to rule that it would be unfair to give bergdahl any prison time. The judge did say, however, that he would consider trump's comments as a mitigating factor in the sentencing. Other mitigating and aggravating factors that he could consider include bergdahl's mental health and serious wounds to service members who searched for him. The wife of one of those soldiers is expected to take the stand monday as bergdahl's sentencing hearing resumes. National guard master sgt. Mark allen was shot in the temple while looking for bergdahl, who faces up to life in prison. The ap previously reported that in mid-october trump was asked about comments he made about bergdahl while he was a candidate; while on the campaign trail, trump called bergdahl a \" dirty, rotten traitor \" who deserved to be executed by firing squad or thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Trump replied that he couldn't say anything more about the case, \" but i think people have heard my comments in the past. \" the defense argued that showed he harbors the same views as commander in chief.",

Namely, they fulfilled a bet: if their fourth- and fifth-grade students bested the school goals set for the state of texas assessments of academic readiness tests, the teachers would do \" gross but awesome \" things, reports the killeen daily herald. The staar tests are tough and important: texas kids in grades 5 and 8 can't move on to the next grade unless they pass them, reports kltv ( they have three chances to do so; there's an appeals process if they don't manage to do that ). The clements/parsons kids did well, so a number of teachers stepped up to the plate. A guinea pig was kissed, as was a bulldog. Another teacher — whose classroom happens to be filled with frog decorations — ate frog legs. But language arts teacher michele cox took the cake, by eating something very un-cake-like: she swallowed worms, of the gummy variety at first. \" most of them don't think you ' ll do it, \" she explains, so she began by implying she might not as well, before moving on to live earthworms. \" it's ok. I chased it with chocolate, \" she says of the experience. Janet dees, the teacher who ate frog legs, jokes that she had it worse. \" the worms were able to just slide down the throat, but i actually had to chew the frog. \" but all the teachers agree on one thing: if the promise of watching a guinea pig get kissed helped the kids get through four hours of testing, it was worth it.

Yes, his work is that complicated. In 2012, shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university, who's known to work in isolation, published a 500-page proof he said explained the abc conjecture, a renowned math problem involving prime numbers. The problem is few could understand his proof because it required a grasp on inter-universal teichmuller theory — essentially a new branch of math mochizuki created — and he refused to travel to explain it to the mathematical community, reports nature. Finally, a breakthrough came last month in kyoto, where he lives. During a meeting of four dozen mathematicians, mochizuki was able to teach his theory to others. As ivan fesenko of the university of nottingham put it on facebook, some participants \" visibly progressed in their understanding \" and ended up \" tired but happy, \" per motherboard. ( the latter site gets into the nitty gritty of the \" simple-seeming \" abc conjecture. ) there are now 10 people who reportedly understand iut and are working to verify mochizuki's proof. But it isn't clear how soon that could happen. One number theorist says it could still be years before mochizuki's theory is proven correct — or not.

The catch? no other mathematician could understand the thing. Mochizuki had unleashed an impenetrable mathematical hellscape. Understanding it is not simply a matter of being a really great number theorist, one has to become an expert in an entirely new mathematical field as defined in mochizuki's papers. The only preparation for verifying the new proof is to understand inter-universal teichmüller theory, which no one really does.

Watch that montage here. Bad material, worse transitions: example? \"one minute hathaway is yelling something about lesbians and then … tom hanks comes talking about gone with the wind, \" writes erik pederson on e!. Most talked-about presenter? possibly kirk douglas, who seemed to divide watchers into two camps. E! says that \"his charm is undiminished, \" but on deadline, nikki finke writes that \"it was painful to watch and listen to \" him. On new york, david edelstein's take: \"i... Like that douglas had fun. … but i hope i ' ll never have cause to relate to how hard people try to hold onto certain physical and physiognomic ( if that's a word ) attributes beyond reason... \" the inevitable f-bomb: melissa leo, who accepted the award for best supporting actress after the aforementioned presenter stalled for a very, very, very long time. Watch a very r-rated version in the gallery. ( her co-star christian bale, who later won best supporting actor, said \" i ' m not gonna drop the f-bomb like she did, i've done that plenty before. \" ) leo was quick to apologize. Auto-tune at the oscars? you betcha. One of the more amusing pieces of filler involved re-imagining some of 2010's films... As musicals. Watch here. So... How was franco? kinda \" stoner-esque, \" writes edelstein. \" there are stoned people who can be quite amusing, others who just kind of sit back and think their own amusing thoughts. The latter kind shouldn't maybe host awards shows. \" hathaway was \" singing and dancing and mugging and acting her heart out and he's not projecting anything.

            "( reuters ) - goldman sachs group inc ( gs.n ) has agreed to pay $ 5.06 billion to settle claims that it misled mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis, the u.s. Department of justice said on monday. The settlement, which goldman disclosed in january, stems from the firm's conduct in packaging, securitization, marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the justice department said. Investors suffered billions of dollars in losses from the securities bought during the period, the department said. The settlement comprises a $ 2.385 billion civil penalty and $ 1.8 billion in other relief, including funds for homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their property, as well as distressed borrowers. It also preserves the government's ability to bring criminal charges against goldman and does not release any individuals from potential criminal or civil liability, the justice department said. In addition, goldman will pay $ 875 million to resolve claims by the new york and illinois attorneys general, the national credit union administration and the federal home loan banks of chicago and seattle. A state and federal working group formed to investigate wrongdoing in the pre-financial crisis mortgage-backed securities market negotiated the settlement, said new york attorney general eric schneiderman. The group has reached settlements with five other major financial institutions since 2012: j.p. Morgan chase ( jpm.n ) ( $ 13 billion ), bank of america ( bac.n ) ( $ 16.6 billion ), citibank ( c.n ) ( $ 7 billion ) and morgan stanley ( ms.n ) ( $ 3.2 billion ). \"we are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us, \" a goldman spokesman said in a statement. \"since the financial crisis, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our culture, reinforce our commitment to our clients, and ensure our governance processes are robust, \" he said.

A new study from the international program on the state of the ocean explains that oceans have guarded us from the worst effects of climate change, but are now facing devastating issues at a scale and rate \" unprecedented in earth's known history. \" for the most part, \" the public and policymakers are failing to recognize — or choosing to ignore — the severity of the situation, \" the report states. \" we are seeing effects that no one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It's clear that it will affect many species, \" an oxford biology prof tells the bbc. Coral reefs — vital to the health of fisheries — are especially in danger, and could stop growing or dissolve if ocean temperatures rise a few more degrees. Another scary fact: carbon is being released 10 times faster today than before the last major extinction 55 million years ago.

Three people briefed on the conversation say trump questioned why the u.s. Would accept more immigrants from haiti and \" shithole countries \" in africa rather than places like norway. The people were not authorized to describe the conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump says friday: \" the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca! \" ___ 7 a.m. President donald trump says a bipartisan immigration proposal is \" a big step backwards. \" he tweets that it would force the u.s. \" to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly. \" trump seems to",
            ".... Because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety, daca has now taken a big step backwards. The dems will threaten \"shutdown, \" but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, make america great again!",

After recounting their back-and-forth, she wrote, \" 3-year-old for sale. $ 12 or best offer. \" pretty harmless, yes? well, no, as it turns out, because an anonymous tipster reported the line to child protective services of mississippi's lafayette county. And then, much to mcdaniel's disbelief, a rep from the agency showed up at her office with a sheriff's deputy in tow asking about the boy, writes mcdaniel in an essay at time. She had to yank her child out of a nap at preschool so he could be interviewed. It took a few days, but with the help of an attorney, mcdaniel was able to have the case dropped. She's relieved, of course, but also angry, and not at child services. \" cps has a hard job, both in the nature of what they do and the day-to-day demands of handling each case, \" she writes. Instead, she's upset at the tipster. Mcdaniel's best guess is that it was someone, perhaps a stranger, who took exception to something she wrote online as part of her job as editorial director at oxford newsmedia. \" it is one thing to come after me, a grown adult woman who enthusiastically signed up for a career that comes with a large amount of exposure and criticism, \" she writes. \" coming after my son is utterly despicable. \" she'd like to see rules put in place with punishments for those caught deliberately making false claims and wasting the agency's time.

However, the justice department is now investigating whether he was wrong about that, reports the wall street journal. The department's inspector general is looking at two memos in particular. In one of them, comey blacked out information of his own accord that he deemed to be confidential, according to the journal. The other three he considered safe. One of those three, however, apparently contained information that was upgraded to classified status after comey left the fbi. The situation is similar to one that occurred with hillary clinton and her infamous email server — some emails that she circulated were ok at the time she did so but were later upgraded to classified. No charges were brought against her ( by comey ), and it's unclear whether comey himself would face any charges in this new investigation. Fox news confirms that the inspector general is investigating the possible mishandling of classified info. One person who needs no convincing: president trump.

Shell, the industry's lead negotiator, says it hopes to resume talks as soon as possible. The union's demands include bigger pay increases and better health coverage. Demands in the 1980 strike included dental coverage and increased pay, both of which workers received. \" looking back now, we all have all our teeth when we retire. It was a good thing, you have to look at the long run, \" a retired refinery worker in louisiana tells reuters.

            "Dylann roof wants to waive his right to a jury trial and put his fate into a federal judge's hands. His defense attorneys on thursday filed a notice in u.s. District court indicating his intent to make the move. The death penalty case is set to be tried nov. 7. But prosecutors also have the same right, and it's unlikely that they would agree to forgo a jury trial. In capital cases, 12 jurors are chosen in a question-and-answer process that can last weeks. If they unanimously decide that a defendant is guilty, the jurors also determine whether he should be executed. A judge must adopt any death verdict. The 22-year-old roof would face execution if convicted in the june 17 killings of nine black worshippers at emanuel ame church. \"the defendant hereby states that he is willing to waive jury, and to be tried and sentenced by the court, \" roof's lead attorney, david bruck, wrote in thursday's filing. \"however, counsel for the government has informed defense counsel that the government will not consent to waive jury at either stage of this case. \" the defense filing amounts to a procedural formality. After setting a trial date earlier this week, presiding judge richard gergel issued orders laying out the dates when opposing attorneys must file certain motions. Whether roof planned to waive",

Researchers say that over the last decade, some of the 120 mummies at the university of tarapaca museum in arica have begun to decompose as rising humidity levels cause bacteria to thrive on the mummies'skin. The microorganisms \" chew these guys right up, \" causing them \" to go black and become gelatinous \" when the moisture and temperature is just right, says harvard's ralph mitchell, an expert in microbiology. Arica has long been arid, but fog off the pacific has reached the area in the last 10 years. \" this kind of degradation has never been studied before, \" mitchell tells the harvard gazette. To come up with a solution, mitchell and his team tested pig skin as well as the mummies'skin in different levels of humidity. Skin began to disintegrate after just 21 days in high humidity. Researchers say the mummies should be safe when stored in a room with humidity at 40 % to 60 % — but the museum's mummies aren't the only ones at risk. Hundreds more are believed to be buried in northern chile, which boasts man-made mummies 2,000 years older than those in egypt. \" you have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: how do i stop them from decomposing? \" mitchell says, per cnn. \" it's almost a forensic problem. \" ( more recent mummified corpses were found atop a mountain in mexico. )",

While out for a ride with his girlfriend in yuma, ariz., on july 11, he came up behind a bus and changed lines in front of a silver honda accord. The driver of the vehicle, who thought he'd been cut off, began tailing munoz and honking his horn, munoz tells the yuma sun. What happened next was caught on munoz's gopro. With munoz stopped at a red light, the driver, identified as lee schismenos, 51, stepped out of his car and approached the couple. \" you got a problem? \" munoz asked. \" yeah, i got a f****** problem, \" schismenos responded, before appearing to punch munoz in the face. Munoz's camera next seemed to catch schismenos pushing munoz's girlfriend, then punching munoz again. As munoz tried to restrain his alleged attacker, schismenos appeared to trip over a curb. Munoz was then able to pin schismenos on the ground, with help from witnesses, until police arrived. A responding officer said he smelled alcohol on schismenos, who reportedly admitted consuming four or five shots of whiskey before getting behind the wheel, reports wgn. He was taken to a hospital with a broken ankle. \" once he was on the ground you could sort of see, you know, his eyes raging, you know, really red, dilated for some reason, \" munoz's girlfriend, luisa loy, 21, tells abc news. Schismenos reportedly told police that munoz shouted an expletive at him, which caused schismenos to throw a punch; that loy hit him before he shoved her; and that he fell to the ground only because munoz punched him. None of his claims are verified by the video footage. Schismenos could face charges including dui, assault, disorderly conduct, threats, and endangerment, munoz explains in the video description, adding the case has now been forwarded to the state.

The hundreds of thousands of turtles then turned around and simply abandoned their nesting area on ostional beach along the pacific coast. \" it was a mess, \" a tour guide who witnessed the scene tells the new york times. It was also an unlikely mess, because the nesting season for olive ridley sea turtles ( from august to october ) is usually protected by the rainy season, which cuts off the beach by overflowing the nosara river. But this year, el nino caused low rainfall and kept the river from rising too high. So the \" mob of eco-tourists \" were able to prevent the turtles from taking their course, tech times reports. \" i almost had a panic attack because it was so crowded, \" says a us doctoral candidate who's been studying the turtles. \" it was basically a free-for-all. \" according to a wildlife official, the beach is also a wildlife refuge where tourists can only go with a licensed guide — so many of them must have gained access illegally.

In the journal of neuroscience, lavie and her team note a person's sense of vision and hearing are found in the same region of the brain called the association cortex. Here, capacity is limited, so rather than multi-task, your brain chooses whether to see or hear at a given time. Previous research shows people lose focus on what's in front of them when listening to sounds, reports discovery news. When vision takes priority, there is \" inattentional deafness, \" researchers say. To reach that conclusion, they asked 13 people to press a key when a certain letter appeared on a computer screen while listening to music. After conducting brain scans, researchers found participants could detect sounds when the visual task was easy. But when it became more demanding, the brain's response was significantly lower. \" the brain scans showed that people were not only ignoring or filtering out the sounds, they were not actually hearing them in the first place, \" a researcher says in a release. While this might seem harmless, it can be dangerous for drivers focusing on directions or pedestrians who are texting. A focused surgeon might also fail to hear the beeping of equipment. As for other effects: \" you may think that the person is ignoring you, but their brain just can't respond to your voice, \" says lavie. \" you shouldn't take it personally. \" ( up to 20 % of people may \" hate sound. \" )",

        "summary": "A bit of clarity is starting to form about what prompted ivan lopez to open fire at fort hood this week. Investigators are backing up early reports that lopez had an argument with one or more soldiers immediately prior to the assault, reports ap. And while lopez's mental health issues may have played a role, it was the argument that set him off, said lt. Gen. Mark milley, reports the washington post. \"his underlying medical conditions are not a direct precipitating factor, \" said milley. \"we believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area. \" a cnn report adds further credence to the belief that the argument was about lopez's request for a leave of absence. The father of wounded soldier jonathan westbrook says his son was working in the office that distributes leave forms when lopez came in and was told by an officer to return the following day. Instead, he returned a short time later and opened fire, says theodis westbrook. \" the first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards jonathan, aimed it, and fired, \" the elder westbrook tells wlbt of mississippi. \" i don't know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times. \" ( earlier, the new york times had a similar report, though it said that lopez's leave had been denied, and that he became angry while discussing it with fort hood officials. ) the pentagon, meanwhile, has confirmed that the three soldiers killed were daniel ferguson, 39, of mulberry, fla.; carlos lazaney rodriguez, 38, of puerto rico; and timothy owens, 37, of effingham, ill. Ferguson was a transportation supervisor, lazaney rodriguez a unit supply sergeant, and owens a heavy vehicle driver. All had served time overseas.",

Now pai says the fcc will determine if colbert's joke meets the supreme court definition of \" obscene, \" in which case it will \" take the appropriate action \" — most likely a fine. The official definition of obscene, as quoted by slate: \"it must appeal to an average person's prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a 'patently offensive ' way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. \" the daily beast reports the fcc announced its investigation a day after fox business network host neil cavuto asked pai about doing exactly that.

Diners will also be sent home hungry if they're found to be over the age of 60. And there are more rules: no phones, no \" calling out to other customers, \" and no touching.

Hot on the heels of naked restaurant openings in london and australia, tokyo has now announced its own body-baring establishment, set to open here on july 29. Called \"the amrita \", ( sanskrit for \"the immortality \" ), tokyo's version of the naked dining experience is marginally more sedate than its overseas counterparts, but it's also a little stricter too. Here, customers will be revealing their skin but keeping their nether regions covered, with \"paper underpants \" provided by the restaurant. That doesn't mean they're shying away from the adventure of body-baring during dinner, though, with the opening event based around an \"adam and eve \" style banquet and featuring \"men with the world's most beautiful bodies \" as waiters, set to entertain patrons while dressed in nothing but skimpy g-strings.

But the outraged response from his opponents and prominent women's and religious groups hasn't exactly hurt the man known as \" duterte harry \" — in fact, it looks like his lead before the may 9 elections has grown since he made the comment, the abc reports. And it was a significant jump: of 1,800 respondents to a social weather stations research survey in march, 27 % of them said they supported duterte. By april 18-20, when the survey was readministered ( and just a couple of days after his rape-focused statements ), that number had jumped to 33 %. Duterte is now 9 points ahead of second-place candidate sen. Grace poe, per the sws poll. \" it's a clear lead, \" an sws rep says. \" the joke could have affected him in such a way that his score could have even been higher had it not been for that news. \" a second survey by pulse asia has him even further ahead, with 34 % saying they're duterte fans and 22 % aligning with poe, the ap reports.

        "summary": "Scientists are floating an intriguing new theory about the demise of woolly mammoths: dogs may have driven them to their graves. Specifically, dogs that learned to hunt with humans, reports science. The idea stems from research of sites around the world known as mammoth cemeteries because of the huge number of bones unearthed. But just how did they come to be? considering that the graveyards started showing up 44,000 years ago, around the time that humans arrived on the scene, penn state anthropologist pat shipman thinks the best guess is that our predecessors are to blame. These early hunters probably killed the mammoths year after year at the same spots on migratory routes — and shipman thinks they got help from the earliest of domesticated dogs, reports the siberian times. For one thing, dog fossils have turned up at the sites, too, including one that seems to have had a large bone placed in its mouth upon burial, as if to honor its hunting prowess. What's more, many dog skulls show healed fractures, suggesting they got some human tlc. If dogs and humans learned to team up to kill the mammoths and share in the spoils, it would be among the first, if not the first, collaborative efforts between the two species. \"this is the first time that someone's gone out on a limb and suggested something different than what we thought before, \" says one expert on dog domestication not involved with the work. \"but it's still very speculative at this stage. \" ( click to read about how modern dogs help us keep e.

The african american community, the hispanic community, and young people. The president's campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift — so he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars. \" those \" gifts, \" according to romney, were college-loan-interest forgiveness, free contraception, extended insurance coverage for 20somethings, obamacare, and amnesty for the children of illegal immigrants. Unsurprisingly, there's been some reaction: the increasingly outspoken bobby jindal took issue with the comments, reports politico. \" no, i think that's absolutely wrong, \" he said at a press conference yesterday. \" we have got to stop dividing the american voters. We need to go after 100 % of the votes, not 53 %. \" jindal isn't the only one alluding to the now-legendary 47 %, though some are doing so a little more explicitly.

Then followed the news that they had been located, with psych professor tim schallert telling the la times that ut san antonio called him to say, \" we got those brains! \" but the times then heard from that school, which said it had no such thing in its possession. What could be the final answer came shortly thereafter, via a statement put out by ut austin: \" a preliminary university investigation has revealed that ut environmental health and safety officials disposed of multiple brain specimens in approximately 2002 in accordance with protocols concerning biological waste. \" the statement goes on to say that those specimens disposed of were \" in poor condition when the university received them in the 1980s and were not suitable for research or teaching. \" it estimates that 40 to 60 jars were disposed of, and that some of the jars contained more than one brain. But the author of malformed: forgotten brains of the texas state mental hospital tells the new york times he's skeptical. \" those jars were designed to hold one brain, and i find it hard to believe that if 40 jars were disposed of, that accounted for all the brains. \" what's still a mystery: whether the brain of tower sniper charles whitman was one of the brains given to the school. The school has \" no evidence \" of that, \" though we will continue to investigate those reports. \"",

Rather, they contend, it was meant for the priests of the temple, though historically only chapter 21 has been interpreted as applying to only priests, including a ban on ritual scarring and tattoos. The other rules have long been extended to everyone of the jewish faith, including the decree that only meat from an \" animal that has a cloven hoof that is completely split into double hooves, and which brings up its cud \" was ritually clean enough for consumption, per vice's munchies. Many aspects of the book of leviticus have long confounded scholars, including whether it was moses who compiled the book, and when it was first composed — some say 3,500 years ago, others say far more recently, possibly in the fifth century bc. The current argument is that the entire book was originally written for priests, but somewhere during babylonian captivity someone extended the rules in leviticus to everyone as a means of unifying the exiled, and setting them apart from those of other religions around them, reports vice. So this ban on bacon, for instance, encouraged \" the enthusiastic self-perception that [ jews ] were all priests in the new temple of god, the world, \" one scholar says.

Nearly a year ago, the mayor thrust himself into worldwide infamy when another drug dealer, mohamed siad, tried to sell another video of the mayor allegedly smoking crack to media outlets in canada and the united states. At the time, the mayor denied using the drug, only to later admit that he had smoked crack cocaine in a \" drunken stupor \" and said that he was not an addict. Since then mr. Ford has been filmed numerous times in public appearing",
            "Toronto - mayor rob ford says he's \"ready to take a break \" from the mayoral election campaign to \"go get help. \" the decision to immediately step away from the campaign — while staying on the ballot — came after the toronto sun exclusively obtained a new raunchy audio recording of ford ranting and swearing in an etobicoke bar. The globe and mail also published a report that a new video surfaced of toronto mayor rob ford smoking what has been described as crack-cocaine early saturday morning. Ford told the sun columnist joe warmington that he realizes \"it's time \" and that he \"wants \" to \"deal with his issues. \" he said he is being urged to not leave the mayoral race by people around him. The audio recording, covertly taped by a patron of sullie gorman's monday night, captures the mayor being unruly as he's ordering booze at the royal york rd. Bar, complaining about his wife renata and making lewd comments about mayoral contender karen stintz. \"i'd like to f ----- g jam her ( stintz ), but she doesn't want... I can't talk like this... I ' m so sorry, \" ford is heard saying on the recording. \"i forgot there's a woman in the house. \" according to one witness, ford was seen buying"

But china finally put its foot down monday to block two young independence-advocating activists from assuming legislative seats after winning elections there. Sixtus \" baggio \" leung, 30, and yau wai-ching, 25 — part of the \" youngspiration \" party, per npr — took their oaths of office in october, but instead of swearing allegiance to the \" hong kong special administrative region of the people's republic of china, \" both said \" chee-na \" ( widely seen as a pejorative ), and yau threw in an obscenity for good measure. None of which pleased china, which accused the two millennials of threatening national security with their constant talk of liberation and wordplay. And so beijing whipped out a rare interpretation of hong kong's \" basic law \" — set up before the territory's sovereignty was passed over from britain in 1997, and which gives china power over hong kong courts. That law issues a vague requirement that those taking office swear allegiance \" in accordance with law, \" with some arguing the whole deal is murky. The duo's oaths were ruled invalid, and the pair was effectively denied the chance to retake them by the national people's congress standing committee on monday, per the ap. The chair of the country's parliamentary committee on the law notes, \" there is a great patriotic tradition in the chinese nation. All traitors and those who sell out their countries will come to no good end. \" the ruling came just one day after thousands of democracy activists demonstrated in hong kong, australia's abc notes.

Washington julius genachowski said on friday he will step down as chairman of the federal communications commission in the coming weeks after four years on the job, and touted his record of working to expand broadband internet service to americans. Genachowski, whose term was due to end in june, told fcc staffers he would be leaving his post \" in the coming weeks \" but did not give a date. He told reuters after his announcement that he has no career plans lined up for after his fcc tenure ends. \" i ' m still focused on the work of the agency, \" genachowski said, adding that he expects the fcc, which maintains a democratic majority, to keep its policy direction after he leaves. Asked to describe his tenure at the fcc in three words, genachowski answered \" unleashing broadband's benefits. \" his exit from the agency that oversees telecommunications and broadcast policies was widely expected after president barack obama's re-election. Obama will nominate a successor to genachowski, who has headed the fcc since 2009.

A california venture capitalist who put down a $ 5,000 deposit on a tesla model x blogged about problems he encountered during the launch event in an open letter to musk — and musk responded by canceling the man's order for the car, the guardian reports. In his first post in september, stewart alsop complained that the event started nearly two hours late, with no acknowledgement of that or apology from musk ( and no \" real food \" provided, to boot ). Alsop wrote that he ultimately left in disgust when it became clear he wouldn't be able to test-drive the model x, as promised, until after some 1,300 people ahead of him. Then, in a follow-up post this week, alsop reveals that musk reached out to him personally... To tell him he was banned from buying the car. Alsop writes that musk considered the open letter a \" personal attack \" but maintains that \" i was actually just a customer who felt he had been ignored at an event designed for customers. \" he adds that it's particularly sad, because he had often talked — even in his complaint letter — about how excited he was to own one of the $ 130,000 cars. In response to the attention alsop's post is getting, musk tweeted wednesday, \" must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention. \" the guardian asserts that musk's wealth allows him \" the ability to be unbelievably petty, \" but kim lachance shandrow at entrepreneur writes that musk, \" entrepreneurial superstar, future citizen of mars, \" isn't getting the scrutiny other ceos would over such a move. \" aside from a few dings and scrapes, his halo seems fully intact. \" ( musk isn't worried about offending apple employees, either. )",

In an unlikely move saturday, the vatican returned it, afp reports. It's \" very rare \" for the vatican museums to return artifacts, and it wasn't easy for ecuador to get the head back, requiring months of negotiations.

But the 16-page document, which details the legal reasoning behind the use of drone strikes against americans, uses a very broad definition of \" imminent. \" a key part: \" the condition that an operational leader present an ' imminent'threat of violent attack against the united states does not require the united states to have clear evidence that a specific attack on us persons and interests will take place in the immediate future. \" the document is not the same one used to justify the killing of anwar al-awlaki, but the legal reasoning appears very similar, reports the new york times. An aclu director describes the memo as \" chilling. \" at its heart, \" it argues that the government has the right to carry out the extrajudicial killing of an american citizen, \" he says. \" it recognizes some limits on the authority it sets out, but the limits are elastic and vaguely defined, and it's easy to see how they could be manipulated. \" a bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote to president obama yesterday urging him to release documents explaining his \" authority to deliberately kill american citizens \" in drone strikes or other counter-terror operations, politico reports, and the issue is expected to play a key role in the confirmation hearing of counter-terrorism adviser john brennan as cia director.",

The latter one, for example, amounts to blaming the victim. \" these messages instruct women that they are to blame for being sexually exploited because they dared to express themselves sexually in private and in consensual contexts, \" writes hess. Two tweets on the theme: lena dunham: \" the'don't take naked pics if you don't want them online ' argument is the'she was wearing a short skirt ' of the web, \" writes the creator of hbo's girls. Farhad manjoo: \" i've never heard anyone respond to financial hacking by saying, just don't use online banking. That's what you get for using credit cards, \" writes the new york times tech columnist. Telling her to laugh it off or \" own it \" is offensive, too, writes samantha allen at the daily beast. In fact, lawrence's initial response is just right: she's angry about having her privacy violated and intends to pursue the hackers legally. \" just because she's america's sweetheart doesn't mean she can't seek justice as well, \" writes allen. \" if anything, lawrence's hardline stance on this photo theft should be just as endearing as the fact that she ate a philly cheesesteak instead of a salad on oscar night. \" she is \" reacting authentically in the face of a public that expects actresses to be superhuman. \"",

            "The president's clean power plan reducing carbon pollution from power plants power plants are the largest major source of emissions in the u.s., together accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas pollution. Progress: in september 2013, the environmental protection agency ( epa ) announced proposed carbon pollution standards for new power plants. Progress: in august 2015, we established the clean power plan — the first-ever carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, protecting the health of our children and working toward a 32 percent reduction in carbon pollution by 2030. Expanding the clean energy economy since the president took office, the administration has made the largest investment in clean energy in american history, including increasing solar generation by twenty-fold and tripling electricity production from wind power. The clean power plan will lead to 30 % more renewable energy generation in 2030. Progress: since 2009, the department of the interior permitted more than 50 clean energy utility-scale projects on public or tribal lands. The projects could support over 20,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to power 4.8 million homes. Progress: the administration launched solar ready vets, an initiative to train transitioning veterans to enter the solar workforce and meet our goal to train 75,000 people to enter the solar workforce by 2020.

The report relies on thousands of photos of dead bodies that were apparently killed by strangulation, starvation, and beatings; some had no eyes and others had been electrocuted, the guardian reports. The bodies are \" reminiscent of the pictures of those [ who ] were found still alive in the nazi death camps after world war ii, \" said desmond de silva, one of three lawyers who wrote the report. Each body was apparently taken to a doctor who wrote out a false cause of death, such as \" heart attack \"; the bodies were then buried and a death certificate given to the family. All 55,000 photos, showing 11,000 victims, were taken by a photographer for the syrian military police who supports the rebel opposition and fled the country — but prosecutors still trusted his evidence. \" this is a smoking gun, \" said david crane, another report author. \" this is direct evidence of the regime's killing machine. \" but legal action seems unlikely for now, cnn notes, because syria is not in the international criminal court, and the un security council won't act due to russian veto power. \" all we can do is put the ammunition in the pistol, \" said de silva. \" it is for others to aim it and pull the trigger. \" see a cnn video containing images from the report, but be warned, they are graphic.",

        "summary": "Despite being drafted 13th overall by the miami dolphins with a contract worth an expected $ 12.4 million, thursday was a bad day for laremy tunsil. Cbs news reports the university of mississippi offensive lineman was expected to go much higher — to the baltimore ravens with the sixth pick — which would have earned him an estimated $ 20.4 million. Tunsil's potentially $ 8 million loss is almost certainly due to a video allegedly showing him smoking pot out of a gas mask bong that was posted to his twitter account minutes before the start of the nfl draft. But it didn't end there for tunsil. According to the washington post, screenshots of a private conversation between tunsil and a mississippi coach were posted to his instagram account while he was at the draft. The conversation shows tunsil requesting money to pay his mother's utility bill, among other things, in violation of ncaa rules. Tunsil admitted being in the video — which he says was filmed years ago — and asking for money but says someone hacked his social media accounts to post the incriminating images. One possible suspect: his stepfather lindsay miller. Miller filed a lawsuit against tunsil on tuesday claiming tunsil assaulted him and defamed him last june. Tunsil claims he was protecting his mother from miller.",

The 77 year-old lanier was trapped on a chunk of driftwood early friday between the checkpoints of white mountain and safety, in an area known as the blow hole. The roughly 15-mile-long formation along the bering sea coast acts as a wind tunnel, creating a \" blizzard that would close highways in the lower 48, \" according to janssen. Janssen's team was making good time -- about 10.2 mph -- when he happened to look to his left, where he saw reflectors on a dogsled facing the wrong way and hit his brakes. \" i yelled out, ' are you all right?

Scientists took a look at 34 trials involving 14 antidepressants and 5,260 subjects with an average age of 9 to 18, a release notes. Drugs studied included sertraline, sold under the brand name zoloft, and escitolopram, or lexapro. Findings? \" the only one that is better than placebo and other drugs is prozac [ fluoxetine ], \" says the study's lead author, reports the ap. Venlafaxine ( effexor ), meanwhile, may actually pose a danger to youngsters: subjects who took this drug showed an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actual attempts compared to those who used placebos and five other antidepressants. The study was published in the lancet journal. And because of what researchers say is a dearth of reliable data, venlafaxine may not be the only antidepressant that could prove dangerous, leading to the scientists ' own caveat for this research: that the relatively small number of eligible studies they reviewed, the flawed design of some clinical trials, and misreported results may be masking the true risk involved with the studied antidepressants. The percentage of us youngsters up to age 19 taking antidepressants rose from 1.3 % in 2005 to 1.6 % in 2012 — despite fda warnings and psychological interventions still being encouraged as the first resort. \" we recommend that children and adolescents taking antidepressants should be monitored closely, \" a study co-author writes, \" particularly at the beginning of treatment. \" ( paxil, one of the drugs included in this research, was found to be unsafe for teens in a 2015 study. )",

        "summary": "A toronto man is dead after a cat bit him on the right thumb — but the cause is so rare that doctors wrote up a case study in the world journal of clinical cases warning other physicians to be on the lookout for the unusual cascade of events. Animal bites are common, and the reason for some 330,000 annual us er visits, with those attending doctors \" acutely aware of the skin and soft tissue infections that can arise from mammalian bites, \" the researchers write. A course of antibiotics tends to do the job, preventing a bacterial infection or at least stopping its spread. But in this case, the bacteria pasteurella multocida, which lives in many pets ' mouths, caused a 4-inch-wide aneurysm in the abdominal section of the man's aorta ( the large vessel descending from the heart to the abdomen ) that ultimately ruptured. A portion of the aorta was fixed using a tube graft, but 13 days later he developed septic shock and died. When the man's wife mentioned — upon the 68-year-old's admission to the hospital — the four-week-old cat bite whose local infection had since healed, doctors dismissed it as the cause of his symptoms, which included elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, abdominal pain, and sudden weight loss. \" sometimes as physicians we roll our eyes at information that seems to be extraneous, \" study co-author dr. Dennis cho tells the toronto sun. \" only looking back did we realize this was probably the key to unlocking the true diagnosis. \" the doctors note the man's heavy drinking likely caused him to be immunosuppressed and upped his risk of long-term complications from the bacterial infection. And cbs news reports on the highly unusual case of a woman who suffered sepsis after her dog simply licked her. ( this cat lick was blamed for a woman's blindness. )",

Crime stoppers of central iowa said sunday that relatives of 20-year-old mollie tibbetts believe she's alive but has potentially been kidnapped. The reward jumped nearly $ 100,000 since thursday, when it was first increased to $ 172,000. Rob tibbetts, mollie's father, told fox news at the time he hopes the increased reward will provide \" financial incentive \" for someone with information to step forward. He says he believes she is alive: \" i ' m thinking someone made a horrible mistake and they don't know what to do. \" tibbetts went missing on july 18 from her small hometown of brooklyn, iowa. Investigators are being tight-lipped about the case, saying holding back basic details may help solve it. That includes saying whether they believe tibbetts returned home from a jog the evening she went missing. Willey says crime stoppers will protect the anonymity of tipsters who call in or submit tips online. He says the organization has shared more than 200 anonymous tips with law enforcement since monday. In their search for the missing student, authorities have questioned a pig farmer with a history of stalking, as well a man accused of assaulting another jogger, and a man seen taking pictures of joggers. So far, these efforts have not yielded any leads.",

The pilot ( the airline involved is not named ) was at 34,000 feet when, he says, a metallic object shaped like a cigar or a rugby ball suddenly came within a few feet of the left side of his jet and just missed colliding with it; he was so certain it was going to strike that he ducked in response to seeing it after determining there was \" no time to react \" to avoid collision. He alerted air traffic controllers, who came up empty-handed, the telegraph reports. The uk aviation board that looks into near-misses over the uk opened an investigation ( this isn't its first ufo-related inquiry ), but so far authorities have no explanation, having ruled out other aircraft and meteorological and toy balloons.

        "summary": "Funny what turns up in the closet of reclusive, deceased heiress: in this case, one of the world's most expensive musical instruments. Christie's has begun accepting sealed bids for a 1731 stradivarius violin that had been in a closet of huguette clark for about 25 years, reports nbc news. The auction house estimates its worth to be $ 7.5 million to $ 10 million, which would be below the stradivarius record of $ 16 million but still not too shabby for a longtime dust-collector, notes reuters. This particular stradivarius is so pricey in part because it was first owned by renowned concert violinist rodolphe kreutzer, both stories explain. Clark's parents bought it in 1920, with her mom sending the teenaged huguette a telegram from paris to say she had just bought her \" the most fabulous violin in the world, \" says a christie's musical expert. Analysis of the wood's ring growths confirms that the violin is legit. ( click to read about how stradivari may not match up to modern violins. )",

        "summary": "Pete seeger was a national medal of arts recipient, inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, and sang at president obama's first inauguration. But before any of that, the folk singer and activist, who died last year at 94, was the subject of a government investigation that spanned some three decades. In a sprawling piece in mother jones, david corn takes us through the nearly 1,800-page file the fbi compiled on seeger between the 1940s and 1970s. It started with a 1942 letter in which seeger, then a 23-year-old army private, expressed his disgust to the california american legion, which had endorsed deporting japanese-americans and barring people of japanese descent from citizenship. \" america is great and strong as she is because we have so far been a haven to all oppressed, \" he wrote. \" i felt sick at heart to read of this matter. \" the american legion forwarded the letter to the fbi. Then, military intelligence got involved. Having completed his training as an aviation mechanic, seeger was expecting to be sent to active duty. But, due to the investigation, the orders never came. Eventually, seeger was sent to the pacific theater as part of the army division tasked with entertaining the troops. Seeger continued his career as a singer and banjo player, later being blacklisted ( he was a member of the communist party in the ' 40s ) and convicted of contempt ( the conviction was overturned ) after appearing before the house committee on un-american activities. Highlights from the fbi file: early on, investigators read seeger's mail and were concerned that his engagement to a japanese-american woman might lead to \" divided loyalty. \" fellow folk singer woody guthrie told an agent: \" what [ seeger ] wants personally, is to do hitler the most damage possible. \" seeger's apartment, per the ap, often was visited by \" disreputable \" and \" noisy \" men who wore jeans and carried guitars. And he stiffed his landlady on a half-month's rent. Agents kept tabs on seeger's comings and goings by pretending to want to book him for concerts. And despite being an enemy of fascism, seeger was still \" potentially subversive. \" read the whole story here. ( more recently, the fbi derailed white supremacists ' plans to spark a race war. )",
