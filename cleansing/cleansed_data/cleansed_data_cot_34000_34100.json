        "summary": "A new study suggests that a woman's diet plays a role in when menopause begins. Uk researchers emphasize that their research doesn't show cause and effect — meaning they're not advocating that anyone change their diet — but the bottom-line findings are drawing attention. The average age of menopause in the study was 51, but women who ate a diet high in refined white pasta or rice tended to see it start about a year and a half earlier, reports new scientist. On the other hand, those who ate a lot of oily fish ( salmon, sardines, and mackerel ) generally saw it begin three years later than usual, reports live science. A diet rich in legumes ( think peas and beans ) also was associated with a later onset, though to a lesser degree than oily fish. \" this study doesn't prove a link with the foods mentioned, but certainly contributes to the limited knowledge we currently have on why some women go through menopause earlier than others, \" a nurse who serves as chairwoman of the british menopause society tells the bbc. In their study in the journal of epidemiology and community health, the researchers theorize that legumes and oily fish keep menstruation going because they contain or stimulate antioxidants, while the refined carbs have the opposite effect by raising the risk of insulin resistance and interfering with sex hormones. While early menopause is linked to a higher risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, it's also linked to protection against breast and ovarian cancer, notes live science.",

Xi made a surprise stop in anchorage late friday on his way back to beijing from the us. The leader and his entourage went from the airport to the scenic lookout at beluga point before heading to anchorage for a seafood dinner and a meeting with gov. Bill walker, reports the alaska dispatch news, which notes that while it is not unusual for planes carrying asian heads of state to refuel in anchorage, it is rare for a leader to leave the airport and spent several hours in the city. Walker's office says the meeting was set up last month, but chinese officials wanted it kept quiet until xi arrived. China is alaska's top export market and the visit was seen as an indication of the scale of china's resource ambitions in the region, reports the los angeles times. Fish accounted for more than half of the state's $ 1.2 billion in exports to china last year, the ap notes, and walker reportedly told xi that alaska could supply his country with \" a generation's worth \" of liquefied natural gas. A walker spokeswoman says xi wanted to visit alaska after flying over it many times. \" he called it a mythical, almost mystical place for the chinese, like a shangri-la, \" the spokeswoman says.",

Lyle jeffs was one of 11 members of the polygamous group charged in the case in february 2016. Prosecutors said food-stamp benefits were funneled to pay for things like a tractor and a truck. Lyle jeffs was the highest-ranking member of the group to face charges and was accused of orchestrating the scheme. A trial had been set for oct. 23.

            "( cnn ) -- a minnesota man who put up a website asking people to help him and his wife decide whether to have an abortion admitted tuesday they never intended to terminate the pregnancy. Pete arnold, who describes himself as a conservative/libertarian and has stirred controversy for his conservative posts on several websites, said he wanted to stimulate conversation about the politically charged subject. Arnold told cnn he bought the domain name \" birthornot.com \" before wife alisha became pregnant about four months ago. He said he had been mulling the idea \" for some time, \" adding that his wife is pro-choice but agreed that abortion was not on the table for them. \" we chose our words very carefully, \" arnold told cnn, insisting the site was not a hoax even though there were never any plans to accept the vote results if abortion won. \" a lot of people elect representatives based on this issue alone, yet nothing happens, nothing comes of it, nothing changes. \" he said, adding that the couple called the baby \" baby wiggles \" to give people more to think about. \" my intent is not to deceive people, but at the same point, i do want people to talk about this. This seemed like a pretty good way to further the discussion, because people don't ever seem to",

If you uttered \" bridgmanite, \" that means you're clearly up on your geologic news because the mineral just got its name this month. In fact, that's because scientists finally saw it for the first time. As livescience explains, the stuff we now know as bridgmanite exists so far below the earth's surface — in the high-pressure zone of the lower mantle — that geologists had never set eyes on it. They knew it existed thanks in part to computer models, however, and they referred to it in dry scientific terms as silicate-perovskite, notes gizmodo. The breakthrough came when scientists at caltech and unlv examined a meteorite that landed in australia in 1879 and found the mineral. They were able to identify its crystal structure, meeting a key requirement set by the powers-that-be in the world of mineral study, and thus were given the green light to bestow a name, reports the american geophysical union. They chose bridgmanite to honor physicist percy bridgman, who won a nobel prize in 1946. \" we finally tracked down natural silicate-perovskite in a meteorite after a five-year investigation, and got to name the most abundant mineral on earth, \" says caltech's chi ma. \" how cool is that? \" ( another recent study of rocks has revealed that the earth is 60 million years older than we thought. )",

Specifically, the lawsuit accuses ivey of \" edge sorting. \" it's complicated, but the suit says ivey exploited a design flaw on the backs of the cards that helped him sort and arrange desirable cards, reports the star-ledger.

        "summary": "Apple lost phase one tuesday of a lawsuit against it by a patent enforcement group that business insider once called one of the \" most fearsome patent trolls \" around — a loss that could cost up to $ 862 million in damages, reuters reports. A us district court jury decided apple had violated a 1998 patent for technology that improves processor efficiency — a patent owned by the wisconsin alumni research foundation, the university of wisconsin-madison's licensing division — by incorporating that technology into the a7, a8, and a8x processors found in its iphone 5, 6, and 6 plus models. The jury also found the patent is valid, a claim apple unsuccessfully tried to take up with the us patent and trademark office before. Presiding judge william conley broke the trial down into three phases: liability, damages, and whether apple had willfully violated the patent, which could lead to more penalties. Indeed, warf had filed for triple damages because it said the patent infringement was \" willful, intentional, and in conscious disregard of warf's right, \" per the milwaukee journal sentinel. This isn't the first time apple has been sued for ipad/iphone patent infringement — boston university filed a complaint in 2013, the verge reports — or the first time warf has sued over this technology ( intel settled in 2009 ). Warf also sued apple a second time last month over the newest a9 and a9x chips found in recently released iphones and the ipad pro, per reuters. Still, a warwick business school professor tells cnet that \" parallel developments \" by different companies means competing intellectual-property claims are \" inevitable \" and any damages apple pays won't \" have a substantial or lasting impact on its earnings. \" ( apple and samsung have gone back and forth on patents, too. )",

The truvada pill has been shown to vastly reduce infection rates and the centers for disease control and prevention's advice for certain groups — including gay men who have sex without condoms, those who inject illicit drugs and share equipment, and heterosexuals with at-risk partners — marks a big and controversial shift in policy, the new york times finds. The drug combination, which costs around $ 13,000 a year, is usually covered by insurance. There are currently only around 10,000 people taking it in the us, but that could leap to 500,000 under the cdc's advice. The cdc says the pill should only be used in conjunction with condoms, but health officials acknowledge that — as the 50,000 new infections per year show — there are many people who simply will not follow that advice. \" making the perfect the enemy of the good is something we've got to get over, \" says anthony fauci, one of the nation's top aids doctors. \" i strongly support the cdc doing this. \" but some groups, including the aids healthcare foundation, oppose the move because they fear patients will fail to follow the drug regime as directed and more of them will abandon condoms, causing the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases, bloomberg reports. \" the cdc has abandoned a science-driven, public health approach to disease prevention — a move that will likely have catastrophic consequences in the fight against aids in this country, \" says the group's director.",

But the truth is — probably — a lot less menacing. According to the independent barents observer, a spike in the radioactive isotope iodine-131 was first measured on the norway-russia border in mid-january. But the spike wasn't made public until later, when it reached france, science alert reports. The levels of iodine-131 weren't high enough to be a danger to the public, but the isotope is usually connected to nuclear fission, so concern abounded. That concern only deepened when the us, with no explanation, sent its nuclear \" sniffing \" aircraft to europe. Despite the alarm, the radiation bloom probably wasn't caused by a nuclear explosion. First, there was no seismic activity to go along with the radiation spike. Second, no other radioactive isotopes spiked besides iodine-131, motherboard reports. And while a nuclear explosion — or accident — is still a possibility, norway's radiation protection agency believes the likely culprit is a pharmaceutical company working with iodine-131, which is used to treat cancers. It's still unclear where the radiation originated, with officials only narrowing it down as far as \" eastern europe, \" but medical companies that work with iodine-131 all have detectors for a leak.

The first detection of the isotope came during the second week of january, via an air sampling station located in svanhovd, on norway's border with russia's kola peninsula. Within days, air sampling stations as far south as spain also detected the presence of small amounts of the isotope. The fact that iodine-131 has a half-life of just eight days would point to the release occurring just days earlier, and not being a remnant of a past nuclear event.

A company called arx pax has developed a skateboard-style device that rides on air instead of wheels, and it's raising money to \" perfect \" the project on kickstarter, phys.org reports. Arx pax has already surpassed its $ 250,000 goal. How it works: four engines on the board create a magnetic field which \" literally pushes against itself, \" the company says on kickstarter. That pushes the board upward. Says co-inventor greg henderson of his hendo hoverboard: \" the wheel may finally have some competition. \" pretty cool, but it's not quite a marty mcfly experience yet, engadget notes: it only gets about an inch off the ground, and it only works over certain types of metal, including copper and aluminum. It's also very loud, according to the verge ( via gizmodo ). Still, it can hold a 300-pound person, arx pax says, though the new york times adds that the board itself weighs 100 pounds. The paper notes that the hendo hoverboard \" is basically a publicity stunt. \" what henderson is really interested in is the broader application of the technology; a building using it, for instance, might be able to \" ride out an earthquake, \" he says. Meanwhile, for those without hoverboards, there's always the cardboard bike.",

        "summary": "Michael brown \" was no angel, \" according to a new york times piece by john eligon — and the phrasing hasn't gone unnoticed. At vox, matthew yglesias recalls that he himself was hardly a model teen, but \" you don't need to be one to survive into adulthood. \" yglesias admits that he, like brown, shoplifted and \" dabbled in drugs and alcohol. \" one night he got caught smoking cigarettes and downing beers with friends in a new york city park, but they were ticketed, paid their fine, and moved on to productive careers. The officer \" didn't shoot us, \" he writes. \" i don't think i've ever heard a story where someone like me was killed and then proclaimed to the world to have been no angel. Angels, it turns out, are pretty rare. \" other reactions: at the washington post, alyssa rosenberg is \" particularly frustrated \" by parts of the times piece that equate brown's \" dabbling in hip-hop \" with weakness of character. Eligon mentions brown's rapping along with his drug and alcohol use, which \" slur[ s ] brown by treating his creative impulses as if they are evidence of some sort of criminal impulse. \" who else has the times called \" no angel \"? crooks, a nazi, and men of color — including al capone, james \" whitey \" bulger, erwin rommel, magic johnson, and michael jackson, vanity fair reports. In 1992, the mother of an unarmed black boy murdered by four white men spoke to the times, which reported that \" her boy was no angel, she admits, \" because police had caught him stealing several times. \" but he was young and i had hopes for him, \" she said. Times national editor alison mitchell defended the phrase, telling the post that it echoed the story's opening paragraph — in which brown \" made out an angel \" in the clouds and \" saw satan chasing the angel. \" said mitchell: \" we have a nuanced story about the young man and if it had been a white young man in the same exact situation, if that's where our reporting took us, we would have written it in the same way. \"",

A dirty tarp covers the in-ground pool at the 60-year-old grand bel ii complex in silver spring, which has no money to run it or fix the weed-infested tennis court, the washington post reports. \" i feel for the children, \" says one condo owner. \" every year, they ask me, ' is the pool going to be open? ' \" the problems aren't unique to the grand bel ii — and they are far worse than just a closed pool, with structural problems posing grave dangers to residents. The post reports on a crisis at aging condo complexes ringing washington, dc — even as new trendy buildings rise — as monthly fees have skyrocketed to cover the costs of repairs. Owners, many working class, have struggled to pay the fees or have stopped altogether, worsening the cycle. Their crumbling buildings \" are mired in a recession that never ended, \" writes bill turque. Although national foreclosure rates have leveled off, condo owners are still disproportionately feeling the effects of the subprime crisis. In alexandria, va., condos comprise 47 % of residences and 63 % of foreclosures. \" you have people who should not have been given loans because they couldn't afford to pay the loans and associated expenses, \" says one attorney. The complexes have also been hurt by tighter fha guidelines that make loans to potential buyers tougher to get, which makes for longer vacancies. Legislation signed by president obama eased some of those standards, but experts say more needs to be done. \" without significant changes, you're going to have cities and states condemning and taking over these properties, \" says one consultant.

His neighbors struggle to pay their monthly fees; since 2010, saxony's board of directors has filed more than 80 court actions to try to collect such assessments. Even as posh condos rise in trendy neighborhoods around the nation's capital, many older complexes are mired in a recession that never ended. A cycle of aging infrastructure, limited resources and foreclosure is putting these communities in a deep financial hole, threatening what traditionally has been an affordable path to homeownership for the working class. Monthly fees, the financial lifeblood of condo developments, have risen sharply as boards try to generate cash for long-deferred maintenance and to cover basic expenses. As a result, more owners can't make their payments, and fewer prospective owners can afford to buy in."

        "summary": "The death toll in the pakistani taliban's massacre of mountain climbers would have been a lot higher if the weather had been worse, the wall street journal finds. Two parties of climbers had already departed the base camp at the edge of the himalayas before the taliban attacked, killing 10 foreign tourists and a pakistani guide. The victims — including one american, two chinese, three ukrainians, one lithuanian, and one nepalese — were robbed, blindfolded, and forced to kneel before they were shot. Adventure tourism was one of the few bright spots in pakistan's struggling tourist industry, but expeditions have now been halted. \" this situation changes our thinking about the world, \" says a polish climber who heard gunfire from his camp on the side of nanga parbat, the world's ninth-highest mountain. \" no one kills climbers. Local bandits think,'these guys are crazy. ' maybe they rob them, but they leave them alone. \" the taliban says the attack was carried out by a new faction created to avenge drone strikes, the bbc reports.",

But they hope it raises awareness of a little-known danger: \" the doctor said this could be a bad tick year, and the video can help show the symptoms parents should look for. \" experts say pet owners should also be on alert, as tick paralysis can also be fatal for dogs, abc news reports.

A space butterfly? that's essentially what the hubble space telescope has captured in a new image of the twin jet nebula, a shimmering planetary nebula that strongly resembles a winged insect, reports cnet. What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the european space agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun. \" the larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf, \" the esa says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display. At the center of each wing, blue areas represent violent jets of gas gushing into space at approximately 621,000mph. Discovered in 1947 and officially known as pn m2-9, the twin jet nebula gets its more common name from its shape. \" if the nebula is sliced across the star, each side of it appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines, \" says the esa. Astronomers believe the nebula is only about 1,200 years old, based on how quickly the wings are expanding, which they will continue to do. Mashable reports hubble took a colorful shot of the nebula in 1997, but it isn't nearly as clear as this latest photo. ( hubble also captured a smiley face in space. )",

            "New york city — a large section of manhattan was in the dark monday night after hurricane sandy flooded conedison substations and left roughly 670,000 customers in new york city and westchester without power. More than 250,000 customers lost power in manhattan — in addition to another 400,000 in the outer boroughs and in westchester — after flooding and an explosion at an east side substation caused major outages from east 39th street down to the tip of lower manhattan, the utility said. The explosion alone knocked out power to roughly 230,000 residents, con edison officials said. Officials said it is not yet clear how long it will take to repair that facility, located at east 14th street and the fdr drive, but they hope to have it up and running by the end of the week or sooner. \" we are in a bit of unchartered territory here, \" said john miksad, a senior vice president at con edison, who added that officials will have to wait until the water recedes to assess the damage. \" what we didn't anticipate was flooding to continue to rise even after the forecasted 10-12 foot tides. \" another substation was also flooded in staten island, blowing power there, coned officials said, and the battery experienced 14-foot tides that inundated facilities, causing damage. At nyu langone hospital on first avenue, officials reported",

The batagaika crater, the biggest megaslump on earth, may be be a \" harbinger \" of our warming planet, as motherboard puts it. The crater, located in one of the planet's coldest places, appeared about 25 years ago, and geologist julian murton of the university of sussex tells the independent that it was likely born after locals cut down a swath of forest that sat above the permafrost. \" cutting down of vegetation... Removes some of the insulation that keeps the ground cool, \" he explains, and that allows the summer's heat to reach deeper levels of earth. As exposed ice layers melt, the earth becomes loose and literally slumps. The chasm has grown to be a mile long and some 400 feet deep, and it continues to grow at a rate of more than 60 feet per year. More worrisome, the melting permafrost releases large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane, which had previously been locked in the soil. This triggers a \" climate feedback loop, \" explains mnn: a warming planet's impact on the permafrost puts methane in the air, which promotes further warming, and the cycle is \" difficult to stop, \" per the site. And were the entire permafrost to melt, the independent reports \" it would likely tip the planet into an extreme scenario the full horror of which is hard to describe. \" as such, mnn reports that researchers view megaslumps as a threat to the planet's health, \" an omen, a symptom, of a larger underlying disease. \" ( read how the \" gates of hell \" emerged in a soviet desert. )",

        "summary": "Seattle has been gradually increasing its minimum wage, with the city planning to make it $ 15 by 2021. ( it's currently $ 13 for most businesses. ) while advocates may be thrilled, a new study out of the university of washington suggests that the rising minimum might actually be harming low-income workers in general. Researchers say that while the new law is indeed resulting in higher wages, employers have reduced hiring and hours, reports the seattle times. However, skeptics say the study is flawed and point to a second study out of berkeley with a different conclusion. Details: a key figure: the study, which has not been peer-reviewed, finds that the hike in the minimum wage so far has cost the average low-wage worker $ 125 a month. The reason? while pay has gone up 3 %, workers saw their hours fall by 9 % from 2014 to 2016, say the researchers. They also estimate that without the law, another 5,000 low-wage jobs would exist in the city currently. ( the study compared seattle to surrounding control areas that saw no wage increase, notes the la times. )'very credible ': the washington post calls the results \" bad news for liberals \" in its headline and quotes an mit economics professor who sees the study as \" very credible \" and predicts it will be influential. It is \" sufficiently compelling in its design and statistical power that it can change minds. \" different study: the berkeley study, out last week, found that the wage increase did not result in lost jobs. This study, however, focused only on the restaurant industry, which critics see as a potential weakness. A flaw? the new york times reports that critics think the uw researchers may be off base in part because seattle's strong economy has caused employers to bid up wages. \" under such a scenario, one would expect to see a decline in the overall number of hours worked in low-wage jobs. In their place would be a significant increase in hours worked at somewhat higher-paying jobs. \" another? from the post: \" to avoid confusing establishments that were subject to the minimum with those that were not, the authors did not include large employers with locations both inside and outside of seattle in their calculations. Skeptics argued that omission could explain the unusual results. \" unprecedented data: yes, there are caveats, but the authors had access to \" detailed data on the hours and earnings of nearly all employees in washington state, \" notes a post at fivethirtyeight. It thinks the research will have broad political implications as other cities weigh similar increases. Told you",

Now, a former fbi agent hopes to change that by opening a cold case review on the subject, the guardian reports. Vince pankoke and his team of 19 forensic experts are using new investigative techniques in an effort that will be filmed and chronicled online at the cold case diary website, with results expected to be announced on aug. 4, 2019, 75 years after frank and her family were discovered. The investigators are using new methods to analyze large amounts of data developed over the last decade. The franks are widely believed to have been betrayed to the gestapo, though the anne frank house museum published a study last year suggesting the family's discovery may have been by chance. Pankoke says he's uncovered documents relating to the franks ' arrest that were originally thought to have been destroyed; in reality they were shipped back to the us after world war ii and recently declassified. The investigators will also be analyzing the anne frank house's archives, witness statements and interviews, and more. \" we have found lists of names of jews arrested having [ been ] betrayed, lists of informants, and names of gestapo agents who lived in amsterdam, \" pankoke says. \" there is so much information available, \" he tells a dutch newspaper, per the new york post.

The other possibility is an interview with documentary maker ami horowitz that aired on fox news; horowitz's latest film examines sweden's crime rate and whether it's related to the nation's open-door policy toward refugees. Regardless, the internet was off to the races, reports mashable, with #swedenincident trending and no shortage of jokes about abba, ikea, and the occasional randy and/or drunken moose: \" four extremists responsible for #swedenincident are still at large, if you see these people phone @realdonaldtrump at once, \" tweeted one user beneath a photo of abba.",

A new study finds that dogs are able to pick up on friend or foe depending on whether a tail is wagging to the left or right, reports the bbc. Research from a few years back suggested that a dog wagged to its right when it was happy and friendly and to the left when it sensed danger. The new research, which involved measuring heart rates and such, shows that dogs themselves are able to pick up on the differences. \" it is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions, \" says the lead italian researcher. \" here we attempted to look at it in other species. \" one part that's a wee bit disappointing: he doesn't think the dogs are intentionally communicating with each other, reports national geographic. But they have apparently learned how to process the visual cue over eons. \" it's just fascinating, \" a duke researcher not involved with the study tells ap.",

But as he tells the chicago tribune while on the road in chile, something compelled him to forge onward, past all the pretty, easy destinations. As a result, he is now by some measures the world's most prolific traveler. The website most traveled people breaks the world down into 875 places, and parrish has visited 851 of them, giving him the site's no. 1 ranking. He ranks seventh at best traveled ( 975 of 1,281 places ), and he's visited 459 of 1,052 unesco world heritage sites. ( several are added every year, making this a tough goal for the 72-year-old ). Parris has just about seen it all, but his most valuable lesson? having been detained by jamaican authorities, nearly dying on a road in nepal, and suffering a bad fall rock climbing in wisconsin, to name a few close calls, he says that in the end, \" you realize that the world isn't such a scary place after all. \" parrish is a lifelong bachelor, but even some families are serious travelers as well.

        "summary": "One of the most expensive projects in the pentagon's history has been awarded to northrop grumman. The company won the bid to build the long range strike-bomber ( lrs-b ) at a cost that could top $ 80 billion, reports the los angeles times. Northrop will get more than $ 20 billion to develop the bomber — which will replace aging b-1s and b-52s — plus $ 564 million per plane with 80 to 100 currently planned, reports popular mechanics. However, the cost of the project could spike if northrop's record is any indication: the pentagon initially planned for 132 northrop-built b-2s in the 1980s, but ended up with 21 when costs skyrocketed to $ 2 billion per unit. Secretary of defense ashton carter says the lrs-b will be the \" backbone \" of the air force with \" initial operational capability \" in 2025. It should be ready to fly by 2040. Because there's no way to know what might be necessary in a bomber in 2040, the lrs-b will be \" adaptable, \" says the air force's chief of staff. Military officials say it will be able to fly nuclear weapons and perhaps operate as a drone. Northrop earlier said the project could create 1,400 new jobs in palmdale, calif. — where northrop also built the b-2 — and the city's mayor says \" we're very excited. \" northrop's chairman seemed to expect the pentagon's decision, telling the times, \" we're ready to get to work. \" but some industry experts were a bit shocked that the company beat out a boeing-lockheed martin team, which had impressive political connections and funding. That team says it's talking with the air force \" before determining our next steps, \" but analysts expect it to challenge the decision.",

The pentagon says it needs the new warplane to replace its aging fleet of b-1 bombers, which were designed in the 1970s, and even older b-52s. \" today, it's vital to innovate and reinvest in the people, strategies and technologies that will allow america's military to be dominant in the second aerospace century, \" defense secretary ashton carter said tuesday as the contract was announced. The contract has two parts. In the first phase, northrop will receive more than $ 20 billion to develop the bomber.

Critics say the cost of the contract is bound to skyrocket, similar to what happened when northrop built the b-2 bomber in the 1980s.

What was the first thing that went through your mind when you heard the news that the charges were abandoned? a. Initially i was extremely alleviated. Quickly that turned into realization that the department of justice finding that there was no basis to pursue charges was just the beginning of a journey my personal journey to correct the wrongs that the federal government did. To ensure that it never happens to any innocent american ever again. Q. You mentioned injustice by the federal government.

Dc police chief cathy lanier says a guard at bureau headquarters in suitland, md., was shot several times when he approached a car that matched the description of one used in a dc kidnapping at around 5: 30pm yesterday, the ap reports. Lanier says the suspect drove back across the border, firing at dc police chasing him until a police car rammed his vehicle and he was captured after an exchange of fire with police. The guard, lawrence buckner, died after he was taken to prince george's hospital center, reports the washington post. The suspect and a police sergeant were shot and injured after the chase came to an end in northeast washington, near union station, usa today reports. An fbi spokeswoman tells the ap that there is no sign the census bureau shooting was terrorism-related. Lanier says the suspect was seen forcing a woman, whom he apparently knew, into the car, and the pair were later seen arguing inside the vehicle near the gate of the bureau's campus, the post reports. The woman managed to escape the car somewhere between the bureau and the end of the chase and is \" in good condition, \" lanier says.",

The washington city of 100,000 north of seattle filed a complaint thursday against purdue pharma, the manufacturer of oxycontin, claiming the maker was grossly negligent in knowing about and allowing a black market for its oxycodone to flourish, \" placing profits over the welfare of the citizens of everett, \" per the suit. The everett city council oked the decision to sue the day before, the daily herald reports. The suit, which asks purdue to pony up punitive damages and money to fix the problem, is said to be the first regarding the company's alleged knowledge of illegal distribution. Per the herald, the suit against purdue accuses it of turning a blind eye when significant quantities of the drug started making its way into illegal \" pill mills \" for eventual distribution to everett. Then, when purdue repurposed the drug in 2010 to minimize the risk of abuse, people who were already addicted turned to heroin instead — a shift \" directly attributable to purdue's wrongful and tortious conduct, \" per the suit — which has turned into its own epidemic in everett, along with the excessive litter, homelessness, crime, and ods that have accompanied the increase in addicts. The lat reports the suit was spurred by its july investigative piece into purdue, which recounted how a sales manager with the company sent to look into why an la clinic was getting so many pills told purdue to call the dea; the company held off on doing so for years.

Agency's european office said monday more than 41,000 measles cases were reported in the region during the first half of the year. That's more than in any 12-month period so far this decade. The previous highest annual total was 23,927 cases in 2017. A year earlier, only 5,273 cases were reported. \" we are seeing a dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks, \" dr. Zsuzsanna jakab, who regional director for europe, said in a statement. \" we call on all countries to immediately implement broad, context-appropriate measures to stop further spread of this disease. Good health for all starts with immunization. \" measles was virtually eliminated in the u.s. After the vaccine became widely available in the 1960s, but outbreaks have flared in recent years — often sparked by a case picked up overseas. The illness is highly contagious and can spread rapidly among people who didn't get the mmr vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Babies too young for the vaccine are especially at risk. Symptoms of measles may include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. In rare cases, complications can be",

Here's what fact-checkers at the ap, the new york times, and the washington post made of his claims, which painted a bleak portrait of the usa in 2016: \" the number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen almost 50 % compared to this point last year. \" false: according to the national law enforcement officers memorial fund, line-of-duty deaths are up 8 % this year, from 62 at this point last year to 67 so far this year. \" homicides last year increased by 17 % in america's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. \" true, though analysts say trump cherry-picked those figures, omitting that the statistical jump was so large because homicides are still very low by historical standards — and are down again so far in 2016. \" two million more latinos are in poverty today than when president obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. \" true, but misleading: the hispanic population has risen since obama took office, while the poverty rate has fallen.

Taxes made up 26 % of the total us economy in 2014, according to the oecd, far below sweden's tax burden of 42.7 % or germany's 36.1 %. \" household incomes are down more than $ 4,000 since the year 2000. \" this would have been true in 2014, when the median household income was $ 53,657, compared to $ 57,724 in 2000.
