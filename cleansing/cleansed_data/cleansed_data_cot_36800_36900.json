Though that sounds like a very believable premise to us, tmz's sources insist producers were actually shocked and even unhappy by tuesday's fracas. And apparently they're doing all they can to smooth things over, which led to a much calmer day on-set yesterday. But if carey divas up again, minaj is walking away, sources say. Meanwhile, just about everyone else in the world has weighed in on the drama: fellow judge keith urban tells extra he felt like \" the un \" when he found himself in the middle of minaj and carey, and wife nicole kidman called him \" switzerland. \" nick cannon, aka mr. Mariah carey, tells e! that his wife is \" the strongest, classiest woman that i've ever met in any situation \" and that she's \" not moved by the theatrics or pageantry. She's just there to do her job and help young people. \" on his radio show, idol host ryan seacrest said the exchange did indeed get \" heated \" and \" intense, \" the new york daily news reports. Even so, \" there's nothing wrong with disagreeing, \" he said. And what does minaj's hairdresser have to say about all this? according to the new york post, terrence davidson wrote on facebook that people should \" stop hitting me about what happened... If you wasn't there save your speech. \"",

In fact, the nazis killed all but 5 % of the country's 200,000 jews during their three-year occupation, reports slate, which brands that \" a more complete destruction than befell any other european country. \" now, some 70 years later, archaeologists say a ground-penetrating radar survey conducted in june has likely revealed remnants of the synagogue buried beneath a school. They plan to begin excavating the site in 2016 with the hopes of learning more about how jews lived in the capital city prior to wwii. Built in the city's dominant renaissance-baroque style, the great synagogue became the epicenter of lithuania's jewish population, and was eventually surrounded by several community buildings — including twelve shuls, a community council, kosher meat stalls, the strashun library, and mikvahs ( jewish baths ), reports yeshiva world news. \" we are very excited about this discovery, as this synagogue stands as a grand memorial to the jewish community of vilna, \" the researchers said.

It would spark and smell. \" the sources say atf investigators have ruled out arson, and they no longer believe an old fridge can be pinpointed as the cause of california's worst building fire in more than a century.

The group included officials from the atf and the oakland fire and police departments. The new york times ' graphics team has worked with former ghost ship residents to produce maps demonstrating why the fire in the cluttered warehouse was so deadly.

The four nebraskans suing all have non-hodgkin's lymphoma, one of the types of cancer glyphosate is most associated with, the lincoln journal-star reports. \" monsanto championed falsified data and has attacked legitimate studies that revealed roundup's dangers. Monsanto led a campaign of misinformation to convince government agencies, farmers, and the general population that roundup is safe, \" the lawsuit contends, alleging that monsanto \" concealed or systematically sought to discredit \" research showing roundup's dangers. Per the lawsuit, monsanto markets roundup as \" safe enough to drink, \" courthouse news reports. The lawsuit alleges that glyphosate has been found in groundwater and waterways around agricultural areas where roundup is used, as well as in food and in the urine of people who have been exposed to it — and even sometimes those without direct exposure. The plaintiffs are suing for unspecified damages. The response from a monsanto rep: \" while we have sympathy for the plaintiffs, the science simply does not support their claims. \" since last year, some countries have restricted or outright barred the sale of roundup, and california labeled glyphosate a carcinogen — a move being fought by monsanto. Similar lawsuits to this one have been filed by agricultural workers in california, delaware, and other states. ( another lawsuit revolves around traces of roundup found in quaker oats. )",

        "summary": "The biggest political scandal going in pakistan is now centered on, of all things, a font. Pakistan's supreme court is investigating maryam nawaz sharif, the prime minister's daughter, for corruption stemming from documents found in the 2016 panama papers, the guardian reports. According to the bbc, the documents indicate sharif was the owner of a number of off-shore companies that purchased multiple expensive london apartments. Sharif claims she was merely a trustee of the companies, which were actually owned by her brother. To prove that claim, she produced a trust deed signed by herself and her brother and dated february 2006. Here's the problem: the deed appears to be typed in the microsoft calibri font, which wasn't rolled out until 2007. The designer of calibri says it would have taken \" serious effort \" to get a hold of calibri before it was included in microsoft office 2007 and microsoft visa and it's \" unlikely \" anyone would have used it for an official document in 2006, al jazeera reports. What's being dubbed \" fontgate \" has set off a storm of jokes on pakistani social media. \" govt. Should declare #calibri pakistan's national font, \" states one twitter user. \" today #calibri was searched more than porn in pakistan, \" quips another. Already facing corruption allegations, sharif, who is seen as a contender to follow in her father's footsteps as prime minister, could face fraud charges if it's determined she forged the trust deed.",

Here's a look: the post story by ashley parker describes how karen, 60, is her husband's constant companion and his \" gut check and shield. \" among its tidbits: \" during their time in the indiana governor's mansion, the pences installed twin treadmills upstairs in their residence. \" read it in full here. The 2002 article from the hill doesn't appear to be online, but this tweet has the opening paragraphs, including a pence quote: \" if there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, i want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me. \" he said it's about \" building a zone around your marriage \" and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. The idea of a man not dining alone with another woman is often known as the \" billy graham rule \" among evangelicals, explains the indianapolis star. One common line of criticism: \" as someone who grew up evangelical, wouldn't say it's standard exactly. But indicative of notion that women are primarily sexual temptresses, \" tweeted writer elizabeth spiers. Another: \" if pence won't eat dinner alone with any woman but his wife, that means he won't hire women in key spots, \" wrote clara jeffery of mother jones. Stephen colbert couldn't resist.

But rod dreher at the american conservative sees hypocrisy in the negative reaction. \" were the pences orthodox jews or practicing muslims, nobody would have batted an eye. But they're evangelical christians, so that means it's open season on tearing them apart. \" at the atlantic, emma green writes that the arrangement might seem crazy and even misogynistic to non-religious people, but not so to evangelicals, and \" the dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide american culture. \" matt lewis at the daily beast says this is the pences ' business and nobody else's.

Nine cases of the flea-borne disease were reported between july and september, the los angeles times reports, adding that there are typically about 200 cases reported nationwide each year. Typhus is caused by a bacteria in infected fleas, according to the cdc. Rats are a common carrier of the fleas that cause typhus, but cats and opossums can also carry fleas infected with the bacteria. Symptoms include fever, rash, and body aches, among others. Most people recover on their own. But severe cases can cause organ damage. In downtown los angeles, officials are now reportedly working to clear rubbish and catch animals to stem the spread of typhus. ( in hong kong, a human was infected with so-called rat hepatitis for the first time in history. )",

In most areas of the world, rats are the main animal host for fleas infected with murine typhus. Murine typhus occurs in tropical and subtropical climates around the world where rats and their fleas live. Cat fleas found on domestic cats and opossums have been associated with cases of murine typhus in the united states.

Signs and symptoms may include: fever and chills body aches and muscle pain loss of appetite nausea vomiting stomach pain cough rash ( typically occurs around day 5 of illness ) most people will recover without treatment, but some cases may be severe. When left untreated, severe illness can cause damage to one or more organs including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. Diagnosis and testing the symptoms of murine typhus are similar to symptoms of many other diseases. See your health care provider if you develop the symptoms listed above after coming in contact with fleas. Tell your health care provider if you have had contact with animals including rats, cats, or opossums. Your health care provider may order a blood test to look for murine typhus or other diseases. Laboratory testing and reporting of results can take several weeks, so your health care provider may start treatment before results are available.

The republican said the state is broke and the cuts are necessary to deal with a projected $ 3.6 billion deficit over the next two fiscal years without raising taxes, the wall street journal reports. Protesters could be heard outside during his budget speech, which outlined a total of $ 4.2 billion in cuts. Union leaders have agreed to the cuts but only if walker ditches his proposal to eliminate collective bargaining rights for most public employees, reports the milwaukee journal-sentinel. Walker warned that if democratic senators who fled the state to avoid a vote on the proposal don't return, the cuts will have to be even deeper. \" if the 14 senate democrats do not come home, their local communities will be forced to manage these reductions in aid without the benefit of the tools provided in the repair bill, \" he said.",

        "summary": "The name sandy hook elementary school is one that will conjure up images of horror for most americans — but officials want it to be a place of hope and happiness. The new school in newtown, connecticut, is ready for students, almost four years after 20 students and six educators were massacred at its now-demolished predecessor, which stood at the same site, reports the new york times. \" despite its birth from a horrible tragedy, sandy hook school will be a place full of laughter, of love and learning, \" newtown first selectman patricia llodra told reporters given a tour of the new school. Nearly 400 students have enrolled at the school, which will teach students from preschool through fourth grade when it opens at the end of next month, the wall street journal reports. Around 60 % of staff at the new school worked at the old sandy hook. The only students at the new school who were in the old building during the massacre will be in fourth grade, and officials say none of them witnessed the shootings. The new school was designed to have a calming atmosphere, though security was also a major concern, the times notes. There is no official memorial — a public one will be built in the town instead — but a grassy mound at the spot where the students and teachers were killed is considered sacred ground, reports people. Officials say the new school will be an \" unbelievable learning space, \" though they of course wish that they had never had to build it. \" let me state unequivocally that we would trade in a minute this beautiful new school for the more familiar and ancient sandy hook school, built in the ' 50s, if we could just change the past, \" llodra said, per the ap.",

        "summary": "A man suspected of gunning down four people at a pennsylvania car wash was driven by jealousy, according to family members of the shooting victims. State police say timothy smith, 28, was armed with a semi-automatic rifle, a.308-caliber rifle, and a handgun and was wearing body armor without the ballistic panels inserted when he opened fire early sunday morning at ed's car wash in saltlick township, a rural town about 55 miles southeast of pittsburgh, the ap reports. Twenty-seven-year-old william porterfield, 25-year-old chelsie cline, 23-year-old courtney snyder, and 21-year-old seth cline were all killed. Smith was on life support sunday and not expected to survive after suffering a gunshot wound to his head. State police say it might have been self-inflicted. A woman who took cover in snyder's pickup when smith opened fire survived with minor injuries from broken glass. Chelsie cline's half-sister, sierra kolarik, tells the pittsburgh tribune-review that smith had developed an obsession with cline. Porterfield's pregnant wife, jenna porterfield, 24, tells the pittsburgh post-gazette that a state police investigator told her that smith was a jealous former boyfriend of cline. Porterfield says she was told by family members of other victims that her husband and cline had spent the past two days together after cline ended a relationship with smith. Porterfield says she and her husband — who were married in november — had been \" having some troubles \" this month, but she doesn't hold it against him. \" i'd give anything to have him back, \" she says.",

Captain dustin brown, who had a goal and two assists, became only the second american-born captain to lift the cup — in front of a wildly delirious staples center crowd which included dozens of fans who have been rink-side since the team's creation in 1967, reports ap. The devils had scored back-to-back wins after going 3-0 down, raising fears that the kings would be the first team since 1942 to blow a 3-0 series lead in the stanley cup final, but the first period changed everything, the los angeles times reports. Devils forward steve bernier was slapped with a five-minute penalty for boarding, and the kings were 3-0 up by the end of the power play. Jeff carter and trevor lewis scored two goals apiece for the kings. Matt greene added another, and playoff mvp jonathan quick stopped 17 shots, helping make the kings the first eighth-seeded team ever to lift the cup.",

The project? a potato salad, of course. \" i ' m making potato salad, \" wrote brown on kickstarter. \" basically i ' m just making potato salad. I haven't decided what kind yet. \" with donations flowing in, he quickly added stretch goals, like hosting a pizza party at $ 75, live-streaming the salad-making at $ 1,000, and renting a venue for the project's backers to party at $ 3,000, the verge reports. He offers rewards, too, like a salad bite for $ 3 donors — which is seemingly simple but geographically complex, as he realized in a reddit q&a. \" yea, it's going to be a challenge, \" he wrote. \" i thought i'd just go to people's houses and hand it off. \" brown's project is benefiting from looser rules at kickstarter, which used to restrict certain things ( \" fund my life \" campaigns, charities, sunglasses ) in favor of creative projects that can be shared. But starting this summer, the crowd-funding platform will approve pretty much anything that isn't dangerous, regulated, or against the law, the verge notes. Which brings up the question: why are brown and his donors doing this? \" we're all craving interaction and feeling like we're a part of something bigger, \" writes brown. \" potato salad isn't controversial, it isn't mean or snarky. Potato salad is lawful good — something incorruptible that we can all rally around. \" \" for me potato salad is more than a dish, it's a connection, \" writes a donor, cnet reports. \" feelings of love, joy, family, and friends. \" \" this is important to me on a deep and spiritual level, \" writes another. Brown, meanwhile, warns that the salad itself \" might not be that good. It's my first potato salad. \" ( click to read about a guy who raked in the bucks with a kickstarter project to buy...

Perry told reporters friday that he's \"going to think about \" seeking the white house once the legislature adjourns next week — a departure from earlier assurances that he won't run. \"he's seen what everybody else has seen, \" said matthew dowd, campaign strategist for george w. Bush. \"there's a field that's not coalesced around anyone, that's very unpredictable at the moment and that doesn't have a candidate who seems to speak to a majority of the party. \" in conversations with friends in recent days, the republican governor has complained that the gop field is weak and hasn't excited enthusiasm in the republican base. Next week",

Rick perry keeps on his blackberry is a portrait of aurora p. ( \"rory \" ) perry, the family's black labrador retriever, who last year acquired a key role in local perry legend. The governor and the dog were out for an early morning jog when a coyote suddenly appeared, growling at rory. Perry, who carries a ruger.380 handgun in his belt when he jogs, pulled the weapon and shot the coyote dead. When some austin locals protested that perry's reaction was excessive, and dangerous, he shrugged it off. \"don't attack my dog, \" he said, \"or you might get shot. \"",
            "Shortly after reports surfaced suggesting that gov. Rick perry of texas is considering a potential presidential bid in 2012, his spokesman said he's not. \" nothing has changed, \" mark miner told national journal in an e-mail. \" the governor has no intention of running for president. \" ( pictures: meet the 2012 gop presidential hopefuls ) miner's statement came after the governor sparked a flurry of renewed media speculation over his intentions by telling austin reporters who asked him about a presidential race: \" i ' m going to think about it. \" said miner in his e-mail: \" the governor thinks about a lot of issues. \" want the news first every morning? sign up for national journal's need-to-know memo.

Per cnn, investigator kok soo chon announced the long-awaited findings at a news conference near kuala lumpur on monday. He said the investigation revealed mh370 was manually steered to turn around and head back to malaysia rather than its destination in beijing. As the ap notes, it remains unclear if the pilot was at the helm because the \" possibility of intervention by a third party cannot be excluded. \" the plane is believed to have flown for some seven hours with its radio communications severed before it went down. Though the report fails to answer many questions, investigators did manage to eliminate some factors, including the mental state of captain zaharie ahmad shah and mechanical malfunction. However, kok said the root cause of the disaster cannot be known until the plane's black boxes are uncovered. There were 239 people aboard the boeing 777 when authorities presume it crashed in the southern indian ocean march 8, 2014. The report was released following a second search that failed to find the plane.",

Just a few seconds into her olympic routine with partner alexander gamelin, \" my hook came undone, \" min says, per the detroit free press. And \" if that comes undone, the whole thing could just pop off. I was terrified the entire program. \" she chose not to stop and risk a deduction. Instead, she improvised the rest of the routine ( see a short clip here ) by avoiding moves that would've risked her costume slipping off, leaving her exposed in front of millions. \" that wouldn't be the most ideal olympic experience, obviously, \" she says, per the ap. Gamelin, for his part, didn't even notice the issue until they'd completed about half the routine. \" during our twizzle, it came off her shoulder, all of the way, \" he says.

Min and gamelin have a compelling story, per the free press: both us citizens, they're skating for the south korean team — min's parents moved to california from south korea before she was born, and gamelin, born in boston, became a naturalized south korean citizen so they could meet the rules required to represent south korea together. The duo came in ninth out of 10 pairs sunday, but they're already looking ahead to the individual pairs competition later this month.",

Brandon, 31, was found dead in his home in basingstoke, england, last august, and a coroner's inquest has concluded that he was asphyxiated by the african rock python, one of 10 snakes and a dozen tarantulas he kept in his bedroom, the bbc reports. His mother, babs brandon, testified that after she heard a crash from his room, she found her son unconscious. The female python was hiding nearby. The mother — who has kept all her son's animals, including tiny — said dan had been caring for the python since it was small enough to fit in his hand, though he'd become wary of it and stopped putting it around his neck because it was so \" strong and unpredictable. \" tiny was \" temperamental, \" but \" she was his baby and she loved him, \" the mother told the inquest, per the new zealand herald. A snake expert testified brandon was an experienced and responsible owner who cared for his snakes properly and would have known that if you are attacked by a python, the trick is to start unwrapping it at the tail, the guardian notes. The coroner said tiny was \" instrumental \" in dan's death — but there were no marks around his neck, and it appears he may have tripped when the snake was coiled around him. \" i do not believe in any way it was aggression from tiny nor a confrontation; if anything it was a show of affection, a moment of peace, \" he said, per the herald. \" there was no aggression, this was an affectionate relationship. \" the verdict was death by misadventure.

            "Washington -- sen. James inhofe ( r-okla. ) said tuesday that the gun control debate doesn't have anything to do with the families of the newtown, conn., shooting victims, and that the only reason those families think it does is because president barack obama told them it did. Eleven family members of newtown victims were in washington on tuesday, meeting privately with senators to urge them to support a forthcoming gun package that would impose tighter background checks, crack down on gun trafficking and enhance school safety measures. Speaking to a handful of reporters, inhofe said he feels bad for those families because they're being used as pawns in a political fight. \" see, i think it's so unfair of the administration to hurt these families, to make them think this has something to do with them when, in fact, it doesn't, \" inhofe said. When it was suggested that the families of newtown victims actually believe the gun debate pertains to them, inhofe said, \" well, that's because they've been told that by the president. \" a request for comment from a spokesman for sandy hook promise, the organization created by members of the newtown community in response to shooting, was not immediately returned.

From what police could piece together, the reception at a venue in ontelaunee township started to turn ugly when partygoer mandi groh punched another woman in the face after she complained about groh allowing her drunk 14-year-old son to drink beer, wfmz reports. The brawl grew and, according to a police report, by the time northern berks officers turned up, some of the guests were shirtless and bloody, reports the reading eagle. \" several people were trying to be a calming influence in all of this, but at that point, alcohol had taken over, \" wrote one of the responding officers, who received help from the fleetwood, hamburg, penn state, berks county, wyomissing, bern, spring, tilden, reading, and muhlenberg forces, among others. The first officers to arrive on the scene had called for all available assistance when the crowd \" was getting riled up \" and turning on them, the eagle reports. Four officers were injured and a total of seven people, including groom nicholas papoutsis, who allegedly challenged officers to a fight, were arrested. Police say the \" very upset \" bride was treated for alcohol poisoning and dehydration, reports the eagle. As for that 14-year-old, he blew a 0.16, twice the legal limit for adults.

Hillary clinton and tim geithner have both publicly announced their exits, but leon panetta, eric holder, ray lahood, steven chu, ken salazaar, and lisa jackson are all expected or rumored to be departing, too, insiders tell politico. Replacements have been bandied about in secret. \" they haven't even made calls, \" one source said. \" they're more like targets than potential nominees. \" but here are the targets the rumor mill is focused on: the prohibitive favorite for treasury secretary seems to be obama's chief of staff, and ex-budget director, jack lew. But there's also been speculation about erskine bowles, who, bloomberg points out, would reassure wall street that a fiscal cliff deal is coming. And the new york daily news has an intriguing, if unlikely, suggestion: mitt romney. Clinton's successor at state is the other big one. Bloomberg reports that susan rice is the frontrunner there, despite her disastrous benghazi comments. John kerry has also long been rumored to be in the mix, but the hill says that prospect has dimmed because scott brown, following his defeat on tuesday, would be the favorite to replace kerry in the senate. Leon panetta hasn't said he's out, but robert gates has had to beg him to stay this long, foreign policy reports. Gop sen. Chuck hagel is reportedly being discussed as a replacement, as is david petraeus. More likely, however, might be former undersecretary michele flournoy, or current panetta deputy ash carter. Obama is trying to find a place for deval patrick, and he's the frontrunner for attorney general — a job he also held under bill clinton. Janet napolitano is interested too, but she's also considering running for senate — and could be a supreme court pick. Napolitano's current gig at homeland security may go to dc court of appeals judge merrick garland — who's also in the mix for attorney general — or to national counterterrorism center director matt olsen.

        "summary": "A new dna analysis in the investigation into the long island serial killer has resulted in what the long island press calls \" the biggest revelation in the case in years. \" records show the torso of an unidentified black woman found in a plastic bin in rockville centre, ny, in 1997 belongs to the same woman whose partial remains were found about 15 miles away along ocean parkway on long island in 2011. Police say the woman — nicknamed peaches due to a peach tattoo on her left breast — was also the mother of the young child whose remains were found about 10 miles from her mother's partial remains. Peaches ' head has yet to be found, but \" each additional piece of information helps in getting an identification, \" a medical examiner says. Only six of 11 people found dead along ocean parkway since 2010 — including a man and eight other women — have been identified, per the ap. Police believe one female victim accidentally drowned but all others were murdered. No suspects have been named. However, the long island press notes a revision to a wikipedia article about the killings once named the killer as joseph foti, a retired corrections officer at suffolk county jail, who is accused of sexual harassing female inmates. The edit — revealed in the recent a&e documentary series the killing season — is intriguing because it came from a computer with an ip address registered to the suffolk county police department. Police have not commented. ( two cops were previously eyed in the case. )",

An ntsb spokeswoman says it's rare for someone to survive a small-plane crash and that it will be very helpful to have a witness. A fund has been set up to help the girl, who is now being cared for by family members in her illinois hometown after being released from the hospital. Relatives say that after the crash, sailor used survival skills her father taught her to seek help, although the second police officer to arrive at the home she walked to tells the los angeles times he suspects there was \" divine intervention there, because she absolutely went to probably the nearest house that she could have, \" despite darkness and rough terrain. The crash also killed the girl's cousin, 14-year-old sierra wilder, whose mother tells nbc that \" she was my best friend. \" sierra, she says, was \" very kind to everybody and anybody, even if she didn't know them \" and loved going on trips with the family to help the gutzlers look after their two young girls.",

But trump has praised putin's leadership saying it would be \"nice \" to work with him to defeat the islamic state, and in their first conversation after the election, putin appeared to emphasise the potential for cooperation. Putin returned to the theme in his speech on thursday: \"of course i am counting on joining forces with the united states in the fight with the real, not made-up, threat of international terrorism, \" he said. He added that thanks to the bombing campaign in syria, where russia and assad's forces are engaged in a bloody push to take aleppo, \"terrorists have been dealt a palpable blow \". A russian diplomat said on wednesday that moscow has been in contact with trump's transition team about syria. Putin made a few jibes at his opponents in the west, saying that \"unlike some foreign colleagues \", russia was looking for friends rather than enemies. But he was less strident in his criticism than in past addresses. In 2014, he accused the west of trying to contain and weaken russia for decades. In 2015, he lashed out at western meddling and regime change in the middle east. In this year's speech, putin said the united states and russia had a \"shared responsibility \" to ensure international security and nuclear nonproliferation, noting that \"attempts to break strategic parity are extremely dangerous \". During his campaign, trump suggested japan and south korea should develop nuclear weapons, although he later appeared to backtrack on that statement. Putin also"

        "summary": "The growing scandal over the rigging of benchmark libor rates raises a fundamental question: why didn't britain's financial services authority see anything was amiss? mainly because the fsa hadn't policed libor for years, reports the wall street journal. Worse, bank executives had warned the fsa about libor violations since 2007, but it took no action until prodded by us regulators in 2010. The fsa even cleared senior barclays executive jerry del missier in 2010 of charges he submitted inaccurate libor data; del missier resigned tuesday in the fallout of the scandal. Fsa chairman adair turner says the day-to-day supervision of libor is actually supposed to be done by the british bankers ' association trade group, and is beyond the legal domain of the fsa. But with the fsa also missing on jpmorgan chase's $ 2 billion loss earlier this year, critics say that ultimate responsibility for the financial system lies with the fsa. The fsa does have one more big loophole to dodge responsibility — it never had a rule in place requiring data submitted to libor be accurate. \" this is a major regulatory failing, \" said one expert. \" it's frankly ridiculous that there wasn't one in place. \" the fsa's turner should at least have plenty of opportunities to explain himself, as british lawmakers voted yesterday to open a parliamentary inquiry into the banking industry, reports reuters.",

            "London british lawmakers backed a government plan on thursday to hold a parliamentary inquiry into the professional and cultural standards of bankers brought into focus by the barclays rate-rigging scandal that has deeply divided politicians.

The palm beach daily news reports that after parking enforcement clamped the device to the wheel of the 1995 range rover that tavoulareas has been living out of, he was arrested on charges of felony theft when the vehicle was found elsewhere, minus the $ 300 boot. A local court assigned him a public defender, despite the fact that he's a son of former mobil ceo william p. Tavoulareas and is believed to have millions in the bank. \" trust me, my brother has millions in his trust fund, \" his brother, shipping magnate peter tavoulareas, tells the miami herald. \" but he's been having psychological problems. The family has tried to help him countless times. We tried to have him move in with family, but it appears he just wants to be homeless. \" tavoulareas, who used to own a 70-foot yacht, moved to a miami beach condo after getting divorced around five years ago. His brother says his irrational behavior is getting worse and he hopes the judge in the theft case sends him for treatment instead of just putting him back on the streets. Tavoulareas, reached by the herald for comment, said he is just \" relaxing \" in palm beach and doesn't want to talk about the situation. ( this homeless woman fought for and won a $ 100,000 settlement from the us. )",

William peter tavoulareas jr., his green range rover and the boot were gone by 12: 20 p.m. The next day, according to a police report. A parking enforcement supervisor reported the boot as stolen. The report says the boot is worth $ 350. A few hours later, at 7 p.m., an officer patrolling southern boulevard recognized tavoulareas, 56, riding a riya 150cc scooter and pulled him over. When the officer asked tavoulareas where the range rover was, he told the officer it was at st. Edward catholic church, 144 n. County road, about a half-mile away. The range rover was at the church, but tavoulareas refused to tell police how it got there and demanded a lawyer. \"truly, how he got it from point a to point b is unknown, \" salm said in a phone interview tuesday. That part of the case is under investigation. Tavoulareas was charged with two felonies: grand theft in connection with the stolen parking boot and with operating a motorcycle without a license, according to the report.

        "summary": "Donald trump has been the gop front-runner for months and by his standards, it's barely cost him a dime. He has only spent around $ 2 million from june to september, reports msnbc, which reports that rivals like ted cruz and ben carson spent more than $ 5 million just through july. The network notes that in 1987's the art of the deal, trump wrote that being written about in the news is a lot more effective than paid advertising, and he seems to be applying the same principle to his campaign with remarkable success. \" i've gotten so much free advertising, it's like nothing i'd have expected, \" he told the new york times last month. \" when you look at cable television, a lot of the programs are 100 % trump, so why would you need more trump during the commercial breaks? \" trump said early on that he's willing to spend $ 1 billion, though he told the times last month that $ 100 million was more realistic. At the current rate of spending, trump could afford to keep his campaign going for many years, but analysts tell msnbc that he's going to have to start digging a lot deeper in the months ahead, when wealthy super pacs are certain to hit him with attack ads. Still, the fact that he has made it so far while spending so little shows his \" brilliance \" at gaming today's political system, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Trump has \" recognized that as a celebrity with a massive following on instagram and twitter, he can dominate the political conversation without spending any real money in the process, \" he writes.

Based on more than 150 interviews with past and current employees, as well as court records, the journal reports on disturbing sexual misconduct accusations against steve wynn, ceo and chairman of wynn resorts and finance chair for the rnc. Many of the allegations revolve around incidents said to have occurred while he was receiving salon services or massages at wynn las vegas, with tales of female workers hiding in the bathroom or in other areas when they heard wynn was coming for an appointment. \" everybody was petrified, \" says one of the salon's ex-artistic directors, who noted he and others had brought up wynn's behavior to higher-ups but \" nobody was there to help us. \" one ex-massage therapist said wynn pressured her into masturbating him during sessions; she says she drew the line at his oral sex requests. Meanwhile, a manicurist says she was forced to have sex with him; she reportedly received a $ 7.5 million settlement. Others mention incidents in which wynn would let his genitals hang out of his shorts and proposition workers. In a statement to the journal, wynn, who turns 76 saturday and has been called a \" great friend \" by president trump, calls the allegations \" preposterous \" and points the finger at ex-wife elaine wynn, whom he married and divorced twice, saying a \" terrible and nasty lawsuit \" from her for a divorce payout is to blame.

Wynn, also the finance chairman for the republican national committee, paid $ 7.5 million to settle claims brought by a former manicurist at his resort who said the executive pressured her to have sex with him, the journal said. Wynn pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for $ 1,000 tips, and others at the spa created fictitious appointments to avoid contact with him, said the newspaper, which contacted more than 150 people who worked with the casino magnate. Wynn, who turns 76 on saturday, denied the allegations. \"the idea that i ever assaulted any woman is preposterous, \" he told the journal.

Shares sank more than 8 percent after the wall street journal reported that its founder, casino industry legend steve wynn, sexually harassed numerous women over many years. Wynn, also the finance chairman for the republican national committee, paid $ 7.5 million to settle claims brought by a former manicurist at his resort who said the executive pressured her to have sex with him, the journal said. Wynn pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for $ 1,000 tips, and others at the spa created fictitious appointments to avoid contact with him, said the newspaper, which contacted more than 150 people who worked with the casino magnate. Wynn, who turns 76 on saturday, denied the allegations. \"the idea that i ever assaulted any woman is preposterous, \" he told the journal. His fortune is valued at about $ 3.7 billion, most of it in wynn shares, according to the bloomberg billionaires index. Steve wynn photographer: jerome favre/bloomberg the allegations jolted a company whose reputation is synonymous with that of its founder, who starred in tv commercials with the likes of frank sinatra to promote his properties. Wynn resorts fell as much as 8.2 percent to $ 184.13 in new york, the biggest drop since july 2017. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the republican national committee, which urged the democratic national committee last year to return campaign donations from movie mogul harvey weinstein when he was accused of sexual assault. \"if the dnc truly stands up for women like they say they do, then returning weinstein's dirty money should be a no-brainer, \" rnc chairwoman ronna mcdaniel tweeted last year.",

On that day's episode of crimewatch — a news program that's run for years on the bbc — host jason mohammad put up a mugshot of viktor lakatos, who was recently sentenced to 18 years in prison for assaulting an elderly woman, the metro reports. But mohammad might as well have put up a photo of himself. British viewers quickly took to social media to point out the resemblance between the host and the criminal. According to the telegraph, the first person to point out the uncanny resemblance was actually a police officer, who tweeted a screenshot with the caption \" that awkward moment... \" another tweet read: \" this presenter on crime watch is starting to sweat. \" the telegraph states mohammad seemed \" oblivious \" to his resemblance to lakatos during the show. But after it became a \" twitter phenomenon \" — in the words of new york magazine — he weighed in on how he kept a straight face: \" i am professional. \" ( a wanted man sent cops a selfie to replace his \" terrible \" mugshot. )",

Other lawmakers piled on cole, too. James sensenbrenner, the primary author of the patriot act, said that \" if the bulk collection program was debated by the congress … it never would have been approved, \" the afp reports.

In a statement, usoc ceo scott blackmun said sorry to \" our hosts in rio and the people of brazil \" for the athletes ' unacceptable behavior, cnn reports. According to the statement: as the usoc understands it, the four men stopped at a gas station sunday night, where one of them committed an act of vandalism. After an argument, armed security staff displayed their weapons and ordered them to pay for the damage before they left. Some of the incident was captured on surveillance video. In other developments: swimmers gunnar bentz and jack conger, who were pulled off their plane home wednesday night, were allowed to fly out on thursday night, the ap reports. Ryan lochte left brazil earlier in the week. A fourth swimmer, james feigen, is still in brazil, seeking to have authorities return his passport. Rio police chief fernando veloso says the other swimmers have told authorities that lochte made up the robbery story. \" no robbery was committed against these athletes. They were not victims of the crimes they claimed, \" he said thursday, per the bbc. Sergio riera, a lawyer for bentz and conger, tells the washington post that the men didn't lie to police or anybody else, though they didn't speak up when lochte gave a false account to the press. Riera says the swimmers arrived at the gas station to use the bathroom, and when one wasn't available, two of the men urinated at the back of the station. He says that after lochte attracted the attention of security staff by punching an ad in a metal frame to the ground, an english-speaking customer had to translate. \" imagine what the conversation must have been like, \" he says. \" a firearm, one talking portuguese, the others talking english, totally frenetic, drunk, and they came to an agreement to pay the damage. They gave a $ 20 note and 100 reals and got another taxi and went away. \" police say lochte and feigen could face charges of false reporting of a crime. Lochte's lawyer tells abc news that he wouldn't be surprised if there were charges, though he insists that there really was a robbery. \" a gun was pointed at the swimmers and they were forced to get out of their cab and give up their money, \" he says. \" no matter what happened at that gas station, the swimmers were robbed by people",

Yu attended a vocational school rather than college, and he's never taken advanced math — \" i barely have any knowledge about calculus or geometry, \" he says — and yet mathematicians say the employee of a package delivery company has come up with a \" more efficient \" way to identify carmichael numbers, or pseudoprimes. The washington post explains that these \" odd \" and \" infrequent \" numbers can pass some of the tests used to determine if a number is prime ( that is, only divisible by 1 or itself ). But they aren't: carmichael numbers have at least three positive prime factors; 561, the first and smallest of 15 such numbers found by rd carmichael in 1910, is the product of 3 x 11 x 17. China daily reports yu spent eight years working on carmichael formulas and tried to contact math professors via email and in-person visits to universities. Professor cai tianxin of zhejiang university was impressed by the work, replied, and invited yu to present his proof at a june 13 lecture. Yu describes himself as so nervous he \" wrote wrong numbers on the blackboard. \" cai now plans to include yu's \" very imaginative solution \" in his latest book, and that's not all cai is doing for yu: he told the man's story to ling lanfang, president of silk road holding group. Impressed, ling has offered yu what china daily reports is a \" statistics-related position \" that ling says would \" give him better development for a career and also more time for furthering his interest and talent in mathematics. \" ( another study found that genuine prime numbers just got a little stranger. )",

Instead, they have to use their tongues in processes researchers didn't understand until recently, reuters reports. Cats, researchers found a few years back, put their tongues on the surface of water and quickly pull it back out. This leads to a column of water that the animals grab with their mouths, shutting them over the water four times per second. \" when we started this project, we thought that dogs drink similarly to cats, \" a researcher says in a press release, as per discovery. \" but it turns out that it's different, because dogs smash their tongues on the water surface — they make lots of splashing, \" he adds. When dogs do this, they drive water upward with an acceleration some five times that of gravity. Researchers investigated the process by placing a camera under the water's surface. A large portion of a dog's tongue hits the water, as opposed to just a small bit of a cat's tongue. And the bigger the dog, the more water it can bring up, discovery notes. Once the water is moving, a dog, like a cat, closes its mouth over the water column. So that's drinking; as for eating, here are some common foods — like grapes — you should never feed your dog or cat.",
