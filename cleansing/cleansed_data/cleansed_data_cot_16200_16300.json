The new guidance advises that teens use long-acting methods like iuds or hormonal implants, which are almost 100 % effective and do a better job in preventing pregnancy than birth control pills, patches, and injections. Nbc news has the order of recommendation: progestin implants like implanon or nexplanon intrauterine devices ( iuds ) depo-provera, which is injected every 13 to 15 weeks combined oral contraceptive pills condoms are currently teens ' no. 1 birth control choice, reports the ap. Though condoms appear low on the academy's list of recommended birth control, the policy pushes for condoms to be used in every instance of teen sex to guard against stds. The guidance also notes that \" an important part of contraceptive counseling \" is a discussion about abstinence. The policy statement's lead author does acknowledge that iuds and hormonal implants can cost hundreds more than other birth control methods, but points out that because they last for years, they're cheaper than the pill in the long run. The recommendations are in line with what the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommended in 2012.",

The survivors were pulled from the wreckage at the crash site and all are said to be in serious condition, per reuters. There was a fourth survivor of the crash, but that person died after arriving at the calixto garcia hospital, the hospital's director says. A local paper says one survivor is between 18 and 25, the second is in her 30s, and the third is 39. \" she is alive but very burned and swollen, \" a relative of one of the women noted. The boeing 737, which authorities say was built in 1979 and last inspected in november, had been under lease to the cuban state airline through the mexican company aerolineas damojh, also known as global air. It's still not clear what brought the plane down, though witnesses tell the bbc they saw it catch on fire before crashing. Mexico's transportation department noted on its website that \" during takeoff ( the plane ) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground. \" cuban president miguel diaz-canel, who says an investigation is underway, designated a 30-hour official period of mourning, from 6am saturday to noon on sunday. The last time a plane crash of this magnitude took place in cuba was in 1989, when an ilyushin-62m passenger plane went down near havana, killing all 126 on board.",

        "summary": "The first dead man tried in russia has been convicted of tax evasion in a move the telegraph says will do further damage to vladimir putin. Sergei magnitsky, a lawyer who died in police custody in 2009, testified before his arrest that state officials tried to claim $ 230 million in tax rebates through an investment company owned by his boss, william browder. Browder, who was tried in absentia, was also found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years behind bars. Supporters claim magnitsky was framed and thrown in jail, where his death later sparked human rights concerns, reports sky news. The kremlin itself suggested magnitsky — who died from pancreatitis at 37 — was beaten to death, while putin said it was heart failure. Though officials say the case was reopened in 2011 so magnitsky's supporters could exonerate him, browder isn't buying it. The trial showed putin \" is ready to sacrifice his international credibility to protect corrupt officials who murdered an innocent lawyer and stole $ 230 million from the russian state, \" his company said, per the ap.",

Police started their investigation after 17-year-old thaishaun hunter was arrested in february in connection with a drive-by shooting outside a grocery store, according to kxly. Khq reports police tapped the phones in the juvenile detention center to follow up on a tip and overheard thaishaun allegedly instructing his 15-year-old brother dionte how to run a prostitution ring using his girlfriends, one of whom had a child with thaishaun. According to kxly, the brothers would allegedly force the girls — some as young as 14 — to advertise themselves for $ 400 \" dates \" on backpage.com. Khq reports police set up a fake date with some of the girls, who confessed to everything. One girl tells police they gave a quarter of the money to the brothers ' mother, who was using it to save up for thaishaun's bail. The sheriff's office believes dionte attacked and robbed a john and beat up one of the girls while running the prostitution ring. They also reportedly found nude photos of underage girls on his phone. Not including the prostitution-related charges brought against him thursday, dionte has had six felony charges against him this year, according to kxly. His teachers describe him as \" remarkably intelligent, \" despite the fact that he was allegedly caught extorting money from fellow students. Both thaishaun and dionte are being charged as adults.",

After that, they could apply for full citizenship, but they'd have to get in line behind immigrants already in the system. Unlike the senators, the president doesn't want to make the process dependent on tougher border controls, notes the new york times.

The wwf says that tiger numbers are going up in india, russia, nepal, and bhutan. The picture is worse in southeast asia; tigers have vanished in cambodia and an estimated dozen are left across all of china and vietnam, according to the wwf, which notes that there are more tigers in captivity in the us alone than there are in the wild. After 2010's all-time low, governments and conservationists teamed up to try to double wild tiger numbers by 2022. \" when you have high-level political commitments, it can make all the difference, \" hemley says. \" when you have well-protected habitat and you control the poaching, tigers will recover. That's a pretty simple formula. We know it works. \" as far as poaching goes, the wwf points out that there is an illegal market for every bit of a tiger, \" from whisker to tail. \" ( in terms of tigers in captivity, this tiger was recently killed by her mating partner at a california zoo. )",

        "summary": "United airlines was plagued with canine passenger problems earlier this year. This time it's american that's making headlines, and it involves a human — an apparently drunk one. Usa today reports on a baggage handler said to be in his mid-20s who had an interesting flight on board a boeing 737 flying from kansas city to chicago after he fell asleep early saturday in the plane's cargo hold. It didn't catch anyone's eye that he'd disappeared from the airport ramp; he was found when the plane touched down at o ' hare around 7: 30am, and he got to have a sit-down with the fbi, chicago cops, and the us attorney's office. He admitted to authorities he'd been drinking the night before; police say he was still intoxicated when he went to work, per cbs chicago. The airline reports the worker wasn't hurt and that the cargo hold was pressurized and had heat. \" we are grateful that he did not sustain any injuries, \" an airline rep says in a statement. An embry-riddle aeronautical university professor tells usa today that baggage handling can be an exhausting job, and that naps in between lugging luggage aren't uncommon. Supervisors are supposed to keep tabs on workers after they load or unload planes, but \" sometimes they slip through the cracks, \" he adds. Although this worker has been suspended from his duties, he wasn't charged by police, and he made his way back to kansas city on another flight — this time, presumably, in the plane's cabin. ( a german shepherd meant to go to kansas ended up in japan on a united flight. )",

        "summary": "After a turbulent year marred by terror woes, ebola outbreaks, and a horrific series of airline disasters, many could be forgiven for saying good riddance to 2014 and gratefully ringing in a new year. Across the globe, revelers looking for a respite from the gloom will converge to welcome 2015. Up first: down under. Sydney takes pride in being one of the first major cities in the world to welcome each new year, and it greeted 2015 in its trademark glittery fashion — with a tropical-style fireworks display featuring shimmering gold and silver palm tree pyrotechnic effects. More than 1.5 million revelers crowded the shores of the city's famed harbor in warm summer weather to watch the vivid eruption of light over the harbour bridge, opera house, and other points along the water. In new zealand, a giant clock on auckland's landmark sky tower counted down the minutes until the new year, with a huge fireworks display launching from the tower at midnight. It's too late now, but if you want to try to celebrate midnight in every time zone next year, philip bump has an extremely complicated ( think 1,429 words and lots of graphics ) piece on how to do just that in the washington post. The \" easy \" way: fly to amundsen-scott station and orbit the south pole. Barring that, you'd have to have access to a military jet and/or an aircraft carrier in order to hit very many of the 24 time zones in such a short period of time; if all you have access to is a regular ol ' car, you can probably only hit a maximum of three.

            "We ' ll come back to this. There is a very easy way to celebrate the strike of midnight on new year's eve in every time zone over a 24 hour period: grab a bottle of whiskey, a heavy down coat, and catch a flight to amundsen-scott station at the south pole. As it turns out, orbiting a pole* is basically the only way to toast the new year in every time zone. The further you get from a pole, the longer it takes to get from time zone to time zone, for the simple reason that the vertical lines that delineate time zones converge at the top and bottom of the world. This map uses lines of longitude, but it's the same idea. The further down you go, the farther you need to travel to cross a line. Which raises an interesting question: assuming one doesn't live at the south pole, how many time zones could you practically celebrate new year's in, if you had a fast enough car or plane? is it possible to celebrate new year's with a drink in all 24 time zones and in a more temperate climate? if you want to do it by car, the first question is pretty easy to answer. The most time zones you can hit is almost certainly",

The kansas city star wrote about polina's plight earlier this month. She was sweet but always left behind when one prospective pet owner after another adopted other rescue animals, largely because polina is scared of other dogs and children. But after the star story, several people stepped forward to adopt polina. Ultimately, she went to a kansas city home where she can roam 3 acres of land and sleep on a large, warm bed. Kc pet project staff chose polina's new family after talking with them and visiting the home. \" she has gone through so much, \" tori fugate, spokeswoman for the kc pet project, said sunday, when the dog went to her new home, just in time for christmas. When it came time to say goodbye, kc pet project staff who had known her so long \" were crying big, ugly ol'tears, \" fugate said. \" they loved her so much. \" staff had worked hard to build polina's confidence, which had been drained.

Shocked drivers spotted a 3-year-old boy in his power wheels in the median of busy us 19 in crystal river wednesday. Witnesses stopped to help the toddler in the area of 1180 north suncoast blvd. One of those people, danny collins, snapped pictures. \"i was shocked, \" collins said. \"that's why i took the pictures. I was like nobody's going to believe. Could have ended a lot differently if not for the people who stopped. \" according to collins, the little one's father showed up about 10 minutes later telling deputies that his son slipped out of the house while he was in the bathroom. Collins tells news channel 8, the father said his son was alone in the living room and used his little chair to reach the front door's lock. News channel 8 reporter, paul mueller tracked down the dad. When he asked from behind a closed door how the child was doing, the dad responded, \"now's not"

        "summary": "Whether you call it the abominable snowman or yeti, the mythical creature may have just jumped from the pages of fiction to the world of fact. Oxford geneticist bryan sykes performed dna testing on 27 suspected yeti samples that had been sent to him from around the world, and got a big hit, reports physorg. Two brownish hair samples found in opposite ends of the himalayas were a perfect match with the dna of an ancient polar bear species that lived 40,000 to 120,000 years ago, the telegraph reports. His conclusion? that yeti is a cross between a polar bear and brown bear — and \" may still be there. \" one of the \" yeti \" hair samples is 40 years old and came from a hunter in india's western himalayas; the second was found in a bhutan bamboo forest 30 years later, so \" we know one of these was walking around 10 years ago, \" sykes says. In the former case, the hunter who shot the animal described being unusually frightened by it, sykes says. \" if its behavior is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then i think that may well be the source of the mystery, \" he tells the bbc, adding the species may be \" more aggressive, more dangerous. \" still, he's not saying there are \" ancient polar bears wandering around the himalayas. \" but there very well could be \" more recent hybridization between the brown bear and the descendant of the ancient polar bear. \"",

            "The \" state of the tropics \" study, run by 13 institutions across 12 countries, reported that people living in the world's tropical zones in 2010 had an average life expectancy of 64.4 years. This was 7.7 years less than those living in non-tropical areas, according to the broad-ranging research project, which was initiated by australia's james cook university ( jcu ). Overall mortality in the region was affected by disease, conflict, poverty and food insecurity, the study said. Investment in social services, such as health and education, as well as access to water, sanitation and medical technology, were also important factors. According to the report, central and southern africa had the worst adult mortality rates, with 377 in every 1,000 people who live to 15 years old dying before they reach 60. That compares with an average of 240 in every 1,000 across the tropics and 154 in every 1,000 for the rest of the world.

            "The \" state of the tropics \" study, run by 13 institutions across 12 countries, reported that people living in the world's tropical zones in 2010 had an average life expectancy of 64.4 years. This was 7.7 years less than those living in non-tropical areas, according to the broad-ranging research project, which was initiated by australia's james cook university ( jcu ). Overall mortality in the region was affected by disease, conflict, poverty and food insecurity, the study said. Investment in social services, such as health and education, as well as access to water, sanitation and medical technology, were also important factors. According to the report, central and southern africa had the worst adult mortality rates, with 377 in every 1,000 people who live to 15 years old dying before they reach 60. That compares with an average of 240 in every 1,000 across the tropics and 154 in every 1,000 for the rest of the world.

The woman took photos of the man's screen, then notified the flight crew. Once the flight had landed, the man was questioned by the fbi and san jose police. Police say 56-year-old michael kellar of tacoma, wash., let authorities review his messages and claimed they only spoke of sexual fantasy. But police say the woman from tacoma with whom kellar was communicating was babysitting two children, aged 5 and 7, at the time, report the washington post and kiro 7, and police allege the kids were being abused. Kellar and 50-year-old gail burnworth were both arrested monday. Kellar faces charges of attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, while burnworth is charged with rape of a child and other crimes. \" if it wasn't for this particular passenger taking action to alert the staff and alert the police, this catastrophic event would have been horrific, \" san jose police sgt.

In other bad news for the family: after getting complaints, hulu yanked the show entirely, tmz reports. And about a dozen advertisers so far have fled the show or pledged not to advertise on it, e! reports. Among them: conagra foods, cvs, h&r block, keurig, walgreens, payless shoes, and general mills; tmz also lists jimmy dean, pure leaf iced tea, ace hardware, david's bridal, party city, ricola, and behr. In touch, which broke the duggar story, now reports that after arkansas police shut their 2006 investigation because the statute of limitations was up, they referred it to the families in need of services agency, and ultimately the department of human services was brought in. Nine months later, duggar sued dhs. Details of the dhs investigation and the trial that resulted are sealed, but a source says duggar was probably appealing whatever the dhs decided. The stir explains: if dhs recommended that duggar be removed from the home, or that the family be monitored, duggar could have sued to dispute that finding. Another possibility for the future of 19 kids and counting: josh could be cut from the show.",

He ignored them and instead followed the advice of his mentor, the dalai lama, who told him to meditate. It took the better part of a year, but the gangrene eventually disappeared.

The lama is expert at tsa lung meditation, whose practitioners visualize a \" wind \" moving through the body and removing impurities, writes maureen seaberg. A medical anthropologist involved in the study writes: \" research shows that mental imagery directed to sites of the body, both superficial as well as deeper tissues, can with practice eventually lead to increased local blood flow, metabolic activity, and oxygenation. Such increases could in principle combat even powerful bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, which not only can be the cause of gangrene, but is now often times resistant to antibiotics. \" full story here.",

When tibetan lama phakyab rinpoche immigrated to the united states in 2003, he was a 37-year-old refugee with diabetes and pott's disease. His afflictions had gotten so bad that his right foot and leg had developed gangrene. He was hospitalized and examined by three different doctors in new york city who all gave the same treatment recommendation: amputate. Can meditation cure disease? ( getty images ) few people would go against such medical advice, but rinpoche ( pronounced rin-poh-chey ) is no average person. Born in 1966 in kham, tibet, he was ordained at the age of 13 and named the eighth incarnation of the phakyab rinpoche by the dalai lama himself when he was working toward the highest level of tibetan buddhist study, the geshe degree, in 1993.

William c. Bushell, an mit-affiliated researcher in medical anthropology and director of east-west research for tibet house in new york.

Won lama rinpoche's cooperation in undergoing a functional mri scan of his brain while he meditated inside the scanner at nyu's center for brain imaging.

            "A tibetan lama believes he cured his gangrene-stricken leg by meditating for a year. Now scientists are studying his brain, hoping to discover a medical miracle. Can the power of the mind help humans self-heal? that's what a group of scientists are hoping to help determine by studying a tibetan lama who believes he cured himself of gangrene through meditation. When tibetan lama phakyab rinpoche immigrated to the united states in 2003, he was a 37-year-old refugee with diabetes and pott's disease. His afflictions had gotten so bad that his right foot and leg had developed gangrene. He was hospitalized and examined by three different doctors in new york city who all gave the same treatment recommendation: amputate. Can meditation cure disease? ( getty images ) few people would go against such medical advice, but rinpoche ( pronounced rin-poh-chey ) is no average person. Born in 1966 in kham, tibet, he was ordained at the age of 13 and named the eighth incarnation of the phakyab rinpoche by the dalai lama himself when he was working toward the highest level of tibetan buddhist study, the geshe degree, in 1993. A deeply spiritual man who has devoted his life to the teachings of buddhism, it was only natural that he should reach out to his mentor, his holiness the dalai lama, when deciding whether to allow his",
            "Now, a group of doctors at new york university have begun studying rinpoche — specifically, his brain. Practitioners of tsa lung meditation like rinpoche visualize a wind ( or \"lung, \" or \"prana \" ) that is one with the mind, moving down the center channel of their bodies, clearing blockages and impurities before moving on to ever-smaller channels. \" this is a cognitive-behavioral practice that present east-west science suggests may be more effective that any existing strictly western medical intervention, \" says dr. William c. Bushell, an mit-affiliated researcher in medical anthropology and director of east-west research for tibet house in new york. Gangrene is not curable by current medical intervention once past a certain point in its progression, except by amputation. This month, dr. Bushell and nyu neuroscientist zoran josipovic, ph.d. Won lama rinpoche's cooperation in undergoing a functional mri scan of his brain while he meditated inside the scanner at nyu's center for brain imaging.

Senior gen. Min aung hlaing, the commander in chief of myanmar's army, is one of six generals named as priority subjects for investigation and prosecution by a united nations fact finding mission on myanmar in a report detailing military campaigns involving atrocities that \"undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law. \" the three-member panel leveled the most serious charge, genocide, over the ferocious campaign unleashed by the buddhist-majority security forces against rohingya muslims a year ago. That campaign, in the state of rakhine, sent more than 700,000 fleeing across the border to bangladesh. Myanmar has rejected allegations of widespread atrocities, asserting that its security forces were simply responding to attacks by rohingya militants on myanmar police posts and an army station on aug. 25 last year. But the panel said there was enough information to warrant investigation and prosecution of senior officers \"so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide. \"",

            "Geneva — myanmar's army commander and other top generals should face trial in an international court for genocide against rohingya muslims and for crimes against humanity targeting other ethnic minorities, united nations experts said on monday after a yearlong investigation. Senior gen. Min aung hlaing, the commander in chief of myanmar's army, is one of six generals named as priority subjects for investigation and prosecution by a united nations fact finding mission on myanmar in a report detailing military campaigns involving atrocities that \"undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law. \" the three-member panel leveled the most serious charge, genocide, over the ferocious campaign unleashed by the buddhist-majority security forces against rohingya muslims a year ago. That campaign, in the state of rakhine, sent more than 700,000 fleeing across the border to bangladesh. Myanmar has rejected allegations of widespread atrocities, asserting that its security forces were simply responding to attacks by rohingya militants on myanmar police posts and an army station on aug. 25 last year. But the panel said there was enough information to warrant investigation and prosecution of senior officers \"so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide. \"",

Second, the 2012 discovery defies conventional wisdom about fossils — scientists can't believe the newly discovered half, despite being exposed, is generally in the same condition as the one that's been safely tucked away for more than a century.",

Witnesses describe the scene as a bloodbath, with militants, armed with ak-47s and riding armored tanks, killing small children and even a woman in labor. \" up until now, the isolation of the baga combined with the fact that boko haram remains in control of the area has meant that it has been very difficult to verify what happened there, \" an ai researcher says.

Many of the 130 victims of last friday's attacks were enjoying drinks after work on an unusually warm autumn night when islamic state gunmen sprang from cars and sprayed them with bullets in france's worst violence since world war two. Tension was still high in paris at the end of a week in which there were scores of false alarms, episodes of crowd panic and a seven-hour gunfight that left the suspected mastermind of the attacks dead. Though some parisians were still thinking twice about going out, some 200 figures from the country's cultural and media elite called on france to continue to have fun in defiance of militants who call paris the \" capital of prostitution and vice \". \" one week on, let's turn on",

        "summary": "Someone in detroit really wants the city's rundown residences — thousands of them. A mystery bidder has offered $ 3.2 million to scoop up a huge batch of foreclosures ( many of them due to owed taxes ) in an open auction held by wayne county, businessweek reports. The county, which is trying to dump the homes in bulk to help clean up city blight, had previously tried selling such properties off on their own or in smaller batches, but more than 75 % of the new buyers also defaulted on their taxes. Just this year there have been 22,000 foreclosures in the city, with 85,000 more foreclosure notices set to be delivered over the next couple of months, the atlantic reports. Because many of these homes still house tenants, that means 142,000 detroit residents — one-fifth of the entire population, according to the census bureau — may be out on the street in the next 18 months. What makes this multimillion-dollar mystery offer even more baffling is that the deal doesn't look like it offers a lot of bang for the buck. The \" blight bundle \" cited in businessweek indicates only about 1,000 of the homes \" hold some value, \" with many of them moldy and missing furnaces or wiring; 2,000 are just empty lots, and 3,000 need to be torn down completely within six months, which could cost an extra $ 24 million. \" it could be — and this is all speculation — that the people who are bidding on it are altruistic in nature, \" the county's chief deputy treasurer tells businessweek.

Konstantin murakhtin on wednesday. On thursday, turkey issued its retort, by way of audio recordings made available to the ap. Turkey says the 10 audio clips are evidence of the repeated warnings made by the turkish military, with the ap reporting they \" indicate the plane was warned several times tuesday that it was approaching turkey's airspace and asked to change course. \" the ap also states that the voice in the audio, which is at times nearly incomprehensible, \" grows increasingly more agitated \" as it continues. The audio features a voice saying in broken english: \" this is turkish air force speaking on guard. You are approaching turkish airspace. \" turkey is the only party that speaks in the audio, and the ap presents three possibilities as to why that's the case: the russian pilots never heard the warnings; they heard them but did not respond; or they did respond but turkey did not release that audio. Meanwhile, turkish president tayyip erdogan on thursday responded to russian prime minister dmitry medvedev's order, issued on the same day, that his country consider measures that would block some turkish food imports and put some joint projects on ice. \" we are strategic partners … ' joint projects may be halted, ties could be cut '? are such approaches fitting for politicians? \" erdogan said, in what reuters calls \" an escalating war of words. \"",

Big names include trump's social media director dan scavino, his assistant for strategic initiatives christopher lidell, top white house counsel don mcgahn, and deputy press secretary raj shah. It's unclear why so many trump appointees lack permanent security clearances — whether it's due to glacial bureaucracy or issues with their backgrounds — but a former administration official tells cnn that lack of permanent clearances can make it harder for appointees and those around them to do their jobs. \" the security clearance process is critical to keeping america's secrets, \" former republican lawmaker mike rogers says. \" it's unusual that so many have taken so long. \" meanwhile, salon wonders if kushner's debt — he and ivanka trump are reportedly in debt anywhere between $ 31 million and $ 155 million — combined with his lack of permanent clearance makes him a danger to national security.

One researcher discovered the tactic for the first time among the mexican free-tailed bat, which, like all bats, uses \" echolocation \" to find its food, reports national geographic. The university of maryland scientist was studying how a species of moth jammed the sonar of the big brown bat with ultrasonic clicks when he noticed that calls coming from mexican free-tailed bats nearby were similar. He reviewed hours of audio to confirm the discovery. Researchers found that if they played one of 15 different calls from the free-tailed bat when another bat was emitting a \" feeding buzz \" — the noise that follows frequent echolocation pings as a bat closes in on prey — the hunter bat was up to 86 % less likely to snatch up the meal, smithsonian reports. \" they get into amazing aerial dogfights, \" one researcher tells livescience. \" one will jam the other, and the other will jam back. \" the new findings are laid out in science.

Per the guardian, a group of academics from copenhagen, cornell, harvard, oxford, and princeton is drafting a submission letter that will note that the islanders responded to the refugees with \" empathy and self-sacrifice, \" despite being in the throes of their own economic crisis. An online petition in favor of the nomination has received hundreds of thousands of signatures. And the people behind the effort tell the guardian that the greek government has pledged its support. Nominations are due feb. 1. Volunteer groups called \" solidarity networks \" that were organized to help refugees would likely be the official nominees, the guardian notes, because only individuals and organizations are eligible for the award, which comes with a gold medal and monetary prize ( about $ 1 million last year ).

The rate of c-sections was flat, at 31.3 %, from 2009 to 2011, and mothers-to-be are waiting until closer to their due dates to go under the knife. It's good news, experts say, showing increased awareness of c-section risks — such as medical issues for the baby, infection, and very rarely, death — and the importance of full-term delivery at 39 to 40 weeks. The number of c-sections at 38 weeks dropped 5 %, while the 39-week rate got a 4 % spike, the ap reports. The report, focusing on single-child deliveries in 2011 — 96 % of births that year — also found c-sections peaked in 2009 at 33 % of all births, after climbing from 5 % in 1970. Though the cdc can't explain the trend, it hopes to discover what's behind it while promoting even fewer c-sections in the future: its goal is 15 %.",

Figures released thursday show what appears to be a significant shift in when pregnant women have cesarean sections. Experts called the change great news _ apparent evidence that doctors and women have absorbed warnings about the risks of c-sections and the importance of waiting to deliver until the baby is full-term. \" people are getting the message, \" said dr.

For decades, the operations were done in only a small fraction of births, usually only when a fetus was in danger. In 1970, the u.s. Rate was 5 percent of all births. By 2009, about a third of births were c-sections. Experts say many factors drove the rate up, including the convenience of scheduling deliveries. But that rate has at least stopped rising for two years. The overall rate was again about 33 percent in 2011, the latest year available from the centers for disease control and prevention. Thursday's report focused on preliminary data for that year's single-child deliveries, which are about 96 percent of all births. The trend there was similar to the overall numbers: the c-section rate has held steady at 31 percent since 2009, after rising for a dozen straight years. The report found very little change in c-sections through 37 weeks of gestation between 2009 and 2011. But at 38 weeks there were fewer: the rate fell 5 percent, to 32 percent. And at 39 weeks, it rose 4 percent, to 34 percent of births. The rate at 40 weeks held steady at 25 percent. A full-term pregnancy is 39 to 40 weeks.

A new study out of texas a&m says ignore those rates — and start with that credit card bill. It all boils down to motivation: successfully bring one balance down to zero, and that \" small victory \" could give you the steam you need to power through bigger balances, the researchers explain. How they arrived at their conclusion: study participants were asked to retype 150 10-character strings in an excel spreadsheet; they worked faster as they approached the end of columns and slowed down as they started a new column, suggesting they had a motivational surge when the end was in sight, science daily reports. Further, when their task was broken down \" into parts of unequal size, \" participants were least likely to complete tasks in ascending order, that is, smallest to largest. But subjects actually performed faster when the parts were ordered that way, alexander l. Brown and joanna n. Lahey write in the journal of marketing research. The theory is also known as the debt-snowball method of debt reduction, popularized by finance expert dave ramsey. \" the math seems to lean more toward paying the highest interest debts first, but what i have learned is that personal finance is 20 % head knowledge and 80 % behavior, \" he told the huffington post in 2014. The researchers do acknowledge there are some situations in which \" the increase in motivation may not offset the additional interest accrued by not paying. \"",

Los angeles native rand gauthier was laying wires at anderson and lee's malibu mansion in 1995 when his relationship with the celebrities went sour, and lee told him at gunpoint to \" get the f -- k off my property. \" stewing, gauthier says, he stole a safe from the rock star's garage and found a hi8 tape among the valuables. \" we put it in and see what it is, and of course, cha-ching, \" he says. \" the dollar signs fly before our eyes. But we're going, this is the kind of thing people will get killed over. \" even so, gauthier teamed up with a porn producer to sell the video. They got funding from louis peraino, son of a new york mobster, to distribute the tape via newly created websites. Although the producer made money, gauthier never did and says he ended up working collections for peraino ( throwing ammonia in people's faces and breaking collarbones ) to pay off the debt. Lee and anderson filed a $ 10 million civil suit to retrieve the video, but they couldn't stop it from going viral and later settled with a savvy distributor who was selling it online and in stores. Now gauthier, who seems deflated, lives up the california coast doing electrical work again. \" i believe in reincarnation, and this is kind of my vacation life, \" he says. \" i have to come back and be really serious next time. \" see g-rated excerpts of the tape at ultimate classic rock.",

Isaac choi, the former ceo of short-lived tech startup wrkriot — which developed software to be used in job searches before its closure in september 2016 — pleaded guilty to wire fraud in federal court monday after lying about his background and defrauding employees out of wages, reports the san francisco chronicle. According to prosecutors, 36-year-old choi stopped paying employees shortly after wrkriot's founding ( the company also went by the names 1for.one and jobsonic ) and forged wire transfer confirmations to suggest payments were coming. As former employee penny kim wrote in a 2016 medium post, it was an intern who discovered wire transfer confirmations sent to 17 employees were actually photoshopped, per the san francisco weekly. All this went down amid greater chaos at the startup. Kim said choi borrowed $ 50,000 from one employee after claiming $ 2 million he planned to invest was tied up in offshore accounts. \" in total, choi collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own employees through false representations about the company's financial health and his own ability to financially support wrkriot in its early stages of development, \" reads an indictment filed in june 2017, per the san jose mercury news. Prosecutors say choi — who was operating under at least four different names — also falsely claimed to have a degree from new york university and to have previously worked as an analyst at jpmorgan. Released on bond monday after seven months in custody, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. He's due to be sentenced may 24.

            "Photo male nurses make $ 5,100 more on average per year than female colleagues in similar positions, researchers reported on tuesday. The new analysis, which included data on more than 290,000 registered nurses, also found that the pay gap had not narrowed within workplace settings and specialties from 1988 to 2013. The new study is the first to have measured gender disparities in pay among nurses over time. \"we now have pretty compelling evidence that there are pay inequalities between men and women in nursing over the past 25 years, \" said debra j. Barksdale, the director of the doctor of nursing practice program at the university of north carolina at chapel hill, who was not involved with the new study. Because most nurses are women, \"you may think women have caught up or even might be ahead of men, but we find that's not the case, \" said ulrike muench,"

A protest in rio de janeiro resembled a party, with some wearing bathing suits and snapping selfies as samba music boomed, reports the new york times. But not all the protesters were upbeat. Many called on the military to seize power, while others urged leftist president dilma rousseff — who is no stranger to such protests and whose approval ratings are stuck in the single digits — to kill herself. Many say rousseff must have known about a multibillion dollar bribery scandal at petrobras while chairwoman of the company's board, before she was elected in 2010. The bbc reports she was cleared of wrongdoing in an attorney general investigation, but members of her government have been connected to the scandal. \" she must be impeached or resign for ultimately she is responsible for all the corruption and the economic mess this country is in, \" a protester tells cbs news. Rousseff says she will not resign; a recent poll found two-thirds of brazilians want to see her impeached.",

The experiment, which was backed by european law enforcement agency europol, involved a group of security researchers setting up a wi-fi hotspot in june. When people connected to the hotspot, the terms and conditions they were asked to sign up to included a \"herod clause \" promising free wi-fi but only if \"the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity \". Six people signed up. F-secure, the security firm that sponsored the experiment, has confirmed that it won't be enforcing the clause. \"we have yet to enforce our rights under the terms and conditions but, as this is an experiment, we will be returning the children to their parents, \" wrote",

In an experiment sponsored by security firm f-secure, an open wi-fi network was set up in a busy public area. When people connected, they were presented with lengthy terms and conditions. But to see just how little attention we pay when checking that agreement box, f-secure included a \" herod clause \" -- one that offered up free wi-fi in exchange for the company's permanent ownership of the user's firstborn child. The experiment was intended to highlight the dangers of connecting to unknown wi-fi networks, the guardian reports.

An inquiry found huston violated the company's conduct code and that he didn't exhibit ceo-like behavior — and huston reportedly admitted to those accusations and expressed his contriteness. \" i am satisfied with the board's thorough review of this issue, \" the board's lead independent director said in a statement. In huston's place for the time being at the priceline helm: chairman jeffrey boyd, who was the company's ceo and president from 2002 to 2013 and who ' ll serve as temporary ceo until the board selects a new executive, the ap reports. Although priceline will pay to send huston, originally from canada, back to north america from his home in europe, he won't be getting a severance package and will forfeit about $ 15.3 million in unvested stock equity, bloomberg reports.

The 28-year-old died after she left a party on chappaquiddick island with ted kennedy, whose oldsmobile went off an island bridge and plunged into a tidal pond. Kennedy escaped the car, later saying he dove repeatedly in an unsuccessful attempt to save kopechne, who never made it out. Kennedy then waited 10 hours to report the incident, and his car wasn't pulled out of the water until the next morning. The movie explores these events, making some leaps of its own about kennedy's behavior. Details: the basics: usa today has a primer on the incident, the movie ( starring jason clarke as kennedy and kate mara as kopechne ), and context about the era and the kennedy clan. ( rfk had been killed about a year earlier. ) producers taylor allen, 34, and andrew logan, 35, say the film ( which alleges a cover-up orchestrated by patriarch joe kennedy ) is neither pro- nor anti-kennedy. About kopechne: she worked on robert kennedy's campaign and in the civil rights movement, and her family is pleased her fuller story is being told. \" she was not a wide-eyed capitol hill staffer, \" write her aunt and cousin in usa today. \" she was a 28-year-old seasoned idealist in a time when everything seemed possible. \" they see all this as \" the classic american tragedy. \"",

        "summary": "Teamwork both human and animal is what saved the lives of nearly a dozen asian elephants in a cambodian wildlife preserve after local farmers there stumbled upon a distressing sight: 11 of the endangered animals stuck in a mud-filled crater formed nearly a half-century ago by a vietnam war bomb, live science reports. The three adult females and eight youngsters apparently fell into peril in the forest of the keo seima wildlife sanctuary when they decided to stop off for a bath and a drink at the crater — which the wildlife conservation society notes had been made even bigger by farmers to use as a water storage pond — and ended up getting stuck in the mud as it dried, unable to scramble back up the 10-foot sides. But it's the rescue that's now getting the most attention, helped along by a video on youtube that shows the elephants'dramatic assisted exit after the farmers found them and called the conservation society for help. After giving the elephants sustenance for strength, rescuers dug a ramp in the side of the giant hole so the animals could walk out. The exit slope was slick, however, and so the elephants got to work ramming each other up the incline with their trunks and heads. When the last elephant remained with none of its compatriots to push it to safety, the humans joined in, using ropes to help drag the straggler out. \" their loss would have been a major blow to conservation, \" a wcs rep said in a statement, per live science. ( perhaps the elephants consoled each other during their ordeal. )",

Whistleblower helen foster says she was demoted and transferred from the department of housing and urban development, which carson heads, after she refused to go over the legal $ 5,000 limit to redecorate his office, the guardian reports. In a federal complaint, foster says she was told by acting hud director craig clemmensen to \" find money \" for the redecoration. She said that when she refused to break the law, she was told that administrations had always found their way around the limit in the past — and that \" $ 5,000 will not even buy a decent chair. \" federal law requires congressional approval if the cost of furnishing the office of a department head goes beyond $ 5,000. A former hud staffer tells cnn that a lot of staff time was wasted on the redecoration project. \" instead of focusing on hud's mission, we were talking about furniture for the secretary's office, \" the former employee says. Federal procurement records show that carson's office ended up spending more than $ 31,000 on a new hardwood table and chairs in late 2017, just as the administration announced major cuts to hud programs helping older and low-income americans, the new york times reports. Hud spokesman raffi williams tells the times that the department didn't request congressional approval for the spend because the dining set in carson's 10th-floor offices \" serves a building-wide need. \" williams says carson believes in being \" fiscally prudent \" — but he isn't planning to send the table back.",

Obama's opponents have been quick to remind him of his earlier stance on executive privilege, when he said the bush administration hid behind it \" every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place. \" entering the battle between the house gop and attorney general eric holder will make it easier for obama to paint house republicans as divisive and extreme, write amie parnes at the hill, but the move also brings him \" closer to the fast and furious scandal, and directly connects obama to holder, seen by some as a controversial figure in the administration. \" obama's assertion of executive privilege may or may not hold up if the house decides to sue, but \" one thing now is clear, \" writes shannen coffin at the national review. \" fast and furious is owned, lock, stock and barrel, by the president.

            "President obama's decision wednesday to assert executive privilege to shield his attorney general and the justice department from congressional investigators reignited a long-running washington debate over the limits of white house power in which obama has argued both sides. In 2007, obama, then a senator with higher ambitions, chided president george w. Bush for employing his executive authority to block then-senior white house adviser karl rove from testifying before congress in a scandal involving the firing of nine u.s. Attorneys. Speaking to cnn host larry king, obama declared that the bush administration had a tendency to \"hide behind executive privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place. \" obama urged bush to consider \"coming clean, \" adding that \"the american people deserve to know what was going on there. \" on wednesday, his role had changed, but the debate was the same: republican were asking what exactly",

Here, there is no claim that any of the communications at issue involved or even related to the president, so the president does not invoke the presidential communications privilege. Instead, the president invokes the second, more common, form of \"executive privilege, \" the",
            "President obama escalated a battle between his administration and the republican house over attorney general eric holder on wednesday in ways that could benefit his reelection campaign. By asserting executive privilege over \"fast and furious \" documents sought by the house gop, obama inserted himself directly into the fight between holder and rep. Darrell issa ( r-calif. ), the house oversight and government reform committee chairman. He also made it easier to run against not only mitt romney, but a republican house he hopes to portray as divisive and overly extreme. Advertisement the move enabled the white house to shift the story surrounding the controversial gun-tracking operation and to scold republicans — under an increasingly bright public spotlight — for focusing on what the administration dubs a political witch hunt instead of passing federal transportation funding and extending low interest rates on federally backed student loans. \"if you had to find one person who is the most over-the-top in"

That means they won't be able to access it anymore, though they can request to be able to. You can also restrict them from forwarding, copying, downloading, or printing the email. If you use the mode, you can also revoke access if you no longer want the person to be able to view the message after you've sent it. More security: you can even require recipients to type in a passcode ( it will be texted to their phone ) before viewing an email; this aims to help protect messages should a recipient's email get hacked.",

Stores in long beach, irvine, and culver city also have been targeted, reports nbc los angeles. ( it counts eight robberies. ) the scene of the crime isn't the only commonality: police say all robberies occurred in the evening, without injuries, and involved a few armed suspects who escaped on foot. In the most recent case, two men took $ 4,800 from a trader joe's in culver city on the night of april 12, before fleeing on foot. Both suspects are described as 5-foot-8 and in their 20s — one reportedly had a scar under an eye — but police were unable to get video footage because the trader joe's store doesn't have security cameras. \" we trust our customers and do not conduct surveillance on them, \" trader joe's says, while a company rep tells the times that only some stores have security cameras or guards. That's a red flag for retail security consultant bob dilonardo. He raises the possibility that robbers might be taking advantage of an \" extremely unusual \" lack of security. \" criminals don't live in a vacuum. When they discover a situation that's easier, rather than more difficult, they take advantage, \" he says.",

Most forecast models predict that the storm currently forming off the east coast will largely remain offshore, though it will still be fierce enough to give new england strong winds, heavy snowfall, and record-breakingly cold temperatures thursday, cnn reports. Winter weather warnings are already in place from massachusetts all the way to florida, where cities including tallahassee are expecting their first substantial snowfall in years. Georgia gov. Nathan deal has declared a state of emergency for 28 counties. Forecasters believe that \" bombogenesis \" will happen over wednesday and thursday in an area of low pressure as it moves from off the east coast of florida toward canada's maritime provinces. It will be considered a \" bomb \" if its central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, mashable explains. Forecasters believe the storm could easily exceed that measure, developing hurricane-force winds and becoming one of the strongest winter storms on record in the region. The noaa warns that the system will bring a mixture of freezing rain, sleet, and snow from northern florida to north carolina and heavy snow from the mid-atlantic states to new england, where blizzard conditions are possible thursday if the storm comes close enough.

Messages can come from anyone ( including people who haven't signed up for sarahah themselves, unless you change the setting allowing it ), are anonymous, and cannot be replied to — although usa today reports that some users work around this by taking a screenshot and broadcasting a reply on platforms like twitter and snapchat. A cyber safety expert tells abc australia that any service like this \" will lend itself to anonymous bullying, \" while reporting abuse is difficult since people don't have to register to send a message. \" when it comes to no face, we can see how the internet can be, \" a stand-up comedian tells kmtv. \" so it's terrifying. \" the counter argument? don't sign up for it in the first place.

The medical examiner tells tmz bernecker passed away thursday evening after his ventilator was turned off, though because he'd been on a ventilator since wednesday, wednesday was listed as the official date of death. Bernecker reportedly had family and friends in the room when his ventilator was turned off. Said to be among them: his girlfriend, who's also a stunt performer on the walking dead. Bernecker had been working on the set when he fell more than 20 feet onto concrete. Although the swelling on his brain began to die down thursday, it started back up again and his status deteriorated from there, a source tells tmz. In addition to his stint on the amc show, bernecker had also worked on shows such as hbo's true detective and fox's scream queens, as well as such movies as logan, the fate of the furious, and get out, among many others, per imdb.
