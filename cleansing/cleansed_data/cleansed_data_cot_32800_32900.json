Conaway's former fiancée tells the national enquirer that conaway was asleep at home in the 1990s, and woke up to travolta giving him oral sex, the new york post reports. The incident ended their long friendship, she claims. ( the incident also spurred the post to use the regrettable line, \"john travolta just couldn't resist a quickie with kenickie. \" ) the ex is apparently on a tabloid tour, because she also reportedly told star that travolta's wife kelly preston knows he's gay, and another source claims preston signed a contract when they entered into their sham marriage. More recent developments: yet another massage therapist tells the enquirer he had sex with travolta in 1997 after a massage at the ritz-carlton, and that the actor is \" experienced \" at sex with men.

Meanwhile, accuser no. 1 may have been dropped by his first attorney, but he's now hired attorney to the ( people accusing ) stars ( of stuff ) gloria allred, people reports.",

        "summary": "With the value of cryptocurrencies soaring, authorities warn that people could be ripped off by sophisticated hackers — or by crooks using more old-fashioned methods. New jersey authorities say louis meza, a 35-year-old cryptocurrency investor, lured a friend into a minivan, where a gunman demanded his keys, his phone, and the 24-word passphrase to open his cryptocurrency wallet, new york daily news reports. Meza then allegedly went to the man's home, stole items including a ledger, and transferred $ 1.8 million in the crytocurrency ether into his own account. Manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr. Says this type of crime can be expected to rise along with the value of currencies like bitcoin and ether. \" hackers, data breaches, and fraud aren't the only threats to an individual's wealth, \" vance said in a statement tuesday, per bloomberg. \" this case demonstrates the increasingly common intersection between cyber and violent crime. \" meza, who faces up to 25 years in prison if found guilty of charges including robbery and kidnapping, pleaded not guilty in manhattan supreme court tuesday. ( last year, a florida judge dismissed money-laundering charges because she decided bitcoin didn't count as money. )",

        "summary": "On wednesday night, abc's black-ish aired a ripped-from-the-headlines show that some might call a \" very special episode. \" the entire half-hour featured the sitcom family sitting in the living room watching the news to see if a police officer would be indicted in a police brutality case. The case was fictionalized, but the characters discussed other such cases that have made the news in real life: eric garner, tamir rice, sandra bland, freddie gray. And the episode has been getting lots of positive reaction: the episode was hard-hitting, and yet it still managed to be funny, writes david sims in the atlantic. \" black-ish's continued presence on the small screen, and abc's willingness to let it talk about more charged issues in depth, is a strong reminder of why network television needs more families that look like the johnsons on screen. This kind of episode doesn't need to air every night — but they don't air nearly often enough. \" sonia saraiya at salon calls the episode \" brilliant \" but also \" heartrending. \" she notes that it's \" lighter and less self-serious \" than a true \" very special episode, \" but \" it does feel like an important manifesto. Not for, exactly, an end to police brutality, or equal rights but something less concrete; that much-politicized clause of the american dream that hopes we might be able to leave for our children something better than what we ourselves had. \" slate's headline: \" black-ish delivered one of the best episodes about race ever to air on television. \" at bustle, kayle hawkins notes some of the episode's best laugh lines ( \" why must you always advocate for the devil? he does not need help with his legal team! \" and \" i wasn't worried about thugs — i married one. \" ) and rounds up some of the positive twitter reactions to the episode. Show runner kenya barris talked to the new york times and entertainment weekly about the episode. \" police brutality is the issue we chose to talk about, but the bigger issue for me is talking to your kids about what's going on in the world, \" he says. \" it used to be you could shelter them in your own way, but with internet and phones and 24-hour news, you can't avoid those conversations. \" the episode title is \" hope, \" and barris says, \" that's sort of what we wake up for every day.

Consumerist reports daniele galliano, mayor of bormida, is offering about $ 2,175 in cash and rent as cheap as $ 54 per month to anyone who moves to his village. The population of bormida has dwindled to just 394 residents as young people flee to the city, and galliano wants to keep it from disappearing altogether. According to usa today, galliano has actually added a net of four people to the population since becoming mayor in 2014 — which is more impressive knowing that 54 people died or moved away in that time. Population stability can be a victory for a place like bormida. Should you take galliano up on his generous proposal — which still needs to be approved by the local board — here's what bormida offers: four restaurants, a library, a pharmacy, a post office that's open three times a week, a corner store, a bed and breakfast, one main street, and a doctor who visits a few times a week, cosmopolitan reports. The nearest big city, genoa, is about 50 miles away. \" life is so simple and natural, \" the manager of one of the restaurants tells the guardian. \" we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food.

        "summary": "Pack away the flannel pajamas: a handful of studies and surveys show sleeping naked could actually be good for you. Six reasons why you should consider it: you may like your partner more: a 2014 survey of brits by cotton usa ( which promotes cotton products that likely include both pajamas and sheets ) found that 57 % of those who slept nude reported being happy in their relationship. That was 9 percentage points more than pj wearers, followed by 43 % of nightie wearers. Onesie wearers — they apparently exist — brought up the rear at 38 %, per the daily mail. It could help prevent diabetes: it's a bit of a stretch, but here's the logic: adults have small amounts of brown fat ( aka \" good fat \" ) in their bodies, and a 2014 study looked at how bedroom temperature affected the fat. The four-month study was small: just five males who slept in rooms heated to 66-, 75-, or 81-degrees. After four weeks spent at the coldest temp, the men had almost twice as much brown fat, and their insulin sensitivity was better, which a researcher says could lower their diabetes risk. Four weeks at 81 degrees undid all the benefits. Though the new york times points out the test subjects slept in hospital scrubs, going naked could help prevent overheating.

It's how our ancestors did it: if you're a paleo-dieter who eats like a caveman, why not sleep like one, too? neurologist rachel salas with the johns hopkins center for sleep in 2013 told the wall street journal that \" back in the cave days, \" people slept naked. It was, in part, a means of protection from predators, and that feeling of safety could be imparted by sleeping similarly in modern day. It could be better for the immune system: mic reports that when skin-on-skin contact occurs, our adrenal glands get a message: lighten up on the production of the stress hormone cortisol. As one doctor explains, \" cortisol suppresses the immune response. \" skin-to-skin contact also increases levels of oxytocin, which can have positive effects on blood pressure and healing, says salas. Body temp affects sleep: a 2004 study found that for sleep to \" initiate normally, \" core body temp matters. Per a",

Viewers learn that \" tillman was never accurately portrayed, not by politicians nor the media, neither in life nor in death, \" claudia puig writes at usa today. Director amir bar-lev \" paints a moving portrait of tillman, mostly through the insightful comments of his family and fellow soldiers, who collectively struggled to find and reveal the truth. \" this \" morally incisive \" documentary \" unravels the deceptions — and the deep dishonor — that inflated life-size valor into fake superheroism, \" writes owen gleiberman at entertainment weekly. The tillman story offers \" a sobering look at how governments operate in wartime, putting a shiny spin on even the grimmest of tragedies, \" christopher kelly writes at the dallas morning news. It deserves to be seen, he writes, though its standard mix of stock footage and talking heads might make it better suited for the small screen. Michael moore has endorsed this documentary but that's no reason to avoid it, argues gary thompson at the philadelphia daily news. The movie \" probably inflates military incompetence, opportunism, and butt-covering into a sinister conspiracy, \" he writes \" but it also stands as a valuable piece of biography \" that sheds light on tillman's fascinating life and \" ferociously independent \" character.",

A film like chloe invites two questions, according to carrie rickey at the philadelphia inquirer. \" is it erotic? yes. Is it good? yes, until it devolves into third-act pretentiousness and preposterousness. \" director atom egoyan aimed to make a thought-provoking psychosexual thriller but the results are \" just puzzling, little more than a messy affair with mood lighting, sexy lingerie, heavy breathing and swelling, um, music, \" writes betsy sharkey at the los angeles times. Mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle found chloe \" profound and satisfying. \" egoyan and screenwriter erin cressida wilson have pulled off the remarkable task of making an erotic movie that's far better than the french original, he writes.

So, from a strictly prurient level, you probably need to pay some attention to chloe. Luckily, the rest of the movie is pretty good, too. Loosely based on anne fontaine's french language film nathalie..., chloe tells the tale of a woman ( moore ) who sicks an irresistible call girl ( seyfried ) after her husband ( liam neeson ) to confirm suspicions of philandering. Whereas the original version stews mostly in a miasma of desire and regret, this version amps up the thriller",

She makes sense of motivations and of the characters ' personalities and relationships. The result is a remake that's an improvement over the original, and an english-speaking women's film that, for once, beats the french at the genre they do best.

Australian researchers are reporting in the journal nutrients that a diet high in fat appears to increase daytime sleepiness, as well as poorer sleep quality at night. After electronically monitoring 1,800 men between the ages of 35 and 80 for obstructive sleep apnea and reviewing sleep and food questionnaires, university of adelaide researchers found that even after adjusting for several factors known to affect sleep — including depression, medications, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and waistline — the men in the top quarter of fat intake were 78 % more likely to report daytime sleepiness and nearly three times as likely to have apnea compared to men in the bottom quarter. \" poor sleep and feeling sleepy during the day means you have less energy, but this in turn is known to increase people's cravings for high-fat, high-carbohydrate foods, which is then associated with poor sleep outcomes, \" says study author yingting cao. \" the poor diet-and-sleep pattern can become a vicious cycle. \" she goes on to tell the new york times that the timing of the meal itself could be a mechanism, but the team didn't ask for that information. The researchers do not report whether they distinguished between types of fat — i.e. Lots of bacon and burgers versus salmon and avocado — and did not study the impact on women, but they did find that the link between one's fat intake and sleep apnea was strongest in participants with the highest body mass.

Michigan factory worker geraldine doyle, who died in 2010, was long thought to have been the woman in a bandanna working at an industrial lathe in a photo that inspired artist j. Howard miller. But after years of sleuthing, scholar james kimble discovered that the photo was actually of fraley, then 20 years old, working at a turret lathe in the machine shop of the naval air station in alameda, calif., in 1942, soon after the japanese attack on pearl harbor, the new york times reports. \" pretty naomi parker looks like she might catch her nose in the turret lathe she is operating, \" says the original caption of the photo obtained from a vintage dealer by kimble, who stresses that doyle made an honest mistake when she thought she recognized herself in the photo, which can be seen here. Fraley worked at the plant with her younger sister, patching airplane wings, drilling — and riveting. Fraley, who kept the photo after the war and was shocked to see somebody else's name on the displayed image when she visited the rosie the riveter/world war ii home front national historical park for a reunion of war workers in 2011, told people in 2016 that she didn't care about fame, but that she was glad to have the record set straight. \" the women of this country these days need some icons.

            "Distributed by the acme photo agency, the photograph showed a young woman, her hair in a polka-dot bandanna, at an industrial lathe. It was published widely in the spring and summer of 1942, though rarely with a caption identifying the woman or the factory. In 1984, mrs. Doyle saw a reprint of that photo in modern maturity magazine. She thought it resembled her younger self. Ten years later, she came across the miller poster, featured on the march 1994 cover of smithsonian magazine. That image, she thought, resembled the woman at the lathe — and therefore resembled her. By the end of the 1990s, the news media was identifying mrs. Doyle as the inspiration for mr. Miller's rosie. There the matter would very likely have rested, had it not been for dr. Kimble's curiosity. It was not mrs. Doyle's claim per se that he found suspect: as he emphasized in the times interview, she had made it in good faith. What nettled him was the news media's unquestioning reiteration of that claim. He embarked on a six-year odyssey to identify the woman at the lathe, and to determine whether that image had influenced mr. Miller's poster.

Authorities say a shocking 83 % of federal parkland in the santa monica mountains was burned in the fire, including the set of m*a*s*h and the reagan ranch, reports the los angeles times, which describes the area as a \" cherished open space \" for southern californians. The fire is now around 40 % contained and people have started to return to some communities, including parts of malibu, that had been under evacuation orders, the ap reports. After more than a week, the fire has destroyed at least 435 structures, burned 152 square miles, and caused the deaths of at least two people. In northern california, meanwhile, the death toll from the camp fire — already the deadliest single wildfire in california history — has risen to 48, authorities said late tuesday. The fire is now 35 % contained. More than 8,000 structures have been destroyed and more than 50,000 people have been unable to return home. Among the tales of survival that have emerged is that of a group that fled into the chilly waters of the concow reservoir as fire surrounded their homes, the san francisco chronicle reports. Scott, who asked to be identified only by his first name, says the group included his 90-year-old neighbor bruno, who was treated for hypothermia after surviving the ordeal. \" bruno was saying, ' just leave me. I can't do this, ' \" scott recalled. \" i said, 'bruno, we're not going to leave you. And i ' m not going to burn, so you better hurry.

            "Image copyright reuters image caption cult leader asahara was executed earlier this month japan has executed the remaining members of a cult behind the deadly 1995 sarin attack on the tokyo subway. The six men were the last members of the aum shinrikyo cult on death row, and were executed on thursday, the justice ministry said. Seven others responsible for the attack, including leader shoko asahara, were put to death earlier this month. The sarin attack, japan's worst terror incident, killed 13 people and injured thousands more. The cult was accused of several other murders and an earlier sarin gas attack in 1994 which killed eight and left 600 injured. \" the pain and anguish of the people who were killed and their families as well as of the survivors left with disabilities, was unimaginable, \" said justice minister yoko kamikawa at a news conference. Those put to death on thursday included a key aum shinrikyo recruiter and cult members who released the nerve gas in train carriages, reported japanese broadcaster nhk. The execution of all 12 cult members involved in the attack as well as asahara had been postponed until their final appeals were completed, which happened in january.

The new date is significant because the first modern humans — the homo genus — didn't arrive until 2.8 million years ago, meaning these tools would have been used by our ancient predecessors, like the famed lucy. Their use of tools has never been proven. The work hasn't been published yet, but a stony brook archaeologist on the team presented the findings at the paleoanthropology society meeting in san francisco this week. \" the obvious implication is that stone tools were invented and used by multiple lineages of early hominins, \" university of wisconsin anthropologist john hawks, who wasn't part of the research, writes at his blog. Previous researchers have speculated as much after the discovery in 2010 of what looked like marks made by tools on animal bones, specimens dated to the same era that were found in ethiopia. But skepticism overshadowed the theory because no tools were found. The new research may have uncovered them — stones that were \" knapped, \" or deliberately chipped, along with anvils, reports phys.org. The next step will likely be to see if cuttings on the bones found in 2010 are a match, the site notes. ( another discovery of late: the skeleton of a camel found in 17th-century trash. )",

So, as the snow from this weekend's blizzard melts into memory, will the east coast have a whole new class of tiny shovelers in nine months'time? fortunately, science has a more authoritative answer, reports npr, which talked to brigham young economist richard evans, whose claim to fame is 2008 research on the subject. What he found was, basically, yes: \" with low-level, low-severity storm advisories, we actually found an uptick in births nine months later. So, it was about a 2 % increase with tropical storm watches. \" but the key there is \" low-severity. \" continues evans: \" with the most severe storm warnings... You get almost an equal decrease in births nine months later. And the story there is if you're running for your life, you can't make babies. \" but since east coast residents weren't running for their lives, and mostly hunkered down, evans thinks we should see a spike in the birth rate. Fox news points to another, more modern indicator: hook-up apps like tinder tend to see a flurry of activity among those looking for some weather-related love, and that was indeed the case this time, notes the daily dot. An earlier 1970 study, however, found no link, notes nj.com, with the author concluding thusly: \" it is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobilizing event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation. \" ( timing's a little off: summer babies tend to become healthier adults. )",

        "summary": "The new york times is out with a report alleging that facebook improperly let other companies have access to users ' personal information — and even their friends ' information. Facebook has quickly pushed back against the allegations. The times says that facebook set up data-sharing agreements with at least 60 device-makers such as apple, blackberry, amazon, microsoft, and samsung over the last 10 years. The deals were arranged before facebook apps were as widely available as they are today, and most remain in effect, though the story quotes one former facebook employee who says the issue \" was flagged internally as a privacy issue \" back in 2012. The newspaper asserts that the deals might violate facebook's consent decree with the ftc: key paragraph: \" facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users ' friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users ' friends who believed they had barred any sharing. \" friends of friends: on the above point, the story says that one reporter discovered that the blackberry hub gleaned private data, including political leanings and events they planned to attend, from 556 of his friends. It then could access info on 294,258 friends of his friends. Facebook's defense: in a detailed blog post, the company said these deals have been closely controlled, and \" we are not aware of any abuse by these companies. \" plus, these application programming interfaces, or apis, are no longer as necessary today and thus \" we're winding down access to them. \" trouble? engadget notes that the story has caught the attention of democratic congressman and privacy advocate david cicilline of rhode island. \" sure looks like zuckerberg lied to congress about whether users have ' complete control ' over who sees our data on facebook, \" he tweeted. \" this needs to be investigated and the people responsible need to be held accountable. \"",

Taylor described how pistorius kept a gun on his bedside table as he slept, or next to his prosthetic legs on the floor, in a room that was \" very dark. \" she says he woke her several times over the course of their relationship fearing an intruder; one time, he checked around the house with his gun, she said, per the telegraph, which noted the defense seemed to make the point that though he woke taylor if he feared a break-in, he apparently didn't react the same way with steenkamp. Taylor also noted she saw pistorius angry on occasion, and he screamed at her a few times. As to what that sounded like? \" he sounds like a man, \" she said, via a second correspondent, seemingly disputing pistorius ' lawyer's theory that female-sounding screams heard before steenkamp's death came from the athlete himself. Also mentioned was a shooting incident when pistorius and a male friend were pulled over by police with taylor in the backseat. Pistorius, who had his gun on the front seat, was angered when the officer unloaded it and pistorius said he wasn't allowed to touch it, the telegraph reports. Later, the two friends fired a shot out of the car's sunroof, \" to irritate the police, \" taylor said. \" they fired the shot and then they laughed. \" pistorius was again seen covering his ears during testimony today — but there was no gagging.",

That's left room for smaller brands like lacroix to enjoy huge success with sparkling water. Lacroix sales have jumped 45 % since last year to an estimated $ 175 million, reports bloomberg. Sales of other fizzy waters like perrier and san pellegrino have also spiked recently, while sparkling ice sales jumped from $ 27 million in 2010 to $ 550 million last year, the washington post reported. But big brands like coke and pepsi aren't having as much success. Whereas the market share for lacroix maker, national beverage — the fourth-largest soda maker in north america — rose 67 % from 2010 to 2014, coke and pepsi's market shares fell 4 % and 5.5 %, respectively. Why are people attracted to a neon can that looks like it came straight out of the 1980s? a major advantage is that it avoids corporate associations, notes bloomberg. Then there are the flavors — 12 in total including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse ( grapefruit ), per grist — which have attracted a kind of indie cult following. National beverage says the flavors are based on a secret brew of \" natural essence. \" but for one young consumer, who used lacroix to help kick his energy drink and soda habit, \" it's less about the taste \" and \" more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing and it can replace soda. \" lacroix — which got a \" letter of recommendation \" in the new york times magazine in march — is certainly marketing itself as a soda alternative.

The incident took place at a city market grocery in rifle, where fabiola velasquez and isabel marin, both from mexico, were doing some shopping monday — uneventful until they were stopped by fellow shopper linda dwire, who'd overheard them speaking spanish, the first two women tell buzzfeed. Dwire went off on them, they say, telling them to learn english if they like america, with velasquez adding that dwire then started getting aggressive and putting her hand in velasquez's face. That's when kamira trent, who was shopping in the same aisle, says she saw what was going on and stepped in to defend marin and velasquez. A video on velasquez's facebook page now shared more than 16,000 times shows part of the screaming match between trent and dwire. Trent yells: \" i ' m calling the cops. You leave these women alone! get out! \" dwire retorts, \" you will lose your country \" and starts to walk away, with trent close behind. Trent did call the police, leading to dwire's arrest on charges of bias-motivated harassment; she's due back in court next month. Dwire, who says she's confronted people not speaking english before, tells buzzfeed her rant wasn't racist but a \" patriotic thing \" and that she doesn't mind immigrants coming here \" as long as they want to be an american. \" meanwhile, velasquez says, \" it felt good to see someone who was born here defend us that way. \" trent's advice for others in similar situations: \" stand up and say something. \" ( this man ranted against spanish speakers in nyc. )",

In destiny and power: the american odyssey of george herbert walker bush, the senior bush tells biographer jon meacham that the \" iron-ass \" cheney who emerged after 9/11 was very different from the man who served as his defense secretary, reports the new york times. But while cheney was a \" good man, \" bush says in the book, rumsfeld \" was an arrogant fellow \" who \" served the president badly. \" he, too, gets the memorable label: \" i don't like what he did, and i think it hurt the president having his iron-ass view of everything, \" bush says. Bush 41 says cheney may have been influenced by his own wife and daughter's hard-line views, and he adds it was a big mistake for his son to have let cheney \" bring in kind of his own state department. \" in the book, he also criticizes some of his son's rhetoric, including \" axis of evil, \" but says, \" he's my son, he did his best, and i ' m for him, \" the times notes. Cheney tells fox news that despite the criticism, he's enjoying the book, and since 9/11 was \" worse than pearl harbor, \" he considers the \" iron-ass \" label a compliment. The book, which will be released next week, also reveals that donald trump sought to become bush 41's vice president in 1988, and that jeb bush — who's currently trying to become bush 45 — urged his father to ditch dan quayle in 1992, the times reports.",

And according to bloomberg, a number of the 100 ceos with the largest retirement accounts head companies that have cut retirement benefits for employees. Cnbc reports those 100 ceos will average a monthly check of $ 277,686 in retirement. Meanwhile only 18 % of private-sector employees even have access to a pension plan. According to bloomberg, the ceo of yum! brands has the cushiest nest egg with $ 234.2 million in retirement savings. That's 3,300 times larger than the 401( k ) of one of his employees — if they even have one ( just a fraction do, per regulatory filings ). Many of these ceo retirement accounts are so large because they're allowed to defer an unlimited amount of their salary tax-free. But regular employees are capped at around $ 20,000 per year into their 401( k ) s. \" these benefits weren't originally intended to be huge wealth generators, but they've become that as ceo compensation has grown to 200 to 300 times what average workers make, \" one expert tells bloomberg. \" they're harder to justify as companies have abandoned worker pensions. \"",

            "Much of the executives'retirement assets are indeed in the form of elective deferred compensation — compensation they have chosen to delay receiving until retirement. Money in these accounts is allowed to grow tax free until retirement ( or until they are paid out ), just like assets in a 401( k ), but there is no limit on how much a senior executive can choose to defer. Peter neuwirth, a senior consultant and senior actuary with towers watson, said these plans enable highly compensated executives to put away a share of their pay just like rank-and-file employees using 401( k ) plans. If they had to use 401( k ) plans, the annual cap on 401( k ) contributions, currently $ 24,000 for employees nearing retirement and $ 18,000 for those under 50, would likely represent a much smaller share or their earnings.

Reuters reports that the british delegation at the global chemical weapons watchdog opcw said thursday samples from khan sheikhun tested positive for sarin gas. As for the us airstrike in response, assad insists his forces are still as strong as ever: \" our firepower, our ability to attack the terrorists hasn't been affected by this strike. \" cnn notes the restrictions placed on the afp interview, most notably that it was filmed by the syrian government, not afp, and footage of only the first five questions was handed over to afp. Meanwhile, russia says the us broke international law with the strike, but president trump reaffirmed wednesday that he has \" absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. \" during an appearance in washington with nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg, trump also said that he hopes russia didn't know about the alleged chemical weapons attack in advance, \" but certainly they could have.

But the category of identical twins includes several variations, which affect whether or not your twins can hold hands before they're born. Most identical twins each have their own placenta and grow within their own amniotic sac. Identical twins who grow within a single amniotic sac, called monoamniotic twins, are the only ones who can hold hands. Monoamniotic twins are rare; fewer than 1 percent of all identical twins grow in the same amniotic sac, according to the lucile packard children's hospital."

Fxx, fx's new comedy-only spin-off network, is owned by the same company as fox ( which airs the simpsons ), and 20th century fox ( which produces it ), the new york times points out. It's therefore something of a corporate win-win, though fxx got the rights only after what deadline calls a \" competitive situation \" involving five networks.

Phil gingrey, who is finding himself under fire following a meeting of congressional republicans yesterday. On the table was the ruling that allows federal lawmakers and their staffers to get a health insurance subsidy for use in the exchange markets. Gingrey wants to see the subsidy gone ( he considers it special treatment ), while others argued that dropping it would create a financial burden for themselves and their aides. The lines getting all the attention, as first reported by the national review: capitol hill aides \" may be 33 years old now and not making a lot of money. But in a few years they can just go to k street [ ie, become a lobbyist ] and make $ 500,000 a year. Meanwhile, i ' m stuck here making $ 172,000 a year. \" at slate, matthew yglesias writes that \" the world's tiniest violin is playing \" for gingrey, who, yglesias points out, is making just a smidge over the median us household income of $ 51,017, and will enjoy a full pension once he stops working. And yglesias ' figure is kind; abc news points out that the median household income in georgia is even lower, at $ 49,736; also, members of congress make $ 174,000, not $ 172,000. Abc news reports gingrey is gunning for a senate seat, as is fellow georgia republican rep. Paul broun. Broun had this to say: \" while most americans are struggling to make ends meet and battling higher health care costs, it's disappointing that congressman gingrey, whose reported net worth exceeds $ 3 million, complains about being 'stuck here [ in congress ]. \" he had at least one defender, though. Erick erickson tweeted, \" good for rep. Phil gingrey telling congressmen and staffers to suck it up. \" and writing for the washington post, aaron blake reminds us that this is hardly the first such \" oops. \" he gives a few examples, like when rep.

        "summary": "The call of the wild is getting harder to hear. Peaceful natural sounds — bird songs, rushing rivers, rustling grass — are being drowned out by noise from people in many of america's protected parks and wilderness areas, a new study in the journal science finds. Scientists measured sound levels in 492 places, from city parks to remote federal wilderness, the ap reports. They calculated that in nearly two-thirds of the lower 48's parks, the noise can at times be twice the natural background level because of airplanes, cars, logging, mining, and oil and gas drilling. That increase can harm wildlife, making it harder for them to find food or mates, and make it more difficult for people to hear those natural sounds, the researchers say. In about one in five public lands, there has been a tenfold increase in noise pollution, per the study. Except for city parks, though, the researchers — including a national park service unit — didn't find sound levels people would consider unusually loud ( think changing from the quiet of a rural area to a still pretty-silent library ) — but that difference masks crucial sounds, especially to birds seeking mates and animals trying to hunt.

        "summary": "In 2010, michigan's upper peninsula recorded its first-ever earthquake when a large crack opened in the ground near the city of menominee, according to a press release from michigan technological university. Now researchers finally know what caused the mysterious menominee crack. Sort of. Live science reports the crack — 360 feet long and 5 feet deep — showed up accompanied by a \" deep boom \" and the rattling of nearby homes. The earthquake that occurred along with it it measured less than a magnitude 1. For years, no one was sure what to make of the crack, which appeared atop a large limestone ridge. That area of michigan is considered \" aseismic, \" and there is no earthquake fault under the crack. Besides, any earthquake large enough to cause the crack would have done more than shake a few homes. Researchers now believe the crack is a geological feature known as a \" pop-up, \" according to a study published this week in seismological research letters. Basically, the bedrock limestone \" violently heaved upward, \" creating the bulge and a resulting crack as the surface stretched, live science explains. But that opens up an entirely new mystery. Pop-ups are caused when a large amount of downward pressure on the rock layer below the soil is suddenly lessened. So far, they've only been found at the bases of quarries and areas where glaciers have recently receded. But there are no quarries near the menominee crack, and michigan hasn't seen a glacier in more than 11,000 years. \" as far as we can tell, this is a one-of-a-kind event, \" research leader wayne pennington says in the press release. \" the earth is still full of surprises, \" he tells live science. \" it's just a little surprise, but it's still interesting. \" ( a 30-year-old mystery was also recently solved. )",

With a total of 367 delegates at stake, delegates will be awarded proportionately in north carolina, while missouri awards delegates by district and illinois uses a similar system. A roundup of coverage: the new york times looks at the role of ohio, which is likely to be crucial to both the republican and democratic contests. The state gop is firmly behind gov. John kasich, who is in a tight race with trump and has said he will end his campaign if he doesn't carry the state. Cnn reports that anti-trump groups, including a pac led by jeb bush staffers, are hitting him hard with attack ads. One cable ad features women reading trump insults like \" bimbo \" and \" fat pig. \" fivethirtyeight crunches the numbers and finds that kasich is the favorite to win ohio, while trump is the favorite in other states, including florida, where marco rubio is given just a 4 % chance of winning his home state — and of having a reason to continue his campaign. The wall street journal was present for some last-minute campaigning in which trump spoke of knockout wins. \" if we win ohio and if we win florida, then everybody agrees, every one of these guys, that it's pretty much over, \" he told supporters at a rally in tampa at which he was joined by sarah palin, who denounced the \" petty, punk-ass little thuggery \" of trump protesters. Ted cruz, meanwhile, was reaching out to kasich and rubio supporters in the belief that it will be a two-man race between him and trump by wednesday. Politico looks at the senator's state-by-state plan. The washington post looks at whether the \" political free-for-all of an old-school contested convention \" is a real possibility this year. Ben carson, who has endorsed trump, warned against a contested convention monday night, saying a fractured gop would be sure to lose both the presidency and the senate if that happens, the hill reports.

In what cnn describes as a \" marathon meeting \" that took place monday into tuesday, the anc's executive panel opted to \" recall \" ( a polite way of saying \" make resign \" ) the 75-year-old zuma, who has been mired in corruption charges and overseen an economic decline in the country since he was elected to the presidency in 2009. The recall decision came after zuma's talks with anc chief cyril ramaphosa deteriorated over the past few days. However, zuma reportedly has asked for between three to six months as a transition period, which the anc is said to have refused. Quartz notes zuma is no stranger to facing opposition, though he has so far managed to rebuff any attempts to push him out ( hence the \" teflon president \" honors ). That may not last, though, with what may come next being deemed a \" nightmare option \": a no-confidence motion in parliament against zuma if he doesn't resign within the next 48 hours, per reports ( the anc hasn't confirmed a timeline ). Ramaphosa is likely to become president if and when that happens — if zuma resigns, he automatically gets the post; if a no-confidence vote happens, the anc-majority parliament would likely pick him. That vote was originally scheduled for feb. 22, but opposition pols may be trying to move that date up. An anc press conference has been announced for tuesday afternoon.

And stabler certainly felt the effects, which came on quickly in his last years: he became super-sensitive to noise and light, lost his sense of direction, and started repeating himself. \" on some days, when he wasn't feeling extremely bad, things were kind of normal, \" his partner, kim bush, tells the times. \" but on other days it was intense.

Going public was the \" only way \" to \" change the system \" that takes advantage of clients, he tells 60 minutes. \" the quickest way to make money on wall street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client, \" he says. He wasn't seeking \" destruction \" in the piece, he says; instead, he writes, he was concerned about the company he loved. Smith tells the ap his goal is to educate those who know little about the financial world. \" if people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless, \" he says. What others are saying about the book: though goldman finds \" no evidence whatsoever to support \" smith's claims, the book could have \" a long-term effect on the firm \" when it comes to hiring — if people believe smith, writes susanne craig in the new york times. Times reviewer james stewart isn't convinced, noting that the book \" fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions. \" the book may have been marketed well, but it doesn't contain much in the way of \" bombshell revelations, \" writes lauren lacapra at reuters. Reviewers haven't been impressed, with some suggesting it's a \" misleading \" read. Indeed, between interviews and the book, smith seems to contradict himself on clients'sophistication, notes nathan vardi at forbes. He tells the story, for instance, of a major client who noted that even though he didn't trust goldman, he'd continue working with the firm.",

Two men reportedly crashed a car through the entrance to air products ' premises in saint-quentin-fallavier and hit gas containers that began exploding, reports reuters and the ap. One attacker also set off explosive devices inside the factory, the afp reports, per the local. Newspaper le dauphine reports a man's decapitated head was found stuck on a fence near the entrance of the site. President francois hollande confirmed that \" inscriptions [ were ] written \" on the body; other reports describe it as arabic writing found on the head. A flag with islamist descriptions was reportedly found near the body. Police say one of the alleged attackers, identified by the guardian as yassine sali ( also given as salhi ), 35, is in custody. France's interior minister bernard cazeneuve says he was under investigation for radicalization from 2006 to 2008 over possible ties to a salifist group. The second suspect was killed by a firefighter \" who had a lot of courage and kept his cool, \" cazeneuve says. Le dauphine reports a third man, allegedly seen driving back and forth in front of the factory before the attack, has been arrested at his home. France's anti-terror prosecutor says simply that the attack was led by \" a terrorist group \" and an investigation is now underway. The guardian has more on pennsylvania-based air products, which has 20,000 employees in 50 countries and provides gases and chemicals that factor into products that run the gamut from tvs to sneakers.",

Garland \" proves himself once again to be one of science fiction's most exciting, visionary talents \" with a \" beautiful, riveting sci-fi mystery \" you ' ll be dissecting afterward, writes adam graham at detroit news. There's action, but annihilation is \" slow and deliberately paced, \" making for \" an emotional and mental tightrope, and portman navigates it perfectly, \" graham writes. She is \" unnervingly good. \" the film \" is, literally and figuratively, all over the place, \" but \" garland's goal isn't clarity: it's allusiveness, and a style of entertainment that swings freely between adventure, some of it silly, and serious mystery. \" he achieves it in a \" daringly original \" and \" unrestrainedly enjoyable \" film that's \" a shimmering treat from a singular intelligence, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. This one will make you \" think, and feel. \" it's \" astonishing, \" the \" kind of film that leaves you dazzled, shellshocked, \" writes leah greenblatt at entertainment weekly. \" the dialogue can be stilted and sometimes hokey, in that particularly sci-fi way; characters aren't so much developed as sketched for utility, \" she writes. \" but the overall effect is extraordinary: a lavish, magnificently unnerving visual feast threaded through with well-earned jump scares and real metaphysical force. \"",

The 49.2 % turnout rivaled that of some presidential elections, including 1996, when 51.7 % of eligible adults voted, and was a huge increase from the 72-year-low of 37 % in the 2014 midterms. Washington state had the highest turnout, at 69.4 %, while turnout in texas rose from 28.3 % to 46.1 %. Some 25 states had turnout higher than 50 %.

Preliminary figures for nationwide turnout in the 2018 mid-term elections are in, and they've reached a mark not seen in more than a century. Across the us, 49.2 % of the voting age public cast ballots. In 2014 that number was 37 %, and the average over the last few decades has hovered around 40 %. The last time turnout for a mid-term topped 50 % was 1914 - before women had the vote in the us. In some states, the numbers were even higher. Washington and colorado, which heavily utilise voting by mail, topped the list at 69.4 % and 65.5 %, respectively. Minnesota, always a high-participation state, came in at 64.3 % this year. Even states with lower 2018 turnout saw sharp increases over recent mid-terms. In texas enthusiasm generated by democrat beto o ' rourke ( who was narrowly defeated ) helped boost turnout to 46.1 %, compared to 28.3 % in 2014. Georgia, which had a contentious governor race, saw an increase from 38.6 % to 55 %. In california, where several prominent republican congressional incumbents have been unseated, turnout",

Elections project, 49.2 % of the eligible voting population — just shy of 116 million people — voted on nov. 6, the highest recorded rate for a midterm election since 1914. On average, 40 % of eligible voters actually vote in non-presidential elections. That number was even lower in 2014, when just 36.4 % voted — the lowest in 70 years. Democrats perhaps unsurprisingly outpaced republicans in terms of turnout, with 51.7 million democrats casting votes compared to 47.4 million republicans. While those numbers are higher overall than the turnout seen in 2014 — 39.8 million republicans and 35.4 million democrats — the starkest change is seen in the rate at which members of the two parties voted with a democratic president in 2014 versus a republican in 2018. On a state-by-state level, 25 states exceeded 50 % turnout according to the elections project, with colorado, minnesota, montana, oregon, and wisconsin all surpassing 60 %. Twenty-three states had double-digit percentage-point increases compared to the 1982-2014 midterm election average. The lowest turnout was seen in hawaii, with 39.3 % of eligible voters casting ballots. The biggest uptick in voter turnout was seen in georgia, where the closely-watched gubernatorial race between stacey abrams and brian kemp has yet to be called. This year"

It's being touted as one of the most difficult and expensive maritime salvage efforts to be attempted, and the bbc reports that the initial hours of the operation have returned progress. Officials say that after about three hours and the application of 6,000 tons of force, undersea cameras show the ship has been raised off the rocks it was resting on and moved onto a platform. The guardian describes parbuckling as a \" common means of salvaging wrecked vessels \": a system of pulleys, counterweights, and huge chains ( see more photos here ) are being used to gently right the ship; a 500-member team and more than 30,000 tons of steel have been employed in the salvage effort. Engineers yesterday got the go-ahead to begin the effort, which started three hours late, at 9am local time, due to an early morning storm. The salvage effort is expected to take eight to 12 hours. The ap reports that the uss oklahoma was parbuckled in 1943 after the japanese attack on pearl harbor ( the guardian calls that effort the biggest such effort to date ). That ship was about 584 feet long; the costa concordia is a hair over 950 feet in length. A second hope for the effort beyond the successful raising of the ship: that two of the still-missing bodies will be located; the guardian notes they could be stuck beneath the ship, but the ap reports that the cameras being used today have yet to spot them.",

But in a lawsuit filed tuesday, frankie's family claims the body found outside the verizon store didn't belong to dickens, either. The suit states that reports from police and fire departments, as well as statements from verizon employees, describe the body of a man about 65 years old and 250 pounds with long, dark hair. Frankie and dickens are approximately 170 pounds, and frankie has short, light hair. The suit, which seeks $ 5 million in damages, claims officials released dickens ' body because it looked enough like frankie and \" no one would care because the deceased were homeless. \" the reason for the initial mix-up is unknown, as is the identity of the possible third body.",

            "Santa ana — the already bizarre story of a homeless man who was misidentified as a dead transient, only to surprise his family by showing up very much alive, has taken another twist — a third body might be involved. A lawsuit filed tuesday accuses orange county coroner officials of misidentifying a body found last year outside a verizon store in fountain valley, and says they knowingly released the wrong body to a funeral home to conceal a mistaken identity blunder involving frankie m. Kerrigan. The suit, which seeks $ 5 million in damages, contends that fountain valley fire and police department reports gave descriptions of a body that looked nothing like kerrigan, and that coroner officials ignored that description when they told kerrigan's relatives that he was dead. The complaint also accuses the coroner's office of knowingly passing off another corpse to kerrigan's family, hoping no one would notice. Officials with the orange county sheriff's department, which runs the coroners office, declined to comment, noting they do not discuss pending litigation. In june, after the mix-up was revealed — and when kerrigan turned out to be alive — the county exhumed a body that was identified as john dickens, 54, of kansas. Dickens ' body was cremated and his ashes shipped to his family. The orange county coroner's office has said dickens was identified through fingerprints.

        "summary": "Electric carmaker tesla is talking with google about developing an \" autopilot \" system for its cars, reports bloomberg. Google, of course, has been testing \" self-driving \" cars for a few years, though tesla chief elon musk dislikes the term. \" self-driving sounds like it's going to do something you don't want it to do, \" he says. \" autopilot is a good thing to have in planes, and we should have it in cars. \" much work lies ahead, though. Musk thinks google's current approach of using a roof-mounted laser system is too expensive, and he envisions a cheaper system that combines cameras and software. At the same time, tesla is working on bringing down the price of its expensive cars, and it hopes to more than halve the cost of its model s sedan to $ 30,000 in the coming years. Estimates on when autonomous cars will be ready for the road range from five years ( google ) to 10 years ( nissan ) to a \" long way off \" ( us government ). Google has another driving-related issue on its hands, notes the new york times: lawmakers around the country are worried that drivers using google glass will be a menace to the road.",

            "San francisco — google's wearable computer, the most anticipated piece of electronic wizardry since the ipad and iphone, will not go on sale for many months. But the resistance is already under way. The glasseslike device, which allows users to access the internet, take photos and film short snippets, has been pre-emptively banned by a seattle bar. Large parts of las vegas will not welcome wearers. West virginia legislators tried to make it illegal to use the gadget, known as google glass, while driving. \"this is just the beginning, \" said timothy toohey, a los angeles lawyer specializing in privacy issues. \"google glass is going to cause quite a brawl. \" as personal technology becomes increasingly nimble and invisible, glass is prompting questions of whether it will distract drivers, upend relationships and strip people of what little privacy they still have in public. A pair of lens-less frames with a tiny computer attached to the right earpiece, glass is promoted by google as \"seamless and empowering. \" it will have the ability to capture any chance encounter, from a celebrity sighting to a grumpy salesclerk, and broadcast it to millions in seconds. \"we are all now going to be both the paparazzi and the paparazzi's target, \" said karen l.
