Court and university records show that the mad men star was accused of taking part in a hazing so violent that the victim left school, three other frat members went to jail, and the university of texas at austin chapter of sigma nu was disbanded. Court documents state that in november 1990, pledge mark sanders said he was beaten, led around a room with the claw of a hammer hooked under his genitals after failing to memorize details about hamm and other frat members. Sanders, who needed medical care after the incident, said the \" really mad \" hamm, who was 20 years old at the time, hit him \" square over \" the kidney with a paddle and set his underwear on fire, forcing him to blow out the fire instead of putting it out with his hand, according to documents seen by the star. According to the ap, a charge of assault against hamm was dismissed, but he received \" deferred adjudication \" on a hazing charge, completing probation while never being officially convicted. University records show hamm left college in his sophomore year at the end of the same semester as the hazing. ( last month, hamm completed a 30-day alcohol rehab program. )",

His company's share price surged $ 9 billion after its purchase of middle eastern e-commerce site souq, adding $ 1.5 billion to bezos ' personal wealth, enough to have paid for his purchase of the washington post six times over, cnn reports. According to bloomberg's billionaires list, bezos is now worth $ 75.6 billion, second only to bill gates, who is worth an estimated $ 86 billion. The stock bump shifted bezos up from fourth place on the list, knocking investor warren buffett and spanish fashion tycoon amancio ortega down a notch. Bezos has now added more than $ 10 billion to his net worth this year, and wednesday was a good day for him in more ways than one, gizmodo reports. Amazon announced that it was shutting down quidsi, which operates sites including diapers.com. It bought the firm for $ 545 million in 2010 after a price war — and a feud with founder marc lore. Lore went on to found \" amazon killer \" jet.com, and now runs e-commerce operations for walmart, which bought jet.com last year.

They spent hours over two nights partying with prostitutes at a thai beach resort in pattaya, known for its sex industry, say authorities. One of the prostitutes has been brought in to identify the men in bangkok, where they're being held, reports msnbc. The hookers took a cell-phone snap of the hard-partying muslims that has been published in the bangkok post. Nothing triggered the prostitutes'suspicions except when they were ordered away from a closet in the men's hotel room. The bomb plot was discovered when one of the suspects accidentally blew off his leg in an explosion in a house he was renting. Iran has denied any links to bomb plots against or other attacks on israelis, whom they have accused of assassinating iranian nuclear scientists. An israeli diplomat's wife and driver were injured early this week when a bomb tore through a diplomatic vehicle in new delhi. Thai authorities said the detained iranians planned to use \" sticky \" bombs that can be magnetically attached to vehicles, the kind that was used in new delhi.

Psychologists and experts on presidential personalities have put together a list of the presidents who had the most \" grandiose narcissism \" — which, the houston chronicle explains, is characterized by a showy and extroverted personality. That's in contrast to \" vulnerable narcissism, \" which involves being more sensitive. More than 100 authorities on various presidents assessed the leaders'traits; to judge a president's success, researchers referred to surveys of historians, futurity reports. Our most grandiosely narcissistic president? one lyndon baines johnson, the study finds. Runners-up were theodore roosevelt, andrew jackson, franklin roosevelt, and john f. Kennedy. Grandiose narcissism is associated with \" overall greatness, \" says the study, published in psychological science. It's also linked to being persuasive, good at handling crises, and taking charge of the agenda. Unfortunately, those presidents with the most grandiose narcissism were also prime candidates for impeachment and had questionable ethics. \" it's interesting to me that these are memorable presidents, ones that we tend to talk about and learn about in history classes, \" a researcher says. \" only rarely, however, do we talk about most of those who had low ratings for grandiose narcissism, like zachary taylor and millard fillmore. \"",

            "As they attempt to sound distressed over jamal khashoggi's murder, western governments are understandably being less than candid about their records of facilitating saudi violence at home and regionally. French president emmanuel macron has been among the worst culprits, recently claiming that it was false to say saudi arabia is a major client of the french arms industry. Macron's defence minister, however, told lawmakers those arms sales were crucial for french jobs. France is the world's third-largest weapons dealer, with exports rising considerably during the past decade. Saudi arabia was its second-largest customer in that period. With his background in banking, macron can surely calculate that there is big money involved: saudi arabia bought more than € 11 billion ( $ 12bn ) in french arms between 2008 and 2017. Audacious spin since becoming president last year, macron has acted as something of an image consultant to saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman. When the crown prince visited paris in",

It is unclear what the subject of the snatched and only partly audible conversation is, but it sounds like macron replies to the crown prince's assurances: ' i do worry. I am worried... I told you.

            "As they attempt to sound distressed over jamal khashoggi's murder, western governments are understandably being less than candid about their records of facilitating saudi violence at home and regionally. French president emmanuel macron has been among the worst culprits, recently claiming that it was false to say saudi arabia is a major client of the french arms industry. Macron's defence minister, however, told lawmakers those arms sales were crucial for french jobs. France is the world's third-largest weapons dealer, with exports rising considerably during the past decade. Saudi arabia was its second-largest customer in that period. With his background in banking, macron can surely calculate that there is big money involved: saudi arabia bought more than € 11 billion ( $ 12bn ) in french arms between 2008 and 2017. Audacious spin since becoming president last year, macron has acted as something of an image consultant to saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman. When the crown prince visited paris in",

One problem is that gehrig has no living relatives, and the mayo clinic insists the records should remain private as a result, reports ap.

        "summary": "Bill gates has long been a philanthropist through the bill &amp; melinda gates foundation, donating millions to combat diseases and poverty. But the microsoft co-founder has now decided to make a personal donation of his own. A big one. Gates says that he will be donating $ 100 million to fund research to bring about an end to alzheimer's disease, reuters reports. That donation will come in two parts. Fifty million to the dementia discovery fund, which combines government and industry resources to seek treatment for the disease, and $ 50 million to alzheimer's research start-ups. Currently there is no treatment that slows alzheimer's, only medications to ease some of the symptoms of the brain-wasting disease. \"i hope that in the next 10 years that we have some powerful drugs, but it's possible that won't be achieved, \" gates says. This is first time gates has donated money to fighting noninfectious diseases, cnn reports. The gates foundation focuses on communicable diseases like aids and malaria. And while one might assume gates'decision to donate so much of his own money to alzheimer's research is in response to personal experience, he says that isn't entirely so. \" some of the men in my family have suffered from alzheimer's, but i wouldn't say that's the sole reason, \" he says. Nearly 50 million people worldwide are afflicted with alzheimer's. Without new treatments or a cure, that number is expected to rise to 131 million by 2050.",

His doctor had chalked up his spotty vision and dizziness to vertigo, but it turns out he had a more than 2-inch long tumor growing on a fluid cavity toward the back of his brain, which was successfully removed and followed with a six-week course of radiation, reports the western mail in wales. \" if you or any of your loved ones are putting off going to the doctors for any reason, don't! \" says the 36-year-old. \" the sooner these things are found the better the chances are of beating it. \" it all started when walker began to notice being light-headed, especially when he'd turn his head from side to side. One night, playing with his kids, he collapsed after simply shaking his head, and knew he had to see his doctor. But after medication for an infection to help manage vertigo did nothing to alleviate his symptoms, walker remembered reading on facebook about the symptoms a colleague and a friend's 4-year-old daughter both had before being diagnosed with brain tumors. He then asked for a brain scan, and the tumor was found. Walker writes on facebook that he \" fortunately \" had an \" amazing surgeon \" and that his tumor was \" low grade, \" but he hopes his story will convince others to visit a doc if something seems off.

According to a city of sugar land press release, the statues are part of a 10-piece collection donated by a sugar land resident to the city through its sugar land legacy foundation. One of the most recent statues installed is a guitar player sitting on the ledge of a fountain. The other statue is of two girls taking a selfie with city hall in the background. \" both show activities common in the plaza, \" according to a press release.",
            "Some residents of sugar land, texas, say they've been left with a bitter taste in their mouths after a city-approved selfie statue was recently erected outside city hall. The statue features two smiling women in a slight stooping stance, with one holding a cellphone, arm outstretched, to snap a picture of themselves. Some residents took to social media to voice their outrage after word went out — mistakenly — that the city paid for the monuments as part of a beautification project. \" i ' m salty [ expletive ] about that'selfie'statue in sugar land, \" one man tweeted. \" who approved that s ---? \"",

But though it came relatively close to earth by space standards, it was still 4.4 million miles away, or about 18 earth-moon distances, according to nasa. Astronomers who've mapped florence's orbit were well aware the asteroid posed no danger to earth — and it won't get any closer to us until after 2500 — and were thrilled at the prospect of its flyby, which provided an opportunity to study the mass up close. Radar images could perhaps reveal details of florence's surface as small as 10 feet wide, per space.com. The images may also allow astronomers to gauge florence's true size and shape for the first time. Until now, they've only been able to speculate that it may take \" the shape of a top \" with \" a bulge at the equator, \" paul chodas of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory tells space.com. That's a common form for fast-spinning asteroids like florence — named after florence nightingale and one of an estimated 10 large asteroids flying in near-earth space. \" if it were spinning any faster, it would fly apart, \" says chodas, who says of the flyby, \" nothing this big has passed this close to earth since we've been tracking. \" ( the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs was twice as big. )",

Researchers studying two demographically similar counties in virginia found that crash rates among 16- to 18-year-olds were higher in the county where teens must wake up earlier. In henrico county, where high school starts at 8: 45 am, the crash rate was 37.9 per thousand in the 2009-2010 school year; in chesterfield county, where school starts at 7: 20, the rate was 48.8 per thousand. Adult crash rates, on the other hand, \" did not differ between counties, \" the researchers write in the journal of clinical sleep medicine. The study doesn't, however, prove that the early start times caused the accidents, the lead author tells the times; researchers didn't look other potential factors like sleep habits or distance traveled in each county. But a pediatric sleep specialist offered a warning in the same newspaper last month: \" the level of impairment associated with sleep-deprived driving is equivalent to driving drunk, \" she noted. \" would you let a kid drive who just consumed three or four beers? well, guess what? kids do that every day. \"",

That is, of course, except for the us. \" i will make my final decision on the paris accord next week! \" president trump tweeted saturday morning. Abc news reports trump was pressured to remain in the climate agreement by the rest of the g7 — japan, the uk, italy, canada, france, and germany — as well as by pope francis earlier in the week. Trump criticized the agreement during the campaign, and once called global warming a chinese hoax, according to the ap. G7 leaders counted it as a small victory that trump didn't reject the agreement outright, and an eu official says they appreciated the chance to make their case, politico reports. \"we are sure that after an internal reflection, the united states will also want to commit to it, \" abc quotes italian prime minister paolo gentiloni as saying. Trump's economic adviser, gary cohn, says the president's views on the paris climate agreement are \" evolving. \" nearly 200 nations are part of the agreement signed by president obama in 2015. The ap consulted more than two dozen climate scientists on what might happen if the us pulls out of the agreement. Experts fear more countries could follow, leading to rising seas and more extreme weather as the earth more quickly reaches dangerous levels of warming.",

Now it turns out the boulder was unfairly fingered. The new york times reports those archaeologists kept digging and turned up the victim's skull — intact and still bearing almost all its teeth ( see it here ) — suggesting the rock didn't decapitate or otherwise crush him as earlier thought. The skull and upper portion of his body were found another 3 feet down, directly below the initial bones, and archaeologists say the two sets of bones fit with each other. The new cause of death? likely \" asphyxia caused by the pyroclastic flow, \" per a facebook post by the pompeii archaeological park. National geographic went to the director of the smithsonian institution's global volcanism program for an explainer on pyroclastic flow and got this: \" a superheated hurricane-force wind carrying ash and rock that can destroy almost anything in its path. \" as for why the bones weren't on the same plane, a statement from archaeologists notes the presence of a tunnel probably explains it. They write the movement likely came as recently as 250 years ago, when a tunnel dug below the remains caved in and caused the upper bones to move downward.

Stra of the pompeii excavations, which address the controversial and complex question of ' campanian etruria ', and of the relationships and cultural exchanges between elite campanian etruscans, greeks and indigenous peoples, at the heart of which was pompeii. Around 800 finds coming from italian and european museums, displayed in 13 rooms which have been arranged in the northern portico of the large palaestra, allow a broad look at the etruscan culture, from the earliest etruscan influences in campania before pompeii, until pompeii itself - a new etruscan city in a multi-ethnic campania, until its sunset, and the memory of certain etruscan customs which were preserved for some time. Pompeii and the etruscans is the major exhibition at the large palae",

Now, his head has been found, along with the reason for his death, officials from the pompeii archaeological park in italy report. Archaeologists located the open-mouthed skull near the unfortunate man's body, which was unearthed in may. The find negates their previous theory that the man was crushed by the stone block ( thought to be a door jamb ) while trying to flee the second phase of the eruption that preserved much of the ancient roman city beneath rock and ash. \"now we know that the death was not due to the impact of the block, but presumably from probable asphyxiation due to the pyroclastic flow, \" wrote the pompeii archaeological park on its facebook page.

        "summary": "It's been established that screen time in its traditional form — think television and video games — is linked to sleep problems in kids, note researchers in introducing their more specific study: one that, for the first time, looks at touch-screen use among very young children. What they found is a link to poorer sleep, and it starts as early as infancy. Reporting in the journal scientific reports, researchers find that the more kids ages 6 months to 3 years use touch screens during the day, the longer it takes them to fall asleep and the less sleep they log in total. The study is observational and does not prove that the use of touch screens causes sleep issues, but researchers say the link warrants further study. According to a survey of 715 uk parents, kids 6 to 11 months old use touch screens ( in the form of smartphones and/or tablets ) an average of 8 minutes a day. That goes up to 19 minutes for kids ages 12 to 18 months, up again to 25 minutes for kids 19 to 25 months, and up again to 44 minutes for 2-year-olds, reports live science. Every hour of additional touch-screen use was associated with about 15 minutes less total sleep, though interestingly that increase in use was linked to 26 fewer minutes at night but 11 more during daytime napping. It's unclear why, though gizmodo notes artificial lighting has been shown to disrupt the body's circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep. ( less sleep in kids is linked to adhd and behavioral problems. )",

The rogue writers also had empty boxes sent to their homes to appear more legit, according to the suit. But amazon isn't suing fiverr — a site that allows people to sell many kinds of services — because fiverr's terms and conditions explicitly forbid the writing of fake reviews. Amazon says it previously had such ads pulled from fiverr, but \" the removal of individual listings does not address the root cause of the issue or serve as a sufficient deterrent, \" the suit says.

        "summary": "In pawn sacrifice, tobey maguire plays troubled american chess prodigy bobby fischer, who will eventually battle russian chess master boris spassky at the 1972 world chess championship. But can any actor really get inside fischer's head? here's what critics are saying: richard roeper sums up the film as \" rocky iii at the chess table — if rocky were an increasingly paranoid loner. \" overall, it's \" enthralling, \" \" captures the essence of fischer's mad genius, perfectly recreates the tenor of the times and works as a legit sports movie about the great game of chess, \" he writes at the chicago sun-times. Plus, \" maguire gives the performance of his career, \" and \" liev schreiber deserves best supporting actor consideration \" for his turn as spassky. The film \" doesn't offer much in the way of surprises or insight, \" and \" never fully captures how fischer became fischer, \" but \" there's much to recommend it anyway, \" writes keith phipps at uproxx. \" it's shot handsomely and builds in intensity. \" there are also \" some sharp lines from screenwriter steven knight and first-rate performances. \" schreiber is good, but maguire steals the show. Jesse hassenger at av club says \" it's a fitfully entertaining and well-acted movie \" but \" doesn't quite come together. \" though \" one of the film's strongest, most potentially surprising pleasures is the sight of maguire playing both with and against his usual type, \" hassenger says the film \" struggles to wring much drama \" out of a 24-game chess series. The lengthy postscript also seems a bit off. Joe neumaier admits the movie isn't perfect. \" the overall intelligence and strategy of the story is occasionally disturbed by moments of obvious movie bluster or emotional trickery. But that's easy to forgive, \" he writes at the new york daily news. \" the challenge of pawn sacrifice was to capture the colorful cold war ' 70s, the inner strategies of one man's paranoid mind, and make chess cinematic. Check, and mate. \" this is maguire's \" best performance since wonder boys. \" ( is this 12-year-old the next bobby fischer? )",

Two of the humans were toddlers putting unusual items in their mouths, while one was an adult who apparently ate dog treats; why he or she did so isn't clear, modern farmer notes. Another human, however, seems to have survived munching on a dog treat with no ill effects: the owner of a chinese factory implicated by nbc ate one himself to prove it was safe.

A pollen test has given investigators \" their first big break \" in the case of a young girl found in a trash bag on a boston beach in june, nbc news reports. The test shows \" baby doe \" — who was around 4 years old and remains unidentified — had pollen on her blanket and pants that match pollen types in the boston area. \" that's somewhat reassuring, because that's been a theory from the start, \" says jake wark, a spokesman for suffolk county district attorney dan conley. Yet hundreds of tips and dozens of checks with families who have similar children have turned up nothing. An autopsy found no cause of death, and a dna test came up empty. What could help: her decomposition was in the early stages, so she hadn't been dead for long. And the pollen indicates she hadn't washed up on deer island, so investigators can focus there. \" at least it's a geographic location that we can target, as opposed to the entire world, \" says wark, who adds that the island is \" the kind of place that an outsider wouldn't know too well. \" authorities have also posted 84 billboards with her computer-generated image and posted a tweet with her pants and blanket. But how can a little girl just go missing? could be her family lacked legal documentation, investigators tell the boston globe. Or maybe she died by accident and her parents are lying low. \" maybe there are people missing her, but they're afraid to come forward, \" an official says.",

The chief, who got married just 18 days after the accident and has a baby son, is being held on $ 500,000 bond. \" this case is particularly heinous because the perpetrator is a public official, sworn to serve and protect the community, \" pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro said in a statement, citing his office's \" zero tolerance for the sexual abuse of children. \"",

The bloomberg piece delves into the nitty-gritty of that money, tracking gore from having a net worth of roughly $ 1.7 million in 1999 ( a year in which, it notes, he sold $ 6,000 worth of cows ) to making $ 100 million in january 2013 alone. The new york piece takes us inside his \" modest \" 10,000-square-foot nashville mansion, in which steve fishman sits down to a lunch of vegetable soup and fruit salad ( gore explains he's on a health kick ). Highlights: though fishman acknowledges much of gore's wealth hails from internet investments like apple and google, he writes that \" just as important have been his ventures as a kind of moral entrepreneur. \" chief among those, of course, is current tv. Gore's partner joel hyatt admits the two first dismissed eventual buyer al jazeera ( they \" associated it with islamic propaganda, \" writes fishman ), but after \" three seconds \" at the network's doha hq, \" i saw what you can do if you have the resources, \" says hyatt. ( fishman didn't manage to get gore to comment on criticism of the deal. ) still, gore says his own wealth doesn't matter much to him. \" i've never cared that much about making money. I don't own a plane. I own a houseboat — solar panels all over the top — my redneck yacht. \" on girlfriend elizabeth keadle, gore says, \" she has really been wonderful for me. We have a great relationship, for which i thank my lucky stars. \" in his heart, politics still trumps business: \" i've never deluded myself. I miss most of all being able to grab the levers and push the buttons and have an impact on policy and lives. \" on gore's horizon: \" gore tells me of his ambition to have another meeting with rupert murdoch, \" writes fishman, \" to convert him to the [ global warming ] cause.'there is still hope that he will awaken to",

Police say liam mcatasney also admitted, while talking with a friend who secretly recorded the conversation, that he strangled 19-year-old sarah stern during the planned robbery and watched her die for 30 minutes. \" he knew exactly how long it was because he chose to time it, \" said a prosecutor, per nj.com. The revelations came during a hearing tuesday at which mcatasney was ordered held without bail as he awaits trial, the asbury park press reports. During the same conversation, mcatasney also said he and a friend dumped stern's body in the shark river. That friend, preston taylor, another childhood friend of stern's who once took her to junior prom, is facing charges including disturbing human remains. Mcatasney's attorney downplayed the recorded conversation as \" locker-room talk, \" and says that his client has \" indicated to me that whatever was said, he had nothing to do with this. He wouldn't hurt anyone, and he didn't hurt her. \" the lawyer adds that what mcatasney says in the recording is nearly identical to what taylor told police, which makes him think the teens made the story up: \" both boys seem to be talking about something that didn't happen. They're talking about something that was scripted. \" he says stern, whose car was found abandoned in december but whose body has not been found, could still be alive, but also adds that neighbors say she seemed suicidal on the day prosecutors believe she was murdered. She was reportedly giving away things that had belonged to her mom, who died several years ago. She \" had some problems, \" he said.",

This asteroid, 2014 dx110, is estimated to be about 100 feet ( 30 meters ) across. Its closest approach to earth was about 217,000 miles ( about 350,000 kilometers ) from earth at about 1 p.m. Pst ( 4 p.m. Est ) on march 5. The average distance between earth and its moon is about 239,000 miles ( 385,000 kilometers ). Nasa detects, tracks and characterizes asteroids and comets using both ground- and space-based telescopes. The near-earth object observations program, commonly called \" spaceguard, \" discovers these objects, characterizes a subset of them and identifies their close approaches to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet. Nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, pasadena, calif., manages the near-earth object",

Astronomers say there's no chance it ' ll hit us, but you just might be able to watch it zoom by online. The space rock known as 2014 dx110 is due to make its closest approach at about 4 p.m. Et — at a distance of about 216,000 miles ( 345,600 kilometers ), or roughly 90 percent of the moon's orbital distance. The passing asteroid is thought to be 60 to 140 feet ( 19 to 43 meters ) wide. Sixty feet is the estimated width of the asteroid that broke apart roughly 20 miles ( 30 kilometers ) above chelyabinsk on feb. 15, 2013, injuring hundreds of people.

In the aeneid, soldiers nisus and euryalus exact revenge on an enemy army by murdering their captains while they sleep. The duo are eventually captured and killed.

            "Share tweet share send link a quote that greets visitors at the national september 11 memorial &amp; museum in new york city has been causing headaches for the center's planners after it was revealed that it refers to a pair of ancient mythological figures who killed scores of people. But another nugget missed by fact-checkers is that these men were also intergenerational lovers. The line \"no day shall erase you from the memory of time, \" which sits on a wall separating guests from the remains of the unidentified individuals who died in the 2001 attacks, seemed like a fitting sentiment to honor the almost 3,000 who lost their lives at the site; but its inclusion has left some considering its appropriateness ahead of the memorial's formal inauguration on may 21. The quote is taken from roman poet virgil's aeneid, an epic 12-volume poem written around 19 b.c. That many scholars consider to be the greatest work written in any language. In the aeneid, soldiers nisus and euryalus exact revenge on an enemy army by murdering their captains while they sleep. The duo are eventually captured and killed. Virgil's famous line rewards the bravery — and foolish bravado — of nisus and euryalus, and suggests that his poem will ensure their immortality. Considering its origin, the quote is an odd choice for the 9/11 memorial, seeing as it honors two men who have killed many.

Virgil. \" it sounds fitting — except in the context of book 9 of the \"aeneid, \" from which it is translated. There, a reader learns who \"you \" are. \"you \" are not nameless.

        "summary": "Philando castile's girlfriend says he was shot last week by a cop \" for no reason at all, \" but there may be another clue as to why he was pulled over. Abc news has gotten its hands on police dispatch audio from the night of july 6, and on the tape ( which you can listen to at the pioneer press ), a police officer indicates he's about to make a traffic stop and that there's \" reason to pull [ the car ] over. \" \" the two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery, \" the cop says. \" the driver looks more like one of our suspects, just ' cause of the wide-set nose. \" he adds, per the star tribune: \" i couldn't get a good look at the passenger. \" the day before castile's shooting, the police department disseminated photos of those robbery suspects, who were accused of stealing from a convenience store on july 2, with descriptions noting they were two black men with medium to long dreadlocks; no mention was made of estimated height, weight, or ages. An attorney who conferred with the castile family after he was killed tells the star tribune that had castile really been pulled over for being a robbery suspect, police should have followed the very different protocol of a felony traffic stop, which \" does not usually involve officers walking up to your car and asking you to produce your driver's license. \" instead, cops would take cover with guns drawn and instruct the suspect to come out and lie on the ground until he or she can be ided. What's not broached in the audio dispatch is a broken taillight, which is what castile's girlfriend, diamond reynolds, says was the reason she and castile were told they were pulled over. A witness took video at the scene and says there didn't appear to be any broken taillights. \" the car was still running and it was nighttime, so you could clearly see both lights were on, \" gregory ford tells the daily mail, adding there was red tape on one of the lights.

Mbta authorities were eventually able to stop the train, but not before it went through four stations, reports the boston globe. None of the passengers were hurt. How it happened is still unclear, but gov. Charlie baker says it was no accident: \" this train was tampered with, and it was tampered with by somebody who knew what they were doing, \" he told boston herald radio, per the ap. Things seemed to go awry when the sole operator got out at the braintree station to check on some kind of signal issue, and the train left the station without him. The 51-year-old operator was brushed by another train at braintree and suffered minor injuries. A woman aboard the train tells wbz that passengers knocked on the conductor's booth after the lights went out, only to find it empty. \" the whole train started going slow, \" she recalls. \" it was all dark, everything was quiet. It was just us. We had no idea what was going on. \" mbta officials shut down power to the track's third rail, and the train finally came to a halt outside the north quincy station after 6am. The six-car train is now out of service, with initial reports suggesting that somebody tampered with a safety device within the driver's cab, allowing it to move forward without an operator. The fbi says only that it is \" aware of the incident. \"",

If ibrahim al-asiri — who was believed to have been involved in an unsuccessful 2009 plot to blow up an aircraft over detroit on christmas day with an underwear bomb — is dead, it would \" represent a serious blow to operational capability \" for al-qaeda, the un says. The report does not detail how al-asiri may have died. Government officials in the us are now looking into evidence that the saudi-born terrorist is, in fact, dead, cnn reports. But some analysts say that reports of al-asiri's death should be received with skepticism because al-qaeda has yet to acknowledge it. One former british spy tells cnn that \" it would be extremely out of the ordinary \" for al-qaeda not to release a eulogy for such a senior leader. In addition to the christmas day plot that failed due to a malfunction, al-asiri, born in 1982, is believed to have built a bomb used in a 2009 attempt to assassinate a saudi official ( the bomber, al-asiri's brother, was killed in the attempt ), according to a 2014 bbc profile. In 2010, al-asiri built bombs disguised as printer cartridges that were intended to be shipped to chicago, the washington post reported in 2012.

The un report says that ibrahim al-asiri, long regarded as one of the most dangerous terrorist operatives in circulation, may have been killed in yemen last year. \" since mid-2017, the organization has suffered losses of leadership and field commanders owing to extensive yemeni and international counter-terrorist operations, \" said a june report by the analytical support and sanctions monitoring team. \" some member states report that explosives expert ibrahim al-asiri... May have been killed during the second half of 2017. Given al-asiri's past role in plots against aviation, this would represent a serious blow to operational capability. \" the un report gave no indication of how al-asiri died",

He has tried to attack the united states three times in the past three years, building small, sophisticated and hard-to-detect devices in his workshop in the rugged terrain of southern yemen. Ibrahim hassan al-asiri, who hails from a middle-class saudi family, is the top bombmaker for al-qaeda's yemen branch. Only 30 years old, he represents the cia's worst fears: a highly skilled terrorist determined to attack the united states. American officials believe asiri's latest bomb was designed to be smuggled onto a u.s.-bound aircraft last month. The non­metallic device had an advanced detonator and was superior to anything created by terrorists so far. \"asiri is an evil genius, \" said",

The 28-year-old is believed to have built the device his younger brother used in an assassination attempt on saudi arabia's deputy interior minister in august 2009, and the underwear bomb a young nigerian man tried to detonate in an aircraft over the us on christmas day.

            "Washington ( cnn ) the al qaeda bomb master behind a 2009 attempt to blow up an airliner over detroit on christmas day may have been killed, according to a un team that tracks terrorist groups. The un report says that ibrahim al-asiri, long regarded as one of the most dangerous terrorist operatives in circulation, may have been killed in yemen last year. \" since mid-2017, the organization has suffered losses of leadership and field commanders owing to extensive yemeni and international counter-terrorist operations, \" said a june report by the analytical support and sanctions monitoring team. \" some member states report that explosives expert ibrahim al-asiri... May have been killed during the second half of 2017. Given al-asiri's past role in plots against aviation, this would represent a serious blow to operational capability. \" the un report gave no indication of how al-asiri died",
            "He has dispatched his own brother to death, hiding a bomb on him before he crossed into saudi arabia to target the kingdom's chief counterterrorism official. He has tried to attack the united states three times in the past three years, building small, sophisticated and hard-to-detect devices in his workshop in the rugged terrain of southern yemen. Ibrahim hassan al-asiri, who hails from a middle-class saudi family, is the top bombmaker for al-qaeda's yemen branch. Only 30 years old, he represents the cia's worst fears: a highly skilled terrorist determined to attack the united states. American officials believe asiri's latest bomb was designed to be smuggled onto a u.s.-bound aircraft last month. The non­metallic device had an advanced detonator and was superior to anything created by terrorists so far. \"asiri is an evil genius, \" said",
            "Image copyright reuters image caption ibrahim al-asiri was first named on a saudi wanted list in february 2009 ibrahim hassan tali al-asiri is a wanted saudi militant who us counter-terrorism officials have accused of making the bombs used in a string of high-profile operations by al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) since mid-2009. The 28-year-old is believed to have built the device his younger brother used in an assassination attempt on saudi arabia's deputy interior minister in august 2009, and the underwear bomb a young nigerian man tried to detonate in an aircraft over the us on christmas day. He is also thought to have made the bombs hidden in two packages which were found on planes in dubai and the uk in october 2010.

Not many people actually took part — as in, 22 — but ocasio-cortez came out on top with nine votes. Because it was an official primary, the city board of elections certified the win, and ocasio-cortez then had to officially decline the nomination because she can't run in two races in the general election.

            "The reform party is pulling off a political stunt on tuesday spanning four boroughs, 230 polling sites, and 5,000 workers. The only question is whether voters will play along. Rep. Nydia velázquez, who represents new york's 7th congressional district, and rep. José serrano, who represents ny-15, are virtually guaranteed to win re-election. They're longtime incumbents in heavily democratic districts who aren't facing primary challenges. Under normal circumstances, the new york city board of elections therefore wouldn't set up polling places in these districts on primary day. But this year, they will have to, since the tiny reform party is hosting a write-in primary. And the party is opening it up to all unaffiliated voters, who don't belong to a political party. That means that 77,000 independent voters and 23 reform party members in velázquez's district – which includes manhattan's lower east side, much of the brooklyn waterfront and slivers of southwest queens – have the option to vote. Ditto for the 55,000 independents and 38 reform party members in serrano's south bronx district. The board of elections didn't respond to a request for comment, but the daily news reported that the board will be running 230 polling sites and employing 5,000 workers, at a cost of $ 1 million to run elections in these two districts despite their being no actual candidates on the reform ballot and no challenges on the democratic side. Why would anyone do such a silly thing? the reform party says it's meant to send a message that current new york election law governing partisan primaries is broken. \"part of my hope, quite frankly, is that people will see what a needless expense this is and we will call upon their state legislators to fix this right away, \" reform party spokesman frank morano told city &amp; state.

Mark vaughan, chief operating officer of vaughan foods in moore, also happens to be a reserve deputy sheriff. When he learned of the attack, he left his office, saw a man stabbing a second woman, and shot the assailant twice with a rifle, police say. Suspect alton nolen, 30, survived and is under police watch at a hospital. Police say he earlier killed and decapitated 54-year-old colleen hufford and was attacking a second employee when he got shot. The second woman suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Nolen had gotten fired from the company moments before the attack occurred. The police have brought in the fbi to help investigate the killing because employees say that nolen was a muslim convert who had been trying to convert others to islam, reports ap. Authorities haven't confirmed that and haven't made a connection between the suspect's religious beliefs and the attack. \"it's really unfortunate that there's a lot of attention on muslims these days for actions of people who are either part of extremist groups or who have extreme ideas, \" the executive director of the council on american islamic relations in oklahoma tells kfor-tv. \" what this gentleman did in moore, which is inhumane and barbaric, is definitely not a representation of what our faith teaches. \" nolen previously served time in prison for assaulting a police officer, reports ap.",

        "summary": "It's a rare genetic illness and, in the washington post's telling, a \" frightening \" one. And it's one whose symptoms many sufferers were able to control for free, or a pittance. That's changed in an extreme and dramatic fashion in recent years, making the drug keveyis yet another example of out-of-control drug prices. But this case has a twist: it's one of good intentions that took a turn. The drug was developed in the late ' 50s to treat glaucoma, and was sold under the name daranide. But those suffering from periodic paralysis, which can cause spells of immobility, discovered it helped ease their symptoms. For the remainder of the 20th century, it came cheap; the post puts its list price at $ 50 for 100 pills in 2001. But then merck discontinued it, and those desperate to obtain it had to import it from abroad; the monthly cost increased to roughly $ 300. But in 2008, taro pharmaceutical industries acquired daranide with good intentions: the former chair's son suffered from periodic paralysis, and while he didn't use daranide, he was aware of the need for it. Two years later, sun pharmaceutical industries purchased a controlling stake in taro, and in 2015, the drug was officially approved to treat periodic paralysis and relabeled as keveyis. The new price: $ 13,650 for 100 pills. The post asked questions in 2016, and sun decided to drop the price to zero — which was the price for a short time, until strongbridge biopharma late that year bought the drug and jacked the list price to $ 15,001 per 100 pills; it told investors that annual treatment would cost $ 109,500 to $ 219,000. Many insurers pick up the entire tab. The hill reports sen. Claire mccaskill is \" demanding answers \" on the price hike and on tuesday reached out to the company.",

The researchers note that previous studies on the fate of vertebrate remains below 600 feet \" have been restricted to either small porpoise and dolphin carcasses or large whale carcasses, \" the latter known as \" whale falls. \" lead author dr. Nick higgs explains to the bbc the sudden richness of the evidence — four carcasses across an area roughly a half-square-mile when none had been seen before — by the fact that there is a large amount of sea-life activity in the waters above the seabed, which has been surveyed more \" intensively \" than most areas because of its industrial uses. Large carcasses are interesting, the scientists write in the journal plos one, because otherwise the main food source in depths beyond where sunlight penetrates is \" marine snow \" consisting of millimeter-long \" dead plankton and fecal pellets. \" these dead large sea creatures could make up 4 % of the food available in these environments ( this one was three-quarters-of-a-mile below the surface ). Four fish species were identified among the remains, including eel pouts, which prey on other fish that come to scavenge.

Ifergan says that in may 2008, he bought two tickets at 8: 59pm, a minute before the 9pm cutoff, the cbc reports. The first ticket out of the convenience store's machine was for that night's draw but the next one — which had the draw's winning numbers — was printed at seven seconds after 9pm and was registered for the following week's draw. If the ticket had been printed a few seconds earlier, he would have shared a $ 21 million jackpot with another winner. Ifergan sued lottery authorities in quebec, saying the processing lag was the fault of their slow system. Loto-quebec never disputed \" the fact that my request for the two tickets was in their system at 8: 59.47, \" he tells ctv, saying that \" had those tickets been bought anywhere else in canada, i would have been a millionaire seven years ago. \" but the courts in quebec ruled against him, and the supreme court of canada refused to hear his appeal yesterday.

Their net income is up and customer churn has been low, but its biggest tactical advantage has been squandered. Now it's time to take this battle to the street. Specifically, chicago's busy michigan avenue. That's where, this weekend, following a few years of planning, at&t is opening its first ever flagship store. There, as 60,000 people per day pass by cartier, louis vuitton, and coach, they ' ll see at&t's new 10,000-square-foot retail mecca, a store that at&t hopes to \"bring life to the brand, \" according to store manager christina cheng.

Altria, parent company of marlboro maker phillip morris usa, announced thursday that it will stop selling e-cigarette refill pods and most of its flavored e-cigarette products, the wall street journal reports. During a call with analysts, ceo howard willard said that the company is concerned about youth access to e-cigarettes, per market watch, and will stop selling the products until the fda makes a final ruling on them or youth access to e-cigs is otherwise addressed \" we're taking this action because we don't want to risk contributing to the issue, \" he said. Studies show that more than 2 million kids and teens use nicotine vaping devices, according to usa today. And they are attracted to flavors, such as strawberry brulee and hazelnut cream, that sound more like they belong to desserts and specialty drinks than to tobacco products. The affected altria products include markten elite, apex by markten, and all flavored products, except for tobacco flavor, menthol, and mint. A spokesman for the fda, which has threatened to ban flavored e-cig products, tells the wsj that it \" appreciates any voluntary steps companies can take to address the youth access and appeal of e-cigarettes. \" the paper notes that altria's move puts pressure on juul, which dominates the e-cigarette market through selling flavored pods.

        "summary": "Police investigating the gruesome deaths of two members of a los angeles family now believe father shehada issa was behind both killings — and they no longer think he killed his son for being gay. Homophobia may have been one factor, investigators say, but the main reason for the shooting appears to have been an attempt to cover up the murder of mother rabihah issa, who had been stabbed to death sometime in the 24 hours before the son was shot dead last week. \" dad killed mom and then killed his son to cover it up, \" detective john doerbecker tells the los angeles times. He says investigators have found evidence of animosity between husband and wife, and nothing to back up issa's claim that he shot his son amir in self-defense. Before the latest twist, prosecutors had considered the son's murder a hate crime, saying it was \" committed because of the victim's sexual orientation, \" the los angeles daily news reports. Deputy da emily cole tells the times that evidence for a hate crime includes statements from amir's siblings about threats the father had made. \" we have enough, obviously, to prove he killed the son, but the motive and the reasoning and everything is very much an ongoing investigation, \" she says. Issa, 69, is being held without bail and has not yet been charged in the death of his wife. ( weeks before the killings, the son made some bizarre posts on facebook, including a video of a confrontation with his parents. )",

        "summary": "Think women get cheated at the negotiating table? that painful cliché has found new life in a us study of mba students who, true to form, cheated females more often than males, jezebel reports. First, researchers at upenn and uc berkeley had prospective sellers — both male and female — negotiate with student buyers. Sure enough, the buyers said females were warmer, more incompetent, and more easily deceived. \" warmth … may decrease women's resistance to lies because directly confronting deception is considered impolite, \" write the study's authors. Another key: people considered less competent appear unlikely to scrutinize lies, one author tells slate. The researchers again paired off students — this time with one selling real estate intended for \" tasteful, \" residential purposes, and the other secretly buying it to develop a high-rise instead. Again, female sellers got cheated more often, even if the buyer was female. The study found that buyers would blatantly lie to women, saying something like, \" they will be luxury condos, \" while telling men \" i can't tell you \" their true purpose, or even admitting the truth with, \" i ' m not supposed to tell you this, but... \" the numbers: men admitted lying to women 24 % of the time, and to men only 3 %. Women lied to women 17 % of the time, and to men 11 %. An in-depth atlantic article headlined \" the confidence gap \" says the issue is women's confidence, not ability, while slate brings it down to stereotypes about what women are \" capable of. And until we chip away at those, telling women to try harder won't get us fair treatment. \" ( see why one writer thinks women are \" best \" at age 42. )",

The other martin shkreli pleaded not guilty friday in the same new york courtroom where the former pharmaceutical ceo was waiting for a verdict in his securities fraud trial.

He said he had no interest in being that \" famous. \" the elder shkreli is accused of money laundering to the tune of $ 800,000, and being involved in a gun-running scheme; he's charged as one of eight men who allegedly sold firearms including ak-47s and a rocket launcher to feds, reports the new york daily news. Prosecutors have accused the more notorious of the two shkrelis of deceiving investors in two failed hedge funds. The 34-year-old \" pharma bro \" is best known for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 %.",

        "summary": "An ancient god has resurfaced in israel thanks to what archaeologists say is a one-of-a-kind discovery. University of haifa researchers were digging at what's believed to be an ancient basalt armory outside sussita — which the jerusalem post reports was once the roman city of antiochia hippos — when a ball from a ballista, an ancient missile weapon, appeared two weeks ago. As it was made of limestone rather than basalt, archaeologists suspected it was an enemy missile and turned to a metal detector to search for a coin that might date the projectile. It found something far bigger: a 2,000-year-old bronze mask larger than a human head. Archaeologists say it depicts the ancient god of shepherds, pan, who is half man, half goat. As per a press release, the mask is \" the only [ one ] of its kind \" as \" most of the known bronze masks from the hellenistic and roman periods are miniature \" and few depict \" greek or roman mythological images \" or gods. Most bronze sculptures and masks from the period were eventually melted down, haaretz adds, so few remain today. Archaeologists first identified pan, also known as faunus or satyr, by the horns poking out from his hair. A closer inspection revealed \" further goat-like characteristics, \" including a beard and pointy ears, researcher michael eisenberg says. Experts now believe the armory or defensive building — featuring \" thick walls and very solid masonry work, which suggested a large structure from the roman period \" — was later turned into \" a pan altar on the main road to the city, beyond its limits, \" eisenberg says. \" because they included drinking, sacrificing, and ecstatic worship that sometimes included nudity and sex, rituals for rustic gods were often held outside of the city. \" he suggests \" what we have here is a magnificent fountain-head or burial offerings of a nearby mausoleum. \" ( another cool find: the world's oldest pretzel. )",

It seems that in recent years, the mysteries of hippos-sussita have been revealing their secrets in an extraordinary way: first, a sculpture of hercules was exposed by the winter rains of 2011, then, two years later, a basalt tombstone with a sculpture of the deceased's bust was uncovered. Now there is a new surprise: the only finding of a bronze mask of unnatural size, in the form of the god pan/faunus. Excavations at hippos-sussita are usually conducted in the summer. However, a series of intriguing structures on the ridge of the city, where the ancient road passed, led to a one-day dig in the winter. The dig focused on a basalt structure which the researchers assumed was a type of armoured hangar for the city's projectile machines. The finding of a ballista ball made of limestone, a different material from the basalt that was customarily used at hippos-sussita to make balista balls, made them realize that it was an enemy's projectile.

Though the pits would have stored agricultural produce, they were \" all full of findings, large ceramic vessels, jars, pots, and basins, \" says dig supervisor diego barkan. Some appear to be local pieces, but others \" did not match the local traditions \" as they \" had straw or other organic matter added to strengthen them. \" instead, they belonged to egyptians who used the vessels to make beer, experts say. Most interesting, however, is that fragments of the basins are the first evidence of an \" egyptian occupation \" in tel aviv and \" the northernmost evidence we have of an egyptian presence in the early bronze age, \" barkan adds, per arutz sheva. \" now we know that the ancient egyptians also appreciated what the tel aviv region had to offer, and were able to enjoy a glass of beer, just like today's tel avivians, \" he tells ynetnews. Beer was known as \" the national drink of the egyptians \" in the bronze age and was made from a partially baked mixture of barley and water that fermented in the sun before fruit was added for flavor. The basins discovered in tel aviv were made \" in an egyptian tradition, \" but a study will determine \" if the vessels were brought from egypt or whether the egyptian population imitated the vessels they knew in egypt, \" barkan says. The site also revealed a 6,000-year-old copper dagger and flint, and oysters from the mediterranean and red seas. ( an underground city has been found in turkey. )",

        "summary": "For all the fanfare surrounding it, world war z is a fair-to-middling zombie movie, critics say. Brad pitt stars as a former un investigator who takes to the skies to fight the undead menace. From the reviews: the movie \" does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them, \" writes ao scott in the new york times. \" and in many ways, when compared with man of steel, iron man 3 and star trek: omg ricardo montalbán!, world war z is pretty refreshing. \" an \" undulating-mass-of-zombies image is this movie's ace in the hole, the reliably jolting vision it returns to whenever things start to feel a little thin in the story department, \" dana stevens notes at slate. As for pitt, he \" has perfected the soulful thousand-yard stare of the thinking action hero. \" other critics are less friendly, however: in the guardian, peter bradshaw writes that \" the real panic spreads in the cinema auditorium as we realize we've got two hours of dodgy acting and dull cgi work ahead, culminating in massed snoring. \" world war z \" is no summer thriller, \" observes joe neumaier in the new york daily news. \" it's an anemic actioner that fosters excitement like dead limbs as it lumbers toward a conclusion. \"",
