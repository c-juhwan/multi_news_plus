But the republican-dominated house rules committee smacked down king's amendment tuesday evening, deciding it woudn't be subject to a vote — a move politico says shows a gop \" desire to avoid controversial votes in an election year. \" meanwhile, kim weaver, king's democratic competitor in iowa, called his attempt a \" headline-grabbing piece of stunt legislation. \"",

        "summary": "An 840-pound emerald is still without a clear owner after six years in police custody, but that could be settled soon in los angeles superior court. Judge michael johnson says a case to determine the rightful owner of the 180,000-carat bahia emerald, found in brazil in 2001, will move forward — despite brazil's claims it was illegally mined, reports the los angeles times. Brazil had asked the judge to dismiss the case so it could negotiate the emerald's return with the us government, but no luck. At one time, eight people claimed ownership, but several claims have been dismissed over the years. The last remaining one is led by idaho businessman kit morrison, who had the gem in his possession when police traced it to a las vegas vault in 2009. But the history of the bahia emerald is far more complicated than that, bloomberg reports. The rock changed hands repeatedly before its confiscation, at one point ending up submerged in a new orleans vault during hurricane katrina. It was also involved in plots with the brazilian mafia, along with a $ 197 million bernie madoff transaction, fox news reports. It once went up on ebay for $ 75 million. Morrison finally ended up in possession, though another man — the guy who put it up on ebay, investor larry biegler — then called police to report it stolen, leading to its confiscation. And that's just a small sense of why it's taken six years to get this far. If morrison is declared the owner, brazil's hope of reclaiming the gem would be complicated, unless it's willing to pay up. \" they have to pay to repatriate, \" says morrison's attorney. \" you can't just take it. \" ( a \" perfect \" 100-carat diamond goes up for auction this month. )",

            "In the northeastern brazilian state of bahia, not far from the city of pindobaçu, the land is creased like an accordion. There, the earth's crust has been squished into a series of granite ridges separated by scrub-filled valleys. These folds are rich with the elements beryllium and chromium, which have worked their way into the cracked rock and cooled to form green hexagonal crystals — emeralds. Starting in the 1960s, thousands of prospectors, known in portuguese as garimpeiros, have flocked here to mine. Descending hundreds of feet down shafts no wider than manholes, they risk their lives to hunt for the gemstones. One of these shafts sits below a farm owned by an elderly man. One day in early 2001, according to an investigation by brazil's national department of mineral production, a garimpeiro there emerged from the ground with an emerald formation far larger than anyone had ever seen. It was a dark, tombstone-size hunk of shale, with a dozen greenish columns jutting out like sticks",

        "summary": "The buffalo museum of science has been sitting on a rare find. A collections manager with the museum discovered an elephant bird egg nestled away in a cabinet for more than half a century and erroneously labeled as a cast. The egg is 1 foot long, more than 2 feet in circumference, and in pristine condition. \" it's the biggest egg laid by any vertebrate ever, \" director of collections kathryn leacock tells the buffalo news — and that includes dinosaurs, notes the smithsonian, which reports the egg's volume is equivalent to that of about 150 chicken eggs. Convinced the specimen looked too real to be a model, the museum brought the egg to conservation experts at suny buffalo state who radiographed and authenticated it. The x-rays also revealed a yolk sac and specks of white material, indicating the egg had been fertilized, with the white bits possibly the early stages of a developing bird. Elephant birds, which became extinct in the 17th century, could grow to a height of 10 feet and weigh as much as 1,100 pounds. The flightless birds were found on madagascar and probably died out due to a combination of factors, reports newsweek: the giant eggs were attractive to poachers, and environmental changes may have sealed their fate. Museum records suggest that the egg was purchased from a london collector in 1939. \" lost, hidden, or misidentified artifacts and specimens are not uncommon in museums that have been collecting for centuries, \" leacock said in a news release. The egg, one of fewer than 40 held by public institutions, will be on display at the museum starting in may. ( this us museum agreed to stop displaying a soldier's skull. )",

Six years after a rule change limited first-year medical residents from working shifts longer than 16 hours, the rule has been changed back, kqed reports. According to npr, as of july, first-year doctors could once again work shifts lasting up to 28 hours without a break. Shifts for first-year residents were cut to 16 hours by the accreditation council for graduate medical education in 2011 after studies showed that human performance starts to decline and medical errors go up after 16 hours. But the acgme reversed its decision in march, arguing the shorter shifts didn't improve patient outcomes and created a new set of problems. Veteran doctors argued the shorter shifts made first-year residents focus on handing off patients rather than seeing them through treatment, prevented residents from observing treatments and surgeries from beginning to end, and gave them less time to teach residents. One doctor tells forbes that patients want to know \" you are the doctor taking care of them \" and won't be replaced by someone else. But not everyone wanted to see the return of longer shifts, which was opposed by both resident and patient groups. The director of public citizen's health research group accuses the acgme of letting \" their misguided wishes trump public health. \" and one first-year resident says veteran doctors only want 28-hour shifts because they feel that \" i went through it, so therefore you have to. \" ( swedish city's six-hour workday didn't work. )",

A yew tree in scotland that's thousands of years old has grown three seed-bearing berries, marking it as \" female \" for the first time on record, the guardian reports. \" yews are normally either male or female and in autumn and winter sexing yews is generally easy, \" writes botanist max coleman in a blog for the royal botanic garden edinburgh, where the fortingall yew lives in a stone enclosure. \" males have small spherical structures that release clouds of pollen when they mature. Females hold bright red berries from autumn into winter. \" he says it was \" quite a surprise to me \" to discover the berries, each of which contains a single seed. Turns out it's not that strange: yews and other conifers are known to change sex \" on part of the crown, \" explains coleman. \" in the fortingall yew it seems that one small branch in the outer part of the crown \" has changed after the tree was male \" for hundreds of years. \" so why the switch? it's usually caused by \" a shift in the balance of hormone-like compounds, \" he tells afp, but \" one of the things that might be triggering it is environmental stress. \" now botanists have sown the three seeds in the botanic garden to preserve the genetic diversity of yew trees. As for the fortingall yew, it's hard to date exactly because its growth rings have rotted, but estimates put it between 2,000 and 5,000 years old, the bbc reports. It lives behind an enclosure to prevent \" souvenir hunters \" from \" help[ ing ] themselves to parts of the tree, \" writes coleman.",

At the maranatha baptist church, which sits in the middle of an industrial area on the outskirts of town, the rev. Timothy kenoyer said that even though he believed mr. Obama was auguring an era of \"socialism \" — and that an economic malaise had set into his neighborhood — he was pessimistic about mr. Romney's chances. \"if romney was a middle-class man, or not incredibly wealthy, that would be a contributor to a greater degree of accessibility, \" mr. Kenoyer said in",
            "The romney campaign and other republicans say polls showing president obama with a significant lead over their candidate are inaccurate. They argue many mainstream polls skew in obama's favor because of sample sizes that base 2012 turnout projections on 2008, when democrats — and hispanics, blacks and young voters in particular — turned out in record numbers. \"i don't think [ the polls ] reflect the composition of what 2012 is going to look like, \" romney pollster neil newhouse said in an interview. Advertisement frustration that polls are skewed in favor of obama has escalated among some on the right in recent weeks. One website, www.unskewedpolls.com, recently began re-weighting the mainstream",
            "The romney campaign is joining the ranks of supporters who have decided that major national polls show romney losing only because the samples are overly weighted with dems. Romney pollster neil newhouse insists that public polling averages are \"skewed, \" and that the 2012 electorate will not show the same minority and dem base composition as the 2008 one did. But in an interview with me, obama campaign pollster joel benenson mocked the idea that the electorate will diverge meaningfully from that of 2008 as as delusional. \"the notion that this electorate isn't going to be as diverse as it was is frankly a fantasy, \" benenson said. \"the percentage of african americans has gone up"

        "summary": "One of the latest, pricey health fads is camel milk, and the fda has made clear that it's none too pleased. That's because california company desert farms has been boasting that its product can cure ( or at least mitigate ) all kinds of ailments, from allergies to crohn's disease, reports vice. In a letter recently made public, the fda warns 25-year-old founder walid abdul-wahab that his company's \" therapeutic claims \" try to \" establish that these products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, \" and that desert farms needs to stop marketing the milk as a medicinal product. The milk mostly comes from amish farms. The fda and cdc have \" standing public warnings \" against unpasteurized raw milk, reports food safety news. That's because pasteurization kills pathogens like e. Coli, listeria, and salmonella. And medicine, however natural, must be subject to federal safety regulations, not to mention scientific rigor. Turns out desert farms ' claims are \" completely unproven, \" per the independent. The company replaced the content on its \" science &amp; research \" page with the message: \" fda asked us to remove this page … no joke! \" however, its \" about us \" section notes that camel milk is used across the globe for \" complex health problems. \" some are still drinking up the $ 18-a-pint concoction, as kim kardashian did on a trip to bahrain last year.

        "summary": "The number of homeless people in los angeles county has hit a new record based on data kept since 2007, with nearly 58,000 people without permanent shelter on a given night. The los angeles times reports that the 23 % spike over 2016, described as \" staggering \" and \" scary \" by those involved in fighting homelessness, came despite stepped-up efforts to keep vulnerable people in their homes. In the city of la alone, the tally of 34,000 is up 20 % over 2016. The sole bright spot in the block-by-block count carried out in january relates to families: though the number of individual family members who are homeless increased 30 %, the number of them who were unsheltered ( meaning not in an emergency shelter or transitional housing ) dropped 21 %. The challenge, say officials, is how to expand efforts amid the area's sky-high housing costs. \" we can't let rents double every year, \" la mayor eric garcetti said wednesday upon the findings'release. The median monthly price for a one-bedroom apartment is $ 1,995, per the times, and data shows at least 2 million la and orange county households shell out more than 30 % of their paychecks on housing. \" our city is in the midst of an extraordinary homelessness crisis that needs an extraordinary response, \" garcetti said, adding that he was \" particularly disappointed \" to see a 57 % jump in homeless veterans. As bad as the figures are, the guardian notes that new york city is home to the most homeless people, with 74,000 in 2016, though unlike la, most spend their nights in shelters.

The chances that someone, somewhere on the planet, will be hit by one of those chunks are 1 in 3,200.the chance that any particular person ( in other words, you ) will be hit is infinitesimal: one in many trillions, according to nasa — which had noted on its website as of press time that the satellite would not be flying over north america during the anticipated re-entry period.but the days leading up to the craft's demise unleashed a flurry of excitement among space enthusiasts who track satellites and a welter of giddy articles about the possible risks.foxnews.com offered a widget that allowed readers to track the satellite's progress in real time. Paddypower.com, an irish gambling website, began taking bets on where the debris will land. Odds of one or more of the pieces landing in ireland were pegged at 66 to 1, for example.a poll item on abc news ' website asked readers where they thought uars would crash. Possible answers were \" harmlessly in the ocean, \" \" in mountains"

After reports that trump was planning an executive order for us withdrawal from nafta, the white house issued a statement wednesday evening saying trump has \" agreed not to terminate nafta at this time \" and will renegotiate the trade deal instead, the cbc reports. The white house said there were \" pleasant and productive \" conversations wednesday afternoon between trump, canadian pm justin trudeau, and mexican president enrique peña nieto. The statement said the leaders had agreed to \" swiftly \" renegotiate the deal \" to the benefit of all three countries. \" \" it is my privilege to bring nafta up-to-date through renegotiation, \" trump said. The new york times reports that the mexican peso and canadian dollar fell against the us dollar amid rumors of a pullout, which followed days of escalating trade disagreements with canada. If trump does decide to pull out of nafta, which he threatened to do during his campaign if the us couldn't get a better deal, he will need to give six months ' notice. Some of trump's fellow republicans voiced strong opposition to withdrawal wednesday, with nebraska's sen. Ben sasse saying \" scrapping nafta would be a disastrously bad idea. \" ( trump's new tariff on canadian lumber could add more than $ 1,000 to the price of new us homes. )",

The events unfolded on april 6, when sanderson went to kyle's house to get her ready for a promotional event. Kingsley was in the house, too, and the dog eventually got into the room. Sanderson says she hid in a bathroom until she was assured it was safe to come out, only to be attacked by the dog. She says it tore her flesh in her lower abdomen and groin area, causing her to go into shock and \" bleed profusely. \" richards allegedly called london instead of 911 to take sanderson to a hospital, and he filled out her admission forms with a note that a stray dog was responsible. Sanderson's attorney says the stylist \" almost lost her life, \" citing lack of immediate medical attention as a major factor. Cns says richards has been sued twice before over the dog, in 2014 and 2015, and had to pay a friend $ 8,000 to resolve another incident. ( richards also made the news when she entered rehab. )",

This was just the first step, however, explains the christian science monitor. Their passing grade in the combat endurance test merely allows the women to move on and try to complete the rest of the infantry officer course. So far, 24 women have tried to do so and failed. Only one has previously made it beyond the initial endurance test, in 2012, but she had to drop out of the course a week later because of a stress fracture in her foot. Another big hurdle: passing the ioc doesn't necessarily mean the women will be allowed to become front-line infantry officers. As the post explains, the military is allowing women to take the course on an experimental basis, but the \" job itself remains closed to women. \" all branches of the military, however, are being ordered to open up more combat jobs to women, so that could change.

        "summary": "In what turned out to be a futile attempt to avoid his downfall, harvey weinstein hired an \" army of spies \" to target women accusing him of sexual assault or harassment and the journalists trying to report on their claims, ronan farrow writes in his second explosive weinstein story in the new yorker. Farrow says that around a year ago, weinstein employed private security agencies — including black cube, which is run by former agents of israel's mossad spy agency — to try to suppress the allegations. Agents met with actresses and journalists under false pretenses, including one who met with rose mcgowan several times, claiming to be a women's rights advocate. Weinstein supervised efforts to target \" dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focused on their personal or sexual histories, \" farrow writes. Weinstein also spoke to current and former employees to try and identify people who might speak out against him, and enlisted the help of journalists and allies including dylan howard at national enquirer publisher american media inc. To try to discredit accusers. Some of the women targeted say the use of private security agencies made it even tougher to speak out against the powerful producer. \" ex-mossad operatives? the biggest international security firms in the world on your case?? and these women still spoke up!!, \" tweeted anthony bourdain, partner of weinstein accuser asia argento, adding that howard is \" beneath whale s ---. \"",

            "In the fall of 2016, harvey weinstein set out to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women. He began to hire private security agencies to collect information on the women and the journalists trying to expose the allegations. According to dozens of pages of documents, and seven people directly involved in the effort, the firms that weinstein hired included kroll, which is one of the world's largest corporate-intelligence companies, and black cube, an enterprise run largely by former officers of mossad and other israeli intelligence agencies. Black cube, which has branches in tel aviv, london, and paris, offers its clients the skills of operatives \"highly experienced and trained in israel's elite military and governmental intelligence units, \" according to its literature. Two private investigators from black cube, using false identities, met with the actress rose mcgowan, who eventually publicly accused weinstein of rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators pretended to be a women's-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least four meetings with mcgowan. The same operative, using a different false identity and implying that she had an allegation against weinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were talking to the press. In other cases, journalists directed by weinstein or the private investigators interviewed women and reported back the details. The explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with black cube, signed in july, was to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against weinstein that eventually emerged in the new york times and the new yorker. Over the course of a year, weinstein had the agencies \"target, \" or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories. Weinstein monitored the progress of the investigations personally. He also enlisted former employees from his film enterprises to join in the effort, collecting names and placing calls that, according to some sources who received them, felt intimidating. In some cases, the investigative effort was run through weinstein's lawyers, including david boies, a celebrated attorney who represented al gore in the 2000 presidential-election dispute and argued for marriage equality before the u.s.

        "summary": "The latest analysis from fivethirtyeight.com about how the midterms will affect the senate is good news for republicans. The forecast gives the gop a 67 % chance of retaining control. Despite an expected strong performance by democrats in house elections — one that could easily result in their party taking over that chamber — the math for a similar result in the senate looks daunting, writes nate silver in an accompanying post. Consider the basics: democrats have 26 seats up for election in the fall, and 10 of them are in states won by president trump in 2016. Republicans, by contrast, will be defending only nine seats. \" it's about as unfavorable a map as any party has faced in the senate, ever, \" writes silver. His site, for example, projects democrats to win the popular vote for the house by up to 9 percentage points. Normally, such a big margin would translate into a senate flop of power as well, but the site thinks the margin would have to be an even larger 11 points for that to happen. Still, democrats need to flip just two seats in senate, and silver sees five reasonable chances — in arizona, nevada, tennessee, texas, and mississippi, and his post digs into the particulars. Democrats, meanwhile, have vulnerable seats of their own, including in missouri, north dakota, and florida. Click to read the full analysis, or to see details on the numbers.",

Joe manchin in a strong position to retain his seat in west virginia, for instance. It has democrats as ever-so-slight favorites to win the gop-held senate seats in nevada and arizona. It thinks democratic incumbents like missouri's claire mccaskill and north dakota's heidi heitkamp could close well down the stretch. It even gives democrat beto o ' rourke a credible shot in texas — although it has sen. Ted cruz as the favorite in the race. But despite that, the model has democrats as reasonably clear underdogs to take control of the senate. Even though it's more optimistic than the consensus about democrats ' chances in several individual races — and even though the model is generated by the same program that gives democrats around a 5 in 6 chance of winning the house — it nevertheless says republicans have somewhere between a 2 in 3 and 7 in 10 chance to hold the senate, depending on which version of our model you look at.

Just how uphill a task is that for democrats? we currently forecast democrats to win the popular vote for the u.s.

        "summary": "The fallout from the massive panama papers leak has mostly been overseas, where iceland prime minister sigmundur david gunnlaugsson has resigned and britain's prime minister david cameron is facing tough questions over his father's use of offshore shell companies. But us authorities are still keeping a close eye on developments: the leak has exposed hundreds of american citizens, and thousands of us companies, with ties to law firm mossack fonseca's offshore network. More: it is difficult to tell exactly how many americans are involved, but the leaked data includes at least 200 scanned us passports, mcclatchy reports. Many of them appear to be american retirees using shell companies to buy property in costa rica and panama. The data is also believed to include many american dual nationals using their foreign passports for financial dealings. Mcclatchy also reports that four americans accused or convicted of serious financial crimes were able to use mossack fonseca to set up offshore companies. They include benjamin wey, president of new york global group. He was indicted last year on securities fraud charges and is accused of scamming tens of millions from shareholders. Incorporation records show that mossack fonseca has set up more than 1,000 companies in the us since 2001, but it has been named in only a handful of court cases, mostly involving attempts to track money believed to have been hidden in offshore tax havens, usa today reports. Compared to other countries, there are relatively few americans named in the leak, which analysts say could be because loose secrecy laws have made it very easy for americans to set up shell companies in wyoming, nevada, or delaware instead of going overseas. \" if a company in the us can do the exact thing for you as this company in panama, then you might as well do it right here in the us, \" a spokeswoman for the us public interest research group tells nbc news. The new yorker notes that mossack fonseca may have deliberately avoided doing a lot of business in the us to avoid attracting the attention of regulators — and because a 2010 deal between the us and panama requires the latter country to provide american authorities with information on the ownership of companies, among other things.",

On thursday, the rim fire nearly quadrupled in size in 24 hours to more than 63,000 acres, or one-fifth the total land burned in california so far this year, prompting tourists to flee the yosemite area, closing the main highway access to the renowned national park and damaging the hetch hetchy water and power system. The strawberry music festival at camp mather, a popular bluegrass destination for bay area music fans scheduled for next week, was canceled. Overnight into friday morning, the rim fire nearly doubled in size again to about 106,000 acres, or almost the size of san jose. The number of homes threatened jumped from 2,500 to 4,500 friday and the fire crossed over the yosemite national park boundary for the first time. Gov. Jerry brown declared a state of emergency for tuolumne county, five days after the fire started, saying that statewide resources were needed to help with evacuations and emergency shelters as the cost to fight the fire hit $ 5.4 million. Sixteen structures were destroyed, and one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. Bay area crews were among the 2,000 firefighters called in",

            "A rapidly spreading wildfire three times the size of san francisco roared in to yosemite national park on friday, fanning fears that california would actually see the fiery summer many envisioned following the bone-dry winter. On thursday, the rim fire nearly quadrupled in size in 24 hours to more than 63,000 acres, or one-fifth the total land burned in california so far this year, prompting tourists to flee the yosemite area, closing the main highway access to the renowned national park and damaging the hetch hetchy water and power system. The strawberry music festival at camp mather, a popular bluegrass destination for bay area music fans scheduled for next week, was canceled. Overnight into friday morning, the rim fire nearly doubled in size again to about 106,000 acres, or almost the size of san jose. The number of homes threatened jumped from 2,500 to 4,500 friday and the fire crossed over the yosemite national park boundary for the first time. Gov. Jerry brown declared a state of emergency for tuolumne county, five days after the fire started, saying that statewide resources were needed to help with evacuations and emergency shelters as the cost to fight the fire hit $ 5.4 million. Sixteen structures were destroyed, and one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. Bay area crews were among the 2,000 firefighters called in",
            "Update, 3: 45 p.m. Authorities have scheduled a community meeting friday to discuss the rim fire with residents and answer questions. The meeting is set for 7 p.m. At tenaya school, 19177 hwy 120, groveland.

Why? \" they accused us of keeping cow meat, \" akhlaq's daughter, sajida, tells the indian express. About 80 % of indians are hindu and refuse to eat beef for religious reasons, but many of the country's 140 million muslims do eat beef — or at least they did until laws passed or tightened under prime minister narendra modi, a hindu nationalist, banned the practice, per the post. The ap reports the state of uttar pradesh — home to akhlaq, a muslim in his 50s — prohibits the slaughter of cows and those who break the law face arrest. Yet when a rumor spread that akhlaq killed a calf, 100 men in bisara village reportedly took matters into their own hands. They \" broke down our doors and started beating my father and brother, \" sajida says. \" my father was taken outside the house and beaten to death. My brother was dragged to the courtyard downstairs and they used bricks to hit him on the head and chest. \" the 22-year-old is now in critical condition. \" they also tried to molest me and hit my grandmother, \" sajida continues. \" they threatened to kill me if i said a word to the police. \" sajida adds there was only mutton in the fridge. \" the police have taken it for examination. If the results prove that it was not beef, will they bring back my dead father? \" the ap reports eight people are charged with murder and rioting. The express notes protesters set fire to two police cars and one person was shot by police after officers detained the priest of a temple from which the mob reportedly set out.

        "summary": "Cat owners, beware: a parasite found in feline feces could not only make you physically sick, but also mentally so, according to new research. Cats carry a parasite known as toxoplasma gondii, which can be passed to humans through feces. As many as 60 million americans may carry the parasite, but those with fragile immune systems can develop toxoplasmosis — an illness that can cause miscarriages, fetal development disorders, blindness, and even death, cbs news reports. Now, new research suggests t. Gondii could also cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Researchers compared two studies that identified a link between owning a cat as a child and the development of schizophrenia in later life with the results of a 1982 questionnaire that found 50 % of childhood cat owners were eventually diagnosed with a mental illness. Comparatively, 42 % of people who didn't have a cat as a child developed mental illness, reports the toronto sun. The study confirmed that owning a cat early in life could boost the risk of developing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder later. \" cat ownership in childhood has now been reported in three studies to be significantly more common in families in which the child is later diagnosed with schizophrenia or another serious mental illness, \" the authors say. \" in schizophrenia, the evidence of an association with t. Gondii is overwhelming. \" in a separate study, researchers found a person infected with t. Gondii was almost twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as others. They also found the parasite was linked to a greater risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, reports medical news today. To protect against t. Gondii, don't feed your cat raw or undercooked meat, keep the litter box covered, and change the litter daily as t. Gondii isn't contagious until a day after it appears in feces. Washing your hands afterward or wearing gloves will also help. Pregnant women should avoid the task entirely. ( the parasite causes a surprising reaction in mice. )",

In comments tuesday, ryan said it was \" regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout, \" noting \" no one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this. \" but he also expressed support for the policy for security reasons and said he'd had a \" very good conversation \" with homeland security secretary john kelly, whom he is \" confident \" will \" correctly \" implement it, report reuters and the new york times. Amid the uproar on the left, many republicans are joining ryan in backing the executive order. Sens. John mccain and lindsey graham are two prominent exceptions, per the times. However, the hill reports most republicans knew little about the order ahead of time, except that it was in the works. Though judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte said tuesday that some of his staffers had been given the go-ahead to assist trump's transition team in regards to immigration law, ryan says gop leaders were only \" briefed on the contents of [ the order ] as it was being rolled out. \"",

Some of the buzz surrounding the new gmo law: there's still plenty of uncertainty swirling around the gmo labeling requirement, per the ap, which notes congress could as soon as next week move forward on a bill that would upend the vermont law. Here's what implication such a national law could have if put into place, per public news service. The burlington free press reports on retailer confusion and concern about the labeling mandate, including manufacturers who are temporarily asking retailers to handle the labeling and worries about certain vendors who may pull their products out of the state. And it looks like one of the world's biggest brands may be one of those vendors. Coca-cola says it may \" temporarily \" pull some products off of vermont shelves, fox news reports.

The drug didn't help, but eventually the hiccups stopped both times — until they hit a third time with a vengeance, lasting five days and causing vomiting as well. Strangely, the man was also experiencing tingling and numbness in his left arm, and doctors ordered up mri scans of his brain and spinal cord, reports live science. That's when they discovered the highly unusual cause of the hiccups: a large tumor in his neck that was pressing against his phrenic nerve, they report in the journal bmj case reports. The kind of tumor, a \" grossly orange \" hemangioblastoma, as iflscience.com notes, is rare, typically benign, and slow-growing, first forming in the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. \" the tumor was pressing on the roots of the nerves in the cervical spine — the same nerve roots that eventually coalesce into the nerves that go to the diaphragm and trigger hiccups, \" says lead author dr. Mark goldin. \" the problem it causes is simply because of its size, what is called the mass effect.... Physically cutting it out will get rid of the problem. \" and so far, it has. The man was discharged just four days after surgery to remove the tumor, and his mris have been clean with every subsequent visit. And no, no more debilitating bouts of hiccuping.

He was offered an antipsychotic drug called chlorpromazine, which is also commonly used to relieve persistent hiccups, but unfortunately it didn't work. Upon return the following month, he presented with hiccups that had lasted for five days straight, alongside vomiting.

State law, however, still considers marijuana possession a criminal offense punishable by one year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine, and state rep. William lamberth has threatened to punish nashville by withholding state highway funds. He complains that by giving police discretion on how to treat marijuana possession, the move will create situations where \" two different individuals face drastically different penalties. \"",

The british couple's three children have released a bittersweet photo of their parents holding hands from their hospital beds; it was taken shortly before mike bennet, 57, died last monday, the bbc reports. Julie bennet, 50, died on saturday, leaving behind luke, 21; hannah, 18; and oliver, 13. Family friend heather gallagher says the \" down-to-earth \" clan was \" known to all for their generosity. \" that generosity is being returned to them: a crowdfunding campaign begun to help the kids, who are from irby in wirral, has raised $ 175,000 as of this writing. \" julie has kept the children in a normal routine whilst dealing with mike's illness over the past few years, \" says gallagher; the cabinet maker was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2013. Then last may, julie got a devastating diagnosis of her own. Cancer had invaded the grade school teacher's liver and kidneys, and would eventually spread to other organs, itv reports. Friend sue wright tells the bbc she made julie bennet a bedside promise: \" i told her the community would come together to help look after her kids — and she opened her eyes and smiled. \" gallagher tells the bbc the kids \" are astounded \" by what's been contributed so far, which is 280 % of the initial target. She adds that their aunts and uncles plan to look after them, and that the money will help them get through college. ( these viral photos involve a 3-year-old boy. )",

He tells wdiv he's faced \" straight-up racism \" from fellow officers and city officials. Brown says he was \" proud \" when he got the results of the dna test, but his fellow officers seemed confused why he'd feel that way. Brown's lawsuit claims he was called \" kunta \" by his chief and had fellow officers whisper \" black lives matter \" at him when they passed. He says the mayor at the time used a joke with the word \" negroid \" around him, and someone put a black santa in his department christmas stocking. Brown is seeking at least $ 500,000, claiming he's suffered stress and related health complications from his coworkers ' behavior, cnn reports. The city is contesting the lawsuit, claiming it was brown making racial jokes. The city says officers never brought it up, but brown kept approaching them and saying things like he now gets why he \" likes chicken so much \" and \" the 18 % is all in my pants. \" furthermore, the city says brown has a history of making disparaging comments about black people. For his part, brown says the experience has made him better understand the animosity between the black community and police.

Police say the girl made a noose out of a scarf and hung herself from a shower door after live-streaming for two hours. A friend of the girl's saw the video on facebook and called 911, but officers were too late after initially being sent to the wrong address. A family friend described the girl as a \" smart \" student who \" loved to smile. According to a herald followup, the superintendent of miami schools blames facebook and other social media sites for not doing more to stop kids from broadcasting suicides or bullying. He calls the girl's death \" abhorrent and horrifying. \" the girl's death happened the same day a 33-year-old man in los angeles killed himself while live-streaming on facebook, fox news reports. And on dec. 30, a 12-year-old girl in georgia killed herself in a live video posted to the website live.me, according to snopes. Facebook live has also hosted videos of attempted suicides in hong kong, thailand, and ohio in just the past few weeks. Facebook says it monitors live videos to the best of its ability and has a system in place wherein if someone reports a live video showing a suicide attempt, the site can shut it down and send links to suicide-prevention services or other resources. Despite the recent headlines, the head of a suicide-prevention organization says live-streamed suicides are still uncommon.",

        "summary": "Steve bannon's exit from the national security council this week has led to a slew of headlines about a rift in the white house between him and trump son-in-law jared kushner. One main theme in coverage suggests that kushner's moderate views are beginning to triumph over bannon's more ideological ones. Here's a look: the daily beast reports that bannon has been telling people that kushner is a \" cuck \" and a \" globablist. \" a \" cuck, \" for the uninitiated, is a popular insult on the alt-right. It's short for cuckservative, a combination of cuckold and conservative, and is a nasty slam for someone deemed conservative-lite. Bannon also considers himself a nationalist, in favor of closed borders, so both terms are high crimes in his view. This escalating feud could mean the departure of both bannon and chief of staff reince priebus, reports axios. House majority leader kevin mccarthy is being floated for chief of staff, it adds. Why is preibus in trouble? the atlantic's guide to this \" battle for the soul of the trump white house \" has this from a source: \"for whatever reason bannon seems to be allied with reince, and bannon seems to be opposed by jared. \" in the analysis, bannon says rumors that he's threatened to quit are \" absurd. \" the washington post has a deep dive into the turmoil, casting it as the \" bannonites \" versus \" centrist financiers \" led by kushner and national economic council chief gary cohn, a registered democrat ( and a name also floated by axios as a potential chief of staff ). One insider sums up the main complaint against bannon thusly: he \" isn't making'dad ' look good. \" the new york times has a similar theme, adding that trump himself seems genuinely torn between the two factions, \" tilting one way or the other depending on the day. \" each side is trying to stick close to the president's side, while waging proxy wars in the media. One telling quote in the times piece: a source says that during one bannon-kushner argument, bannon declared: \"here's the reason there's no middle ground. You're a democrat. \" a post at npr observes that trump has long surrounded himself with competing factions and seems to thrive on it. But it also questions whether the \" chaos theory of trump, \" while effective in the business world, can succeed under the unique challenges of the presidency.",

Those big guns were beekeepers, notes smithsonian, and they had a neat trick: hose the little buzzing critters. \" there's no rounding them up, \" explained a police spokesperson. \" the water will calm and disperse their activity. \" oddly, state police were able to dust off a \" bee swarm removal procedure \" drawn up 14 years earlier but never used.

They had previously offered to buy him out, saying, \" you're not getting screwed out of anything, \" the suit notes. Warstler, however, allegedly rejected the buyout, forbes reports. Droll and buffington proceeded to dissolve locus without warning warstler, the suit says. Warstler is seeking a third of yik yak as well as damages. Yik yak, which allows anonymous postings to message boards, is nearly as popular as snapchat, gawker notes — and the two have more in common. Warstler is working with the same law firm that represented a co-founder of snapchat, which was also created by a trio of fraternity brothers, in a similar case. Warstler \" was responsible for yik yak going viral at furman \" when it first started in oct. 2013, his lawyer says; warstler was still a senior at the time, but droll and buffington had graduated.

It isn't yet clear whether the projectiles were missiles, artillery, or rockets; pyongyang called them missiles, but south korea says they were most likely conventional shells, al jazeera reports. Either way, more warnings have now been issued: \" north korea should refrain from all provocative actions, including missile launches, which are in clear violation of un resolutions, \" the us special envoy for north korea said monday. North korea has been ratcheting up the war rhetoric as of late, firing short-range missiles and artillery and noting both seoul and washington, dc, are squarely in its sights for preemptive nuclear strikes, per reuters. Cnn notes 15 projectiles have been launched on four separate occasions since early february. Meanwhile, even china is urging its ally to simmer down as the us and south korea hold their largest drills ever, with 300,000 south korean troops and at least 17,000 us soldiers. \" we hope north korea does not do anything to contravene un security council resolutions, \" a chinese foreign ministry rep said, per reuters. \" we also hope all sides can remain calm and exercise restraint and avoid doing anything to exacerbate confrontation. \" ( north korea sentenced a us student to 15 years of hard labor. )",

In 2013, he was investigated for making \" inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorists, \" hopper says, and in 2014, the fbi investigated a possible link to american suicide bomber and fellow fort pierce, fla., resident moner mohammad abusalha and \" determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time. \" mateen reportedly pledged allegiance to isis after launching the massacre at the pulse nightclub in orlando, fla., in which at least 50 people died.

He was able to buy the weapons legally in the week before the shootings despite being on the fbi's radar, the guardian reports. Mateen was a new york-born american citizen and the son of afghan immigrants, reports reuters. He worked as a security guard for a gated retirement community, and security firm g4s, which has employed him for nine years, says he passed two background checks.

A century ago, on sept. 21, 1915, cecil chubb set off for an auction \" and came back with something rather different \" than the practical household items wife mary was hoping for — that being stonehenge, for which he plunked down £ 6,600 \" on a whim, \" reports the bbc. That works out to just over $ 1 million in today's currency, which didn't exactly thrill mary. No one knows the true motive behind chubb's splurge, but there was talk of a wealthy american who wanted to dismantle what is now an iconic tourist destination and ship it overseas, and chubb, a local, may have wanted to keep it in its original home. Chubb, born in 1876 to a saddler and harness-maker in the village of shrewton just a few miles up the road, worked his way up to cambridge university, became a lawyer, and made a fortune. When he gave stonehenge away just three years later in october of 1918, he stipulated that the general public should get in for less than a shilling a visit and locals should get in for free. \" cecil chubb did a great thing in trying to return stonehenge to the people and to ensure a legacy of free and unfettered access, \" one local says. The guardian reports that chubb wrote at the time: \" i became the owner of it with a deep sense of pleasure … [ but ] it has been pressed upon me that the nation would like to have it for its own. \" ( as for why stonehenge was built, there's a theory involving stilts. )",

But the high court in london has dashed that dream after ruling that the fertilized eggs of the woman, who died at age 28 in 2011, can't be transported to the us clinic where her mother would have had them implanted, the bbc reports. Even though the daughter signed off on having her eggs stored after she died, she neglected to fill out a form that specified how the eggs were to be used, the ap reports. Presiding justice duncan ouseley called it \" a very sad case, \" but added that the daughter hadn't legally indicated she wanted her mother to be her surrogate, and that there was no proof she had considered her mom being named the legal mother of her own grandchildren or how a pregnancy would affect her mom's health, the guardian notes. In what a london fertility expert tells the independent may have been the world's first such case, the woman's mother says in a statement her daughter told them, \" i didn't go through ivf to save my eggs for nothing. I want you and dad to bring them up, they will be safe with you, \" the bbc notes. But the human fertilisation and embryology authority decided last year there wasn't enough legal evidence to prove that wish, and it refused to allow the eggs to travel overseas. \" this is a very sad case, and the ruling must be heartbreaking for the couple, \" an hfea rep says, per the guardian. \" our committee considered this case on three separate occasions... But decided that there was not the kind of fully informed consent required by the law. \" the woman's parents can still appeal, per the bbc.

        "summary": "Strolling through a guyana rainforest one night, a scientist heard some rustling and thought he'd encountered a furry mammal. Well, he was right about the furry part. The creature was actually a goliath birdeater spider, livescience reports — the world's biggest type of spider, according to the guinness book of world records. It can weigh up to 6 ounces. For comparison, national geographic reports a black widow weighs roughly.035 ounces; that's 170 times lighter. Scientist piotr naskrecki writes its weight is \" about as much as a young puppy, \" while its leg span can be a foot long, comparable with a kid's forearm, notes livescience. The body itself is fist-sized, naskrecki says. The fangs? two inches long. The thing won't kill you, but its bite feels \" like driving a nail through your hand. \" and when it rubs its legs on its body, it can fire out hairs carrying tiny barbs, which can really hurt and itch if they get you in the eyes. Ultimately, however, it seems the spider is just unpleasant, and not too common: \" a chicken can probably do more damage, \" naskrecki notes, adding that he's only seen one three times in as many as 15 years spent working in south america. Though mnn reports the spider was given the \" birdeater \" name after being discovered while eating a hummingbird, \" they rarely have a chance to [ kill birds ] while scouring the forest floor at night, \" naskrecki writes on his blog. \" rather, they seem to be feeding on what is available in this moist and warm habitat, and what is available is earthworms — lots of them. \" ( a possibly freakier spider story: a spider burrowed into a man's chest for three days. )",

Patrick swanton tells the waco tribune-herald there's still \" plenty of room in our jail \" for gang members who travel to the city seeking payback. The waco police department said this morning that 192 people were being booked on organized crime charges. Swanton says the deadly brawl, which left at least 18 people injured, began in a restroom at the twin peaks restaurant before spilling outside. He says members of five rival gangs had gathered for a meeting at the restaurant; he adds it was the bloodiest crime scene he has seen in 34 years of law enforcement. Some restaurant patrons and employees locked themselves in a freezer to escape the fight, kwtx reports. Police say officers were already outside the restaurant when the brawl began and some of the armed bikers were shot by police, the ap reports. The bikers allegedly fired on police before they were shot, and police say they prevented further deaths by firing on the bikers. Swanton blames twin peaks management for allowing the establishment — the interior of which is now littered with bullet casings — to become a gang hangout. \" what happened here today could have been avoided, \" he tells the tribune-herald. \" they failed and this is what happened. \" swanton says all nine people killed were gang members, as are the 18 injured people, some of whom are being treated for both knife and gunshot wounds.",

            "San antonio - bexar county sheriff's deputies on thursday night rescued eight children from a home in the northeast part of the county. Two toddlers were found around 11: 45 p.m. In the backyard of a home in the 8100 block of chipping. One of them was chained to the ground and another was tied to a door with a dog leash, the sheriff's office said. Inside the home, deputies found six more unattended children, ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years old. The children were found after a woman called 911 and told dispatchers she suspected children were being abused at the home. She told authorities she had heard crying coming from the backyard for at least a couple of hours. \" our deputies arrive to the house, they knock on the front door ( and ) no one answers.

Deputies arrived at the home after receiving a call just before midnight about a child crying for a long time, bexar county sheriff's office spokesman james keith said. The deputies didn't get a response when they knocked on the front door, and when they looked in the backyard they discovered the two restrained children. \" it's sickening.

That's the assignment for a group of us navy-trained dolphins that mexican officials hope will save the endangered vaquita, the bbc reports. The plan is for the dolphins to find the pint-size porpoises, who are known for their smirks, and herd them to safety at a marine refuge. At only 55 inches long, the vaquitas, or \" little cows, \" are the smallest and most threatened marine mammal, per the ap. There are fewer than 40 of them left in the world, which means in the gulf of california, their only habitat. The dolphin mission is set to deploy in september. \" we've spent the past year working alongside the us navy with a group of dolphins they had trained to search for missing scuba divers, \" mexico's environment minister tells formula radio, per the bbc. Now the dolphins are being retrained to hunt for vaquitas. In another bid to protect the porpoise, mexico last week permanently banned fishing with gill nets — also called ghost nets, as they're nearly invisible to marine life, notes the ap — in the upper gulf. The nets are used to catch fish such as the totoaba, valued in chinese medicine for its bladder, by trapping their heads but not their bodies. Illegal use of the nets has drawn the condemnation of conservation groups and a foundation run by leonardo dicaprio, who tweeted the ban was \" great news. \" mexico is the first country to ban gill nets. ( a totoaba bladder can fetch more than $ 4,000. )",

But in something out of upton sinclair's the jungle, bloomberg notes, an oxfam america report suggests that \" value \" is really a humiliating issue for already marginalized workers in the us poultry industry ( which the report notes is enjoying record profits ): a denial of bathroom breaks, leading to workers urinating and defecating themselves on the processing line, keeping their fluid intake at dangerously low levels, and wearing diapers on the job. Workers from pilgrim's, as well as tyson foods, perdue, and sanderson farms — the four companies that make up 60 % of the us poultry market, per a press release — are specifically called out in the \" no relief \" report, compiled over three years via hundreds of interviews with current and ex-workers, medical experts, and advocacy groups. \" it's not just their dignity that suffers: they are in danger of serious health problems, \" the report reads. Per the report, supervisors poke fun at, threaten, or turn a blind eye to bathroom break requests, imposing strict time limits and forcing workers to wait more than an hour in some cases. Not only would these allegations be violations of osha \" sanitary standards, \" such practices would also pose serious health risks, including utis ( especially for women ), kidney infections, and pressure on the bladder and urethra that could prove fatal. While sanderson's cfo wouldn't comment on the report when contacted by bloomberg, the other three companies all issued outraged statements noting they ' ll be checking up on the veracity. \" poultry workers are some of the most vulnerable people in our country — most are minorities and immigrants, some are recently resettled refugees, \" says a national employment law project fellow. \" poultry companies know they can get away with [ these ] practices, because these workers are too fearful to speak up. \" ( amputations are also an issue in some plants. )",

        "summary": "What started out as a well-intentioned parenting arrangement has deteriorated into one of the most \" bruising and distressing \" cases a british family court judge has ever seen, the telegraph reports. A gay man in a civil partnership decided to donate his sperm to a lesbian friend ( also in a civil partnership ), but a nearly six-year feud between the four parties over their informal deal has left their 9-year-old and 13-year-old daughters \" irredeemably marred \" by a \" sense of mutual loathing \" between all of their parents, justice cobb wrote in his rulings, per the independent. The problems started when the two dads tried to get legal approval to have contact with the girls; the moms apparently didn't think that was a good idea and put up a \" high-wall fortress \" against anyone who didn't agree with them, according to social workers cited in the telegraph. Although the girls are said to be \" polite and highly intelligent \" by teachers, the judge believes they've suffered emotional damage from the often-bitter battle, as have the parents: the biological mother suffers from \" serious mental health problems \" that were only exacerbated by the infighting, the ruling says. In a move designed to end the girls'distress once and for all, the judge ruled that they ' ll live with their moms under social worker supervision — despite \" domestic problems \" between the women — and the dads will be allowed to have contact with the younger daughter on \" specified occasions \" and write to the older daughter, who reportedly doesn't want contact, notes the independent.

The country's interim interior minister has issued an arrest warrant accusing the ex-leader of \" mass murder of peaceful citizens \" over the deaths of scores of protesters in kiev last week, the bbc reports. Yanukovich, who fled the capital over the weekend while still declaring himself the country's legitimate leader, seems highly unlikely to turn himself in. Officials say he was last seen in the autonomous and strongly pro-russia crimea region, but left by car for an unknown destination. The obama administration has warned russia against sending troops to ukraine, which is split between a pro-russia east and pro-european union west, voice of america reports. Russian intervention would be a \" grave mistake, \" national security adviser susan rice warned yesterday. \" it is not in the interest of ukraine or of russia, or europe, or the united states to see the country split. It is in nobody's interest to see violence return and the situation escalate. \" but dmitry medvedev said he had \" great doubts \" about the legitimacy of the new government. \" some of our foreign, western partners think otherwise, \" he told russian media, according to the afp. \" this is some kind of aberration of perception when people call legitimate what is essentially the result of an armed mutiny. \" the kremlin has recalled its ambassador to kiev, and there have been pro-yanukovich demonstrations in russia. But fears of a split are easing, the new york times finds. Yanukovich's own party has now turned against him, issuing a statement accusing him of betraying a country that now finds itself \" deceived and robbed. \" parliament speaker and acting president oleksandr turchinov — an ally of now-freed yanukovich archrival yulia tymoshenko is expected to form a unity government before tomorrow to run the country until elections in may. But whoever takes charge will face very tough challenges, including an economy in crisis, reuters notes. To ease the transition, the eu and us have both offered financial aid.",

        "summary": "Thursday was what politico calls \" the nastiest day of the general election battle so far, \" with hillary clinton and donald trump trading insults and accusations of racism. In a campaign video and speech thursday, clinton linked trump to the far right and described him as a \" profoundly dangerous \" candidate who is \" taking hate groups mainstream. \" trump, speaking to cnn, described clinton as a \" bigot \" who \" talks a good game \" but is doing nothing for minorities. He also called her a bigot on wednesday, telling a rally she saw people of color as nothing but votes. In other developments: reuters reports that a federal judge in florida has ordered the state department to release clinton emails from the week of the benghazi attack by no later than sept. 13, a month earlier than planned. In a speech in new hampshire thursday, trump described clinton's accusation of racism as an attack on \" millions of decent americans \" who support him, the washington post reports. \" it's the oldest play in the democratic playbook, \" he said. \" when democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: you're racist, you're racist, you're racist. \" the new york times notes that clinton's thursday remarks, in which she accused trump of peddling \" racist lies \" and giving new strength to an \" emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right, \" appeared to be aimed largely at moderate republicans. Trump's campaign is \" a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump, \" she said. Trump, speaking to cnn thursday, said he doesn't want the votes of white supremacists and he doesn't know what the term \" alt-right \" even means, the hill reports. \" nobody even knows what it is, and she didn't know what it was, \" said trump, whose new campaign chief, steve bannon, has described breitbart as \" the platform for the alt-right. \" politico reports that trump's apparent shift on immigration policy has annoyed ann coulter, but amused rush limbaugh. \" who knew that it would be donald trump to come on and convert the gop base to supporting amnesty the same week ann coulter's book comes out, \" limbaugh laughed thursday. Jeb bush, meanwhile, told another radio host that it's \" disturbing \" how trump seems to be \" morphing into \" the things he was against.",

        "summary": "The days of buying fruit with the best of intentions only to watch it molder on the counter may be over. In a study published friday in scientific reports, engineers at tufts university report using silk to keep fruit fresh for a week without refrigeration. They dipped strawberries and bananas into an \" odorless, biocompatible silk solution \" made of water and silk fibroin proteins, according to a press release. After dipping, engineers exposed the fruit to water vapor in a vacuum, which caused the silk proteins to bind and form a \" protective film, \" gizmodo explains. The film is so thin it's nearly invisible, and upi reports it's biodegradable and safe to eat. Seven days after being coated, the strawberries were still \" juicy and firm \" and the bananas hadn't turned into brown mush. \" silk fibroin coatings enhance fruits'shelf life at room conditions by reducing cell respiration rate and water evaporation, \" according to the study. The study also found the coating didn't change the fruit's texture, though a report on what it did to taste was conspicuously absent. \" the coating could be a wonderful idea if human taste buds can't perceive it, but until that's proven, the coating won't be covering anything you eat, \" gizmodo states.
