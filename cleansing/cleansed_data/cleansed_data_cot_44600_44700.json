Second president john adams tops the list with 9,893, while revolutionary war financier robert morris comes in second at 7,367 ( perhaps both are a coincidence given john and robert as well as adams and morris are common to begin with ). Congressman and famous signature-writer john hancock, meanwhile, claims a far more modest ( but likely more intentional ) 1,616 namesakes, ranking a distant third. \" it's interesting to note that the top two most common names, john adams and robert morris, are most popular in florida, \" says liz powell, culture and trend expert from whitepages, in a news release. \" while florida may have been the 27th state to enter the union, it is the number one state for patriotic names. \" only one name, meanwhile, belongs to a woman ( whitepages admits she wasn't a founding father but gave her a spot all the same ), and that's seamstress betsy ross. She came in 14th on the list of 14 with 163 namesakes. And while several names are probably to be expected ( samuel adams comes in 5th place, thomas jefferson in 8th, and benjamin franklin in 9th ), abraham lincoln's name is rather mysteriously missing. In the realm of more general patriotic names, livescience points out that liberty ranked 532nd as far as girls ' baby names go last year; america took the 777th spot.

Per cnn, obama is in negotiations regarding a \" production partnership \" with netflix, in which the former president and michelle obama would be involved in creating exclusive content for the streaming service. What that content would be, and how much of it, is still up in the air, though ideas floated include everything from inspirational narratives, michelle-hosted shows on topics like nutrition, or barack moderating episodes on hot-button subjects such as health care and immigration. Also unclear is how much the obamas would earn, though one analyst estimates it could be as much as $ 500 million, per newsweek. The move could be an obama attempt to push back against the misinformation and \" manipulation of news \" he has complained about in recent months, giving him \" an unfiltered method of communication with the public similar to the audiences he already reaches through social media, \" per the new york times, which describes the negotiations as \" advanced. \" ( netflix has 118 million subscribers. ) what the shows won't be doing, sources say: getting directly combative with either president trump or conservatives who've been critical of obama.

And then, poof, they switch to a simpler tune and start the cycle over again. In fact, lead researcher jenny allen of the university of queensland refers to this switch as a \" cultural revolution \" in a uq news release. So why the abrupt change to a new tune? one theory is that the songs become so complex that the whales reach their limit of being able to learn new material, according to the study in proceedings of the royal society b. The researchers studied 412 song cycles from 95 singing whales over 13 years, per science. While the whales generally sing the same song, the researchers found that individuals add their own touches, perhaps to help them stand out.

The new york times set this one off with a tweet of two photos, one showing the new england patriots visiting trump at the white house on wednesday and another showing them visiting president obama in 2015. The obama crowd was much bigger. A few hours later, the patriots took public exception to the tweet with one of their own complaining that the images \" lack context. \" and they have a point: the 2015 photo included players, coaches, and administrative staff. The 2017 photo included players and coaches only â€” those same staffers were seated in the audience. All of which caught the attention of trump himself, who tweeted thursday: \" failing @nytimes, which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning new england patriots visit to w.h. \" it's true that fewer players attended this year's event than in 2015 â€” 34 vs. About 50. But a team spokesman says even that comparison is unfair given that it's the team's second super bowl win in three years, reports the boston globe. It's just human nature that fewer would come this time, he suggested, not politics. However, at least one player skipped because of the president's politics, notes the washington post: free safety devin mccourty. Qb tom brady also skipped this year, though he cited family reasons, and he skipped in 2015, too. Meanwhile, the huffington post notes that his wife, gisele bundchen, issued a tweet wednesday perceived as anti-trump. It's since been deleted, but it supported an april 29 march in dc against new white house environmental policies. \" march for climate, jobs, and justice, \" it read.",

        "summary": "A veteran of the us navy walked nine miles to a veterans affairs clinic in new jersey earlier this month, poured gasoline on himself, and set himself ablaze. Charles richard ingram iii, 51, died later on march 19 at a burn center in philadelphia. \" gasoline burns extremely hot, so how he survived the short time that he did was in my opinion a little unbelievable, \" says a local fire chief. Self-immolation is often linked to protest, the daily beast notes, but attempts to learn more about ingram's psychological state haven't led to much. Known as \" rich, \" he's a seven-year veteran who served on the uss la salle, and was chief on deck when it went to the newly liberated kuwait on march 12, 1991. After his service, he married billie bessler and settled with her in egg harbor, nj, but knocks at their door went unanswered. The northfield, nj, clinic where ingram killed himself is designed to help people in remote or rural areas who live far from population hubs. Because most specialists ( psychiatrists included ) are in cities, they assist people via teleconference â€” something ingram likely did or was planning to do if he was getting psychiatric help, says police capt. Paul newman. Ingram also leaves behind two kids, ages 3 and 5, who were photographed in a local newspaper the day before ingram's death. A 2015 study says the suicide rate among recent veterans of the us military is roughly 50 % more than the civilian rate ( 29.5 per 100,000 veterans ), rt.com reports. Whistleblowers, lawmakers, and veterans have harshly criticized the department of veterans affairs over the degree of care it provides veterans.",

Some of the \" treasure, \" however, offers a look at a very different side of his crew's life. Researchers have discovered an array of medical artifacts on the ship, called the queen anne's revenge, which ran aground off north carolina in 1718, livescience reports. Among them is a urethral syringe that once contained mercury, which was used as a syphilis treatment, researcher linda carnes-mcnaughton says. That might have caused more problems than it solved. \" eventually, the mercury kills you \" if you take too much, carnes-mcnaughton notes. Also discovered were what's left of two devices, known as pump clysters, intended for sending fluid into one's rectum. Researchers plan further investigation to figure out just why the crew needed them. The ship also contained equipment likely used for bloodletting. Sure, blackbeard might have been vicious, but he did seem to care about health, carnes-mcnaughton explains. When he captured the ship, he let most of its crew go â€” but not the surgeons. And in a blockade of charleston, blackbeard's primary demand was for a medicine chest, the smithsonian reports. Livescience has images of the equipment that's been discovered; if you'd like to see blackbeard's gear up close, some of it is on display in a newly updated exhibit in north carolina, the sun journal reports.

John mcdonald, an evolutionary biologist, is out to debunk what he calls a myth about the genetic roots of tongue-rolling, pbs news reports. He says many of his undergrad students walk into class at the university of delaware believing the skill is passed down through generations, and you can see why in textbooks like biology for cxc: \" try rolling your tongue longways into a u-shape, \" the book reads. \" some people can do this, others can't. Tongue-rolling is caused by a dominant gene which we can call t. \" pretty specific, yet untrue, says mcdonald. The misinformation began in 1940, when geneticist alfred sturtevant wrote that tongue rolling was a genetic trait that relies on one dominant gene. His theory was debunked 12 years later by researcher philip matlock, who noted that in seven of 33 pairs of identical twins, one twin could roll his tongue while the other couldn't. ( his 1952 paper also noted 65 % of the population has a tongue-rolling ability. ) that ruled out the dominant gene theory, and sturtevant later backed down. Yet the belief remains so dominant that mcdonald says kids have written him fearing they were adopted because they can't tongue-roll like their parents. Genetics may play some role, however. Mcdonald points to a 1971 study that found non-identical twins were twice as likely to not share tongue-rolling ability as identical ones, \" which is additional evidence that there is some genetic influence. \" still, \" tongue rolling is not a simple genetic character, \" he writes at the university of delaware. \" despite this, tongue rolling is probably the most commonly used classroom example of a simple genetic trait in humans. \" ( speaking of genetics, you and your spouse may have similar dna. )",

Many studies have shown that the myth is incorrect, but tongue rolling remains a popular subject in genetics classes. The reality tongue rolling as a character rolled tongue; non-rolled tongue. Most people, when first asked, either can easily roll their tongue ( here called \" r \" ), or cannot roll it at all ( \" nr \" ). The proportion of people who can roll their tongue ranges from 65 to 81 percent, with a slightly higher proportion of tongue-rollers in females than in males ( sturtevant 1940, urbanowski and wilson 1947, liu and hsu 1949, komai 1951, lee 1955 ).

Alfred sturtevant ( one of the pioneers of drosophila genetics ) described tongue rolling as a simple two-allele character, with the allele for rolling ( usually given the symbol t or r ) being dominant over the allele for non-rolling ( t or r ) ( sturtevant 1940 ). Many studies have shown that the myth is incorrect, but tongue rolling remains a popular subject in genetics classes. The reality tongue rolling as a character rolled tongue; non-rolled tongue. Most people, when first asked, either can easily roll their tongue ( here called \" r \" ), or cannot roll it at all ( \" nr \" ). The proportion of people who can roll their tongue ranges from 65 to 81 percent, with a slightly higher proportion of tongue-rollers in females than in males ( sturtevant 1940, urbanowski and wilson 1947, liu and hsu 1949, komai 1951, lee 1955 ). However, some people, especially children, cannot roll their tongue when first asked but later learn to do so ( sturtevant 1940 ). Komai ( 1951 ) found that the proportion of tongue-rollers among japanese schoolchildren increased from 54 percent at"

        "summary": "House republicans want to get rid of the affordable care act's subsidies, medicaid expansion, and individual mandate, according to a leaked draft of a bill to repeal obamacare. The bill, which was obtained by politico, would give money to states to cover some people with pre-existing conditions and replace subsidies with tax credits based on age rather than income. As it stands, people under 30 would get a $ 2,000 tax credit, while people over 60 would get $ 4,000. Vox, which has an in-depth explanation of the bill, reports that sets up the possibility that tax credits would mostly benefit richer americans, who are typically older. But insurance, as laid out in the bill, would overall be better for younger, healthier people than older people. And it would still be possible to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. House republicans plan to pay for their healthcare plan by restricting tax breaks on employer health plans. This is a version of obamacare's \" cadillac tax, \" which was opposed by businesses, unions â€” and republicans. The draft bill is likely to change as it passes through various committees. Meanwhile, obamacare is more popular than it's been in seven years. A survey released friday shows 48 % have a favorable view of the aca compared to 42 % with a negative view, us news reports. That's a sizable turn around from december, when only 43 % viewed it favorably and 46 % viewed it negatively. According to usa today, nearly 50 % of people polled were worried a family member would lose coverage if the aca is repealed.",

As smithsonian recounts, legend has it that the location of the mongolian warrior's tomb was safeguarded by soldiers who murdered the tomb builders and were then killed themselves. University of california-san diego scientist albert yu-min lin has been on the hunt for this \" needle in a haystack, \" and since 2010, he's had some help: under his valley of the khans project, volunteers were able to visit a national geographic website, sift through high-res images of mongolia taken by orbital satellites, and flag any features they spotted. Except no similar burials have been uncovered in mongolia, so \" the appearance of the needle is undefined. \" in a paper published dec. 30 in plos one, lin reports on what was accomplished in the first six months. Some 10,000 volunteers spent 30,000 hours ( that's 3.4 years ) examining roughly 2,300 square miles ( two times yosemite's size ) that had been tiled into 84,183 images. They were asked to tag any feature they spotted as a road, river, modern structure, ancient structure, or other. Participants tagged 2.3 million sites, and the researchers used \" consensus, defined by kernel density estimation, to pool human perception \" for features with potentially ancient origins. The field team explored 100 of those and positively identified 55 sites with archaeological significance ( no genghis khan tomb, sadly ), including bronze age burial mounds. The researchers ask: could archaeologists have found these themselves? their answer: a ground search would have been \" prohibitive, \" and a scan of the images would have required an archaeologist to scan through 20,000 screens.

        "summary": "Ami strahan lost her husband on father's day when a motor home he was working on fell atop him. Less than three months later, she'd also lose her son. Sam strahan was shot in the head shortly after 10am wednesday by a schoolmate at freeman high school in spokane county, wash., possibly as the sophomore tried to stop the shooter, reports the spokesman-review. Caleb sharpe, whom a friend says had recently become interested in school shooting documentaries, had been seen carrying a duffel bag on the bus to school, per the review. Once inside the building, he allegedly pulled an ar-15 rifle from within, the review reports. When it jammed, he withdrew a handgun, witnesses say. According to one account, sharpe shot into the ceiling, then killed strahan as he tried to intervene. \" his face was completely passive, \" a student says of sharpe, who reportedly fired shots down a hallway. Three females were hit â€” including one in the back and one in the abdomen â€” before a custodian tackled sharpe, witnesses say. Those injured are in stable condition, while sharpe is now in a juvenile detention center. The teen â€” who showed off guns on his youtube channel, archived here â€” had warned friends in a series of notes, passed to a counselor, that he planned to do \" something stupid, \" per the review. Spokane county sheriff ozzie knezovich describes the motive for the shooting as \" a bullying type of situation. \" as for strahan, \" he gave everything to protect those who are in harm's way \" and \" that's how he ' ll be remembered, \" knezovich tells the washington post.",

        "summary": "The dow eclipsed 22,000 for the first time in its 121-year history on wednesday, helped to the mark soon after the opening bell by a strong earnings report from apple. The index fell below the mark at points during the day but closed in milestone territory at 22,016, per the ap. ( the s&p 500 ticked up incrementally to 2,477 and the nasdaq ticked down a smidge to 6,362. ) the dow's record has prompted a flood of commentary and factoids. Examples: biggest gainer: since march 1, shares of boeing had contributed 380 points to the dow as of wednesday morning, more than any other company and ahead of mcdonald's ( 171 ), unitedhealth ( 166 ), caterpillar ( 99 ), and 3m ( 91 ), per cnbc. The biggest detractor? ibm had the largest loss over the same span, 251 points. Dollar's role: as the dow has risen, the us dollar has declined, losing about 10 % of its value against major world currencies. The new york times explores how the two are related, as does usa today, which notes that a weak dollar helps big companies that do business abroad because their products are more affordable in foreign currencies. Trump's start: the dow's close above 22,000 means that it has risen 20 % in the 183 trading days since election day, per the wall street journal. For a new president, that's second only to george hw bush ( 171 days ) and ahead of barack obama ( 537 ), george w. Bush ( 1,626 ), and bill clinton ( 308 ). Hold the applause: at marketwatch, rex nutting argues that the cheerleading over the dow's rise is overblown, given that most americans don't own very many shares. The rise helps the richest americans, while the young in particular are out of luck. \" i bought my first shares for my retirement account back in the 1970s, so i've benefited from the incredible gains since then, \" he writes. \" but my children are buying high, not low. \" warning signs: at moneywatch, anthony mirhaydari is worried about weak economic fundamentals in regard to personal income growth, manufacturing, us auto sales, consumer sentiment, and more. As for this current surge: \" enjoy it while it lasts. \" why the rise? president trump has been touting the surging dow for a while now, and a post at barron's suggests he's due some of the credit. He and the gop \" have campaigned on business-friendly policies such as a lower corporate tax rate and",

The result? breastfeeding had no effect on 10 out of 11 long-term health and well-being outcomes, and for the 11th â€” asthma â€” it actually increased risk. \" i ' m not saying breast-feeding is not beneficial, \" colen says. But if it doesn't improve long-term outcomes, \" we really need to focus on other things \" that do, like maternity leave policies and subsidized day care. Colen's study doesn't examine, or attempt to contradict, previous work showing short-term immunity boosts against chest and gut infections for infants, the new scientist explains. One breastfeeding advocate argued that the study is flawed, complaining for instance that babies fed with a mix of breast milk and formula were counted as breastfed.",

        "summary": "Nestle may find itself muttering \" give me a break, \" but perhaps with an expletive tossed in at the end. The company on wednesday lost its latest attempt to trademark its four-finger chocolate bar shape in the uk, in what has been a 7-year battle. The guardian reports that after months of deliberation, a three-judge appeals panel explained in 16,000 words that the kitkat shape is not a \" badge of origin \" and has \" no inherent distinctiveness. \" ouch. The global confectionery has been fighting its rival mondelez, the us owner of cadbury, on the issue since 2010. The bbc reports that the two have gone at it over other would-be trademarks, calling out cadbury's failed attempt in 2013 to register the shade of purple used in its dairy milk packaging ( pantone 2685c, for the curious ). Shapes can in fact be trademarked if proven distinctive enough ( think coca-cola's bottle, or, on the candy front, toblerone's \" zigzag prism \" bar ), but it's often a slog, and a long one at that. An intellectual property lawyer explains what's at stake in cases like these: trademarks \" confer monopoly rights, so i can see entirely why nestle thought... Let's register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers. \" and they aren't the only ones to produce such a bar; the similarly-shaped norwegian bar kvikk lunsj, which means \" quick lunch, \" has been around since 1937 â€” nearly as long as kitkat. Nestle could try to get its case in front of the uk supreme court. ( in other food news, a new pepsi flavor isn't wowing soda fans. )",

She says madyson suffers from seizures, and that the october ones were particularly bad: \" they would stop and come back, stop and come back, \" with hallucinations and vomiting. The girl was also in the midst of withdrawing from risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder ( it's unclear why madyson was prescribed the medication ), and osborne says the pot stopped it all within 30 minutes. Problem is, \" marijuana is illegal, period, \" says a rep with the state's department of health and welfare. Indeed, osborne was charged with misdemeanor injury to a child; she has pleaded not guilty. Medical marijuana isn't legal in the state, and in those places where children with epilepsy are permitted to partake in pot, they use cannabidiol oil, which is free of thc. The twin falls times-news says osborne couldn't get the oil, and so resorted to using butter that she prepared herself.

This time, characters played by chris pratt and bryce dallas howard watch as the genetically-modified dinosaur indominus rex is unleashed on the park; destruction, of course, is inevitable. Here's what critics are saying: \" you can't experience first love twice, \" writes kenneth turan at the los angeles times. \" despite the best efforts of director colin trevorrow, jurassic world's story of indominus rex on the loose, while certainly acceptable, doesn't have the same impact as the initial film. \" that being said, the moviemakers \" have done as well as they could, \" turan writes, and pratt's \" combination of physicality, charisma, and attitude prove hard to resist. \" brian truitt is awed by the \" zoo of phenomenal creations that rivals the original's impressive array of ancient animals. \" while he says jurassic world is \" a monster step up from the two disappointing previous sequels, \" it's \" sorely missing the heart and inherent wonder of the classic first film, \" he writes at usa today. Still, it holds \" enough dino-mite action to stave off excitement extinction. \" audiences will flock to the film regardless of what he writes, but joe morgenstern writes it anyway: \" something should be said about the film's cheesiness â€” it doesn't even look good, though it sounds grand â€” and the shoddiness of its workmanship. \" pratt offers an easy charm, but he's \" no match for the crude filmmaking or the stupid plot that keeps him running around in a constant state of artificial animation, \" he writes at the wall street journal. His vote: don't waste your money. Writing for the new york post, kyle smith's opinion couldn't be more different: \" motorcycle, chris pratt, sprinting dinosaurs: if you require more than that out of a movie, you're being unreasonable. \" he says pratt, combined with the film's \" brilliant special effects â€¦ make the first jurassic movie since 2001 nearly as much fun as the stellar first two. \" there are strong, quiet moments and great action scenes. \" the worst you can say about the movie is that it sticks to a highly potent formula. \" click for more reviews or find out why some accuse the film of sexism.",

The new york daily news points out that trump suggested last week on fox he should do the press briefings himself every other week. Spicer will likely no longer do the daily on-camera press briefing, and sources say the administration is looking to do fewer on-camera briefings overall. A senior white house official tells politico that deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders will likely be seen behind the podium more often, but spicer will hold onto a senior administration role. Spicer himself has said that he'd prefer not to be behind the podium as much, but politico points out that amid a growing number of scandals plaguing the trump administration, the president is increasingly using the communications department as a scapegoat, complaining about how the team has responded to the scandals.

The bbc reports on the planned january 2019 mission, whose true intention is to study the antarctic's larsen c ice shelf. But its position near the endurance's final recorded location in the weddell sea proves too tempting to ignore. The plan, says lead researcher julian dowdeswell, is to take the autonomous underwater vehicles that will be used in their examination of larsen c and send them under the ice in the area where the endurance was thought to have gone down in 1915. The auvs ' echo sounders will map the seafloor, searching for anything anomalous â€” assuming things don't go south. The bbc notes that a february 2018 mission to the larsen c failed. The british antarctic survey behind it explains the sea ice its ship encountered was up to 16 feet thick, and in 24 hours they made it just 5 miles, with more than 250 to go. The times of london reports dowdeswell and his team will sail on the sa agulhas ii, a polar class 5 ship that can break ice roughly 3 feet thick. That's not good enough, says american shipwreck hunter david mearns, who also covets the endurance and thinks a polar class 3 ship is needed. \" whatever ship you have, it's possible it won't get there, \" dowdeswell allows. \" it could be a better or worse sea ice year. \" shackleton's survival story is legendary: after abandoning ship, he and his crew survived on ice floes for five months; five days at sea in lifeboats brought them to elephant island, and shackleton and a few others then set off on a 720-nautical-mile voyage to south georgia, per the telegraph.

After dierks bentley introduced miranda lambert for a performance, best pop vocal album went to in the lonely hour by sam smith. He again managed to keep things short and sweet enough to avoid getting played off. Kanye west performed, singing ( with auto-tune ) the entire time with not a rap in sight. Then a bunch of dancers dressed as, apparently, bulls took the stage for a madonna performance, which would explain her red carpet outfit. Best rock album was presented to beck for morning phase. He got played off. Best r&b performance went to beyonce for \" drunk in love, \" featuring hubby jay z. She was, of course, not played off, though she did keep things pretty short. After an ed sheeran-john mayer performance, jeff lynne's elo performed ( and got paul mccartney up dancing and singing along in the audience ). And then it was time for the unholy union of adam levine and gwen stefani performing a maroon 5 song. Oh, you thought there might be another award right about now? no. Instead, hozier performed \" take me to church, \" joined by annie lennox. Then a jonas brother and the \" all about that bass \" lady presented best country album to platinum by miranda lambert. And then, yes, another performance: pharrell williams ' \" happy, \" with a strangely ominous intro. Then it was time for a prerecorded message from president obama, calling for an end to violence against women and girls, followed by an impassioned speech by domestic violence survivor and activist brooke axtell and a performance of \" by the grace of god \" from katy perry.

        "summary": "A new harvard study adds more evidence to the theory that insecticides are the main culprit in the disappearance of honeybees, reports the christian science monitor. Researchers found that bees in massachusetts exposed to a common class of insecticides known as neonicotinoids suffered significant drops in numbers over the winter compared with bees who had no such exposure. In the study, only six of 12 colonies exposed to the chemicals imidacloprid and clothianidin survived the winter. Of six non-exposed colonies, all but one made it. Imidacloprid is the world's no. 1 pesticide and has been registered in the us since 1994, says the monitor. \" we demonstrated that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering ' colony collapse disorder ' in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter, \" says one of the harvard researchers, as quoted in the guardian. The scientists speculate that the chemicals impair the bees ' neurological functions, causing them to first abandon their colonies and then die. Based on comparisons with a previous study, the researchers also think that particularly harsh winters can worsen the effects of ccd, reports the harvard gazette.",

Many employees at such companies also play the games, so if they have crucial data ahead of time, well, you get the idea. \" the scary thing is that nothing appears to be in place to stop any employee from obtaining data that is not available to the [ everyday ] player, \" writes ben brown at dfs report. \" that is what has to change. \" ( brown also broke the story at dfs report. ) now industry analysts and lawmakers are talking about regulating fantasy sports. \" if the industry is unwilling to undertake these reforms voluntarily, it will be imposed on them involuntarily, \" says a sports and gambling lawyer. The companies are allowed to operate under a 2006 federal law that bans online gambling but considers fantasy games contests of skill rather than chance. Yet \" if they had to justify themselves at a hearing they wouldn't be able to, \" says rep. Frank pallone jr. Of new jersey. Draftkings and fanduel, which told workers to stop playing games for now, say that \" nothing is more important... Than the integrity of the games. \" there's no evidence of abuse, they add, but they still \" plan to work with the entire fantasy sports industry on this specific issue. \" ( see a breakdown of the facts at legal sports report. )",

It is expected to get approval at a plenary session as early as wednesday since it passed the committee with the consensus of both the governing and opposition parties. Slashing working hours was among the main election pledges of president moon jae-in, which he said will improve quality of life as well as help create jobs. However, fewer working hours means higher labor costs for businesses. According to an estimate by the korea economic research institute, businesses will pay an additional 12.1 trillion won annually to maintain current production while cutting the working hours. This includes wages paid to additional workers hired to cover the hours lost, as well as their training costs. It is especially likely to hit the manufacturing and transportation industries as working overtime has been the norm there. Labor ministry data from 2012 showed that employees in manufacturing work on average 28.1 extra hours a month. Smes will be damaged more than conglomerates. The institute explained that small businesses hiring fewer than 300 will"

On tuesday, badger guns was ordered to pay $ 6 million to two police officers who were shot in the face with a handgun bought at the store, nbc news reports. The badly injured officers sued the gun shop for negligence. The jury agreed that the store had been extremely negligent when it sold the firearm to a 21-year-old man who was buying it in a \" straw purchase \" for underage friend julius burton, who used it to shoot the officers, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. The evidence included video of burton pointing to the gun and saying, \" that's the one i want, \" the guardian reports. The atf has described the milwaukee store as one of america's top sellers of guns used in crimes, and 537 of its weapons were found at crime scenes in 2005 alone, nbc notes. The case is only the second one of its kind to go to trial since the passage of a 2005 law shielding gun dealers from such lawsuits, the journal sentinel reports; a gun store in alaska won the previous case. The closely watched case could have major implications nationwide, but the officers ' attorney tells the journal sentinel that he was out to represent his clients, not send a message. \" will it change the way things are done around the country? time will tell, \" he says.

Credit: mike de sisti by of the a jury late tuesday found badger guns and its owner liable in the wounding of two milwaukee police officers in a first-of-its-kind verdict that was being watched nationwide. Jurors found badger guns broke four laws when a clerk sold a gun that was used to shoot officer bryan norberg and former officer graham kunisch in the head in 2009. After nine hours of deliberation, the jury announced a verdict that included nearly $ 6 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the two officers. There will be an appeal. This high-profile case was only the second of its kind nationwide to make it to a jury since congress passed a law a decade ago holding gun dealers and manufacturers immune from such lawsuits. In the first, a jury found in favor of a gun store in alaska. The officers ' attorney, patrick dunphy, said norberg was \" overwhelmed with emotion \" by the verdict, while kunisch, who suffered from brain damage in the shooting, was stoic â€” as he was for all of the trial. Norberg and kunisch left the courthouse without commenting.",
            "A wisconsin jury was in its second day of deliberations on tuesday, in a rare case in which a gun dealer was accused of the illegal sale of a weapon that was then used to shoot two police officers. Badger guns, a seller on the outskirts of milwaukee, \"failed miserably \" to protect the public when it allowed a 21-year-old to buy a gun on behalf of a friend who was underage and had accompanied him to the store, the jury heard in closing arguments on monday. The common manoeuvre is known as a straw purchase. The outcome of the civil trial could influence future legal actions against gun dealers or manufacturers after shootings, whether street murders, attacks on police or the kind of school or college massacre that dominates headlines in the us all too regularly. A federal law passed in 2005 to protect the firearms industry against being sued by shooting victims, amid strong lobbying by the national rifle association, means lawsuits against gun companies usually struggle to get far. The lawsuit in wisconsin is believed to be only the second such case to reach a jury in 10 years, following a case in alaska in the summer which found in favour of the gun shop. In june 2009, milwaukee police officers bryan norberg and graham kunisch were both shot in the face when they stopped 18-year-old julius burton for riding a"

Credit: mike de sisti by of the a jury late tuesday found badger guns and its owner liable in the wounding of two milwaukee police officers in a first-of-its-kind verdict that was being watched nationwide. Jurors found badger guns broke four laws when a clerk sold a gun that was used to shoot officer bryan norberg and former officer graham kunisch in the head in 2009. After nine hours of deliberation, the jury announced a verdict that included nearly $ 6 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the two officers. There will be an appeal. This high-profile case was only the second of its kind nationwide to make it to a jury since congress passed a law a decade ago holding gun dealers and manufacturers immune from such lawsuits. In the first, a jury found in favor of a gun store in alaska. The officers ' attorney, patrick dunphy, said norberg was \" overwhelmed with emotion \" by the verdict, while kunisch, who suffered from brain damage in the shooting, was stoic â€” as he was for all of the trial. Norberg and kunisch left the courthouse without commenting.",
            "A wisconsin jury was in its second day of deliberations on tuesday, in a rare case in which a gun dealer was accused of the illegal sale of a weapon that was then used to shoot two police officers. Badger guns, a seller on the outskirts of milwaukee, \"failed miserably \" to protect the public when it allowed a 21-year-old to buy a gun on behalf of a friend who was underage and had accompanied him to the store, the jury heard in closing arguments on monday. The common manoeuvre is known as a straw purchase. The outcome of the civil trial could influence future legal actions against gun dealers or manufacturers after shootings, whether street murders, attacks on police or the kind of school or college massacre that dominates headlines in the us all too regularly. A federal law passed in 2005 to protect the firearms industry against being sued by shooting victims, amid strong lobbying by the national rifle association, means lawsuits against gun companies usually struggle to get far. The lawsuit in wisconsin is believed to be only the second such case to reach a jury in 10 years, following a case in alaska in the summer which found in favour of the gun shop. In june 2009, milwaukee police officers bryan norberg and graham kunisch were both shot in the face when they stopped 18-year-old julius burton for riding a"

        "summary": "The first african american elected to the us senate has died at age 95. Edward brooke, a massachusetts republican, died of natural causes in florida, the ap reports. He was elected in 1966 and served two terms as a highly popular politician. That came after he became the first african american attorney general of any state, the boston globe reports. As a senator, brooke championed issues including the equal rights amendment and a push for racial integration via busing in boston, and he was the first gop senator to call for richard nixon's resignation. In 2009, he received the congressional gold medal and called for bipartisanship in washington. When brooke was elected, no african american had served in the senate since reconstruction, when senators were chosen by legislators â€” not elected by popular vote. His victory by nearly 500,000 votes came despite being a republican in a democratic state, the new york times notes, describing him as a centrist. In a 1966 book, he wondered about republicans: \" where are our plans for a new deal or a great society? \" his period in office was not without controversy, the ap notes; he faced a senate ethics committee probe into his personal finances and lost the next election. More recently, describing president obama's election victory, he said: \" i ' m not that surprised that he was able to pull it off. But i am thankful to god to live to see this happen. \"",

The star and free malaysia today report that 33-year-old firefighter abu zarin hussin was attacked by the snake earlier this week in betong while trying to catch it, and he was rushed to two different hospitals over the past several days, finally succumbing to his injuries in the icu of the sultan haji ahmad shah hospital on friday. Hussin, who the bbc says kept four snakes at home, had become both a local and international celebrity for his snake-handling acumen, which he used to train fellow firefighters so that they could respond to calls about snake sightings. Under hussin's tutelage, firefighters learned how to id different types of snakes, with a particular eye for the poisonous ones, as well as the most humane ways to capture them. Newsweek explains how hussin shot to international fame in 2016 when overseas tabloids mistakenly used his picture for a story on a man who reportedly married his pet snake. An interview in the star noted hussin, who began his hobby in 2007, got his inspiration from his snake-charmer dad. \" before i joined the [ fire department ], i was afraid of snakes and would avoid them, \" he said. \" but... Now [ i ] practice with [ my father ]. \" hussin had been bitten a few times before, with one incident in 2015 even sending him into a two-day coma. But he couldn't stay away from the slithery reptiles, and he even took his act to asia's got talent. A zookeeper tells the new straits times how, after he was bit by a snake in 2012, he met hussin and struck up an instant friendship. \" i have lost a daring and genuine friend, \" he says.

Eyes are shifting to sarah sellers, who finished 4 minutes and 10 seconds behind winner desiree linden with a time of 2 hours, 44 minutes, 4 seconds. But while linden is a two-time olympian, sellers is a virtual unknown: a promising track career in college hit an early end due to a broken foot her junior year, reports the salt lake tribune. She had only run one marathon prior, in utah in september, in order to qualify for boston. The 26-year-old has no sponsors, and did much of her training starting at 4am, before heading to her full-time job as a nurse anesthetist in tucson, arizona. Cnn picks up this tweet from kit fox of runners world as a sign of just how unexpected her win was: the first question she was asked in a post-race news conference was \" please introduce yourself. Tell us who you are. \" sellers logs about 85 miles a week, and still relies on weber state track coach paul pilkington for advice. She now walks away with $ 75,000 in prize money, which she says she and her husband will put toward their student debt. As for that first marathon in huntsville, utah, she didn't just win it: she set a course record.",

The nearby town of braine-l ' alleud isn't too thrilled about it, however. As the wall street journal reports, the battle of waterloo didn't actually take place in waterloo. A belgian historian's research shows that three of the key fights were in braine-l ' alleud and two more were in plancenoit â€” but because a duke filed his dispatch from his headquarters in waterloo, that name has gotten all the glory. \"nobody will ever call it the 'battle of braine-l ' alleud.'that would be completely ridiculous, and that's not our goal at all, \" says the town's mayor. \" but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to correct errors that were made. \" among other things, the town is suing michelin over a tour guide that it says doesn't give braine-l ' alleud its due. This isn't the only waterloo-related disagreement related to the anniversary. Belgium has minted coins worth 2.50 euros to commemorate the defeat of the french emperor, and france is a little miffed. First, it blocked belgium from issuing coins worth 2 euros that would be legal tender throughout the eu, a move that meant 180,000 coins had to be melted down, reports cnn.

The so-called lipinski stradivarius, an instrument made in 1715 and distinguished by unique striations on its back, was stolen on monday night at a college campus in wauwatosa, immediately west of milwaukee, flynn said. The instrument was on loan to violinist frank almond of the milwaukee symphony orchestra when it was taken from him following a performance, flyn said. Police said almond was subdued with a stun gun fired at him by one of the thieves, who then jumped into the waiting getaway vehicle driven by another suspect. Violins such as the one stolen can sell for $ 5 million to $ 10 million, flynn said. He added that the fbi has entered the lipinski into its international art theft database. \" this violin is very valuable, but very valuable to a very small population, \" flynn said in",
            "A 300-year-old stradivarius violin on loan to milwaukee symphony orchestra concertmaster frank almond was stolen during an armed robbery after a performance by almond at wisconsin lutheran college, milwaukee police chief edward flynn said tuesday. Almond was attacked with a stun gun and robbed of the instrument â€” flynn said it was valued in the \" high seven figures \" â€” shortly before 10: 30 p.m. Monday in a parking lot in the rear of the school, 8815 w. Wisconsin ave., the chief said at a news conference. As almond lay on the pavement the robber fled to a nearby vehicle, described as a maroon or burgundy minivan driven by an accomplice, which then left the scene, flynn said. Almond had played a concert monday evening at wisconsin lutheran as part of his frankly music series. \" the artistic heritage of milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night, \" flynn told reporters during the conference at the police administration building. Investigators believe the instrument, known in musical circles as the lipinski stradivarius, was the primary target of the robbery, flynn said. In a 2008 feature on the violin, chicago violin dealer stefan hersh said the lipinski violin was comparable in value to another strad that sold for more than $ 3.5 million in a 2006 auction.

Another official yesterday told reuters that \" initial indications show indisputably \" that a handful of bodies recovered yesterday are those of speicher victims, though dna testing will be carried out to confirm this. The ap notes that one clip aired on iraqi state tv showed unearthed skeletal remains still wearing combat boots. A cnn reporter on the scene describes decomposed bodies with their hands still tied together. In making its claim, isis released photos showing soldiers being led to trenches and then facedown in them before and after their execution. Other videos showed masked gunmen bringing the soldiers to a bloodstained concrete river waterfront, shooting them in the head, and tossing them into the tigris. Previous reports have stated that if the number of dead is indeed 1,700, the massacre would rank as by far the largest atrocity in the country in more than a decade.",

According to fox 4, lambert's cafe's gimmick is that its servers throw dinner rolls across the room to diners. A lawyer for troy tucker claims she was hit in the face with one of those rolls while visiting the restaurant with her bible group in september 2014, kfvs reports. According to fox 4, tucker is seeking $ 25,000 to cover medical bills and legal fees. She claims the roll lacerated her cornea and left her with impaired vision. While the lawsuit states the restaurant should have known the roll-throwing exposed diners to danger, the river front times questions how solid tucker's case is, and points to this: in june, the kansas city royals were found not at fault after a fan was hit in the face by a hot dog thrown by the team mascot. The jury found the man \" assumed some personal responsibility \" by entering the stadium. The gm of lambert's cafe tells kfvs this isn't the first time a customer has wanted a payout after being hit with one of the signature rolls, and the restaurant has paid medical expenses via its insurance in the past.",

Rick perry, who barely registers at 4 percent. Just 8 percent remain undecided. \"you really have a two-man race, with paul and santorum battling back and forth for no. 3 and 4 and perry out of the mix, \" said ed goeas, a republican pollster whose firm, the tarrance group, conducted the survey on tuesday and wednesday. Gingrich has momentum: when voters are asked to volunteer the name of the candidate they plan to vote for without being prompted by a list of names to choose from, romney's lead over gingrich slips to 31 percent to 29 percent. Among those who say they will \"definitely \" support their candidate of choice, the two are essentially tied, with romney at 23 percent and gingrich at 22 percent"

        "summary": "A home's history can really make or break its marketability. Such is the case with what would otherwise be prime real estate in austria's braunau am inn, a town near the german border. This house marks the spot where adolf hitler was born on april 20, 1889; it was an inn at the time, and though he only lived there briefly as a baby before his family relocated, the 8,610-square-foot building that rents for nearly $ 5,820 a month has gone unoccupied since 2011, much to the displeasure of the country's interior ministry. The ministry has rented it from the home's private owner ( haaretz reports it does so to keep it from being used by neo-nazis ) since 1972 and sublets it, reports afp. Hitler's personal secretary, martin bormann, purchased the building in 1938 in the hopes of eventually fashioning it into a monument to the fÃ¼hrer, der spiegel reports. A gate marked with bormann's initials is the final lingering nazi-era item present at the location, which hitler visited a single time during his reign. Neo-nazis gather there much more frequently: each year on hitler's birthday. The owners who sold the building in 1938 repurchased it in 1952, with the interior ministry stepping in two decades later. The local reports that the owner has apparently been quite particular, quashing potential plans that would see a community college or migrant center occupy it. The owner has apparently also nixed a proposal by historian andreas maislinger that it be made into a \" house of responsibility. \" afp reports the ministry is trying to hand off the location to another ministry and is hopeful it will get a response by year's end.

        "summary": "Beate zschaepe, the last surviving member of a neo-nazi trio accused of 10 murders between 2000 and 2007, goes on trial today in munich, in a case that is riveting germany. Zschaepe is charged in the killings of eight turkish immigrants, a greek immigrant, and a german police officer, but for years police believed the execution-style murders were connected to turkish organized crime, the bbc reports. In reality, prosecutors say, zschaepe and the other members of the national socialist underground were trying to instill fear in immigrants in an attempt to drive them out of germany. The plot finally came to light in november 2011, when the other two alleged members of the nsu, uwe mundlos, 38, and uwe boenhardt, 34, apparently killed themselves after a bank robbery gone wrong; police then discovered the gun used in the 10 murders and zschaepe surrendered. The 38-year-old now faces life in prison; she is also accused of involvement in armed robberies, arson, and two bomb attacks. Four men are also standing trial, accused of helping the nsu. Today's opening drew anti-racism protesters outside the courthouse; german authorities have been accused of institutional racism and of being \" blind \" to right-wing extremism, der spiegel reports, and the case has sparked debate about germany's attitude toward immigrants. The trial could go on for more than a year, the new york times adds. Neo-nazis including zschaepe were just last month found to be communicating from prison via secret code.",

            "The munich court handling the historic trial of neo-nazi beate zschÃ¤pe on monday adjourned proceedings until may 14 after her lawyers accused the presiding judge of being biased because he had ordered them to be frisked for weapons before entering the courtroom. Members of the prosecution weren't subjected to searches. The adjournment on the first day is a fresh indication that the trial, which is being closely watched in germany and abroad, especially in turkey where most of the victims came from, will be lengthy and complex.

            "The munich court handling the historic trial of neo-nazi beate zschÃ¤pe on monday adjourned proceedings until may 14 after her lawyers accused the presiding judge of being biased because he had ordered them to be frisked for weapons before entering the courtroom. Members of the prosecution weren't subjected to searches.

Speaking in new orleans, obama promised there would be a national conversation on the issue. Specifically, he declared support for background checks on gun buyers and better enforcement of gun laws, and said that \" ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, \" not criminals â€” which could imply future support for an assault-weapons ban similar to one that expired in 2004, the washington post notes. The move is somewhat unexpected, since just this week white house press secretary jay carney implied obama would not wade into the issue of new gun legislation, thanks in part to congressional opposition. But yesterday, obama said gun reform has too often been \"defeated by politics and by lobbying and eventually by the pull of our collective attention elsewhere. \" also yesterday, mitt romney reiterated his position that stricter gun laws would not have made a difference in aurora. \"a lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law, but the fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening, \" romney told nbc nightly news anchor brian williams.",

The academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced a slew of changes last month to its annual awards show, among them a new \" outstanding achievement in popular film \" category meant to reward films perhaps not critically acclaimed but still able to draw big crowds. Not many details on voting or eligibility came with the announcement, but it was enough to cause an outcry, and that outcry has made an impact. Per the hollywood reporter, the academy said thursday the new category will be postponed and won't debut at the 91st awards show on feb. 24 so it can \" examine and seek additional input. \" the group said in a statement that \" the academy recognized that implementing any new award nine months into the year creates challenges for films that have already been released, \" the bbc reports. But it wasn't just the timing that rankled some. The announcement met resistance from detractors who said hit movies that are also critically acclaimed â€” chief among them black panther â€” could lose steam for a best picture award if they were also thrown into the \" popular \" film category. Advocates for the move say it would spur more of the general public to watch the awards show, which has seen a nearly 40 % viewership decline over the past four years. The new york times'sources say that at a tuesday night meeting of the academy's 54-member board, laura dern was steadfast in her opposition to the new category; steven spielberg, who is described as a board member with \" enormous influence, \" was reportedly \" uncomfortable with plans to introduce [ it ] at the coming oscars. \"",

Gale sends a nasty note to the woman causing a disturbance on the flight. ( theyearofelan via tiwtter ) the entire exchange was recorded in real-time by buzzfeed. Gale, who claims to be a producer on abc's the bachelor, first tweeted at 11 a.m. After being told his plane would be taking off late. But he went into overdrive after finally boarding the",
            "As some of you know, i had a bit of an altercation today with a woman named diane on an airplane. I had a great time antagonizing her, reading your responses, and just generally trying to have fun with an irritating person. But i did have a point and i just want to put it out there. I know i can come across as abrasive. I know i can seem harsh. But what i've never done is be unkind to a person in a service position. My first job was in a video store. I rewinded tapes and put them back on the shelves. I was a caterer. I put ravioli into divided plates and cut bagels in half for hours at a time. The difference between someone being nice and someone being mean was the difference in how i felt when",

According to gale's tweets, which were picked up by buzzfeed's rachel zarrell, a female passenger was complaining that she might not make it home for thanksgiving dinner. She seemed to be oblivious to others on the flight, who also needed to get home to their families for thanksgiving. The battle began before the flight boarded. Gale tweeted about the woman at 11: 05 a.m. Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously.

Her lawyer cited the fragility of her health, saying he feared she will die in prison and claiming her jailers weren't meeting her medical needs. Those fears have been renewed now that cook county judge joel greenblatt",
            "Ã— bonnie liltz, woman who killed disabled daughter, commits suicide schaumburg, ill. â€” bonnie liltz, who was sentenced for four years in prison for giving her disabled daughter a fatal overdose of medication has committed suicide. Her attorney, thomas glascow, said liltz committed suicide on saturday by overdosing on pills because, according to a note she left behind, she didn't want to die in jail. Glascow said he had been in contact with her on friday and she seemed fine after spending the holiday with her mom and sister. He said that she was always in pain and had lost more weight. She was down from 98 pounds to 84 pounds"

What the heck? \" he added that she should have gone to cosby's home \" dressed properly \" and she should have \" left the incense [ a gift for cosby ] in the store. \" cnn, cbs, and the ap also have new interviews with an anonymous juror or jurors, and while it's not clear whether it's the same one, the sentiments expressed were similar. \" when you ask for help on your resume, on your resignation letter, which she did, and he, mr.
