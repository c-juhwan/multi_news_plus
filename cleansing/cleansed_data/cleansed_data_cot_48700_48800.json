Trump retweeted messages of support today, including one fan who posted, \" @realdonaldtrump the thought of you becoming president of the united states is the only thing that gives me hope for this country's future. \" ( if he does run, will it be as an independent, a republican, or … something else? )",

And it's not something hannity completely denies, telling the reporter, \" do i talk to my friend who i've known for years and speak my mind? i can't not speak my mind. \" hannity adds that his blatant pro-trump leanings make him \" more honest \" than other reporters. \" i ' m not hiding the fact that i want donald trump to be the next president of the united states, \" he says.

Researchers showed groups of babies a puppet routine in which one elephant puppet treated a duck puppet well, while another was mean to his puppet peer. In a later scene, a moose puppet rewarded the elephant for his behavior with a toy, or punished him by taking a toy away. The infants then chose their favorite moose. The five-month-olds showed a preference for the moose who had been nice to everyone — even the elephants who'd behaved badly. But most babies eight months old and older liked the moose who punished the mean elephants, abc news reports. \"it's hard to argue that parents are teaching their children to punish at eight months.

            "Have you ever cheered when a bad guy gets what he deserves in a movie's closing scene? or watched a child tattle on a classmate who broke the rules? scientists believe the urge to punish bad guys and reward good ones may be hardwired into the human psyche, and a new study suggests that even infants prefer to see punishment for an unkind act. To test this urge for retribution, researchers put on different puppet shows for 100 babies in three age groups: 5 months old, 8 months old and 19 months and older. The babies watched puppets behave positively or negatively toward one another – one elephant helped a duck open a box, while another elephant slammed the lid shut. Next, the children saw the \"good \" or \"bad \" puppets get rewarded or punished – a toy moose either gave a toy to the elephants or took the toy away. When the babies were prompted to choose their favorite puppets, the researchers reported that most of the 8-month-olds preferred the puppets that had punished the \"bad \" puppets, while the majority of the 5-month-olds preferred the moose that treated everyone kindly, even the \"bad \" elephants. The children 19 months and older acted similarly to the 8-month-olds, physically taking treats away from puppets who had mistreated others. The study was published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. Study author kiley hamlin, a psychologist from the university of british columbia, said the results offered some clues about exactly when humans develop a sense of justice, a factor that evolutionary psychologists say is critical to the function of society. \"somehow between age 5 and 8 months, the babies get this much more nuanced perception, the ability to interpret circumstances, \" hamlin said. \"it's hard to argue that parents are teaching their children to punish at 8 months.

        "summary": "Eight people, including five children, have a 13-year-old organ donor to thank for their lives — and that donor has entered the uk record books. The guardian reports on jemima layzell, who collapsed from a brain aneurysm while helping prep for her mom's birthday party in march 2012. Jemima died four days later, just a couple of weeks after she'd had a discussion with her family about organ donation following a car crash that killed a family friend. \" jemima had never heard of organ donation before and found it a little bit unsettling, but totally understood the importance of it, \" her mom, sophy, says. And so when jemima passed away, her parents made the decision to donate her kidneys to two recipients and her lungs to another; her liver was split and transplanted into two people, and her heart, pancreas, and small intestine were transplanted into three others. The nhs blood and transplant department says it's the largest number of solid organ recipients from a single donor ever recorded in the uk, per the telegraph. Jemima's family had been unsure about whether to donate her organs, but a tv program on kids waiting for heart transplants — as well as their past conversation with jemima on organ donation — changed their minds. \" every parent's instinct is to say no, as we are programmed to protect our children, \" sophy layzell says. \" it's only with prior knowledge of jemima's agreement that we were able to say yes. \" other ways the layzells are honoring her: they've set up the jemima layzell trust to promote organ donation, as well as published the draft, a compilation of her diary entries found after she died.",

More than half of asian americans and nearly half of hispanic americans with diabetes are undiagnosed, according to a press release from the national institutes of health. Live science reports asian americans may have so many cases of undiagnosed diabetes because they develop it at a lower bmi than other ethnic groups, which means doctors may not be screening asian americans who have the disease but don't appear obese. \"by learning more about who has diabetes — and who has the disease but does not know it — we can better target research and prevention efforts, \" says the director of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases in the press release. \"we have treatments to help people with diabetes, but treatments can only help those who have been diagnosed. \"",

He now has a new distinction: the oldest american to be robbed of his savings, reports newsweek. Family members recently learned that an unidentified thief used overton's identity to buy savings bonds through the government's treasurydirect site over a couple of months. It appears the thief set up a fake bank account with overton's social security number and then broke into his personal checking account. \" it's a shock, it hurts, it hurts tremendously, \" says cousin volma overton, who discovered the theft. Volma overton noticed the withdrawals when he went to deposit funds into the account. \" i don't know how they got his social security number and his personal checking account number but those things they have, \" he tells kxan. Overton's experience appears to be an all-too-common case of identity theft, where a thief uses someone else's personal information to apply for credit, file taxes, or, in overton's case, drain an account. Fortunately, overton's care, which costs $ 480 a day, is covered by a separate gofundme-linked account. Austin police are working closely with the overton family to try to track down the culprit. \" we wanted to put the word out about them using his name with stolen id, \" volma overton says. \" it might help others realize how vulnerable we all are to this. \" overton, whose age has been verified by the gerontology research group, is something of a character, reports the dallas morning news. His favorite pastime is sitting on his porch, where he can be seen waving at honking cars and smoking one of his 12 daily cigars.",

The cbc reports on 19-year-old gavin strickland's parking plight, which started sunday after the metallica performance at the rogers centre. Strickland searched multiple parking garages after the show, even hitching a ride with local cops as he scoured the city for his vehicle. By monday, he had to call his father back in syracuse, ny, and admit he'd lost his car, at which point he took a bus back home. That's when his dad decided to post a craigslist ad asking toronto locals to assist his \" doofy son \" in the search, offering a $ 100 reward along with the details strickland could remember ( \" nearby is allegedly a strange spiral outdoor sculpture \" ). Enter madison riddolls, who dragged her boyfriend out late wednesday to hunt for the car. \" i've been watching a lot of criminal minds lately, \" riddolls says of her quest, which finally proved successful at a parking garage under the city's td centre. After confirming some identifying features provided by strickland, riddolls contacted him, and he showed up, to much media hullabaloo, to pick up the car. \" how did i walk past this? \" he mused to reporters in front of the nissan thursday night, per the toronto star. The parking garage wiped out the four days ' worth of parking fees ( he ' ll only be charged for sunday ) and gave him a bluetooth device to help him locate his car in the future. Riddolls, meanwhile, will pocket a $ 100 reward, and the elder strickland says he ' ll also donate money to her favorite charity. ( a uk man's car went missing after a concert for six months. )",

The post outlines a number of assertions in the book that it says don't hold up. Among them: martin writes that she lived on park avenue with her two children for six years; the post contends that she lived there with one child for three-and-a-half years, selling the apartment in 2007. The book also describes martin working out at physique 57, but the fancy gym didn't exist during the quoted time period. The same problem exists with references to desserts shop ladurée and uber, both of which came to the city in 2011. Martin tells the post that \" since the book is organized by topic ( ex. Real estate, social hierarchies, exercise ), it is not always a straightforward chronology. \" her publisher backs that up: \" it is a common narrative technique in memoirs for some names, identifying characteristics, and chronologies to be adjusted or disguised, \" simon &amp; schuster's vp tells the times; she says future editions and e-books will get a \" clarifying note. \" the times reports that it ran an op-ed from martin on her experience last month, and quotes this line from it: \" i stuck to the facts. \"",

But the hoverboard hubbub at ces in las vegas thursday was something straight out of a corporate espionage movie: per bloomberg, us marshals raided a booth set up by chinese company changzhou first international trade. It was promoting its trotter electronic skateboard — what bloomberg describes as looking \" like a seesaw with one big wheel in the middle. \" the problem: silicon valley startup future motion says the product is a knockoff of its own onewheel skateboard, invented and designed by kyle doerksen. \" when we got word that a company was exhibiting a knock-off product, we engaged in the formal process, which involved sending a cease and desist letter and... Getting a restraining order... Then enforced by the us marshals, \" doerksen tells the bbc. The marshals who swept into the booth scooped up a trotter, plus marketing material. A quick visual comparison of future motion's product and those hawked by changzhou on alibaba does show a marked similarity. But while future motion sells its version for $ 1,500, the knockoffs are going for around $ 550 each — which doerksen says is bad news for not only his company, but the hoverboard/electric skateboard industry overall. \" if customers start to view the space as full of low-quality, low-cost products, that reflects poorly on everybody, \" he tells bloomberg. Future motion, which the business site notes started the patent process for parts of its onewheel years ago, didn't set up a booth at the consumer electronics forum this year, but doerksen was in town meeting with possible partners.

Obama, who turns 51 on saturday, has joked that his birthday wish is to win florida in november. The republican national committee has other ideas, and is using the occasion to raise money and enlist volunteers with a web site, www.baracksbirthdaycards.com. The cards have mocking or pointed messages about everything from the sputtering economy to the collapse of clean-energy firm solyndra. One card with senate intelligence committee chair dianne feinstein reads \" news of your birthday leaked out. \" on another card, a grinning, shirtless russian president putin says \" after the election you are flexible for me. I flex for your birthday. \" a particularly dark card reads \" mr. President. I couldn't afford to get you a gift, so here is the shirt off my back — unemployed. \" it's no \" boehner birthday song. \" -- this embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 16917028.",

She says it's because of her period, and the american civil liberties union is arguing gender discrimination is at play. In the brief, coleman alleges that the bobby dodd institute in fort benning, georgia, gave her a disciplinary write up after the \" sudden onset of her menstrual period \" caused her to leak fluid onto her chair in august 2015. It happened again the following april, with menstrual fluid spotting the carpet as she made her way to the bathroom. She says she cleaned the spot with bleach, but was fired four days later for failing to \" practice high standards of personal hygiene and maintain a clean, neat appearance while on duty. \" the aclu calls coleman's firing \" wrong and illegal under federal law, \" citing title vii of the civil rights act, which bans workplace discrimination based on sex. The crux of the case is that sudden heavy menstrual flow is a symptom of pre-menopause. The new york daily news reports that coleman's case was first dismissed by a district court that found the law does not protect the condition of pre-menopause, but the aclu argues that it fits under title vii, which prohibits discrimination due to \" pregnancy, childbirth and related conditions. \" usa today reports that bobby dodd has issued a statement saying \" there is more to this story than is being portrayed by those who are suing us. \" ( one company actually gives women time off for their periods. )",

Running since may, the pilot plant should grab about a ton of co2 daily — about the same as removing 100 cars from the road, the cbc reports. It works by running air through equipment that absorbs co2 in a liquid solution and turns it into calcium-carbonate pellets ( see a diagram at quartz ). The pellets are then heated in order to free pure carbon. \" there's no real magic to it, \" says corless. \" the pieces of equipment already exist today in very large scale. \" indeed, companies in california and switzerland are also aiming to capture airborne co2. Carbon engineering isn't commercially viable just yet, but carbon pricing varies and could eventually hit $ 100 per ton.

But authorities never notified tamayo that he had the right to contact the mexican consulate, and that failure violates an international treaty, the new york times reports.

In 2004, the world court ordered tamayo's conviction and 50 others reviewed because of vienna convention violations, but tamayo's never was; texas says it's not bound by that order.

        "summary": "Donald trump is doubling down in his criticism of former miss universe alicia machado, calling her \" disgusting, \" accusing her of making a sex tape, and saying that hillary clinton made a big mistake in referencing her during monday's debate. As for the sex tape, myth-busting site snopes looked into it, along with rumors that she was an adult-film actress, and finds the allegations to be \" mostly untrue. \" the sex-tape story stems from 2005, when machado reportedly was filmed having sex with another member of a spanish reality-tv show. But the grainy night-vision footage of a \" covered \" couple in bed is not explicit and, given that it stems from a reality show, may have been a staged stunt anyway, says snopes. In a series of tweets friday morning, trump unleashed the following: first: \" wow, crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u. Hillary floated her as an ' angel ' without checking her past, which is terrible! \" second: \" using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement! hillary was set up by a con. \" third: \" did crooked hillary help disgusting ( check out sex tape and past ) alicia m become a u.s. Citizen so she could use her in the debate? \" also surfacing are reports that machado was implicated in a murder as a getaway driver about 20 years ago and that she threatened a judge, but she wasn't charged over either, reports cbs news. Asked about the allegations on cnn, she said, \" i ' m no saint girl. \"",

        "summary": "The western man's sperm count just isn't what it used to be. In what the washington post calls the largest and most comprehensive look into the matter, an international team of researchers reports in the journal human reproductive update that after analyzing 185 previous studies involving 42,000 men worldwide between 1973 and 2011, they've observed a 52 % drop in sperm concentration in men from north america, europe, australia, and new zealand. This is in stark contrast to men in south america, asia, and africa, where no such decline was found, though not nearly as much data comes out of those regions, researchers report in press release. \" given the importance of sperm counts for male fertility and human health, this study is an urgent wake-up call, \" the lead author says. In 1973, the researchers estimate, men had an average sperm concentration of 99 million per milliliter. The world health organization puts the threshold for impaired chances of conception at 40 million, and today, the average western male's sperm concentration has dropped very close to that: 47 million. And while there isn't exactly a fertility crisis among humans, gizmodo calls the research \" admittedly scary. \" having a low sperm count has been linked to a range of increased health problems and even higher mortality. It's \" a signal that there's something wrong in men's health overall, \" one researcher tells the post, noting that \" the decline is strong and... The decline is continuing. \" what's causing the drop is up for debate, and everything from chemical and pesticide exposure to smoking and stress have been blamed.

Tiede, who in 1996 killed his longtime companion, wealthy 81-year-old widow marjorie nugent, was originally sentenced to life in prison. But his appeals attorney argued that his sentence should be reduced because he was sexually assaulted as a child and nugent ( played by shirley maclaine ) was abusive toward him; her body was found 9 months after she vanished in a freezer in her garage. The da who originally prosecuted tiede agreed, the ap reports, and tiede was freed on $ 10,000 bond. The state criminal appeals court still needs to formally sign off on the reduction. A psychiatrist who examined tiede explained that he killed nugent in a \" brief dissociative episode, \" and that the murder was not planned. Tiede, now 55, \" doesn't come across in examination at all as a person prone to violence, \" he testified yesterday. \" that set of circumstances... Is not going to re-create itself. \" the sexual abuse tiede suffered at the hands of an uncle between ages 12 and 18 had not been divulged during the trial — a lawyer who decided to investigate the case, with linklater's blessing, after seeing the movie discovered tiede had been abused, texas monthly explained in a january article.

A few years earlier, bernie had quit his job at the funeral home to work as mrs. Nugent's business manager and traveling companion. She also had named him the sole heir to her estate, which was worth millions ( her husband had been a prominent carthage oilman and banker ). Bernie was on his way to becoming a very rich man.

Nugent four times in the back and then buried her in her own deep freeze in her garage, where she remained for nine months before anyone started looking for her"

        "summary": "A bacterium that flourishes in warm, brackish water has killed two people in florida this year and will likely take more lives — but people can easily lower their chance of infection. Florida health officials say one person picked up the bacterium, known as vibrio vulnificus, via \" raw seafood exposure \" and another through \" multiple exposures, \" upi reports. It's not unusual in florida, where 32 vibrio vulnificus cases were reported last year and seven were fatal. People usually get infected by entering vibrio vulnificus-infected water with open wounds — even a mosquito bite can serve as a point of entry, per the gulf coast research laboratory — or eating raw seafood. Sufferers with weakened immune systems ( chronic liver disease in particular ) are especially at risk, according to the florida department of health. Mild cases resemble stomach flu or food poisoning, cbs news reports, but vibrio vulnificus becomes life-threatening when it enters the bloodstream. Then come symptoms like blistering skin lesions, low blood pressure, chills, and fever. Sufferers sometimes endure painful skin infections and have their limbs amputated; death results in about half of life-threatening cases. As the laboratory puts it, that's \" said by many experts to be the highest human fatality rate for any bacterium. \" the more grim results explain why vibrio vulnificus is loosely called a \" flesh-eating \" bacteria even though it doesn't meet the official criteria, upi noted last year. For more, see wtvm's list of ways to avoid vibrio vulnificus, including tips on shellfish-cooking and a warning to avoid raw oysters altogether. Another vibrio vulnificus factoid: maryland and gulf coast states like florida have the worst infection rates, but the bacterium is spreading to new waters thanks to global warming, per the laboratory.

The couple, zakia, 18, and mohammad ali, 21, fled their homes in mountainous bamian province after her family threatened her with an \"honor killing \" because she wanted to marry outside her ethnic group, and against her father's wishes. They have stayed in hiding since their escape in march, but an afghan official who helped zakia evade almost certain death has now fled afghanistan and is seeking asylum in rwanda, where she is expected to arrive monday. Zakia's family, which included nine other children, many of them young, says it has been driven from its farm, resettling in kabul to eke out an uncertain existence as day laborers. Mohammad ali's family is still on its farm in bamian, but his father and brother say they have been forced to mortgage most of their land to raise money to help the couple by bribing officials.

But thanks to an aging population, the personal care industry is expected to add 754,000 jobs for 37.4 % growth by 2026, while the home health industry is expected to add 425,600 new jobs for 46.7 % growth. Together, that's more jobs than projected across the eight other fastest-growing fields combined, notes the washington post. The problem: they're among the lowest-paying jobs in the country, per 24/7 wall st. Personal care aides make about $ 21,900 annually; home health aides pull in $ 22,600. Some 90 % of these positions are held by women, many of whom live in poverty, per the post. \" what they earn makes it hard for them to pay the rent, or get an education to move into better-paying jobs, \" says a labor economist. She suggests the government should supplement aides ' wages, as they can help the health care system save money by keeping people out of nursing homes.

As npr reports, the tiremaker runs a rubber plantation and basically the entire town of harbel, outside monrovia, liberia. And when an employee's wife turned up with the virus on march 30, firestone liberia's managing director says they \" went into crisis mode \": upon discovering that there was nowhere to treat her, the company turned to the internet for help in treating ebola itself. Within a day, they had an ebola ward. Within two, the woman was quarantined. They handed medical workers hazmat suits to prevent the virus'spread. \" none of us had any ebola experience, \" says the director, but npr notes that they did have what everywhere else in the region did not: the muscle and resources that a major corporation can harness. The woman died, but not one of firestone's roughly 8,500 employees and 71,500 family members contracted the virus. Months passed, and when the virus rampaged through the area in august, firestone stepped up to the plate: it expanded the isolation ward, built an annex and quarantine centers, and sent out-of-work teachers ( schools had been shut down ) to go door-to-door and educate. Janitors were taught how to properly bury the dead, notes the wall street journal. It runs its hospital ward with military-like precision, and at present it's down to just three patients, a trio of boys whose homes are outside the plantation. As for what's needed to contain the outbreak, a cdc rep says simply: \" more firestones. \" ( meanwhile, spain is planning to kill an ebola patient's dog, and the dallas ebola patient's bill is rising $ 1,000 per hour. )",

Today, firestone workers and their families make up a community of 80,000 people across the plantation. Firestone detected its first ebola case on march 30, when an employee's wife arrived from northern liberia. She'd been caring for a disease-stricken woman and was herself diagnosed with the disease. Since then firestone has done a remarkable job of keeping the virus at bay. It built its own treatment center and set up a comprehensive response that's managed to quickly stop transmission. Dr. Brendan flannery, the head of the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention's team in liberia, has hailed firestone's efforts as resourceful, innovative and effective.

Poole/npr the classic slogan for firestone tires was \" where the rubber meets the road. \" when it comes to ebola, the rubber met the road at the firestone rubber plantation in harbel, liberia. Harbel is a company town not far from the capital city of monrovia. It was named in 1926 after the founder of the firestone tire and rubber company, harvey and his wife, idabelle. Today, firestone workers and their families make up a community of 80,000 people across the plantation. Firestone detected its first ebola case on march 30, when an employee's wife arrived from northern liberia. She'd been caring for a disease-stricken woman and was herself diagnosed with the disease. Since then firestone has done a remarkable job of keeping the virus at bay. It built its own treatment center and set up a comprehensive response that's managed to quickly stop transmission. Dr. Brendan flannery, the head of the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention's team in liberia, has hailed firestone's efforts as resourceful, innovative and effective. Currently the only ebola cases on the sprawling, 185-square-mile plantation are in patients who come from neighboring towns",

The unnamed driver, 31, told police that he took his eyes off the road for three or four seconds in order to take a breath test via his ignition interlock device at 6: 20pm on nov. 10. The fort-worth star telegram describes it as a \" re-test. \" as he was doing so, alexis butler was backing her toyota camry out of a driveway; the driver smashed into her passenger side, with nbc dallas-fort worth reporting police found no tire tracks at the scene to suggest the driver applied the brakes before hitting butler. Police say the male driver wasn't impaired during the incident; no charges have yet been filed. Lt. Chris cook with the arlington police department says they plan to review the man's original court order and to also look at the device's directions. \" it's very concerning to us, as a police department, that an individual may be operating some type of ignition equipment while they're in a moving vehicle, \" says cook. The dallas news describes a \" rolling retest \" as one where the driver must \" blow into the device to ensure he or she isn't drinking while driving. \" the male driver was uninjured. ( a toddler who was buckled incorrectly into a car seat was the only survivor of this michigan crash. )",

            "Image copyright ap image caption juan carlos abdicated last year to make way for his son felipe spain's supreme court has agreed to examine a belgian woman's claim to be the illegitimate daughter of ex-king juan carlos, who abdicated last summer. Ingrid sartiau says her mother had an affair with him in the 1960s, while he was married and a crown prince. Royal officials said they respected the independence of the court, but refused further comment. The case can only be heard because the king lost his immunity from prosecution after his abdication. The court rejected a separate claim by alberto sola, born in barcelona in 1956, who said his mother also had an affair with juan carlos. But an official confirmed the case of ms sartiau, who was born in 1966 after juan carlos married, would be examined. Juan carlos, 77, will now have 20 days to respond to the suit. Ultimately, the former king could be asked to take a paternity test and the case could go as far as a public hearing. He stepped down last june to make way for his son, felipe vi, saying it was time for a \" new era \".

Authorities said it appeared nobody was killed, but three people were injured in the bridge failure that raised the question about the safety of aging spans and cut off the main route between seattle and canada. \" we don't think anyone else went into the water, \" said marcus deyerin, a spokesman for the northwest washington incident management team. Three people were reported in stable condition at local hospitals. A portion of the four-lane bridge over the skagit river collapsed about 7pm, said a state trooper. At a press conference, authorities said a semi truck struck the bridge, which was about 50 feet above the water, causing the collapse. Witnesses tell northwest cable news they saw the truck, which was carrying an oversize load, hit the bridge's beams shortly before the collapse. The bridge is not considered structurally deficient but is listed as being \" functionally obsolete \" — meaning that the design is outdated, according to a database compiled by the federal highway administration. The bridge was built in 1955 and has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records — well below the statewide average rating of 80, per ap data.",

        "summary": "Iceland's beauty attracts more than a million travelers from around the world every year, and a tourist just learned the hard way that the country doesn't mess around when it comes to protecting its turf. A swiss woman in her 60s entered the country in her camper by ferry and snuck her cat in along with her. Under icelandic law, pets entering the country can only pass through keflavík international airport, must have the proper paperwork, and must be quarantined for a month, reports the iceland review. Police acting on a tip arrested the woman in höfn in southeastern iceland within two hours of her arrival and promptly brought her cat to a vet, where it was killed. They're also billing the woman for disinfecting her camper van. Some are calling the measure extreme, though travel and leisure notes that iceland has a delicate ecosystem to protect, and that many diseases found in animals all over the world have never been detected in iceland — including rabies. The argument in favor of the tough measure is that the island's animals could be devastated by just one undeclared animal unwittingly introducing a disease for which the native population has no immunity. Iceland magazine reports that this isn't the first time a cat has been smuggled onto the island only to be euthanized. In 2003, police put down a french couple's cat they'd hidden in their rv. ( there are now about two feral cats per human in hawaii. )",

Kelsey smith is believed to have flown into a rage and savagely beaten jeida torres on saturday, police sources tell the new york daily news. He allegedly called 911 posing as a neighbor before fleeing the family's apartment in a brooklyn homeless shelter. Cops found the dying toddler and her badly beaten 5-year-old brother, who police believe may have tried to intervene when smith attacked his sister. Police say smith, 20, routinely watched his new wife's two children when she was at work and there had been no previous domestic violence calls to the apartment. The 5-year-old boy is still in the hospital, as is smith, who relatives say tried to slit his wrists in a suicide attempt before police caught up with him, reports the new york times. He has been charged with felony assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17 years old; murder charges may follow. Neighbors say they heard loud arguments at the apartment in recent weeks, and brooklyn borough president eric adams has promised a thorough investigation, reports cbs 2. \" a person doesn't start taking the life of a child overnight, it is something that is built up to, \" he says. \" did we have this abuser among us and it was ignored? \" ( in mexico earlier this year, police and soldiers managed to rescue hundreds of abused kids from \" truly terrible conditions \" in a refuge. )",

        "summary": "The supreme court ruled unanimously today that an anti-abortion group can challenge an ohio law that bars people from making false statements about political candidates during a campaign. The high court said the susan b. Anthony list does not have to wait until it is prosecuted under the law to claim its first amendment rights have been infringed. The court did not directly rule on the constitutionality of the law, but the decision raises serious doubts about whether the law — and similar measures in more than a dozen other states — can survive. The case began during the 2010 election when the group planned to put up billboards ads accusing then-rep. Steve driehaus of supporting taxpayer-funded abortion because he supported president barack obama's new health care law. Driehaus, a democrat who opposes abortion, claimed the ads misrepresented the true facts and therefore violated the false speech law. In other high court news today: a divided court sided with gun control groups and the obama administration, by upholding the federal ban on \" straw \" gun purchases. The justices ruled 5-4 that a man could not buy a gun for a relative in pennsylvania, even though that relative was legally allowed to own guns. Anthony kennedy joined the court's liberals, who argued in their decision that allowing straw purchasing would make it too easy to evade the various restrictions on gun ownership. The court handed argentina a double defeat in its long-running fight with holders of its defaulted bonds, rejecting without comment its appeal of judgments ordering it to pay more than $ 1.3 billion to hedge funds that hold some of the country's bonds. The justices ignored the south american country's pleas that its economy could be threatened if it has to pay off the old debt. The court also dealt a blow to scottie pippen, refusing to revive his defamation suit against nbc universal and other media outlets that had reported that he filed for bankruptcy.",

            "Washington ( ap ) — a divided supreme court sided with gun control groups and the obama administration monday, ruling that the federal ban on \" straw \" purchases of guns can be enforced even if the ultimate buyer is legally allowed to own a gun. The justices ruled 5-4 that the law applied to a virginia man who bought a gun with the intention of transferring it to a relative in pennsylvania who was not prohibited from owning firearms. The ruling settles a split among appeals courts over federal gun laws intended to prevent sham buyers from obtaining guns for the sole purpose of giving them to another person. The laws were part of congress ' effort to make sure firearms did not get into the hands of unlawful recipients. Writing for the majority, justice elena kagan said the federal government's elaborate system of background checks and record-keeping requirements help law enforcement investigate crimes by tracing guns to their buyers. Those provisions would mean little, she said,",

Then, in a 7-1 ruling, the high court said the bond holders could use american courts to force argentina to reveal where it owns property around the world. The decision should make it easier for them to collect on court judgments. The legal fight stems from debt that has been unpaid since the country's 2001 economic crisis.

            "Washington ( ap ) — the supreme court has declined to revive a defamation lawsuit that former chicago bulls star scottie pippen filed against several media companies for falsely reporting he had filed for bankruptcy. The justices on monday did not comment in letting stand lower court decisions dismissing the $ 10 million lawsuit against nbcuniversal media llc, cbs interactive, inc. And other media outlets. Lower courts found that as a public figure, pippen could not show the reports were published with actual malice. That standard requires pippen to show the information was published knowing it was false or issued with reckless disregard for the truth. Pippen claimed the media companies acted with malice because they refused to correct or remove the erroneous reports from several websites after being alerted to the error.",
            "Washington ( ap ) — a divided supreme court sided with gun control groups and the obama administration monday, ruling that the federal ban on \" straw \" purchases of guns can be enforced even if the ultimate buyer is legally allowed to own a gun. The justices ruled 5-4 that the law applied to a virginia man who bought a gun with the intention of transferring it to a relative in pennsylvania who was not prohibited from owning firearms. The ruling settles a split among appeals courts over federal gun laws intended to prevent sham buyers from obtaining guns for the sole purpose of giving them to another person. The laws were part of congress ' effort to make sure firearms did not get into the hands of unlawful recipients. Writing for the majority, justice elena kagan said the federal government's elaborate system of background checks and record-keeping requirements help law enforcement investigate crimes by tracing guns to their buyers. Those provisions would mean little, she said,",
            "Washington ( ap ) — the supreme court on monday handed argentina a double defeat in its long-running fight with holders of its defaulted bonds, despite the south american country's pleas that its economy could be threatened if it has to pay off the old debt. The justices rejected without comment argentina's appeal of judgments ordering it to pay more than $ 1.3 billion to hedge funds that hold some of the country's bonds. Then, in a 7-1 ruling, the high court said the bond holders could use american courts to force argentina to reveal where it owns property around the world. The decision should make it easier for them to collect on court judgments. The legal fight stems from debt that has been unpaid since the country's 2001 economic crisis. Investors holding more than 92 percent of argentina's defaulted debt agreed in 2005 and 2010 to write off two-thirds of their pre-crisis value, providing debt relief that enabled the"

        "summary": "Gold miners hoping to strike it rich in peru appear to have inflicted the miserable side effect of mercury poisoning on an estimated 48,000 people. Peru's government declared a 60-day health emergency last month after duke researchers analyzed hair from a sample of 3,000 madre de dios residents and found that 40 % showed mercury levels above the maximum recommended by the who, reports nature. The area has been booming, with gold production in march up 28 % from a year previously. But to extract the gold, miners use a method involving mercury that results in about 40 tons of the latter being dumped into waterways annually. The duke study suggests those with mercury poisoning — which can cause brain or kidney damage in severe cases — likely ate contaminated fish. \" we now know with certainty what the source of the exposure is, \" says peru's deputy health minister. \" we are not going to solve this in two months, or even in a year, but the health ministry has to start. \" under the health emergency, 25 villages spread across 33,000 square miles will receive food and medical aid, including canned fish, multivitamins to help with anemia, and perhaps quinoa, which researchers say may help lower mercury levels. Community fish farms are also planned, but peru's presidential election on june 5 may present a hurdle. One of two top candidates is a former mining minister and both support the industry, an analyst tells afp. Some government officials also aren't convinced that fish consumption is responsible for the poisonings and worry the emergency declaration will hurt tourism.

        "summary": "Walter becker, one half of the legendary rock duo steely dan, died sunday at the age of 67, the new york times reports. Becker, a guitarist, bassist, and vocalist, formed the band with donald fagen in 1972 after the two men met at bard college in the late 1960s. Together they became one of the most successful rock acts of the 1970s, creating a sound that owed as much to jazz as rock and roll. Since forming, the band has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001. After breaking up for most of the 80s the band re-formed in 1993 and won the grammy award for album of the year that year. While the cause of becker's death has yet to be announced, he had been suffering from an undisclosed illness in recent months that kept him off recent steely dan shows, vulture reports. In a statement released sunday, fagen says he intends to \" keep the music we created together as long as i can with the steely dan band. \"",

Such gun violence hasn't been seen in chicago since july 5, 2003, when 10 homicides occurred, reports the chicago tribune. Police say the various shootings were unconnected ( though two 30-something men did die in one shooting ). Among the dead are two 19-year-olds; a woman in her 20s; a 25-year-old man shot in the head, chest, and groin; and a 60-year-old man, nbc chicago reports. \" it's unfortunate to have this many murders in one day, \" says an officer. \" is this the worst it has been? no. We've got to put it into perspective. \" police say one of the nine gunshot deaths wasn't a homicide but was accidental: 11-year-old antwone j. Price was shot by a family member who was fooling around with a gun. His father and grandfather previously died in shootings, his family says. Over 36 hours from tuesday afternoon to early thursday, the death toll reached 12. Homicides have now spiked 20 % in chicago over last year, with 294 as of aug. 23, compared to 244 by that date in 2014.",

        "summary": "It's a criminal tale that reads like catch me if you can. At its center: a thief of antique silver alleged to have burgled 500 homes over 30 years ( including that of ivanka trump ) and the retired detective who spent his career trailing him. Blane nordahl was arrested yesterday in a small town in north florida, thanks in part to the dogged efforts of lonnie mason, a former nj detective who twice captured nordahl and who tipped atlanta police off to the 51-year-old after noticing a pattern of southern burglaries via internet reports — as many as 70 this year, reports the athens banner-herald. Among them: a 1734 silver mug once sipped by george ii, slipped out of an atlanta home via a removed windowpane; and silver spoons made by paul revere that disappeared from a nc plantation home whose alarm system was deactivated. The descriptions of nordahl, per the new york times, are fascinating: at 5-feet-4, he's able to squeeze in through windowpanes or door panels, breaking in so neatly that homeowners often don't realize they've been robbed until an occasion arises that demands the good silver ( in the case of the atlanta robbery, neither the homeowner's cameras nor those of neighbor tyler perry spotted the thief ). He is so schooled in silver, reportedly thanks to his painter father, that he ' ll decline to take things that might fool others — a utensil with a hollow silver handle, for instance. ( the florida times-union notes that during one burglary, nordahl allegedly taunted mason by leaving $ 1,000 arranged on the table. ) he's been arrested more than a dozen times, first in 1983, and was last paroled in 2010. He headed to his sister's home in florida, leading mason to keep an eye on theft reports there. It wasn't until mason thought to search neighboring states for reported thefts that he realized nordahl was allegedly back at it. Mason went on to advise a team of two dozen police in six states, ultimately leading to yesterday's arrest. ( click for another wild burglary story. )",

The clip shows korean \" comfort women \" held as sex slaves by the japanese military, reports the bbc. It's believed to be the first such film clip known to exist, though images of \" comfort women \" had previously surfaced in still photographs.

A research team from seoul national university found the footage in the us national archives after a two-year search, reports reuters. An american soldier is believed to have filmed the scene, in which a chinese officer talks to the women lined up in front of a building used as a brothel. Japan forced an estimated 200,000 women to work as sex slaves for its soldiers during world war ii. ( earlier this year, south korea angered japan with a statue honoring the women. )",

A worker told police that a box filled with two skulls and a bunch of bones was discovered by staffers yesterday in a closet that the consulate's previous management had used, the chicago tribune reports. With the box was a letter postmarked in june from rochester, minn., informing the consulate that the bones belonged to two japanese wwii vets and asking the consulate to return the bones to japan for burial. The anonymous sender said in the letter that the remains were of two soldiers who had been killed on tinian island, which, according to the national park service, is the island in the pacific's marianas that served as the launching pad for planes that dropped the hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bombs. Interviews with members of the former consulate staff revealed that they had sent photos of the bones to a pathologist when the box originally showed up back on june 17 — but the results came back a couple of months later saying the bones \" may not be of japanese descent, \" according to the police report cited in the tribune. The remains are now reportedly with the cook county medical examiner's office. ( this woman found 80 skeletons stuffed into ikea bags in a swedish church. )",

As an internet sleuth has revealed, it was all too unbelievable to be true. Though seo, a 24-year-old food blogger and writer for the huffington post, defended her time at the finish line when questioned by a timer and went on to claim a medal, her race didn't sit well with derek murphy of marathoninvestigation.com, who noticed gps data seo later shared showing her completing the 13.1-mile route was recorded in the afternoon — well after the morning half-marathon was completed, per the miami new times. Murphy also believed the data, showing an even pace of about six minutes per mile at 122 steps per minute, came from a bike ride. But his biggest piece of evidence came when he zoomed in on a photo of seo at the finish line; the running watch on her wrist showed she'd only run 11.65 miles. \" after information was relayed to her, \" murphy says seo posted an apology to instagram, since deleted, claiming she \" cut the course \" because she felt ill. Once at the finish line, \" i got swept away in the moment and pretended i ran the entire course \" then later \" proceeded to bike the course afterward with my gps watch to cover my wrongdoings, \" seo said.

After last year's mass shootings, colorado was the only state beyond democratic strongholds new york, california and connecticut to pass gun-control legislation. Gun-control measures died in congress, as well as minnesota, oregon, washington and delaware. Outspent by about 5-to-1, recall supporters cited a big anti-recall donation from new york mayor michael bloomberg to make one of their main points — that democrats controlling the state legislature were more interested in listening to the white house and outside interests than their own constituents. That feeling was particularly strong in pueblo, an industrial city in southern colorado where democrats tend to be more conservative on social issues and voters of all persuasions tend to embrace gun rights.
