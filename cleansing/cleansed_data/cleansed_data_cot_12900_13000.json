        "summary": "City officials are scrambling, apartment owners are organizing, and civil engineering experts are continuing to fret in the ongoing saga of san francisco's millennium tower. The 58-story reinforced-concrete skyscraper has already sunk 16 inches and leaned a few inches closer to a nearby building since it was built seven years ago. Per the new york times, blame for the problem ( depending on who you talk to ) is being assigned to everything from \" very challenging \" soil conditions and a \" deficient \" foundation — business insider notes the building was anchored 80 feet into packed sand rather than to bedrock 200 feet down — to lack of city oversight and adjacent digging and groundwater removal. All of which is worrisome in a metropolitan area that lies in a major earthquake zone. Potential buyers had been warned by developers in 2009 that some aesthetic elements of the building, like the landscaping and color of the stone hallways, were subject to change, but they say they had no clue the building had already sunk 8 inches by the time construction had finished. Jerry dodson, who paid $ 2.1 million for his 42nd-floor apartment, says sewage lines and elevators are at risk of malfunctioning with any further leaning or sinkage — and it's anticipated the building could sink as much as 30 inches, cbs san francisco notes. Dodson's wife reveals one possible solution an engineer has suggested: removing the top 20 floors of the building to reduce its weight. The developer insists the tower is still safe, per cnbc. ( elsewhere in san francisco, the \" east bay walls \" remain an intriguing puzzle. )",

Mimi lee and then-husband stephen findley froze five embryos after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. They signed an agreement with the ivf clinic saying the embryos must be \" thawed and discarded \" if the couple divorced, the san jose mercury news reports. The couple split in 2013, and lee went to court to keep the embryos she calls her \" babies, \" arguing that the agreement wasn't binding and it violated her right to have children, reports the san francisco chronicle. Superior court judge anne-christine massullo upheld the agreement in what the los angeles times reports is the first california ruling of its kind. Findley testified that the divorce had been bitter and he didn't want to be forced into fatherhood with lee, per the times. Lee, an anesthesiologist, argued that she had misunderstood the nature of the agreement and thought she could change her mind, which the judge found hard to believe. \" the court holds that while lee might have a right to procreate in other circumstances not before the court, she does not have a right to procreate with findley, \" the judge wrote, calling it a \" disturbing consequence of modern biological technology \" that the fate of the embryos must be decided by \" cold legal principles. \" ( modern family star sofia vergara is in a similar dispute with ex nick loeb. )",

        "summary": "A worker at a pennsylvania sugar plant died buried alive in sugar in an accident that could have been prevented by a safety device removed just 13 days earlier, a propublica investigation finds. Janio salinas — a 50-year-old who, like every other employee in the csc sugar warehouse in fairless hills, was a temp worker — died after climbing inside a huge hopper to remove sugar clogs on february 25, 2013. The warehouse manager told the occupational safety and health administration that he had asked for a safety screen to prevent such an accident, but after one was installed, the plant manager decided to get rid of it because it was slowing down production. The bucks county courier times reports that with the screen, sugar clumps had to be broken up every 30 to 40 minutes; without it, clogs only occurred two or three times a shift. Another worker nearly met the same fate soon after the screen was removed, but it wasn't replaced despite the near-miss, investigators found. The death at the plant that supplies the makers of snapple drinks and ben &amp; jerry's ice cream was one of numerous gruesome deaths that spurred osha to boost enforcement of rules affecting temp workers, who face a much greater risk of being killed or injured on the job than other workers, propublica notes. Before salinas died early last year, there had been no reports of violations at the sugar plant, which was fined $ 25,855 by osha after the accident. After the plant installed a new safety device, the fine was cut to $ 18,098.",

            "Temp land lost wages, high injury rates, few benefits this story was done in collaboration with univision. Inside the sugar plant in fairless hills, pa., nobody could find janio salinas, a 50-year-old temp worker from just over the new jersey border. Throughout the morning, salinas and a handful of other workers had been bagging mounds of sugar for a company that supplies the makers of snapple drinks and ben &amp; jerry's ice cream. But sugar clumps kept clogging the massive hopper, forcing the workers to climb inside with shovels to help the granules flow out the funnel-like hole at the bottom. Coming back from lunch that day in february 2013, one employee said he had seen salinas digging in the sugar. But when he looked back, salinas was gone. All that remained was a shovel buried up to its handle. Then, peering through a small gap in the bottom of the hopper, someone noticed what appeared to be blue jeans. It was salinas. He had been buried alive in sugar. As harrowing as the accident was, federal safety investigators recently discovered something perhaps even more disturbing: a safety device that would have prevented salinas'death had been removed just 13 days before the accident because a manager believed it was slowing down production. After a series of gruesome accidents involving untrained temp workers, the u.s. Occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has stepped up its enforcement of rules affecting temp workers. In recent cases, osha has held companies and temp agencies jointly responsible for training, and it has fined temp agencies for not assessing potential dangers before sending people to a workplace. But the federal report on the accident that killed salinas reveals how deeply rooted the problems are — and how difficult a challenge osha faces in changing the way temp workers are treated. Univision went undercover to work at temp agencies in new brunswick, new jersey. At one, a producer was asked to sign a safety quiz that had already been filled out. When he pointed out that he hadn't actually taken the safety test, the recruiter responded, \"i did it to save you time. \" ( courtesy of univision ) the salinas case is featured in a new investigative report by univision, airing tonight on its news magazine show, aquí y ahora.

            "**scroll down for a big picture of the cover and vote on whether demi's hip was removed** photoshopping is a part of creating any magazine cover, but usually it doesn't render the subject an anatomical wonder. Demi moore, 47, covers the december w in a gold balmain leotard. Yes she appears impossibly thin, but moreover, there seems to be a chunk missing from her left hip where you'd expect a more contiguous line would connect hip to thigh beneath that pelvic drapery. A w spokesperson tells jezebel.com the magazine \" did not do anything unusual or out of the ordinary on demi moore for the photo on the cover of w. Demi is an extraordinary beautiful woman and we feel our cover reflects that. \" she doesn't say whether photoshopping women within an inch of their life is unusual. Demi also denies she fell victim to a botched photoshop job. \" here is the original image people my hips were not touched don't let these people bullshit you! \" she tweeted thursday afternoon, along with an \" original image \" that matches the cover image. She followed up with several tweets talking about her skinniness and how flattering the shoot was: \" demi shouldn't be on the defensive over someone else's mistakes. She's a beautiful woman who needs no help from photoshop, \" said fashion photographer anthony citrano, who posted a commentary and high-res image here. \" it's too bad w or the photogs won't step up and take some responsibility. \" photo:"

And sure enough, when one heads over to the dickinson website, the application to receive a harvey relief grant contains a section on the third page titled \" verification not to boycott israel, \" spelling out that the applicant will \" not boycott israel, \" and won't do so at any time \" during the term of this agreement. \" the washington post and dallas news offer some context, with a dickinson city lawyer pointing to a state law he says makes this language legally acceptable. That legislation, in effect as of sept. 1, is the anti-bds ( boycott, divestments, and sanctions ) bill, which, per a release, \" prohibits all state agencies from contracting with, and certain public funds from investing in, companies that boycott israel. \" \" anti-israel policies are anti-texas, \" gov. Greg abbott said at the bill's may signing. But some note the law mentions companies that boycott israel, not individuals, and the aclu says this condition for aid violates one's right to protest. \" the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression, \" the aclu of texas ' legal director says in a statement. \" dickinson's requirement is an egregious violation of the first amendment, reminiscent of mccarthy-era loyalty oaths, \" he adds.",

            "A federal appeals court on friday upheld a decision barring the federal government from requiring tobacco companies to put large graphic health warnings on cigarette packages to show that smoking can disfigure and even kill people. In a 2-1 decision, the u.s. Court of appeals in washington affirmed a lower court ruling that the requirement ran afoul of the first amendment's free speech protections. The appeals court tossed out the requirement and told the food and drug administration to go back to the drawing board. Some of the nation's largest tobacco companies, including r.j. Reynolds tobacco co., sued to block the mandate to include warnings to show the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit lighting up. They argued that the proposed warnings went beyond factual information into anti-smoking advocacy. The government argued the photos of dead and diseased smokers are factual in conveying the dangers of tobacco, which is responsible for about 443,000 deaths in the u.s. A year. The nine graphic warnings proposed by the fda include color images of a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat, and a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a mother's kiss. These are accompanied by language that says smoking causes cancer and can harm fetuses. The warnings were to cover the entire top half of cigarette packs, front and back, and include the phone number for a stop-smoking hotline, 1-800-quit-now. In the majority opinion, the appeals court wrote that the case raises \" novel questions about the scope of the government's authority to force the manufacturer of a product to go beyond making purely factual and accurate commercial disclosures and undermine its own economic interest _ in this case, by making ` every single pack of cigarettes in the country ( a ) mini billboard ' for the government's anti-smoking message. \" the court also wrote that the fda \" has not provided a shred of evidence \" showing that the warnings will \" directly advance \" its interest in reducing the number of americans who smoke. Tobacco companies increasingly rely on their packaging to build brand loyalty and grab consumers _ one of the few advertising levers left to them after the government curbed their presence in magazines, billboards and tv. \" it's a significant vindication of first amendment principles, \" said floyd abrams, an attorney representing lorillard tobacco. \" there's never been any doubt that the government could require warnings on products that can have dangerous results."

Per the correspondence, bin laden specifically tasked an associate with collecting wikileaks material, and was sent secret military reports on afghanistan released by wikileaks, along with some embassy cables.

As the prosecution approaches the end of its case, government lawyers presented the trial judge, colonel denise lind, with testimony and statements of fact that attempted to underline al-qaida's familiarity with the web and wikileaks specifically.

Prosecutors read into the trial record a statement already discussed in court, that reveals that the al-qaida leader osama bin laden personally asked for wikileaks material to be provided to him. Bin laden wrote a letter to an assistant requesting that he gather the material, and in response was sent battlefield reports from afghanistan, known as the afghan warlogs, as well as some of the embassy cables published by wikileaks. Bin laden's letter and response was found on digital items recovered by the team of us navy seals who burst into his compound in abbottabad, pakistan, and killed him in may 2011.

Authorities say riehl fired more than 100 rounds in his suburban denver apartment before he was killed by a swat team on sunday. University of wyoming college of law students had been warned about riehl, a former student, because of social media posts critical of professors at the school in laramie, reports ktwo-am. A nov. 6 email from assistant college of law dean lindsay hoyt told students to notify campus police if they spotted riehl or his car near campus. In addition, security on campus was increased for several days. Campus officers called police in colorado in mid-november to warn them about riehl, suggesting his rants were indicative of mental illness, uw police chief mike samp tells the denver post. Samp says it's possible that colorado authorities faced the same issue as wyoming officials when an apparently mentally ill, dangerous person makes indirect threats. \" wyoming statutes are pretty clear: if someone is not making an immediate threat, they cannot be held for a mental evaluation. They are very tough cases, \" samp says. Riehl, an attorney and an iraq war veteran, had also posted videos criticizing colorado law enforcement officers in profane, highly personal terms.

The warning to lone tree was made in mid-november, more than six weeks before riehl shot and killed douglas county deputy zackari parrish.

            "Wyoming authorities warned lone tree police about bizarre implied threats more than six weeks before a gunman killed a douglas county deputy and wounded four law enforcement officers, officials say. University of wyoming detectives called lone tree police and warned that iraq war veteran matthew edward riehl, 37, had made veiled threats against professors of the uw law school, where he earned a law degree, and that his vulgar, nonsensical rantings were indicative of a mental illness, said chief mike samp of the university of wyoming police department. The warning to lone tree was made in mid-november, more than six weeks before riehl shot and killed douglas county deputy zackari parrish. Samp said it's possible that colorado authorities faced the same conundrum wyoming officials do when an apparently mentally ill and dangerous person makes veiled but not direct, imminent threats. \"wyoming statutes are pretty clear: if someone is not making an immediate threat, they cannot by held for a mental evaluation. They are very tough cases, \" samp said.

He shot and wounded a bystander who tried to intervene, and then killed two people and injured two more, one of them critically, in apparently random shootings the next day, authorities say. Tordil, a homeland security employee who has been a federal law enforcement officer since 1987, was arrested after police spotted him in a shopping plaza. They watched as he visited a dunkin'donuts, browsed a craft store, and had lunch at a boston market. Sources tell the post that he planned to commit \" suicide by cop, \" but was thwarted when up 100 officers surrounded him as soon as he left the restaurant. He has been charged with first-degree murder. Weirdly, the shopping plaza where he was arrested was the first place targeted by dc snipers john allen muhammad and lee boyd malvo in 2002. \" they ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance here today, which was an irony that was not lost on me, \" montgomery county state's attorney john mccarthy tells the ap. \" i think it's a coincidence. \"",

While grand juries usually return an indictment, fivethirtyeight.com notes, that doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to police shootings. Observers are pointing to a need for systemic change: at slate, jamelle bouie acknowledges that such indictments are \" extremely rare. \" and that's to be expected: \" actual justice for michael brown — a world in which young men like michael brown can't be gunned down without consequences — won't come from the criminal justice system. Our courts and juries aren't impartial arbiters — they exist inside society, not outside of it — and they can only provide as much justice as society is willing to give, \" he writes. Jason johnson raises similar concerns at cnn. \" police transparency, review of controversial programs, selecting objective prosecutors, and community engagement are basic government functions that should have worked far better in response \" to the shooting, he writes. A better-functioning government at any of these levels would have prompted \" a lot more faith in the grand jury decision, \" thus helping prevent further violence. In the washington post, a former federal prosecutor weighs in: \" i know firsthand how difficult it is to prosecute police officers, \" writes jenny durkan. Federal law \" essentially requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer intended to deprive a person of his civil rights, \" and that's a very difficult case to make.

For her part, daniels has sued the president, claiming the nda is invalid because it's missing trump's signature. The wall street journal reports the filing says the damages could be owed to either trump or essential consultants, the llc through which cohen paid daniels the $ 130,000. The bbc reports the filing also requested the case be taken from state to federal court, upping the likelihood the case would go arbitration and exit the \" public view, \" as usa today puts it. Bloomberg reports the filing argues that neither daniels nor trump are residents of california, where daniels ' own lawsuit was filed; a calif.

Palin is extremely popular with her conservative base, which has fueled the sales of her best-selling memoir. But she is a divisive political figure who not only draws the ire of liberals but some republicans, including staffers who deal with her during her run as john mccain's running mate. Steve schmidt, a top mccain strategist, said on \" 60 minutes \" last night that \" there were numerous instances that she said things that were -- that were not accurate that ultimately",
            "Former gov. Sarah palin of alaska has signed on as a contributor to the fox news channel. Jim watson/agence france-presse — getty images the network confirmed that ms. Palin would appear on the network's programming on a regular basis as part of a multiyear deal. Financial terms were not disclosed. Ms. Palin will not have her own regular program, one person with knowledge of the deal said, though she will host a series that will run on the network from time to time. This person would not elaborate, but the network does have a precedent for such a series. Oliver l. North is the host of an occasionally running documentary series on the military called \"war stories. \" many suspected that when ms. Palin retired as the governor of alaska last summer she was doing so to pursue some sort of career in television. The fox news deal, however, would not seem to be all-encompassing, and would appear to give her room for other pursuits, as well. The deal was formally announced on monday afternoon. Robert barnett, ms. Palin's lawyer, did not respond to a call for comment. \"i am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at fox news. It's wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news, \" ms. Palin said in"

Ulandis forte says his grandmother sometimes had to decide between paying for her medication and talking to him, but he credits her calls with enabling him to turn his life around after his release. The move, which caps rates at 11 cents per minute for prisons and 14 to 22 cents per minute for jails and limits fees, was supported by 26 civil and human rights groups, huffpo reports. \" studies show keeping communication in between families members and incarcerated loved ones reduces recidivism, and that helps us all, \" one supporter tells nbc. Rate caps were strongly opposed by the phone providers — who call the vote a \" business-ending event \" and are threatening legal action — and the national sheriffs ' association — which says it may have to eliminate inmates ' access to phones now, huffpo reports. Under the old system, prisons and jails received what have been called \" kickbacks \" in return for giving contracts to phone providers. In its vote, the fcc \" strongly encouraged \" ending that practice.",

A research team out of scotland's university of aberdeen has discovered high concentrations of human-created organic pollutants in crustaceans gathered from two deep-ocean trenches, putting to rest any hope that people haven't managed to muck up even the world's most far-flung locations. \" we often think deep-sea trenches are remote and pristine, untouched by humans, \" lead researcher alan jamieson tells nature, which notes he delivered his announcement about the find at a deep-sea exploration conference in china on june 8 and that the research has yet to be published. The work involved scientists lowering two unpeopled landers about 6 miles deep in 2014: one into the mariana trench in the western pacific ocean, and the other into the kermadec trench near new zealand. They then tested the amphipods — tiny crustaceans that resemble shrimp — they found down there and discovered the creatures had polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ), both hard-to-break down, carbon-based compounds used to make plastics and as flame retardants. The pcb concentration in mariana trench amphipods was especially stunning — 15 times that of the crustaceans in the kermadec. Researchers believe the high pcb levels may be due to the mariana trench's relative closeness to asian plastic manufacturers. \" the take-home message is that when you dump rubbish into the sea, it will ultimately sink, \" jameieson says. \" when [ pollutants ] fall into the trenches, they have nowhere else to go. So they're just going to keep building up. \" ( plastic is also floating around the ocean via human feces. )",

            "World amphipoda database ( part of worms - the world register of marine species ) introduction the amphipods belong to the very diverse crustacean class malacostraca, which includes other common groups such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp. The order amphipoda is part of the superorder peracarida, uniting a diverse group of small shrimp-like taxa that brood their young in a pouch, with no independent larval dispersal stage. Amphipods are unique in the possession of three pairs of pleopods and three pairs of uropods. In a small minority of cases secondary reduction of the abdomen may result in a loss of one or more pairs ( e.g. The caprellidae ). No other malacostracan group possesses more than one pair of uropods. The name amphipoda means 'different feet ' and refers to the different forms of the pereopods ( legs ) which contrasts with the related isopoda meaning 'same feet '. Amphipods are variously known as, scuds, shrimp or sideswimmers. Those amphipods that have colonised the land are often referred to as landhoppers and beach dwellers are called sandhoppers or beach/sand fleas. The order amphipoda is very diverse and currently contains 10,207 species which are divided into six suborders: suborder amphilochidea ( 88 families; 682 genera; 4,140 species ) suborder colomastigidea ( 2 families; 3 genera; 55 species ) suborder hyperiidea ( 35 families; 76 genera; 283 species ) suborder"

        "summary": "Russia's adelina sotnikova pulled off a huge upset to win olympic gold in women's figure skating yesterday, bumping defending champ and favorite yuna kim of south korea to second place — and the world is not taking it well. American skater ashley wagner, who's definitely not afraid to express her feelings, sums up the problem as most people see it: \" i saw a lot of very nice, decent landings [ from kim ], \" she said, whereas sotnikova botched a landing, nbc news reports. \" people don't want to watch a sport where you watch people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean, \" wagner continues. Part of the problem: as nbc puts it, figure skating's scoring system \" is harder to understand than the theory of relativity, \" and anonymous judging doesn't help. Others expressed similar confusion, wondering how sotnikova managed to win by such a large margin — and, in particular, why she was so far ahead of bronze medalist carolina kostner of italy despite the fact that both attempted seven triple jumps. \" i am stunned by this result, i don't understand the scoring, \" said former olympic champion katarina witt on german tv. \" you have to think being in russia in front of a russian audience has definitely helped, \" noted johnny weir on nbc ( indeed, some are implying the whole thing was fixed, although the ioc insists there's no problem ). The new york times notes that all the confusion over scoring — even among fellow skaters — explains why the sport is \" popular among mainstream fans only every four years. \" if you're outraged, join the more than 1.5 million people who've signed a petition asking for an investigation to be opened.

The us fish and wildlife service has confirmed the existence of the new egg at the refuge, where wisdom and her mate, akeakamai, have headed to once a year for the past 12 years to mate, per smithsonian.com. An id band was first placed on wisdom in 1956 by birder chandler robbins, who himself died just last year at the age of 98. That band has made it possible for researchers to keep tabs on wisdom over the decades, offering invaluable insight into the albatross's habits in the wild. What makes wisdom somewhat \" exceptional \" even among her own kind is that most albatrosses, which can only lay one egg a year, don't typically do so annually, as the process of taking care of it is a grueling one. Wisdom, however, \" has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break, \" a fish and wildlife service biologist says. Also noteworthy: wisdom was able to create this egg with the help of her \" longtime lover \" akeakamai, and the guardian dives further into just how seriously albatrosses take their romantic relationships, engaging in yearly courting rituals to keep the fires burning.

More than three million birds, 1.2 million of which are albatross, come to the atoll every year to breed. \"every square foot of land, and much of the ground underfoot is occupied by a nesting bird, \" beth flint, a biologist with the u. S. Fish and wildlife service, said in a blog post. \"it's like another world. \" the usfws has confirmed that wisdom and her mate, akeakamai, are looking after a new egg, taking turns between tending to the nest and searching for food. As is typical for the species, the couple has laid just one egg, and if all goes well, they will care for the hatchling for around five and a half months before it sets off on its own. Wisdom and akeakamai have been returning to midway every year since 2006 to breed, which is somewhat unusual; according",
            "In sea mariner lore, an albatross is considered a good omen, and for almost seven decades, one bird has spread generations of blessings across the pacific ocean. Wisdom, a 68-year-old laysan albatross believed to be the world's oldest known wild bird, has returned to her home at the midway atoll national wildlife refuge for yet another winter – and laid yet another egg to add to the already impressive brood that she has built up over an impressive lifetime. Biologists with the us fish and wildlife service think the almost-septuagenarian has birthed and raised as many as 36 chicks over the years. Should her latest egg with her longtime lover, akeakamai, hatch, fledge and take to the open sea, it will be her 37th. Trump administration plans to weaken protections for sage grouse read more wisdom was first banded in 1956 by biologist chandler robbins, who estimated that she was about five years old at the time. The biologist and bird met again in 2002 when he went to band her and recognized that she had been one of the 8,400 birds he recorded during his first season, 46 years previously. Albatrosses are known for their long life spans and often outlive their researchers – robbins died in 2017 at the age 98 – but what makes wisdom unique is that researchers have been able to monitor her habits for so"

According to the 78-year-old's defense team, when cosby was first accused of drugging and assaulting andrea constand in 2004, he made an immunity deal with then-district attorney bruce l. Castor jr. In 2005, the ap reports. Per cosby's defense team, castor told cosby he wouldn't be prosecuted for the alleged assault and thus could testify freely in the civil lawsuit brought by constand. Castor said at the time that he didn't have enough evidence to charge cosby. But the current district attorney, kevin steele, says he has no evidence of an immunity agreement in writing, which, he says, is what cosby needs to get the case thrown out. Castor was called to the stand tuesday and said that while he did decide not to prosecute cosby, there was no \" agreement. \" while testifying in constand's civil suit, cosby admitted to obtaining quaaludes for the purpose of having sex with women and to giving constand three pills, but he insisted any sexual contact was consensual. That testimony was released last summer, prompting steele to charge cosby. Castor has said in the past he did work out an oral \" non-prosecution \" deal with one of cosby's lawyers. But on the stand tuesday, he said he simply wanted cosby to testify in the lawsuit so constand could perhaps win \" some measure of justice \" via monetary damages, and that's why he told cosby's lawyer the comedian wouldn't be prosecuted. He also reiterated his original reasons for not charging cosby: constand waited a year to report her accusations, meaning her hair and fingernails could not be tested for evidence she was drugged; there were inconsistencies in her statements; and she talked to a lawyer before talking to police. ( another lawsuit against cosby was just dropped without explanation. )",

Oregon state university has canceled its sponsor relationship with papa john's over what it calls \" derogatory and insensitive \" comments from schnatter, and the university of louisville has dropped papa john's name from its football stadium and is now calling it \" cardinal stadium. \" schnatter has been removed from all the company's promotional material but since he is still its largest shareholder, he can't be removed from the six-person board easily — and probably not before its annual meeting. Sources tell bloomberg that schnatter now regrets his resignation as chairman and thinks the company was wrong to oust him without an investigation.",

        "summary": "A doctor accused of murdering his partner and their 2-year-old son in 2011 will go on trial in april next year — and he may blame cough syrup for the grisly killings. Louis chen's defense team in october filed papers signaling that they will argue that the 43-year-old was suffering from psychosis caused by a buildup of the drug dextromethorphan in his system, reports the seattle times. The defense declaration suggests chen's taiwanese genetic makeup made it harder for him to metabolize dextromethorphan, found in many over-the-counter cough medications. Police have suggested chen killed partner eric cooper because of an impending breakup and custody battle in which chen's alleged prescription drug abuse may have been exposed, the times reports. When chen didn't show up for his first day at work in a seattle hospital in the summer of 2011, police found him covered in blood at his apartment, along with the bodies of cooper and their son, cooper chen, the seattle post-intelligencer reported at the time. Cooper had been stabbed more than 100 times and the toddler's throat had been cut. Chen, who fathered the boy with a surrogate mother, spent more than a week in the hospital being treated for self-inflicted stab wounds. University of washington law professor mary fan tells the times that she has \" definitely heard of induced psychosis through taking various drugs, \" but not in any cases involving cough syrup, and she predicts the case will hinge on whether chen's \" intoxication \" was voluntary or involuntary. Chen faces life without parole.",

And it's a good thing they did. The piles of discarded oyster shells created by hungry native americans over centuries are an irreplaceable source of information on their cultural practices, as well as the environment and climate of maine millennia ago. \" if you want to know what was in the western gulf of maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you're going to figure that out, \" dr. Alice kelley says. But the new york times reports maine's more than 2,000 shell piles, or middens, are disappearing thanks to climate change and rising oceans. \" they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea, \" says donald soctomah, historic preservation officer for two passamaquoddy tribes. Middens protect native american artifacts from acidic soils because of the calcium carbonate in the shells. Stone tools, ceramics, and bones have been discovered in the shell piles, and artifacts from one midden were found to be more than 5,000 years old. \" the shell middens are a link to the past and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time, \" soctomah says. However, there are so many middens there's no way to study and save them all, the mount desert islander reports. Kelley is securing funding to scan the shell piles with ground-penetrating radar to figure out which are most worthy of study — and which are most endangered by erosion. In a case illustrative of the time pressure kelley and her team is under, they attempted to use radar to scan a midden recorded just 49 years ago only to find it had disappeared into the sea.",

In what they told investigators was an attempt to please the fictional online \" slender man \" character, morgan geyser and anissa weier allegedly stabbed their friend 19 times and left her for dead in waukesha, wisc., last spring. They have been detained since the attack, and the judge's decision today was being closely watched by advocates for reform of the juvenile justice system, reports the milwaukee journal-sentinel. \" there has to be assurance to the public — and to these defendants as well — that a serious offense has to be dealt with on a serious basis that offers protection to everyone, \" he said. The girls have been charged with attempted intentional first-degree homicide, a crime that could get them a 45-year sentence as adults. If they were treated as juveniles, they could be out before they turn 18. Fox 6 reports that mental health experts have testified over the last year that both girls would be better off in the juvenile system. Anissa is now in a juvenile secure detention facility and fox 6 reports that she has done well in school but spent time on suicide watch after bullying. Morgan's case is more complicated, the journal-sentinel notes: she has been diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia, but isn't receiving medication and has told psychiatrists that she still believes in the slender man.",

A pair of customers filed the lawsuit in california, reports consumerist, accusing the company, which was started by a then-single mother of seven children, of eight counts related to unfair, illegal, and fraudulent business practices as well as violating laws intended to shield customers and vendors from these practices. Specifically, the customers claim their new leggings tore or developed holes after the very first wear; the lawsuit claims thousands of customers have complained about the problem on social media and that it's difficult or impossible to get refunds for defective leggings. The company apparently admitted in an email that \" the leggings may get holes, because we weaken the fibers to make them buttery soft. We have done all we can to fix them. \" what's more, the better business bureau has given lularoe an f rating. The lawsuit suggests that thousands of consumers across the us could benefit from the lawsuit if they bought leggings after march 31, 2016. Meanwhile, another lawsuit accuses lularoe — which has grown six-fold in two years with sales reaching $ 1 billion in 2016 — of charging customers the wrong sales tax, reports business insider.

The study is out of germany, and such bedding was common there when the kids were born in the 1990s.

They were also less likely to development ailments such as hay fever. \" previous studies have suggested that microbes found in rural settings can protect from asthma, \" says one of the researchers via eureka alert. \" an animal skin might also be a reservoir for various kinds of microbes, following similar mechanisms as has been observed in rural environments. \" scientists still don't know what causes asthma — it's all about treating symptoms — and results like this can point the way toward future research, says medical news today.

        "summary": "Audi has finally released what germany's other major car manufacturers have — a report detailing how its predecessor company made use of concentration camp labor. The admission comes via a newly released historical study that the company itself called for. It found that 3,700 concentration camp inmates were made to work for auto union at one of seven labor camps specifically built for the carmaker by the nazis and run by the ss; that the company bears \" moral responsibility \" for some 4,500 people interned at flossenbürg concentration camp who died while working at an auto union plant near the camp; and that 16,500 people not held in the camps were forced to work at two of the company's existent factories in the country's east. The findings were born from a review of the archives of the company, which became part of volkswagen group in 1965 and was renamed audi in 1985 following a merger. Though haaretz reports that audi had previously owned up to the fact that it used forced labor, the company expressed shock at the extent of the report's findings and its revelations about company chair richard bruhn, who had \" closet ties \" to nazi leaders, was instrumental in the use of slave labor, and was known as a \" wehrwirtschaftsfuehrer, \" a title that reflected the company's key contribution to the war's supply needs. A rep tells the local that bruhn's company biography will be altered; his name may also be wiped from things like pension plans.

If the cavs hope to repeat, it looks like they ' ll have to go through golden state once again: the warriors just added free agent kevin durant, one of the game's best players, to their roster and thus become the \" heavy favorites \" to win the title next year, reports usa today. Durant, who will be playing alongside superstar steph curry, is expected to sign a two-year deal for $ 54.3 million, reports espn. In a post at the player's tribune, the 27-year-old durant writes that finding a team to help him improve as a player was one factor, \" but i am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. \" durant has played his entire career with the same organization, and his oklahoma city thunder nearly upset golden state in the playoffs this year.

His uncle, chris coates, 35, was visiting from iowa and was lying in a hammock in the oklahoma city backyard, whittling, when bralyn shively came over and started playfully pushing the hammock, the oklahoman reports. The hammock broke free of the tree, dropping coates to the ground. Bralyn somehow fell on top of him — and was stabbed in the chest with the knife coates had been holding. A police sergeant describes the knife as a \" pocket knife \" to kfor-tv, and says the boy was \" impaled. \" coates called for someone to dial 911, but bralyn died at a hospital.

        "summary": "Good news, coffee drinkers: you're less likely to die than those who steer clear of java. A new harvard study finds regular coffee consumption not only boosts longevity but reduces your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and suicide. The study — based on surveys of more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men in the us — notes non-smokers who drink three to five cups of coffee daily are 15 % less likely to die, reports cnn. Those who drink three cups or less have a 6 % to 8 % lower risk of death, while those who drink more than five cups have a 12 % lower risk. The same applies to those who drink decaf, suggesting caffeine isn't responsible for the benefits, per npr. While the lead author notes coffee shouldn't be used \" as a strategy for prevention of the chronic diseases, \" coffee is a good source of antioxidants, which fight dna damage, per nbc news. Also, \" the chlorogenic acid, lignans, quinides, trigonelline, and magnesium in coffee reduce insulin resistance and systematic inflammation, \" the authors add. However, \" people should also be aware of the amount of added sugar to coffee drinks which can become a problem, \" the author notes. Coffee drinkers in general were 10 % less likely to die from heart disease, 9 % to 27 % less likely to die from neurological diseases like parkinson's and dementia, and 20 % to 36 % less likely to die from suicide. Interestingly, those who drank less than a cup of coffee a day had a 36 % higher chance of suicide. \" the main message is that people who enjoy drinking coffee should not worry about it being harmful for their health, \" a researcher says. \" coffee may actually be beneficial to their health. \" ( coffee might also clean your arteries. )",

        "summary": "Is edward snowden looking to decamp from russia to brazil? he strongly implies as much in an open letter today, published at folha. \" i have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, \" he writes, \" but unfortunately the united states government has worked hard to limit my ability to do so. … until a country grants permanent political asylum, the us government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak. \" the rest of the letter is spent decrying nsa activities, which he says is a \" culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance \" that is \" collapsing. \" yesterday, snowden heartily endorsed a scathing ruling from us district judge richard leon that declared the nsa's phone data collection \" almost orwellian \" and likely unconstitutional. Today, the new york times has a profile on leon, depicting him as a conservative firebrand who \" does not seem bound by judicial sobriety. \" he has a long history of criticizing the federal government, most notably in a 2008 case in which he ordered the release of five guantanamo bay detainees, saying they were being held illegally on insufficient evidence. In 2005, however, he sided with the administration in saying the detainees had no right to habeas corpus. Other stories spilling out of the ruling today: as heralded as the ruling has been, it's only the starting gun in a case that will probably wind up at the supreme court, the ap observes. A justice department spokesman says they're not worried about the ultimate outcome of that process. \" we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found, \" he said. Leon's ruling effectively runs against a 1979 supreme court decision saying that americans can't expect privacy about who they're calling, because they're giving that information to the phone company, the wall street journal explains. Leon argued that \" present day circumstances \" had \" become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the supreme court thirty-four years ago \" that the precedent was moot. The case that leon was ruling on is itself somewhat unusual; plaintiff larry klayman, a conservative activist, said the government had sent strange text messages to his clients on his behalf, saying, \" i think they are messing with me. \" he also tried to expand his lawsuit into a class action on behalf of all americans, the new york times reports.",

The plane was carrying 144 passengers and six crew from barcelona to duesseldorf when it crashed after an unexplained eight-minute descent, the ap reports. Germanwings ' ceo says the plane began descending about one minute after it reached its cruising height, 44 minutes into the flight, the guardian reports. Two babies and a party of 16 children and two teachers on a class trip are believed to have been on board, reuters reports. Approximately 45 passengers were spaniards and 67 were germans, according to reports. Germanwings has said the airline received \" contradictory information \" about whether the plane made a distress call, but a rep for france's aviation regulator tells reuters the jetliner did not. Instead, air traffic controllers implemented a distress phase, the most serious of three stages of alerts, due to \" the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent. \" the owner of a camping ground in the alps says he heard odd noises before the plane went down. \" there are often fighter jets flying over, so i thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside but i couldn't see any fighter planes, \" he says. \" the noise i heard was long — like eight seconds — as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane speed. There was another long noise about 30 seconds later. \" the plane was given a routine technical check yesterday and last underwent a major inspection in 2013.",

It hasn't acted since, but the fed signaled last month it would likely do so in the coming months. Meanwhile, consumers appear increasingly confident about the economy, which could stimulate a rebound in spending.

Job growth has averaged 178,000 a month so far this year, down from last year's pace of 229,000. Still, hiring at that level is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Economists have expected the pace to slow as the supply of unemployed workers declines. The hiring figures could keep the federal reserve on track to raise the short-term interest rate it controls by december. After seven years of pinning that rate at a record low near zero to try to spur more borrowing and spending, the fed raised its rate in december. It has not acted since. But the fed signaled after its policy meeting last month that it would likely act in the coming months. The fed will meet in november, just before the election, but analysts expect it to hold off until the campaign ends. Recent"

Known as snow rollers, the delicate formations are as light as meringues and may crumble when touched, but others are icy enough for play. They were a social media phenomenon today ( jan. 27 ), sweeping twitter and facebook as people from ohio, illinois and pennsylvania posted images of their yards dotted with strange snowballs. Snow roller in ohio. Credit: tracey montgomery according to the national weather service, snow rollers need just the right combination of light, sticky snow, strong ( but not too strong ) winds and cold temperatures to form. It's been about 10 years since snow rollers were reported in western pennsylvania, but snow rollers appeared in near spokane, wash., in 2009. Like a snowball spinning downhill in a cartoon, picking up size, snow rollers grow layer by layer as they're rolled along by the wind. Sometimes they do roll downhill, but in this case, wind created the mysterious, hollow snow tubes. Pictures posted online show tracks in the snow left behind as the snow rollers swept across snowy yards and golf courses. Snow roller"

Richard jones was released by a kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence that there is another man who bears an uncanny resemblance to him and that witnesses could not tell the two of them apart, the kansas city star reports. There was never any physical evidence linking jones to the 1999 robbery he was sent to prison for. Jones ' girlfriend and family members backed up his alibi, but he was convicted after witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified him. The victim testified last week that she can no longer be certain jones was the robber. Jones says people in prison told him there was another inmate who looked just like him and had the same first name. No criminal case has been filed yet against the other man, who, unlike jones, lived near the scene of the crime, the bbc reports. Jones was arrested months after the robbery after a witness picked his photo out of around 200 people named richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo line-up in which jones was the only light-skinned person. Jones, who became a grandfather while in prison, was released with the help of the midwest innocence project. Kansas has no law compensating victims of wrongful conviction, but a gofundme page has been set up to support jones'return to society.",

        "summary": "President trump was handed a huge defeat thursday with the 9th circuit court of appeals decision against his travel ban — but he made it clear he plans to keep fighting. \" see you in court, the security of our nation is at stake! \" he tweeted. He later said the ruling was a \" political decision \" and that \" we look forward, as i just said, to seeing them in court, \" the washington post reports. He told reporters that he thought the administration could win an appeal of the ruling \" very easily, \" though he admitted he hadn't discussed it with jeff sessions, the new attorney general, yet. A roundup of coverage: the administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the supreme court, though most analysts predict that the court will split 4-4, meaning the 9th circuit's decision will stand. The new york times predicts that a decision could come as soon as next week. There's also a chance that the administration could ask the whole 9th circuit court to rule on the executive order, instead of the three-judge panel that issued thursday's decision. The hill lists five key quotes from what it calls a decision that \" ripped apart \" trump's executive order. Among them: \" rather than present evidence to explain the need for the executive order, the government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree. \" some democrats hope trump will just withdraw the order, though republicans, including arkansas sen. Tom cotton, predicted that the decision would be reversed by the supreme court, reports the new york times. \" this misguided ruling is from the 9th circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in america, and the most-reversed court at the supreme court, \" cotton said. \" i ' m confident the administration's position will ultimately prevail. \" politico lists three mistakes that contributed to the court loss, including the failure to make it clear from the start that green card holders would be exempt — a blunder that made it inevitable that the order would face stiff court challenges from us residents very early on. Cnn looks at the implications of the defeat for the trump administration, noting that trump has now run into the limits of executive power and predicting that the saga will continue indefinitely.

            "Some common pain relievers may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, according to a new study from denmark. In the study, researchers found a link between the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) — including ibuprofen — and an increased risk of cardiac arrest, which is when the heart suddenly stops beating. The findings add to those of previous research, which has also found a link between nsaid use and a higher risk of heart problems, including heart attack, stroke and heart failure. The new study is the first to look specifically at the impact of nsaids on cardiac-arrest risk. \" the findings are a stark reminder that nsaids are not harmless, \" study author dr. Gunnar gislason, a professor of cardiology at copenhagen university hospital gentofte, said in a statement. People should be aware of the link, so that they can balance the benefits of taking one of these drugs against the risks, the researchers said. \" nsaids should be used with caution and for a valid indication, \" gislason said. The researchers recommended that people not take more than 1,200 milligrams of ibuprofen ( or six 200-mg tablets ) per day. [ top 10 amazing facts about your heart ] the u.s.
