        "summary": "We may very well be at zero hour: john boehner has privately told republicans that in order to get a debt ceiling measure signed by president obama by the aug. 2 deadline, it must be introduced in the house today. But despite the increasing likeliness of a us default, politico reports that hope for a bipartisan deal has disintegrated. After meeting with the president and nancy pelosi last night, harry reid accused boehner of taking a \" my-way-or-the-highway approach, \" and reiterated the fact that his two-part plan — or any short-term plan — is \" a non-starter in the senate and with the president. \" politico also notes that obama, after three weeks of being highly visible, was on the sidelines during this weekend's developments, a potentially risky move this late in the game. Republicans, however, say reid had been working with them right up until the change-of-heart-inducing white house meeting: \"sen. Reid took the bipartisan plan to the white house and the president said no, \" says one republican aide. Another adds that while boehner has the 218 house votes he needs for his proposal, reid and obama don't have the 60 they need in the senate for any alternative. At this point, the new york times reports, boehner and reid are preparing dueling back-up plans; reid's would include $ 2.7 trillion in spending cuts, no new taxes, and the full $ 2.4 trillion debt limit extension, as opposed to boehner's two-stage extension plan. Bloomberg notes that even if default is avoided, the us could lose its aaa rating.",

Originally written in the punjabi language, it is translated as: \" a sikh is any woman or man whose faith consists of belief in: one god, the ten gurus, from guru nanak to guru gobind singh, the guru granth sahib, the utterances and teachings of the ten gurus, who has faith in and aspires to take amrit, initiation ceremony into the khalsa, and who does not owe allegiance to any other religion. \" as with most religions, a devotee cannot be confined to a definition. There are many women and men who perceive themselves as sikhs yet do not meet the above definition. How many sikhs live in the united states? when did sikhs first immigrate to america? there are over 500,000 sikh americans, and sikhs have been in america for over 100 years. Why don't people know about sikhism since it is the 5th largest world religion? there are several different reasons. First, sikhism, compared to other world traditions, is relatively young. The faith first emerged in 1469. Second, since many people are not aware that sikhism is the fifth largest world religion, it is not referenced when discussing the other world religions.",

The wreck of the whydah gally was found off wellfleet, mass., in 1984 by barry clifford, whose whydah pirate museum now features coins, weapons, and other items pulled from the wreckage, with the boston globe reporting the ship also had four tons of silver and gold aboard. It notes a 2008 report from forbes that weighed in on just how successful bellamy was on the financial front: it estimated he had pilfered the equivalent of $ 120 million as a pirate. The museum earlier this month announced that archaeologists in 2017 located remains in a huge concretion ( that is, a hardened mass of sand and stone ) pulled from the wreck near what they suspect is bellamy's pistol, reports the ap.

In 1984, treasure hunters found his ship and in 2018 archaeologists believed they found his remains. Black sam bellamy ran his pirate operation democratically.

Keller believes in the former, saying it can produce \" more substantial and more credible \" reporting. \" i believe that in most cases it gets you closer to the truth, because it imposes a discipline of testing all assumptions. \" greenwald, in contrast, believes it \" drains journalism of its passion, vibrancy, vitality, and soul, \" and that it's less honest, given that all journalists have biases anyway. \" a journalist who is petrified of appearing to express any opinions will often steer clear of declarative sentences about what is true, opting instead for a cowardly and unhelpful ' here's-what-both-sides-say-and-i-won't-resolve-the-conflicts ' formulation. \" greenwald also bashes the times for a number of specific sins: \" it isn't wikileaks that prints incredibly incendiary accusations about american whistleblowers without a shred of evidence. And it wasn't wikileaks that allowed the american people to re-elect george bush while knowing, but concealing, that he was eavesdropping on them. \" he also complains about the times'refusal to use the word \" torture \" when referring to cia interrogations, and one reporter's undisclosed support for the iraq war.

Greenwald bashed brooks as an \" east coast rendition \" of a conservative.

Six days later, another march is taking place in dc, and the new york times notes this event may be tinged with \" a new sense of urgency, anxiety, and maybe a little envy. \" the 44th anti-abortion march for life is set for friday, and one organizer says they're \" pulling out all the stops \" to boost attendance, which last year was marred by a snowstorm. What organizers hope will draw crowds: speeches by vp mike pence and kellyanne conway, excitement over a possible new supreme court justice who could overturn roe v. Wade, and \" pent-up energy \" from those who canceled last year due to the inclement weather. The march is scheduled to start shortly before noon with a rally close to the washington monument before participants head over to the supreme court, abc news reports. Pence, who's lobbied over the years to defund planned parenthood, is said to be the highest-ranking white house official to ever speak in person at the event, per usa today; speeches by reagan and george w. Bush at previous marches were piped in. In the end, though, march for life president jeanne mancini says there's a number more important than how many show up for friday's march: 58 million, \" the number of americans [ who ] have been lost to abortion, \" she tells the times.

The official estimate is that between 64 and 116 civilians have been killed in such strikes since 2009, reports usa today. Some of those asterisks: that range is much lower than estimates by independent groups — their figures go from about 200 to more than 1,000 — and the white house doesn't specify when or where the fatalities occurred except to say they were in non-war zones. That means strikes in afghanistan, iraq, and syria were not counted, but those in countries such as pakistan, yemen, somalia, and libya were, reports the washington post. The us also says that it killed about 2,500 enemy militants in those same non-combat zones. As part of the release — most coverage notes that the white house did this on a friday before a holiday weekend — president obama made a significant policy change: he issued an executive order requiring that future presidents make this information public in an annual list, notes the new york times. \" this is a remarkable shift, even if you're skeptical of numbers this reports, \" writes naureen shah at the guardian. But shah also sees a downside: \" the drone data could be completely misleading — and provide a veneer of legitimacy to unlawful killings. \" the reaction from human rights watch: \"unless details are provided on specific incidents, it's not possible to determine if individuals killed were civilians, and thus whether the us is complying with its own policy and with international law. \"",

All nine victims were americans — eight us troops and one contractor — who were training members of afghanistan's fledgling air force. The shooter, an afghan pilot, got into an argument with the trainers, left the room, then re-entered and forced the americans to remove their weapons, reports abc news. When they were disarmed, he shot them with a us-provided semi-automatic. He then apparently fatally shot himself. The taliban immediately claimed responsibility and said it was yet another infiltrator attack. But that looks unlikely, notes ap, which talked to the pilot's brother. \" he was under economic pressures and recently he sold his house. He was not in a normal frame of mind because of these pressures, \" said the brother. \" he loved his people and his country. He had no link with taliban or al-qaeda. \"",

Highlights from the interview ( which politico notes was posted at 4: 20pm yesterday ), or you can watch in the gallery: on climate change: the president mentions goals such as doubling fuel-efficiency standards, upping clean-energy production, and making appliances more efficient. \" if i ' m able to do all those things now, when i ' m done, we're still going to have a heck of a problem, \" he says. \" but we will have made enough progress that the next president and the next generations can start building on it. \" and to snowball-hurling detractors like sen. Jim inhofe? \" that's disturbing, \" obama says. \" i guarantee you that the republican party will have to change its approach to climate change, because voters will insist upon it. \" on an iran nuclear deal: how does the president feel about the 47 senators who sent their own letter to iran? \" i ' m embarrassed for them, \" he says. \" i think it's entirely legitimate for my friends in the senate who signed that letter to ask very hard questions. … [ but ] this is a good example, i think, of where the state of our politics … leads republicans to be more worried about a tea party primary than they are about what ordinary folks are thinking. It damages the country, it damages our standing, it's not productive. \" on pot: according to smith, the \" no. 1 question from everyone on the internet \": how does the president feel about marijuana legalization? while obama discusses what he thinks is a currently \" skewed \" criminal justice system with too-long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenders, costly state incarceration programs, and the \" terrible effect on many communities, \" pot shouldn't be generation y's first priority: \" young people, i understand this is important to you, but you know, you should be thinking about climate change, the economy, jobs, war and peace. Maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana. \" ( sadly, the president didn't cap the interview by reading mean tweets about himself. )",

They've been together 17 years, and the story has plenty of quotes from insiders who say they are much happier than headlines suggest.

' awkward '? speaking of that negative press, a headline at newsweek wonders if the trumps are \" the most awkward couple in politics, \" running through examples going back to the inauguration.

Trump is gradually becoming a more assertive and visible figure on the political stage — one enigmatic gesture at a time, \" writes courtney weaver.

The dayton daily news notes that the deaths are consistent with a pattern of overdoses in which people combine opioids such as fentanyl and its derivatives with cocaine or other drugs. Carfentanil is particularly potent: 100 times more powerful than fentanyl and 1,000 times more powerful than morphine. Last month, the medical examiner in ohio's cuyahoga county told a senate subcommittee that he believed drug dealers were secretly lacing cocaine with fentanyl to increase addiction in the black community, per the cleveland plain dealer. It's not clear when brian halye had his last drug test as a pilot. ( these 10 states have the biggest drug problems. )",

            "Washington - drug dealers may be mixing cocaine with fentanyl to increase the prevalence of opioid addiction in the black community, cuyahoga county medical examiner dr. Thomas gilson told a u.s. Senate subcommittee thursday. In recent years, fentanyl was largely linked to deaths involving white people in suburban communities. However, data released wednesday shows that within the past year, the drug has made inroads within the black community. Fentanyl contributed to the deaths of 58 black people last year in cuyahoga county, up from 25 in 2015. Just five black people died from fentanyl use in 2014, statistics show. The rise is likely due to the fact that drug dealers are mixing fentanyl with cocaine, gilson said. The mixture could result in a high number of black persons becoming addicted to opioids and using heroin and fentanyl, he said. \" cocaine had been the only drug that victims were predominately african american",

Now meek, 21, is the \" potential target \" of a federal criminal investigation into the june mass shooting at a charleston church of which roof is accused. Meek tells the state that he broke down when fbi agents notified him last month that he's being investigated for allegedly lying to authorities and hiding knowledge of a crime from authorities. Meek says the only thing he may have done wrong was trust roof too much; during his time at meek's south carolina mobile home, roof would sometimes make comments about wanting to start a race war, but meek says neither he nor anyone else living at the trailer — meek's two brothers and his girlfriend lindsey fry — took him seriously. Roof only talked like that while drunk, meek and fry say; he also did drugs including cocaine — possibly every day — leading the pair to believe they needn't be concerned about anything he said. \" there are a lot of people talking violent things, like rappers, and no one takes them seriously, \" meek says. He and fry also note that roof had black friends that they never knew him to mistreat, and once appeared infatuated with a black stripper at a club. It's been known since july that authorities were investigating associates and friends of roof, but no names had been released until now.

Then he trapped general keith alexander, the recently retired head of the national security agency, on camera, and made him sit through a series of nsa rebranding suggestions that included a kitten called mr tiggles and, simply, \"the washington redskins \". The host gleefully turned the screws on the spy. The general soldiered on. The live studio audience, watching the segment on tape, roared and applauded.

Oliver has been with the daily show since 2006; he's one of the longest-serving correspondents, behind stephen colbert and the eternal bee/jones double act.

Public health investigators used dna \"fingerprints \" of salmonella bacteria to identify ill persons who were part of this outbreak.

The outbreak strain of salmonella heidelberg was resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics.

Doctors fixed that with a womb transplant earlier this year, leading to last month's medical milestone, reports ap. The unidentified 36-year-old becomes the first woman to give birth with a transplanted womb. The baby is doing \" fantastic, \" says lead researcher mats brannstrom of the university of gothenburg and stockholm. His team will soon provide more details in the medical journal lancet. It's \" still sinking in that we have actually done it. \". The woman received her uterus from her own mother, reports the telegraph, which spells out another related milestone: the baby is \" the first born to a woman using the same womb from which she emerged herself. \" the swedish team actually transplanted wombs into nine women, though two of the procedures eventually failed. But the other seven women are doing fine, and two of them are currently pregnant. \" it was a pretty tough journey over the years, but we now have the most amazing baby, \" says the proud new father in sweden.",

            "London ( ap ) — in a medical first, a woman in sweden has given birth after receiving a womb transplant, the doctor who performed the pioneering procedure said friday. The 36-year-old mother received a uterus from a close family friend last year. Her baby boy was born prematurely but healthy last month, and mother and child are now at home and well. The identities of the woman and her male partner were not disclosed. \" the baby is fantastic, \" said dr. Mats brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of gothenburg and stockholm ivf who led the research and delivered the baby with the help of his wife, a midwife. \" but it is even better to see the joy in the parents and how happy he made them. \" brannstrom said it was \" still sinking in that we have actually done it. \" the feat opens up a new but still experimental alternative for some of the thousands of women each year who are unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. Before this case proved the concept can work, some experts had questioned whether a transplanted womb would be able to nourish a fetus. For the proud parents, the years of research and experimentation were well worth the wait. \" it was a pretty tough journey over the years, but we now have the most amazing baby, \" the father said in a telephone interview. \" he is very, very cute, and he doesn't even scream, he just murmurs. \" he said he and his wife, both competitive athletes, were convinced the procedure would work, despite its experimental nature. Brannstrom and colleagues transplanted wombs into nine women over the last two years as part of a study, but complications forced removal of two of the organs. Earlier this year, brannstrom began transferring embryos into the seven other women. He said there are two other pregnancies at least 25 weeks along. Before these cases, there had been two attempts to transplant a womb — in saudi arabia and turkey — but no live births resulted. Doctors in britain, france, japan, turkey and elsewhere are planning to try similar operations, but using wombs from women who have just died rather than live donors. The swedish woman had healthy ovaries, but she was born without a uterus — a syndrome seen in one girl in 4,500. She received a uterus from a 61-year-old family friend who had gone through menopause after giving birth"

        "summary": "For seven seconds, the footage shows an american president walking to a white house railing to wave at a crowd. But \" when i saw [ it ]... I gasped, \" says paul sparrow, director of the franklin d. Roosevelt presidential library and museum, which has acquired the silent film of the 32nd president at the 1935 white house easter egg roll. It's so remarkable because fdr, disabled by polio in 1921, wasn't keen on walking, which for him often required braces. Only a handful of short, blurry films show him doing so, per history. Indeed, cameramen were told not to record his stiff gait for fear it would make clear his disability, per the washington post. Apparently unaware of such a rule, new york tourist fred hill aimed his camera at roosevelt as he walked with help from a cane and bodyguard, his wife and two nieces at his side. Secret service agents surely would've taken the film had they spotted hill's camera amid the crowd of 50,000, says roosevelt biographer geoffrey c. Ward. \" it's by far the clearest image i've ever seen of something that's obsessed me for 20 years, \" he adds, pointing to the careful \" choreography \" of bodyguard gus gennerich, who helps fdr to a railing, vanishes behind a pillar, and reemerges just as the president is ready to leave, per the post. The footage stayed with hill as he relocated to reno, nev., continuing to make home movies, and was discovered by his grandson in the 1980s. \" i've kind of jealously guarded this stuff \" but it \" needs to go where it belongs, \" says richard hill, 66, who made the december donation announced wednesday. \" it's an important part of history that almost got away. \" ( this fdr footage is rare for another reason. )",

The court's 4-1 decision found that banning marijuana violated the constitutional right \" to the free development of personality \" of the four plaintiffs from a group called the mexican society for responsible and tolerant consumption, the guardian reports. The four, including prominent businessman armando santacruz, will now be allowed to grow marijuana and smoke it, reports the bbc. For pot to become legal for all mexicans, the court will have to rule the same way in five similar cases, the guardian notes. Pot smoking isn't as widespread in mexico as it is in the us, and the government is firmly opposed to legalization, but advocates say it makes little sense for mexicans to be locked up or killed in cartel violence over a substance that's gradually being legalized north of the border, reports the new york times. \" we are killing ourselves to stop the production of something that is heading to the us, where it's legal, \" santacruz tells the times, adding that bad regulation \" is better than whatever regulation el chapo and the narcos can provide. \" ( on tuesday, ohio voters rejected a legalization measure that would have established a \" marijuana monopoly. \" )",

Parents have figured out that there's a better way than spanking — and now it's time for yelling to experience that same reckoning. Most parents today yell at their kids, and in the new york times, stephen marche calls the practice \" the most widespread parental stupidity around today. \" studies have found that shouting at kids can lead to increases in anxiety, stress, depression, and behavioral problems and decreases in self-esteem. It makes parents look out of control and weak, and all it accomplishes is teaching kids to yell themselves. \" yelling, even more than spanking, is the response of a person who doesn't know what else to do, \" marche writes — before explaining what else you can do. He highlights the abcs of parenting, a process that does require advance planning: a: antecedents. Instead of yelling at your children every time they leave their shoes strewn around the room, clearly explain to them what you want them to do — before you want them to do it. In this case, talk to them in the morning about putting their shoes away when they come home from school. B: behaviors. Define, shape, and model the behavior you want. Put your own shoes away, and help your kids understand what to do. C: consequences. When your child puts his or her shoes away, or even gets them closer to where they're supposed to go, go over-the-top with praise, both verbal and nonverbal ( touching ). \" the beauty of having a system is that instead of reacting after your kids do something bad, instead of waiting for them to mess up and then getting angry, you have a conscious plan, \" writes marche.

The lessons provide step-by-step instructions and demonstrations to improve your course of action with both children and adolescents. Among many techniques, you will learn how even simple modifications to tone of voice and phrasing can lead to more compliance. The key to the course and learning the techniques is practice. It is not enough to know the strategies; you have to do them to reap the rewards. Using the techniques on a temporary basis can lead to permanent change. Apart from the techniques, the course will also shed light on many parenting misconceptions and ineffective strategies that are routinely used.

Conservation groups including the world wildlife federation praised the move as a historic step towards protecting elephants, which poachers have been slaughtering in huge numbers to supply the chinese market. A 18-country \" great elephant census \" released this year found that a third of africa's elephants were wiped out between 2007 and 2014, with the population continuing to drop 8 % a year. Around 70 % of poached ivory is believed to end up in china. \" ivory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets, \" said aili kang of the wildlife conservation society. Elly pepper of the natural resources defense council described the move as \" critical to saving the species. \" beijing says commercial processing and sale of ivory will be halted by march 31 and trading will be phased out entirely over the following months. The new york times reports that negotiations between china and the us may have speeded up the introduction of the ban. After xi jinping visited washington in 2015, the white house released a statement saying both nations had agreed to \" take significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory. \" ( poaching has caused more elephants to be born tuskless. )",

        "summary": "It's hard to imagine facebook without the face of mark zuckerberg at its helm, but that's exactly what the site's board of directors is anticipating in its latest proposal to the sec. Per reuters, the board submitted a proxy filing thursday, notifying the federal agency that it intends to call for a shareholder vote on converting the ceo's current class b shares ( about 419 million of them ) into class a shares ( 4 million ), so that if and when he bade a facebook farewell from any executive position, he won't retain majority voting control. All of his shares together equal about 54 % of the company's voting power, but he also holds proxy over shares owned by co-founder dustin moskovitz, effectively giving him 60 % control, reports cnnmoney. \" these new terms thus ensure that we will not remain a founder-controlled company after we cease to be a founder-led company, \" the filing says. Investopedia explains: although class a shares are often thought to hold more voting power, this isn't always true, and in facebook's case, the latter appears to be what's going on. If zuckerberg were to resign or be fired for cause, his class b shares would morph into class a versions, which would allot him just one vote ( instead of 10 ) per share, cnn notes. What would remain unaffected if his shares are converted is zuckerberg's economic stake in the company — currently 14.8 %, per cnet. Facebook's reasoning for loosening zuckerberg's grip: the company says the power he holds may scare away interested ceo candidates. It also hopes to convince him to remain with facebook for the long haul and not jump to a competitor. The vote will reportedly take place on june 20.

Researchers found that animals of all kinds use the same essential mechanics to move whether on land, air, or water, reports the houston chronicle, which likens it to a \" magic formula. \" in other words, \" the fin of a fish moves just like the wing of a bird, \" explains texas a&m's tamu times. And it's no accident: \" the best reason we can think that these similarities are there in nature is that they are the most energy efficient, \" says an a&m researcher. The team looked at everything from insects to birds to whales to fish to molluscs, and found that the secret is in their flexible wings, fins, and tails. It's all about the bend, which always falls into a range of 30 % to 60 %. It's not that they can't bend further, it's that it doesn't make aerodynamic sense. Compared with how we get around on our man-made contraptions, animals show \" a potentially perfect universal design, \" the chronicle notes — and scientists hope they can steal some wisdom to help technology catch up. Maybe someday, then, fixed-wing aircraft will be replaced by planes with bendable wings. ( elsewhere in the animal kingdom, researchers found that your dog really does know when you're happy. )",

Another coincidence: abdeslam's slain brother, ibrahim, a suicide bomber at the paris cafe, was finally being buried thursday. Cops tapped the phones of 20 of the brothers ' friends who collected ibrahim abdeslam's body, which apparently gave them intel to set up friday's successful raid in mollenbeek. \" this is a really, really good thing, that he was captured alive, \" says mollenbeek's deputy mayor.

The human rights arm of the united nations says that forces supporting the syrian regime have been entering homes in eastern aleppo and murdering residents, with one report coming in that 82 civilians ( 11 said to be women, 13 children ) have been shot in four separate areas of the city, per the bbc. \" we're filled with the deepest foreboding for those who remain in this last hellish corner, \" says a un spokesman, who conceded that confirmation of the reports was impossible at the moment. Another humanitarian rep from the un is calling it a \" complete meltdown of humanity. \" from elsewhere on the internet: the new york times reports rebels hold just a \" sliver of territory, \" per reps for the syrian government and opposition forces. The paper notes it's \" increasingly likely \" that assad's regime could regain control of the city \" within days, if not hours. \" the un and the red cross are making desperate pleas to spare the people of aleppo, the bbc reports, with the international committee of the red cross noting residents have \" literally nowhere safe to run. \" un secretary general ban ki-moon is said to be \" alarmed over reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, \" and the icrc said further tragedy could only be avoided if the basic rules of war were adhered to. An opinion piece in the independent examines why the rebels are losing ( they can partly blame turkey, qatar, and saudi arabia ) and whether assad will have truly won the war if he gets eastern aleppo back under his command. Vice news has compiled social media postings from people trapped in aleppo now saying their final goodbyes to the world. One photographer there wrote, \" i am waiting to die or be captured by the assad regime … pray for me and always remember us, \" while the mom of bana alabed, the 7-year-old girl who's been made famous by her tweets out of the war-torn city, posted on her daughter's twitter account, \" final message — i am very sad no one is helping us in this world, no one is evacuating me &amp; my daughter.

That number has swelled by 130,000 in the last four days, according to turkey's deputy pm. It's not just the sheer number of refugees that's noteworthy: they're mainly kurds, and as the bbc reports, many are \" deeply hostile \" to turkey. And since thursday, they've been pouring into the country in an attempt to flee isis militants who have, as the ap puts it, \" pushed the conflict nearly within eyeshot of the turkish border. \" the current conflict centers around the town of kobani, which isis attempted to take in july, reports reuters. That attempt was quelled with the help of kurds who entered syria from turkey, and there were skirmishes on the turkish side of the border yesterday as the country tried to prevent kurds from flowing into syria once again. As bbc correspondent mark lowen explains, there's a fear that the kurdistan workers ' party, which for decades battled for autonomy for kurds inside turkey, could team up with a beefed-up syrian kurdish militia and once again take up arms within turkey. For now, the syrian kurdish fighters are said to have halted an isis advance on kobani from the east, according to a rep for the kurdish group, who says that's the front where the most intense fighting is taking place.",

A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains discovery news. It dredges up 2009 findings by british archaeologist simon james, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the roman-controlled city of dura-europos around ad 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading sasanian persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But james offered proof that the romans were actually gassed: a jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National geographic shares james ' explanation: \" i think the sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the roman tunnel. \" death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck alexander's army in 327 bc. But a stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

According to university of leicester archaeologist simon james, who published his findings back in 2009, poison gas was used in syria more than 1,700 years ago when a roman fort at dura-europos became the site of a violent siege by the powerful sasanian persian empire.

Trying to enter the city, the sasanians dug tunnels underneath its walls. Intending to hold their ground at all costs, roman defenders responded with counter-mines.

In one of the tunnels, a pile of bodies, still completely fitted with their weapons and armour, testified to the horrors of the battle.

The panthers, held to 28 yards in the first quarter, retaliated with a 5-yard td run by jonathan stewart early in the second quarter. But the broncos ' jordan norwood soon slashed across the field for a 61-yard punt return, the longest in super bowl history. Stymied in the red zone, denver settled for a mcmanus 34-yard field goal. The teams traded field goals in the second half before denver again stripped newton of the ball, forcing a fumble that led to a 2-yard cj anderson rushing touchdown.

A profile of the first lady at vanity fair quotes two insiders who say that melania gave donald trump an ultimatum of sorts: either run for the presidency or stop brooding about it. \" she was very clearly the one who said, ' either run or don't run, ' \" says roger stone, who paraphrases melania's message to her husband: \" your friends are tired of this striptease. Every four years you talk about it. ' \" and with that quasi-encouragement, trump ran, but melania wasn't counting on a victory. \" she didn't want this come hell or high water, \" says another source, described as a longtime friend of the trumps. \" i don't think she thought it was going to happen. \" ( in a statement to cnn, the first lady's spokeswoman says melania is \" honored \" by her role and that the story is filled with \" false assertions. \" ) the profile goes on to recount her unusual approach to her new role as first lady, including a relatively sparse staff and her decision to remain in new york with son barron for the first five months of her husband's presidency. But the latter dovetails with what seems to be melania's no. 1 priority: shielding the 11-year-old ( who speaks her native slovenian ) from the media glare. The story provides a mixed view on the relationship between melania and donald, with one of her friends saying it is \" old news \" that they lead largely separate lives. A longtime friend of the president, however, has a warmer picture. \" the one who has the most control over donald is melania, 100 percent, \" says thomas barrack jr. \" and he listens to her and adores her. \" ( click for the full profile. )",

Those lies became all too clear with tmz sports ' friday release of surveillance video that captures the incident and shows hunt shoving and kicking a woman in a hallway in his cleveland hotel apartment, the metropolitan at the 9. In light of the video's release, the team announced it was \" releasing kareem immediately. \" the kansas city star reports police did respond to the feb. 10 incident and two police reports resulted. No charges were filed, and the paper describes the footage as being \" not available \" until tmz obtained it. Both the team and the nfl said they hadn't seen it. More: the star reports one police report named the 19-year-old woman as the suspect; the other named hunt. Citing a police report, usa today reports the female said she and a female friend had met hunt that day, partied with him and his friends, and returned to his apartment. She said she got thrown out because she \" didn't want \" one of the men; a friend of hunt's says the two women were booted when their ages surfaced. The woman allegedly used racial slurs, knocked repeatedly on the door, and sat outside the apartment. Hunt and a friend then tell her and her friend to leave. The video shows the two talking before hunt shoves her. She hits him in the face and he tries to charge toward her as others restrain him; he kicks her toward the end of the video as she's squatting on the ground. Hunt said in a statement, \" i want to apologize for my actions. I deeply regret what i did. I hope to move on from this. \" as far as moving on goes, the washington post notes that prior to the chiefs releasing hunt the nfl put him on paid administrative leave via the commissioner's exempt list. That means even if another nfl team were to scoop him up, he's not currently eligible to play. The nfl launched an investigation in february and will now include a review of the video, which a source tells the post the nfl repeatedly tried to obtain. The hotel reportedly said its policy restricted it to only giving it to law enforcement. Espn reports the league did reach out to the cleveland police department, but it would not share the video.

His career moved him to paris and eventually the us in 1963. By the 1970s, de la renta and his first wife, françoise de langlade, were \" the social lions of new york, \" andré leon talley writes in vogue. The times notes that the couple were central to the rise of designers as the social elite. But de la renta didn't see his work as particularly \" heavy. Somebody might ask, ' what is oscar de la renta? ' and you could say, ' it's a pretty dress. ' \"",

Over five decades he made fashion that was elegant, based on the tools of the trade that he learned in spain at balenciaga, and in paris, at lanvin under antonio castillo. I also considered him one of my close, best friends. He truly cared about my well-being, regardless of whether or not it was my weight-loss battle, or was i lonely, and would i come dine with him and annette at home in new york. I spent thanksgiving with him, about eight or nine years ago, just the three of us and his son moises in kent, connecticut. Family was of the utmost importance to him. The wedding he and his wife created for stepdaughter eliza bolen's nuptials, was one of the most beautiful and original country weddings i ever attended. And the social world was there in full force. Oscar was king of the historical social anecdote, no matter if it was about the marquis de cuevas's famous costume ball, or marie-hélène de rothschild's dinners. He lived through his youth, following the great bullfighters of spain, when he worked in madrid, he honed his design dna in paris and with his great success in new york, he always gave back, philanthropically.",

Now it takes 12.5 years, \" a sort of incremental change, but in the big picture that is a rapid change, \" says one of the lead researchers from the university of oxford. As the bbc explains, scientists see it as a natural evolution: eventually, hiv runs into people with natural immunity and has to adapt to survive, and this \" watered down \" version begins to spread. \" in theory, if we were to let hiv run its course then we would see a human population emerge that was more resistant to the virus than we collectively are today, \" says a virologist at the university of nottingham. \" hiv infection would eventually become almost harmless, \" though he cautions that he's talking about \" very large timescales. \" in its coverage, reuters notes an hiv milestone: for the first time, the number of new annual infections is lower than the number of new hiv-positive people getting treatment, \" meaning a crucial tipping point has been reached in reducing deaths from aids. \"",

Wil roebroeks at the netherlands ' leiden university was one of two researchers who dug through archaeological records looking for research to support the idea of a dimwitted demise, but instead found \" there is no archaeology to back them up. \" adds dr. Paola villa of the university of colorado museum of natural history, \" the evidence for cognitive inferiority is simply not there. \" in terms of being able to communicate and work as a team, they point to a sinkhole in france where neanderthals are believed to have steered hundreds of bison to their deaths; food remains at cooking sites suggest a diverse diet that included pistachios and wild olives, a press release notes. Villa says part of the issue is that neanderthals have long been compared to humans who came after them ( in the upper paleolithic period ) rather than those who were their middle paleolithic contemporaries.

Believed to have been descending into the gold mine shaft near aguila, 90 miles northwest of phoenix, when he fell monday, 62-year-old john waddell suffered two broken legs, per fox 10. But his hardships didn't end there. The father also battled three rattlesnakes ( now dead ) and severe dehydration over 48 hours without food or water before a neighbor discovered him wednesday. Terry schrader had agreed to check on waddell at the shaft if he didn't return by tuesday, though it was wednesday before he actually went searching. \" i was afraid of what i was going to find, \" schrader says. \" as i pulled up my truck, i could hear him hollering, ' help, help. ' \" schrader adds, per abc15, that \" the carabiner broke, i guess, and he supposedly fell 40 to 50 feet. \" though waddell had a phone, there was no cell service; schrader had to drive out of the desert to call authorities. The maricopa county sheriff's office organized the rescue beginning around 2pm, reports the arizona republic. It took more than six hours and a team of more than a dozen before waddell could be airlifted to a hospital. \" we are looking forward to his recovery, \" an mcso rep says. Regardless of his screams as he was removed from the shaft, \" he's a tough guy, \" schrader says. ( rescuers decided to abandon efforts to pull a man out of a nevada mine shaft. )",

        "summary": "Almost 6 million people die from a stroke each year, and although scientists aren't recommending spider bites to remedy that, the poison contained in one particular arachnid may fend off stroke-related brain damage, the guardian reports. In a study published in the pnas journal, australian scientists discovered that just a tiny amount of a peptide called hi1a, found in the venom of the darling downs funnel web spider ( hadronyche infensa ), was able to cut down on brain damage in rats by 80 % if it was given two hours after the rats had suffered a stroke. And the effects were still significant when hi1a was administered eight hours after the stroke, leading to a 65 % reduction. The discovery was made somewhat by accident after researchers had \" milked exhaustively \" three funnel web spiders they'd gathered in brisbane to study their toxins. They noticed one peculiar-looking molecule that looked like a mega version of a brain-cell-protecting chemical — so they tested it to see if it might help cells starved of oxygen by strokes. Rats that didn't receive the h1ia \" performed very badly \" after their stroke, study co-author glenn king says, while those who did get it were nearly as good as new. \" we believe that we have, for the first time, found a way to minimize the effects of brain damage after a stroke, \" says king, per the sydney morning herald. The researchers warn that the results can't yet be extrapolated to humans and that it's unclear whether the peptide would work in strokes caused by blood vessel ruptures, as well as those caused by blockages. One scientist not involved in the study called it \" a very exciting discovery and a very big effect, \" but cautioned that any practical applications are years away.

            "Six million people die each year from stroke, and 5 million survivors are left with a permanent disability. Moreover, the neuronal damage caused by stroke often triggers a progressive decline in cognitive function that doubles the risk of dementia for stroke survivors. Despite this massive global disease burden, there are no approved drugs for treating the neuronal injury caused to the brain by the oxygen deprivation occurring during an ischemic stroke. The precipitous drop in brain ph resulting from stroke activates acid-sensing ion channel 1a. We show that inhibition of these channels using a \"double-knot \" spider venom peptide massively attenuates brain damage after stroke and improves behavioral outcomes, even when the peptide is administered 8 h after stroke onset. Abstract stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, yet there are no drugs available to protect the brain from stroke-induced neuronal injury. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a ( asic1a ) is the primary acid sensor in mammalian brain and a key mediator of acidosis-induced neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia. Genetic ablation and selective pharmacologic inhibition of asic1a reduces neuronal death following ischemic stroke in rodents. Here, we demonstrate that hi1a, a disulfide-rich spider venom peptide, is highly neuroprotective in a focal model of ischemic stroke. Nuclear magnetic resonance structural studies reveal that hi1a comprises two homologous inhibitor cystine knot domains separated by a short, structurally well-defined linker. In contrast with known"
