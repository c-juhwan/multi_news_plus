        "summary": "The american people haven't been moved by all the dire warnings about the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling, a new fox news poll suggests. Only 37 % said they would vote to raise the debt ceiling if they were in congress, compared to 58 % who said they'd vote against. Opponents included 78 % of republicans, 57 % of independents, and 38 % of democrats. Respondents weren't nearly as sanguine when it came to the government shutdown; 81 % said it was a \" very \" or \" somewhat \" serious problem. But the country is still seriously divided about how to resolve that impasse, a pew poll reveals. Asked who should give ground in the debate, 42 % said president obama should, to 44 % who said the gop should, with the response split essentially evenly along party lines. Republicans are still taking more blame for the crisis, however, and that may show up in the ballot box. The latest politico poll shows terry mcauliffe opening a 9-point lead over ken cuccinelli in virginia's governor's race, amid rampant anti-shutdown sentiment.",

Agranoff first came up with the idea for hoopswagg when he was at a high school basketball game at age 13 and noticed all the boring athletic socks players were wearing; the company makes socks and other products, including shoelaces and arm sleeves, for basketball and other sports. Designs range from fairly standard ( digital camo ) to pretty out-there ( unicorns farting rainbows ). \" my ideas, they're either really random or based on what is happening right now, \" the oregon high school junior, who has come up with more than 500 designs so far, tells katu. The company's annual sales are more than $ 1 million, cnn money reports. Agranoff has a number of part-time employees, and his mom works for the business full-time. One of his most popular designs involves pictures of the goats his family owns; agranoff still has normal family chores, including feeding those goats, as well as his schoolwork. None of that stops him from working around 5 to 6 hours a day, he says. He taught himself how to code and do graphic design, and his parents were the first investors in his business, which he now runs from a 1,500-square-foot building on his family's property. Last week, hoopswagg announced that it had purchased another custom athletic apparel company, its first acquisition. Agranoff plans to go to college eventually, but first he will work for his company full-time after graduating from high school six months early; he'd like to sell his products in brick-and-mortar stores. A pair of socks will run you $ 14.99. Agranoff hopes to someday allow customers to come up with their own designs. ( this teen's business involves naming chinese babies. )",

The 33-year-old canadian woman then headed home, only to return to iwk health center in halifax, nova scotia, the next day, per the canadian press. This time, doctors did not blame constipation. Hubley, who went immediately into surgery, was experiencing secondary septic shock and multi-system organ failure, reports the washington post. Seven months later, she remains hospitalized following a hysterectomy and amputations of all four limbs — an outcome hubley attributes to doctor negligence in a lawsuit filed wednesday. The new mom was eventually diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating disease. \" our allegations are that had she been properly assessed when she presented at the hospital... A substantial part of the damage, if not all of it, could have been prevented, \" says her attorney. He adds that his client suffered a vaginal tear during the birth and that part of the placenta was not removed, both of which could have contributed to the infection. According to the cdc, flesh-eating disease most often occurs when bacteria enters the body through a break in the skin. \" no mom should ever have to watch their fiance and their son walk out the door every night for over 200 days, \" adds hubley's partner, mike sampson, 34, referring to hubley's long hospital stay. \" our lives have been turned upside down. \" iwk has not responded.

Now, she's taking legal action against the iwk health centre and several halifax-area doctors for alleged wrongdoings in her care during the birth and her postoperative care. Lawyer ray wagner said a statement of claim filed in nova scotia supreme court wednesday alleges that the negligence of five doctors and the hospital caused or contributed to the health issues suffered by hubley. \" she was very lucky to have survived, \" said wagner in an interview on wednesday.

Physicians eventually determined hubley was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, a dangerous flesh-eating disease.

I love that their reasons for not wanting kids aren't about the environment or money struggles, but all jokes. It illustrates the point: it doesn't matter why a woman doesn't want kids.

Police in little rock, ark., used them on 84 % of raids from 2011 to 2013, although the raids usually just turned up minor drug paraphernalia. But a police rep defends flashbang use, saying that \" what we see is a large service of warrants without gunfire. \" still, horror stories include a 19-month-old georgia baby who suffered severe facial injuries during a drug raid when a flashbang landed in her crib, wokv reports. A grand jury didn't indict the officers involved but suggested two ideas that are going around: better police training ( there are no national flashbang training standards ) and fewer \" no-knock \" warrants that permit police raids. Meanwhile, dukes — who suffered second-degree burns over her body — has filed a civil suit alleging excessive police force. \" my skin is ugly, and i feel like i ' m ugly, \" she says. \" when i talk about it, i just get angry. \"",

The big takeaway: yes, it does, and apparently \" significantly \" so, reports medical daily. The researchers partnered with the brussels beer project and uk band the editors to test a porter-style beer created especially for the experiment, they report in science daily.

            "Music can influence how much you like the taste of beer, according to a study published in frontiers in psychology. Their findings suggest that a range of multisensory information, such as sound, sensation, shape and color, can influence the way we perceive taste. The brussels beer project collaborated with uk band the editors to produce a porter-style beer that took inspiration from the musical and visual identity of the band. The ale had a medium body and used an earl grey infusion that produced citrus notes, contrasting with the malty, chocolate flavors from the mix of grains used in production. This taste profile was designed to broadly correspond to the editors latest album, ' in dreams '. Then, a team of researchers led by dr. Felipe reinoso cavalho, from the vrije universiteit brussel and ku leuven, designed an experiment to see if the influence of music and packaging design would result in a more positive tasting experience. They invited 231 drinkers to experience the beer in three different conditions. The first served as a control group and drank the beer along with a bottle without a label. In this case, they didn't listen to any specific song. The second group, testing the influence of packaging, tasted the beer after seeing the bottle with the label. The third group drank the beer presented with the",
            "The research presented here focuses on the influence of background music on the beer-tasting experience. An experiment is reported in which different groups of customers tasted a beer under three different conditions ( n = 231 ). The control group was presented with an unlabeled beer, the second group with a labeled beer, and the third group with a labeled beer together with a customized sonic cue ( a short clip from an existing song ). In general, the beer-tasting experience was rated as more enjoyable with music than when the tasting was conducted in silence. In particular, those who were familiar with the band that had composed the song, liked the beer more after having tasted it while listening to the song, than those who knew the band, but only saw the label while tasting.

            "Music can influence how much you like the taste of beer, according to a study published in frontiers in psychology. Their findings suggest that a range of multisensory information, such as sound, sensation, shape and color, can influence the way we perceive taste. The brussels beer project collaborated with uk band the editors to produce a porter-style beer that took inspiration from the musical and visual identity of the band. The ale had a medium body and used an earl grey infusion that produced citrus notes, contrasting with the malty, chocolate flavors from the mix of grains used in production. This taste profile was designed to broadly correspond to the editors latest album, ' in dreams '. Then, a team of researchers led by dr. Felipe reinoso cavalho, from the vrije universiteit brussel and ku leuven, designed an experiment to see if the influence of music and packaging design would result in a more positive tasting experience. They invited 231 drinkers to experience the beer in three different conditions. The first served as a control group and drank the beer along with a bottle without a label. In this case, they didn't listen to any specific song. The second group, testing the influence of packaging, tasted the beer after seeing the bottle with the label. The third group drank the beer presented with the",
            "The research presented here focuses on the influence of background music on the beer-tasting experience. An experiment is reported in which different groups of customers tasted a beer under three different conditions ( n = 231 ). The control group was presented with an unlabeled beer, the second group with a labeled beer, and the third group with a labeled beer together with a customized sonic cue ( a short clip from an existing song ). In general, the beer-tasting experience was rated as more enjoyable with music than when the tasting was conducted in silence. In particular, those who were familiar with the band that had composed the song, liked the beer more after having tasted it while listening to the song, than those who knew the band, but only saw the label while tasting. These results support the idea that customized sound-tasting experiences can complement the process of developing novel beverage ( and presumably also food ) events. We suggest that involving musicians and researchers alongside brewers in the process of beer development, offers an interesting model for future development. Finally, we discuss the role of attention in sound-tasting experiences, and the importance that a positive hedonic reaction toward a song can have for the ensuing tasting experience.

Data for 2016 has been released, and it's official that last year was the hottest year on record, following 2014 and 2015 in holding this status, the guardian reports. Nasa and noaa released their year-end stats along with the uk's met office, and 2016 narrowly edged out 2015 as the year with the highest globally averaged temperature since such measurements began in 1880. The average temperature across the planet's land masses and oceans came in at 58.69 degrees fahrenheit, which was what usa today calls a \" whopping 1.69 degrees above average \" — and the paper notes that while an almost-2-degree difference sounds small, records in climate science are often surpassed in tenths or hundredths of degrees. \" nature is sending a distress call, \" a world wildlife fund spokesman says. Sixteen of the past 17 hottest years have been since the turn of this century, and penn state climate scientist michael mann stresses that humans are indeed to blame, telling the guardian \" the effect of human activity on our climate is no longer subtle. \" mann says \" about 75 % of the warmth \" last year was people-driven, per the new york times, and that its impacts — including droughts, wildfires, floods, and other extreme-weather phenomena — are obvious. Some scientists are also turning a wary eye to the incoming trump administration in the wake of this news, with the policy director of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment noting that climate change-denying politicians \" will be willfully turning a blind eye to rising risks \" for everyone.",

North korea has previously detonated atom bombs that use fission. \" like a dropped water balloon hitting a sidewalk, atomic bombs crack open the dense atomic nuclei of large, unwieldy elements like uranium and plutonium to release tremendous amounts of energy. \" a hydrogen bomb is akin to \" filling up a water balloon until it bursts. \" nuclear fission factors into only the initial detonation, which \" [ ignites ] a secondary fusion stage by compressing lighter atoms of deuterium and tritium together until they explode. \" the concern: \" a fission weapon typically yields around 10 kilotons, while a fusion weapon is measured in megatons ( 1,000 kilotons ), \" notes daily intel. To put it in perspective, we're talking about a potential weapon \" hundreds of times more powerful \" than what decimated hiroshima and nagasaki. Maybe just ' boosted ': instead of a full-fledged hydrogen bomb, this could have been an atom bomb \" boosted \" by a small amount of fusion. \" weapon designers can easily boost the destructive power of an atom bomb by putting at its core a small amount of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, \" reports the new york times. But even so: a boosted atom bomb would be in the 50-kiloton range, which would be catastrophic if used on a densely populated city such as seoul, writes analyst bruce bennett at cnn. \" about 250,000 people could be killed in such a strike, or about 2.5 % of the population. \" enough experience: be skeptical, but remember that north korea has had a nuclear program, resulting in three previous detonations, for 20 years now, writes jeffrey lewis at 38 north. \" we should not expect that they will test the same fission device over and over again. \" still, he thinks a \" staged thermonuclear weapon \" is likely too advanced for the north at this point, with the \" boosted \" theory more plausible.

In a lengthy instagram post, kate beckinsale recounts an experience she had with weinstein at the savoy hotel ( the age of consent in the uk is 16 ). \" he opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him, \" she writes. \" after declining alcohol and announcing that i had school in the morning i left, uneasy but unscathed. \" years later, \" he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not. \" she also says a male friend was ostracized by weinstein after warning another young actress about him; that woman ended up sleeping with weinstein. Beckinsale's account comes as cops in both the us and the uk confirm they're investigating allegations against weinstein, the guardian reports. London police are looking into a sexual abuse allegation made against him and received by the department wednesday. The nypd, meanwhile, says it's \" conducting a review to determine if there are any additional complaints relating to the harvey weinstein matter \" based on allegations in news reports. \" no filed complaints have been identified as of this time, \" the nypd statement notes. Actresses in the us and abroad have accused weinstein of sexual harassment or assault. Weinstein, who's reportedly in an arizona treatment facility, has insisted he believed any sexual encounters were consensual.

For example, if you'd like to save the ponies that roam the moors of southwestern england, perhaps you should... Eat one. This is the suggestion being bandied about by the dartmoor hill pony association to rescue the pony population there: their numbers have fallen from 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 currently, the telegraph reports. The reason some think the scarf-down strategy will work: it would create a \" sustainable market \" for the ponies. Herders would have an incentive to take good care of their animals if they could eventually sell them as meat, and those not sold as food could be trained for riding and driving. \" strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales, \" argues charlotte faulkner, head of the dhpa. Princess anne is also an eat-the-pony/save-the-pony advocate for animal-welfare purposes: in a speech to a horse charity last year, she said herd owners would actually treat the animals better if they knew they had to maintain the herds until they were old enough to kill for meat ( the ponies have to be at least 3 years old to qualify, notes faulkner ). Other conservation groups are backing the initiative, claiming there are too many abandoned ponies wandering around — unwanted ponies that were being fed to zoo lions and tigers and stripped of their hides to make \" wild pony \" drums, reported the daily mail last year. \" why not promote the free-living exmoor ponies as a food animal as much as an amenity or aesthetic resource? \" says a horse expert in a report by local advocacy groups, notes the telegraph.

His weekend itinerary also includes a stop with his own family at robben island, where mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. \" the struggle here against apartheid for freedom, madiba's moral courage, this country's historic transition to a free and democratic nation has been a personal inspiration to me, it has been an inspiration to the world, \" obama said at a news conference, using mandela's clan name, reports ap. For his part, south african president jacob zuma added that obama and mandela were \" bound by history \" as the first black leaders of their nations. The 94-year-old mandela remains in critical condition, though zuma said he had \" every hope that he will be out of the hospital soon. \"",

        "summary": "The fda suspended a cancer drug trial earlier this month after three people died. But just a few days later, the agency gave juno therapeutics the green light to resume testing jcar015 on leukemia patients. Such a re-evaluation often takes the fda more than 30 days to complete, according to quartz. So why did the process move so quickly for jcar015? it could be because it's an immunotherapy drug, per quartz. From the american cancer society: \" immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person's immune system to fight diseases. \" and, quartz notes, it's a promising new cancer treatment that has really taken off in the last five years. With jcar015, white blood cells are removed from a patient, modified, and then re-injected so they can target cancer cells. Fifty-one patients participated in phase 1 of the jcar015 study, which had a \" complete response rate \" ( meaning no detectable cancer remains ) of 77 % to 90 %, depending on the stage of a patient's disease, according to onclive. The deaths, which occurred during phase 2, were caused by a reaction between jcar015 and the chemotherapy drug fludarabine, which was given in combination with the jcar015 and caused fatal brain swelling. Going forward, juno will remove fludarabine from the trial. \" although we have experienced a setback … we are optimistic that we will achieve results comparable to those in the phase i trial, \" says juno ceo hans bishop, per onclive. \" these results should provide the basis for an accelerated approval. \" immunotherapy is being studied as a treatment for a variety of malignancies, including melanoma, lung cancer, and the type of oral cancer poison drummer rikki rocket had. Promising as it may be, however, some cancers seem to evolve to outsmart immunotherapy, the washington post reports. ( a new study says alcohol consumption can cause at least seven types of cancer. )",

The process, expected to take years, will focus on deteriorations since the painting was last restored in 1975, following a knife attack. Most notably, the figure of a dog in the lower right of the painting of civic guardsmen has turned white, per the bbc. The masterpiece will be showcased on its own for several months beginning in february, as the museum commemorates the 350th anniversary of rembrandt's death. It will then be scanned and mapped before a restoration plan is agreed upon. ( this painting could be mistaken for a lost rembrandt, for good reason. )",

Investigators aren't saying much about the death of james \" skip \" scandirito, 75, who resigned a judgeship in macomb county, michigan, in 2000 in the face of sexual misconduct charges. But they've arrested his only child, james anthony \" jimmy \" scandirito, 49, and charged him with murder. The sun sentinel reports police went to the elder scandirito's boca raton home on april 1 after his son reported him missing. Scandirito's body was found april 4 on the site of the ocean breeze golf club, where the former judge used to work in the pro shop. The son was arrested april 9 when an alachua county sheriff's deputy spotted a toyota prius on interstate 75 near gainesville. Scandirito has been charged with murder, according to an alachua sheriff's spokesman. The elder scandirito moved to florida after resigning his position in michigan and was hired by the florida department of children and families as a senior attorney representing caseworkers and abused children. He was fired in 2003 when the agency learned of allegations that scandirito used his position as a michigan district judge to help five women with traffic tickets, drunken driving arrests and a bad check charge in exchange for sex. At the time of his firing, scandirito told the ap he was contesting the decision to revoke his law license for predatory sexual misconduct. \" i did a very good job and there were a couple of allegations. And instead of fighting it, i moved to florida, \" he told the ap in 2003.",

            "The report triggered two immediate and inevitable responses. Doctors and patients began an animated discussion. And republicans declared it was all a democratic plot. \"i mean, let the rationing begin. This is what happens when bureaucrats make your health care decisions, \" said representative david camp, the ranking republican on the house ways and means committee. Representative camp is definitely on to something. Whatever happens, we do not want the government conducting any studies on whether current health practices actually do any good. Let this continue and soon you will not be able to get your hands on a good leech when you need one. Photo there is no possible political advantage in coming out against medical testing, so the obama administration scurried away from the report. The task force did not consider the matter of cost, but, of course, people like representative camp depicted it as the first step toward rationing.

Still, it's hard to find a woman anywhere who was pleased to hear the new ruling that women in their 40s don't need to endure the annual indignity of baring their breasts to the radiologist after all. That's because it's hard to find a woman anywhere who believes that the federal panel changed its recommendation for her benefit.it's not that the decision doesn't make sense: it costs a lot to screen women for breast cancer in their 40s, and very few actually have it — something like 1.4 %. At the same time, it produces almost 10 % false positives, which cost a lot more to follow up with further imaging and biopsies.but that's not the way it's been presented. It's been rolled out with a lot of rhetoric about saving women the \"anxiety \" of false positives, about the \"risk \" of false-positives outweighing the risk of breast cancer.

An x-ray and ct scan revealed the movement. According to a report in the new england journal of medicine, the man's heart was likely repositioned after the accident, as air from his leaking lungs built up inside his chest cavity and essentially pushed his heart. The man's spleen was removed and the air was drained from his chest; his heart returned to its normal position within 24 hours and showed no \" relevant anatomical disruption \" afterward. A heart surgeon not involved in the man's treatment tells livescience that while the \" structures in the back of the heart and the big arteries \" are anchored in place, the heart lives in a sac that allows for some movement.

One of the officers, who was shot in the neck, is in a serious condition, but it's not life-threatening, reuters reports.

Now enrico letta, deputy head of the democratic party, is the new prime minister, overseeing what's been dubbed a \" grand coalition \" government. Its future is cloudy. The head of silvio berlusconi's people of freedom party in the country's lower house has demanded that letta immediately pledge to end to a housing tax and pay citizens back after a tax levy from last year; otherwise, he says, the government is doomed.",

Are critics as charmed by the playful antics of the guardians this time around? here's what they're saying: this \" ravishingly designed comedic space opera \" is \" a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all, \" writes michael o'sullivan at the washington post. In high praise for a sequel, he says the flick is \" more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier \" and \" more touching than the first film, \" managing to \" evoke genuine, deep feelings, along with belly laughs. \" richard roeper doesn't think the film quite measures up to the original \" but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch, \" he writes at the chicago sun-times. \" even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the guardians can put a lump in your throat, \" he writes, adding \" chris pratt and kurt russell are terrific together as a father and son. \" still, a third installment could be \" just a little smarter, a little less bloated, a little more focused. \" at times it seems like director james gunn \" is playing cosmic pinball rather than telling a story, \" with the characters bouncing from one battle to the next.

Yes, the 83-year-old former defense secretary is behind churchill solitaire, available on iphones and ipads as of last week, the wall street journal reports. Rumsfeld says that while he was us ambassador to nato in brussels in 1973, he learned the version of solitaire winston churchill played during world war ii to keep on top of strategic thinking. It's a supposedly more difficult version of traditional solitaire, and rumsfeld says it requires players \" to be strategic, to look around corners, to think ahead, and to never give in. \" the app's website describes it as \" the most diabolical version of solitaire ever devised. \" but rumsfeld doesn't actually know how to code, so he issued memos called \" snowflakes \" to his programmers using a dictaphone. Sample: \" [ w ] e ought to find some way we can achieve steady improvement instead of simply making new glitches. \" in a post at medium, rumsfeld explains that he decided to develop the app because few people know the game, and he was concerned it could end up lost forever. It involves two decks of cards, a timer, and complications like a \" devil's row \" of six cards that must be eliminated in quite a challenging fashion, the washington post reports. Reviewers on the app store seem to like it, with one saying players will \" feel sucked in. \" but another complains that rumsfeld's involvement \" sours the app for me — i still enjoy the challenge of the game but knowing rumsfeld will be making money from it is a negative. \" ( the journal reports that all of rumsfeld's profits are going to charity. ) over at gizmodo, kate knibbs declares the app \" donald rumsfeld's best contribution to society, \" and at the verge, rich mccormick calls it \" the most intense game of solitaire i've ever played. \"",

Ms. Quinn doled them out with equal fervor to toddlers, hecklers and strangers alike; in brooklyn, a man who stopped to complain about the economy ended up locked in an embrace with ms. Quinn, who delivered a kiss to his cheek. As she walked along southern boulevard in the bronx, ms. Quinn reached through the open passenger-side window of an idling suv, making a point of touching a woman's shoulder as she introduced herself. The gesture, which seemed to initially take the woman, milta rivera, by surprise, instantly endeared ms. Quinn to her. Photo \"she is a people person, \" ms. Rivera said later. \"you can just tell. \" still, ms. Quinn's campaign team — led by a consulting firm that worked on mr. Bloomberg's mayoral bids — took precautions, scoping out businesses in advance for her to visit and surrounding the speaker with a hive of supporters, some of them relatives and volunteers who had traveled into the city from afar. Ms. Quinn, 46, also took pains to avoid mentioning the man she hopes to replace in city hall. Asked explicitly if mr. Bloomberg had done enough to help the city's middle class, she did not utter his name. \"we all need to do more, \" she said when pressed, before an aide ended the interview. Ms. Quinn's close relationship with the mayor could prove politically treacherous as she appeals to new yorkers who remain frustrated by her efforts to change the city's term limits laws and allow mr. Bloomberg to seek a third term. That tension surfaced when herbert goldman, a retiree in forest hills gardens, confronted ms. Quinn outside a bank on continental avenue in queens. \"why did you push bloomberg for a third term? \" mr. Goldman shouted. Photo \"give me one second, \" ms.

Steve bullock ( d ) will be tasked with appointing a replacement for baucus -- one who could also run for a full six-year term in 2014. The clear early front-runner for the pick is lt. Gov. John walsh ( d ). Walsh is already running and is liked by national democrats. If appointed, he would suddenly have the advantage of incumbency ( think dean heller in nevada circa 2012 ) and could use it to craft a moderate profile through things like pushing for",
            "Washington — senator max baucus of montana, soon to be nominated as president obama's next ambassador to china, is the powerful — and, to many fellow democrats, infuriating — chairman of the senate finance committee. He is also the conflicted architect of mr. Obama's health care law. Now, if he is confirmed, mr. Baucus, who had already announced that he would not run for re-election in 2014, will join the administration whose bureaucratic ineptitude he foresaw in april when he warned of a \"huge train wreck \" if officials did not do a better job explaining the affordable care act. A democratic official said mr. Obama settled on mr. Baucus to succeed gary locke, the current ambassador, for reasons that include his efforts to bring down trade barriers between china and the united states and his insistence that \"china play by internationally accepted rules \" regarding currency, intellectual property, labor and human rights. The senator's departure would also remove a democrat who has been a thorn in his party's side, and would clear the way for gov. Steve bullock of montana to appoint a fellow democrat, most likely lt. Gov. John walsh, as interim senator. Mr. Walsh, who has already declared for mr. Baucus's seat, would be a strong candidate next november in a race crucial"

Police in germany say a woman dabbed playing cards with a radioactive substance as part of an elaborate scheme to cheat, reports the bbc. The 41-year-old restaurant owner in berlin marked the cards with iodine-125, allowing her or perhaps a gambler she was in cahoots with to spot them with some unspecified detector. The substance is typically used in medicine and poses a health risk to those exposed to it without protective clothing. It was unclear whether the doses involved in the case might have endangered players. Details about the scheme were scant, but investigators uncovered it with some nifty detective work. First, a routine inspection of a garbage truck at a waste-treatment plant turned up elevated levels of radioactivity, explains the ap. Authorities traced the load back to the woman's restaurant, and a subsequent raid turned up 13 radioactive cards. It wasn't clear how much money the alleged scheme netted.

So, we decided to take a bit of a risk and have fun with it. \" \" the car is fully functional. It's a running and driving car, \" grams tells abc, which notes that the delorean is also worth a not-insignificant $ 85,000. Visitors to the museum will be eligible to enter between march 21 and whenever \" the cubs are out, or until they win, \" says grams. And what happens in the event of a non-hollywood ending, in which the cubs don't win the pennant? \" we keep the car, but the giveaway winner will win the museum's hover board prop, \" says grams. But if the team does win, \" you could travel back in time to 1908 and watch the cubs win their last series. \" ( this stolen delorean was found in a weird way. )",

        "summary": "Southwest airlines recently removed a college student from a flight after he was heard speaking arabic on his cellphone, the new york times reports. The student, khairuldeen makhzoomi — who had emigrated to the us from iraq with his family in 2010 — says he was only talking about a dinner he had attended where un secretary general ban ki-moon gave a speech. \" i was very excited about the event so i called my uncle to tell him about it, \" says the 26-year-old. But a passenger apparently misheard his use of the common arabic phrase \" inshallah \" ( or \" god willing \" ) as \" shahid \" ( or \" martyr \" ) and reported him on the april 6 flight out of lax, the daily californian reports. According to makhzoomi, an employee escorted him off the plane and asked why he was speaking arabic. \" i said to him,'this is what islamophobia got this country into, ' and that made him so angry, \" says the uc berkeley student. \" that is when he told me i could not go back on the plane. \" taken to a terminal, makhzoomi says he and his luggage were searched while onlookers and half a dozen cops watched. \" that is when i couldn't handle it and my eyes began to water, \" says makhzoomi, whose father was killed by saddam hussein's regime. Released by the fbi later that day, makhzoomi got a refund from southwest and arrived at his oakland destination on delta air lines 8 hours later than expected. Makhzoomi says he doesn't want any money for his ordeal — just an apology from southwest. Makhzoomi's case isn't so unusual: six muslims have already been pulled off flights this year, an expert says, including one on a southwest flight just last week, cbs baltimore reports.",

But just as confusing and \" hurtful \" to the 20-year-old gymnast, per the washington post, was criticism about everything from the look on her face as she watched teammates compete to how she hadn't placed her hand over her heart while the national anthem played during a medal ceremony tuesday — leading her to stay away from online \" negativity \" while in rio, an emotional douglas said after a disappointing uneven-bars routine over the weekend. \" when they talk about my hair or me not putting my hand up on my heart or me being very salty in the stands, they're really criticizing me, and it doesn't really feel good, \" she said.

Later this week, another round of talks is scheduled to begin in geneva. The window for achieving a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis is not open-ended. Both mr. Obama and mr.

            "Photo advertisement continue reading the main story there were high expectations after president obama and iran's president, hassan rouhani, talked on the phone in late september. Those hoping for a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear standoff were excited that a breakthrough was imminent; meanwhile, some american allies, like israel and saudi arabia, expressed deep skepticism over a potential american rapprochement with iran. No breakthrough was achieved when american and iranian officials met for negotiations last month, but few observers expected one. Later this week, another round of talks is scheduled to begin in geneva. The window for achieving a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis is not open-ended. Both mr. Obama and mr. Rouhani face domestic pressures — from skeptical members of congress in washington and anti-american hard-liners in tehran. Nevertheless, despite three decades of frosty relations and although most americans may be unaware of it, talks with iran have succeeded in the past — and they can succeed again. Immediately after 9/11, while serving in the state department, i sat down with iranian diplomats to discuss next steps in afghanistan.

North carolina state researchers who examined skulls from spain and portugal going back to the 16th century say that the differences between male and female specimens have diminished over the ages, reports dailytech. Specifically, modern women have larger facial structures, closer to the size of men's, possibly because of better nutrition. \" this has applications for characterizing older remains, \" says the lead researcher, according to science daily. \" applying 20th-century standards to historical remains could be misleading, since sex differences can change over time — as we showed in this study. \"",

Dr. Ann ross, study leader and an associate professor of anthropology at north carolina state university, and a team of researchers, have discovered that the craniofacial features of spanish and portuguese men and women have become more and more similar since the 16th century. Ross and her colleagues made this discovery by comparing over 200 skulls from 16th to 20th century spain. They also looked at 50 skulls from 20th century portugal. By paying particular attention to the craniofacial features, they found that male and female skulls from the 16th century were more distinct than in the 20th century. For instance, modern spanish women have larger facial structures than spanish women from the 16th century. These larger facial structures are much closer to the size of men's facial structures. According to ross, improved nutrition may be one of the reasons for the increased size of female craniofacial features. Ross and her colleagues looked into the changing features of male and female skulls in order to better understand exactly how they've changed over time, which can help researchers identify the sex of remains based on these features.

In fact, the planet's rings and many of its 62 moons likely didn't form until dinosaurs were around to see it happen, discovery reports. Researchers from the seti institute measured changes in the orbits of saturn's moons and rings — caused by the tidal forces they constantly exert on each other — to create a computer model capable of mapping their histories, according to a press release. They figured out the orbits of the icy moons closer to the planet hadn't changed as much as would be expected had they formed along with the planet 4.5 billion years ago as previously believed. Conversely, the planet's rings were shifting too quickly to be that old. Instead, it's likely the moons and rings were created in the most recent 2 % of saturn's history — or about 100 million years ago — when older moons circling the planet crashed into each other. Dinosaurs roamed the earth from about 230 million years ago to 66 million years ago, cnn reports. Researchers published their findings thursday in the astrophysics journal. They hope to use them to figure out the ages of other moons in the solar system. \" it's pretty crazy to think that moons were forming in our solar system during a time on earth that many of us can actually envision, \" science alert states. \" cosmically speaking, it's like it only happened yesterday. \" ( nasa is baffled by red arcs on one of saturn's moons. )",

Luckily, the museum says the glowing pumpkin in the \" infinity room \" — dubbed \" all the eternal love i have for the pumpkins \" — only \" sustained minor damage \" and explains the cost of replacing an individual pumpkin is \" negligible. \" however, \" the room was closed temporarily \" and \" will have increased security and visitor services staff \" when it reopens at a later date.

It's also possible the visitor was in a rush. Museumgoers are allowed in the pumpkin room for only 30 seconds due to the high popularity of the exhibit, which opened last week and includes six infinity rooms, each making use of mirrors to give the impression that the room has no end. The hirshhorn describes the exhibit as an \" unforgettable sensory journey through the mind and legacy of one of the world's most popular artists \" and \" one of 2017's essential art experiences. \" ( a selfie damaged a 300-year-old statue. )",

        "summary": "The debate over mh370's demise rages on, this time in the australian senate, where an official with the country's transport safety bureau ( atsb ) threw cold water on a recently pushed theory. In an episode of australia's 60 minutes, experts alleged that captain zaharie ahmad shah intentionally crashed the plane and that those aboard weren't conscious when he did so. They suggested he depressurized the aircraft by rapidly changing its altitude to inflict hypoxia on the passengers and crew but remained conscious himself using an emergency air supply, then repressurized the plane for the remainder of the journey. Both the atsb and malaysian officials say zaharie was unconscious when the flight went down, and the atsb's peter foley used the example of a 1994 flight as reported by the us national transportation safety board in attempting to dispel the theory. The guardian has his quote: \" during the climbout [ of the 1994 flight ] the flight crew was unable to pressurize the aircraft, and the captain elected to proceed with the flight. The crew donned their oxygen masks and shortly thereafter the captain became incapacitated from decompression sickness. The first officer took command and they landed the plane. The pilot in this particular aircraft was 51 and overweight. The pilot in command of mh370 was 53 and overweight. I ' m not saying that happened and i hate to speculate, but that is one plausible scenario. \" the australian associated press reports foley said zaharie would have had to battle the effects of decompression sickness for as long as an hour, and that doing so just wasn't likely.",

But recent reports, including a one-hour special aired by australia's 60 minutes, claimed zaharie was conscious at the end of the flight, and deliberately piloted his plane in a \"controlled ditching \" into the sea. The program's experts said zaharie depressurised the plane to incapacitate passengers and other crew through hypoxia ( oxygen deficiency ), and used an emergency air supply to stay conscious. He then repressurised the plane for the rest of the journey.

            "Australian investigators have defended their search for malaysian airlines flight 370, saying it was unlikely the pilot performed a controlled ditching. Australian transport safety bureau's greg hood and peter foley told a senate estimates hearing on tuesday they deeply regretted not being able to find the plane and the 239 people on board. Mr foley said claims the atsb had ignored a theory in which the pilot flew the plane to the end were wrong. A recent book by canadian larry vance, a former commercial pilot who worked as a senior air-crash investigator with canada's transportation safety board, cast doubt on the atsb's findings. Mr vance presents evidence contradicting the bureau's conclusion mh370 likely entered an out-of-control high-speed descent and crashed into the ocean. But mr foley told the hearing the last transmission from the plane was incomplete and probably triggered by fuel exhaustion. \" there's no earthly reason why someone in control of an aircraft would exhaust its fuel and then attempt to glide it when they have the option of ditching, \" mr foley said. \" the aircraft was probably descending in an uncontrolled manner. \" one of the plane's flaps found off the coast of tanzania in july 2015 was a crucial piece of evidence, mr foley said.

        "summary": "\" if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out. \" so says stephen hawking in claiming to have resolved the so-called information paradox — the seemingly irreconcilable problem of two well-accepted tenets involving black holes. Quantum mechanics dictates that the information of the physical state of objects that fall into black holes cannot be lost, while general relativity argues that it can't survive a black hole's overwhelming gravitation. Hawking contends that a third perspective could allow both theories to be simultaneously true, reports the wall street journal. \" black holes ain't as black as they are painted, \" he said, per al jazeera. \" they are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly come out in another universe. \" information doesn't actually reach the black hole's interior, hawking posits, but rather is stored on its boundary, the event horizon, essentially sitting on the surface as holograms ( 2d afterimages of a 3d object ), reports engadget. \" the information about ingoing particles is returned, but in a chaotic and useless form, \" hawking adds. \" this resolves the information paradox. For all practical purposes, the information is lost. \" hawking had maintained for decades that information could not possibly be lost, but eventually revised his assessment when his own calculations found that information appears to leak out. But not everyone is applauding. Fellow physicist gerard 't hooft, who won the nobel prize in 1999, says he published a paper in 1996 with a similar finding. \" i claim he is now where i was 20 years ago, \" he tells the journal. \" if he announces this as a new idea, i won't be thrilled. \" ( see how hawking ranks empathy. )",

Democrat phil murphy beat goper kim guadagno in november, and at a recent photo op, murphy got in a low-key dig at christie. Northjersey.com reports that while murphy was in attendance at a gala in glen ridge for the new jersey working families alliance, he posed in front of a cutout of christie that depicted him lazing in a beach chair — a pic made famous as christie hung out at island beach state park with his family on july 2 after he'd shut down state beaches to everyone else over the july 4th weekend. The washington post notes the pic, which showed murphy and the njwfa director with big smiles on their faces next to the cutout, was posted on northjersey.com and the njwfa site. See it here. Christie isn't smiling back. \" i think someone's got to remind him that the campaign is over, \" christie said friday. \" it's disappointing because we've been so open and so welcoming to him, and not playing politics at all. \" christie is especially miffed that murphy ran on a platform that vowed to take down the \" us versus them \" mentality, noting that this slam \" sends a really terrible message. \" still, he says murphy's photo \" doesn't matter \" to him personally. There's been a dust-up between the two recently as they prep for the transition, specifically regarding budget numbers and media access to them.

The blast put out so much energy that it was detected by networks designed to pick up infrasound data on nuclear explosions — and indeed, the blast was drastically more powerful than north korea's recent nuclear test. Almost all of that energy and force is believed to have been generated not by impact — because the rock likely broke apart in the upper atmosphere — but by the sonic force of it obliterating the sound barrier. \" it was a very, very powerful event, \" says one astronomer, explaining that, to make matters worse, the meteor's low angle of approach focused its energy on the city below. \" it's lucky that there wasn't more damage. \" by the most recent count, roughly 1,000 adults and 200 children have been injured, mostly from shards of glass, reuters reports. ( the european space agency has confirmed that there's no link between the meteor and the much larger asteroid that passed earth today. ) meanwhile, the washington post reports that conspiracy theories about the meteor are already springing up in russia, with explanations ranging from alien invasion to biblical apocalypse.",

New york ( cnnmoney ) -- in the not so distant past, netflix was known mainly for its red envelopes. The dvd-rental-by-mail service was the company's core, and streaming video was a side perk for subscribers. Fast forward to 2011, and online movies and tv couldn't be hotter. Google, amazon, hulu and others have jumped into the fray -- putting studios in the power position. They want to be paid more for the content they're providing. That spells trouble for netflix's streaming content costs. \" netflix has another year or two on most of these contracts, and then the game completely changes, \" says michael pachter, analyst at wedbush securities.

The wife of 63-year-old danny burch, an employee of yemeni-owned oil company safer, says five armed men driving a pickup truck without license plates took him from his car on a busy street in the yemeni capital of sanaa on saturday, per the new york times. The kidnapping took place \" in broad daylight in front of everyone, \" says nadia forsa, who later found her husband's car parked on the side of the road. A yemeni security official and two of burch's colleagues confirmed the account. The us state department says it is aware of the report, per the ap. No group has claimed responsibility, but reuters reports two of burch's colleagues blamed the houthi rebels who occupy sanaa. The times notes the houthis are known to abduct foreigners for ransom or because they believe them to be spies. Burch was born in louisiana and spent years working on oil rigs in texas before taking a job in yemen in 1994. He moved there permanently in 2005 when he fell in love with forsa, a yemeni woman, his brother tells the longview news-journal. The pair went on to have three children, aged 7, 9, and 12.

Friends who rented the property to host a birthday soiree on saturday had to cancel their plans when they found the body of a woman in a shallow grave in a garden, reports the week. She was found \" hunched in a dug-out area, her head against the ground, covered in branches, and surrounded by wood stumps … at the bottom of the property which opens out into a woods, \" police tell the afp. A prosecutor tells the ap that the branches had been deliberately placed. The woman, aged between 30 and 50, was clothed and wearing a \" ring with a large stone \" on her finger, but her shoes and identification papers were nowhere to be found, police say. Authorities add the body may have been in the garden for several weeks. Officers couldn't immediately determine a cause of death because of the advanced stage of decomposition, per the telegraph, though the prosecutor's office says \" all the signs suggest that this was a criminal act. \" the renters were interviewed by police on sunday. The property listing has since been removed from airbnb; the telegraph notes it isn't clear who owns the property. ( this teen duped an airbnb host to throw a birthday rager. )",

        "summary": "Benjamin netanyahu has been israel's prime minister since 2009, the longest run since that of israel's founding father, david ben-gurion. That streak, however, might be in jeopardy thanks to a convoluted chain of events that involves two separate corruption investigations, a former confidant who has turned against him, the producer of pretty woman, and casino mogul sheldon adelson. Indictments are expected against the prime minister, though this could continue to play out for months. Here's a look at what's going on: defection: netanyahu got bad news last week with the news that former chief of staff ari harow, in trouble over his own private business dealings, agreed to cooperate with investigators against the prime minister, reports the new york times. Police said for the first time that netanyahu is accused of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. The cases: netanyahu is accused of accepting lavish gifts in return for favors and of trying to arrange better coverage in a critical newspaper by reining in a competing, pro-netanyahu newspaper run by adelson, per npr in this audio report. Pretty woman connection: hollywood producer arnon milchan, who has pretty woman and fight club among his credits, reportedly gave netanyahu thousands of dollars ' worth of cigars and champagne. In exchange, israeli media says the prime minister called up then secretary of state john kerry to help milchan secure a us visa, reports the washington post. Adelson: a court ruled monday that netanyahu must turn over call logs between him and adelson, who publishes the supportive israel today newspaper, reports haaretz. A journalist behind the suit says netanyahu is the \" de facto \" editor of the paper. The prime minister is accused of agreeing to curtail circulation if a competing newspaper backed off its criticism of him. Defiant: \" i have nothing to fear, \" said netanyahu, per the jerusalem post. \" i don't think i have a problem. \" on facebook, he posted that his opponents aimed to topple him, adding, \" it won't happen. \" indictments would not require him to step down as prime minister. His wife: sara netanyahu might be indicted, too, reports haaretz. Investigators suspect she used government funds for personal expenses at the netanyahu households.",
