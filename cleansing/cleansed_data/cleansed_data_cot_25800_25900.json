        "summary": "Trying to beat addiction through a faith-based 12-step program — alcoholics anonymous being the best known of the bunch — typically means you can never take a sip of alcohol again. But gabrielle glaser writes for the atlantic that aa was founded 80 years ago, \" when knowledge of the brain was in its infancy. \" it and programs like it present an antiquated model of dealing with addiction, she writes, going on to argue that most addiction counselors today aren't qualified to help those most in need, and that there are alternatives. \" nowhere in the field of medicine is treatment less grounded in modern science, \" she writes, pointing out that despite the 75 % success rate claimed for aa members who \" really tried \" in the group's 12-step bible, the \" big book, \" there's \" no conclusive data \" the program actually works. ( a retired harvard professor who's studied aa retention rates puts that number closer to 5 % to 8 %, she notes. ) one of the top methods she thinks we should consider for the estimated 18 million people with alcohol-use disorder, especially now that treating it is mandated for insurers under obamacare: medication, especially naltrexone, one of the three fda-approved drugs that's currently available. A couple other nuggets of note: the aa 12-step model is so ingrained that abstinence — not moderation — is recommended for all, and only after a drinker has \" hit bottom. \" \" researchers i've talked with say that's akin to offering antidepressants only to those who have attempted suicide, or prescribing insulin only after a patient has lapsed into a diabetic coma, \" she writes. Regarding the use of drugs to treat alcoholism, glaser notes a widespread resistance that's still strong. A psychologist she interviewed who used to speak about using naltrexone to curb cravings at medical conferences said \" the reaction was always ' how can you be giving alcoholics drugs?'they'd look at me like i was promoting valley of the dolls 2.0. \" read glaser's complete take, which includes her own experiment with naltrexone, at the atlantic.",

            "News release april is alcohol awareness month — a time to raise awareness about the health and social problems caused by excessive drinking. Alcohol awareness month also offers people the opportunity to evaluate their own drinking and determine if they need to change their habits. Most people have a general sense of the negative impact of high-risk drinking, but may not realize how widespread and extensive the consequences are. Each year, nearly 80,000 people die from alcohol-related causes, making it the third leading preventable cause of death in the united states. Alcohol problems cost the u.s. $ 225 billion each year, primarily from lost productivity, but also from health care and property damage costs. These issues affect every american, regardless of whether they drink or not. Most adults who drink do so responsibly with no harm to their health. In fact, for some people, drinking moderately is associated with a variety of potential health benefits including a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and certain types of strokes. Nevertheless, more than 30 percent of u.s. Adults will meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder at some point during their lives. The term \"alcohol use disorder \" includes both alcoholism and harmful drinking that has not reached the level of dependence. Alcohol-related problems — which result from drinking too much, too fast, or too often",

A major new study conducted by lancaster university and the cambridge university press, has found that women's use of the f-word has increased by over 500 per cent since the 1990s, and we say s*** 10 times more than men. What's more, a separate study recently found that millennial women have a much more relaxed attitude to swearing than previous generations, which isn't really surprising considering we reject the traditional gender roles that defined the lives of our elders. F*** that s***. A man once told me that he doesn't like it when \"girls \" swear, which made me effing angry and simply want to swear a crap-load more. Wtf. God forbid i should ever appear unladylike.",

        "summary": "\" #starbucks newest drink is the latte macchiato. Wtf is that? \" ok, that's one way of tweeting it. The answer is that latte macchiatos — available at starbucks starting tuesday in the us, canada, and some locations in latin america — combine espresso with \" steamy creamed whole milk, \" the company tells us weekly. How does that differ from a macchiato or a latte? well, a macchiato is an espresso with milk foam on top and a latte is an espresso under steamed milk and milk foam, the huffington post reports. With latte macchiatos, baristas first pour in the milk, then the espresso. This allows the espresso to \" stain \" the steamed milk, as time puts it. The \" perfectly aerated \" milk is \" marked by slowly-poured full espresso shots, creating a signature espresso dot, \" per a starbucks press release. \" starbucks baristas will use this carefully crafted technique to draw out an intensely bold and roasty flavor that highlights the starbucks espresso in the beverage. \" no reviews are in yet, of course, but @deeem_x tweeted this: \" i wanted to quit drinking coffee.

While she was incarcerated, a friend of hers says scott greene promised \" he would move and not bother \" his mom if his mom gave him $ 20,000. Patricia greene filed for a restraining order, and on tuesday — just hours before officers were killed — a judge found scott greene guilty of elder abuse for \" physically hitting and financially exploiting \" his mother. The judge ordered him to move out of her basement by nov. 6 and return $ 10,000 to her. An unemployed scott greene seemed \" pretty desperate \" for a job when he was hired by a construction business last month, claiming he had to provide for his teen daughter. But he quit three days later after being sent home \" because he was not taking directions and wasn't working. \" those who knew greene say he wasn't dealing well with his recent divorce and the death of his father, the huffington post reports.

Just ask rush limbaugh, who continues to take on fire as he stumbles his way through the right-wing media's divisive primary season from hell. Routinely condemned for not calling out what republican critics see as donald trump's brand of faux conservatism, limbaugh continues to fish around for a middle ground. The host seems anxious to defend trump from attacks, but also wary of offending his legion of listeners, who see the front-runner as a fraud, and see limbaugh as a hypocrite for playing nice with him. Torn between the allure of what's popular ( trump ) and abandoning everything limbaugh's said about how he defines conservatism over the last 30 years, limbaugh now often finds himself in no-man's land. \" every day of rush's show now feels like an exercise in strained, compulsory quasi-neutrality, which amounts in practice to him defending nearly everything trump says and does but mixing in some praise for cruz here and there just to make sure he's",

Its charts show that nigeria, about the size of texas, will surpass the entire us in population by 2050, reports the guardian. By 2100, it is expected to have an astonishing 1 billion people and be poised to overtake china, writes max fisher in the washington post. ( the latter country will be shrinking and likely headed for a demographic nightmare. ) as for the african continent, it \" will see a population explosion nearly unprecedented in human history, \" he adds. The biggest nation in 2100, however, is expected to be india, with a population somewhere around 1.5 billion. But its growth will level off around 2065 — meaning nigeria looks on track to be no. 1 in the subsequent decades. As for the us, its growth will rise slowly but steadily over the century and should be around 500 million by 2100. The world's overall population, now at 7.2 billion, is expected to be at 11 billion by then.",

Now, archaeologists who spent three weeks studying an excavated area beneath some 80 arched entrances that opened up into the arena say that after the roman empire crumbled, the ancient structure came to house — gasp! — ordinary romans, reports the telegraph. Discovery likens the colosseum to a \" huge condominium \" from the 800s until at least 1349, when a major earthquake inflicted significant damage. \" this excavation has allowed us to identify an entire housing lot from the late medieval period, \" explains the colosseum's director. Among the findings: terracotta sewage pipes, pottery shards, the likely presence of stables and workshops, and the foundation of a wall that marked the boundaries of one of the properties. They believe that friars from the nearby santa maria nova convent, who controlled the building for a time, rented out square feet within the colosseum as housing. The amphitheater, no longer used as an arena, became a huge courtyard, they say, thriving with people, animals, and goods. Archaeologists even found a tiny monkey figurine carved in ivory, likely a chess pawn. Smithsonian notes other unexpected uses followed: in the 1500s, pope sixtus attempted to make the colosseum a wool factory.

They believe that people lived within the arena from the ninth century until at least 1349, when it was badly damaged by an earthquake. One of their most intriguing discoveries is the figurine of a tiny monkey, carved in ivory, which was probably used as a pawn in a chess game.

The outcry over rogers'decree that 21-year-old josten bundy had to marry 19-year-old elizabeth jaynes or face 15 days in jail has led to the revelation of at least one similar ruling by the judge and resulted in a complaint against him with the state commission for judicial conduct, per the station. \" judges are government actors and they need to keep their personal religious bias out of the courtroom, \" the attorney who filed the complaint in august tells kltv. He adds that rogers also violated the separation of church and state by ordering bundy to write out proverbs 26: 27 ( \" if a man digs a pit, he will fall into it \" ) 25 times a day. Bill bull tells kltv a similar story about his 27-year-old son, benjerman, who faced rogers on a misdemeanor theft charge in 2012 and felt compelled to marry his also-arrested girlfriend: the two were living together, and rogers said they couldn't be around each other; that meant they had to move or risk jail for violating the order — but \" if you get married, that's a different story, \" rogers said, per the court transcript. Bull says the quickie marriage \" made things worse \" for his son and \" created more financial and emotional problems. \" one person vouching for rogers: retired judge cynthia stevens kent, who knew rogers well. \" the judge has enormous discretion [ to set probation ] as long as the conditions are meant to protect the victim, protect society, work toward rehabilitation, \" she tells kltv.",

The uninitiated can test the original problem for themselves: go to the kitchen, pull out a piece of dry spaghetti, and try to break it into two pieces. As a post at mit news explains, it's all but impossible: the pasta snaps into three more pieces, every single time. This phenomenon has previously been explained as a result of bending waves combined with a \" snap-back \" effect, but the mit researchers investigated whether it's possible to overcome all that. The answer: yes, but there's twisting involved. The trick is to twist each end of the piece hard, as in 270 degrees, and then bend it slowly. \" they did some manual tests, tried various things, and came up with an idea that when he twisted the spaghetti really hard and brought the ends together, it seemed to work and it broke into two pieces, \" says jorn dunkel, co-author of the study in pnas. \" but you have to twist really strongly. \" after those initial hand tests, the team built a spaghetti-snapping device that cemented the theory, per newsweek. And they swear it has applications outside the kitchen, perhaps in preventing other rod-like materials from breaking in the real world. \" it will be interesting to see whether and how twist could similarly be used to control the fracture dynamics of two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials, \" says dunkel.

This initial break triggers a \"snap-back \" effect and a bending wave, or vibration, that further fractures the stick.

The similar-sounding \" texit \" movement, which gained significant support online friday, is mainly being pushed by the texas nationalist movement, which is basically the us soulmate of the uk secession initiative, according to its leader, david miller, right down to the \" leave \" campaign slogan that tnm says it's been using for years. With a motto of \" texas first, texas forever, \" the group, like those behind brexit, advocates for \" self-government, \" miller tells news.com.au. \" at this moment, we don't enjoy that right, \" he says. \" the vast majority of the laws, rules, and regulations that affect the people of texas are created by the political class or unelected bureaucrats in washington. \" vocativ decided to see how often the phrase \" texit \" has been used in 2016 and found that online references spiked after the brexit tally came in. Nearly 1,800 people tweeted something texit-related in the hour of the announcement, with thousands more tweets following. Some of the posts are frighteningly serious, others are somewhat clever ( cue the \" most likely to secede \" memes ), and still others can't do anything but virtually shake their heads. It's not the first time some of the state's residents have vied for a breakaway: right after president obama's reelection, the white house turned down a petition signed by 125,000 people calling for texas ' freedom, fox news reported. One texit supporter tells the guardian that a secession would bring back \" texas solutions \" on issues such as gay marriage, gun rights, and immigration.

Dieudonne ( known in france by his first name ) was taken into police custody today in the wake of the now-deleted post he wrote after attending sunday's unity and free-speech rally in paris. It read, \" tonight, as far as i ' m concerned, i feel like charlie coulibaly, \" making reference to both killer amedy coulibaly and the \" je suis charlie \" ( \" i am charlie \" ) phrase of support for charlie hebdo that's been circulating worldwide, the guardian reports. Dieudonne is no stranger to french authorities. He's been called anti-semitic for popularizing a nazi-like salute, joking about the holocaust, and poking fun of french-jewish leaders, the washington post reported last year. But his arrest brings up an inevitable debate: how a country that's taken to the streets to advocate for free speech may be trying to keep a lid on his. France doesn't enjoy the same free-speech liberties that the us does — denying the holocaust is illegal, for example, and more than 50 hate-speech investigations have opened since the attacks — but dieudonne's lawyer tells time that this arrest was \" totally exaggerated and [ disproportionate ]. \" the comic himself said, as per the atlantic: \" whenever i express myself some people will not even try to understand me, they will not listen....

A full refund is being offered to customers who bought affected units between 2002 and 2016; partial store credit will be available to those who bought affected furniture manufactured before 2002. For customers who want to keep the recalled furniture, ikea will send a crew to anchor the unit to a wall — the subject of a previous ikea safety campaign some say was inadequate. The philadelphia inquirer, which has been reporting on furniture tip-over issues, notes that after two recent toddler deaths, ikea offered a free wall-anchoring kit last summer — but cnnmoney reports that no design alterations were made and no products were taken off shelves. Then in february, 22-month-old ted mcgee of minnesota was killed after a malm dresser toppled onto him, and his parents said they'd never heard of ikea's anchoring campaign. But while safety advocates applaud ikea's move, others want more regulation in the furniture industry overall. The inquirer notes that pennsylvania sen.

That's because while lunenburg high school junior emily nash was allowed to play in the regional boys'team tournament tuesday — where her team failed to make the cut for the state team tournament — as a female, she is barred from competing with boys as an individual under massachusetts interscholastic athletic association rules, per the guardian. The worcester telegram explains her high school has no girls'team, so miaa rules let her play on the fall boys'team, but only as a member of the team, not as an individual. Nash knew in advance that she couldn't advance as an individual, but was \" disappointed \" to later learn \" i wouldn't be able to get the title or the trophy, \" she tells the telegram. It seems so were most others on the course. \" it's a real injustice, \" a rules official who was present at the tourney tells the telegram. The male runner-up, who was given the first-place trophy, even offered it to nash. She refused to take it, however. \" i understand that there are rules in place, \" she says. Even so, the tournament director says he plans to get another trophy made especially for nash, who can play in the girls state championships next spring. In the meantime, \" the miaa needs to get with the times, \" tj auclair writes at pga.com.

Specifically, per a sciencedaily news release, noshing down late at night can mess with the skin's biological clock, which in turn can affect the effectiveness during daylight hours of a particular enzyme that shields the skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Even dr. Joseph s. Takahashi — the geneticist whose 1997 claim to fame was discovering the \" clock gene \" that regulates our mammalian circadian rhythms — was taken aback when he saw the results of his latest study, published in the journal cell reports. \" this finding is surprising, \" he says. \" i did not think the skin was paying attention to when we are eating. \" mice in this experiment who ate only during the day ( i.e., not the nocturnal creatures ' normal feeding time ) didn't express as much of the skin gene xpa during the time they should have been resting. They also suffered worse skin damage when exposed to uvb rays than mice fed at night and who didn't exhibit a shift in xpa cycles. The research follows on the heels of other research that shows, for instance, that drinking on the beach is bad, reports the los angeles times. The researchers concede the study may not speak to how human skin genes react to food intake, or whether diurnal ( daytime ) creatures are susceptible to sleep-time snacking the way the nocturnal mice in the study were, reports food52. \" but it's fascinating to me that the skin would be sensitive to the timing of food intake, \" study co-author bogi andersen says, per the release.

        "summary": "The new bbc sketch comedy show revolting didn't wait long before jumping into controversy: its very first episode featured a real housewives of isis skit, rolling stone reports. It's exactly what you'd expect — a spoof of bravo's real housewives franchise in which the wives of isis fighters complain about not having a thing to wear to a beheading, show off their fancy new suicide vests, and rejoice in the fact that the new chain their husband bought to tie them up with is almost long enough to allow them outside. It's proving unsurprisingly controversial. Many commenters on social media complained that the sketch made light of the very real issue of young girls being groomed online and turned into jihadi brides, according to the hollywood reporter. Per one commenter: the sketch has \" all the fun of an off-base amy schumer skit with the same lack of awareness of anything other than itself \" and is \" only funny if you look down on someone else and enjoy seeing them unhappy because they are not white and christian. \" but the show's creators tell the i newspaper that's the exact issue they're trying to highlight. \" the target is online grooming. It's about people who are vulnerable to these kind of approaches, \" says jolyon rubinstein. Adds heydon prowse, \" it's important not to pull your punches in satire. You have to be fearless or it undermines your credibility. You can't go after david cameron for five years like we did [ on a previous show ] and not go after islamic state. \"",

Kristal eventually remarried and had two more children, and he and his family moved to israel in 1950. He became somewhat of a celebrity in haifa last year when he decided, 100 years after when most people do so, to celebrate his bar mitzvah. When kristal was told last year he was being bestowed with the world's oldest man title, he reportedly told haaretz, \" i couldn't care less. \" despite the ordeals he'd lived through over the years, he told the paper that \" the world is worse than in the past, \" lamenting modern-day \" permissiveness, \" lack of work ethic in today's \" cheeky \" young people, and the fact that everything is now \" high tech. \" \" today, children decide everything, \" he said. \" once upon a time, parents had the last word. \"",

Brett talley failed to mention in the senate questionnaire for judicial nominees that his wife is chief of staff to the white house counsel donald mcgahn, who has been helping trump fill judicial positions, the new york times reports. Sen. Dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee, says talley made a \" glaring omission \" by failing to mention his wife's position and the fact that she has been interviewed by special counsel robert mueller, the ap reports. The judiciary committee advanced talley's nomination for an alabama judgeship last week and a full senate vote is expected soon. His wife's job was \" no secret, \" said taylor foy, a spokesman for the gop-controlled committee, per cnn. \" she was sitting behind mr. Talley at his nominations hearing. Anyone who had any concerns about his wife's occupation could have raised them at the hearing. \" talley's nomination was already controversial: the 36-year-old has never tried a case and he received a rare \" not qualified \" rating from the american bar association.

The agent soon got a bite from the suspect, identified as foreign national patrick campbell. Campbell said he represented a mining company in sierra leone that could supply the material, and he and the agent worked out the logistics over 15 months. Campbell flew from paris to jfk on wednesday and was about to catch a connecting flight to miami, where the meeting was supposed to take place, when the feds arrested him. They confiscated samples of the raw uranium from his shoes ( it was in plastic bags ), along with a thumb drive that contained a contract for a larger shipment.

Three is the magic number as long as i can remember, there's been a mythical rule about third dates and sex. The survey results didn't really dispel that rumour - the global average is 3.53, which obviously considers more conservative cultures too.

The los angeles times has illustrations showing how nunchucks can be used in place of a baton to restrain a suspect by winding around an ankle or wrist. \" it gives us the ability to control a suspect instead of striking them, \" says sgt. Casey day, who's already been trained on the weapon and plans to use it instead of a baton. He notes that nunchucks also allow for distance between an officer and a suspect, but that they can be used as an \" impact weapon \" as well if need be. \" these were kind of designed with a different goal in mind to be more of a control weapon, but like i said, it's not like we can't use these as an impact weapon, \" day tells krcr. \" they work really good as an impact weapon, but we try to [ emphasize ] a control tool over impact. \" the anderson pd nunchucks were developed by a retired colorado police sergeant and are made of hard plastic. A nylon cord connects the two pieces and is used to restrain a suspect via the wrist or ankle — and while day is confident anderson officers will use the martial arts weapons properly, the times notes that some departments have used them improperly in the past, sometimes leading to broken wrists. Officers won't be required to carry nunchucks, but anyone wishing to do so will have to undergo 16 hours of training. Nunchucks are illegal for regular citizens to own in california.",

Pulmonary congestion has been listed as a potential cause of death for the 37-year-old, per the adirondack medical center's preliminary report, usa today reports, though the ap takes a more conservative stance in its reporting. It acknowledges the three-time olympic medalist and five-time world champ died with fluid in his lungs, but reports \" that alone was not enough to draw a conclusion as to why holcomb died. \" the formal conclusion will come once toxicology test results are in, which is still several weeks off. But essex county coroner francis whitelaw on sunday did say preliminary results were negative for drugs. Holcomb was found dead in his room at the olympic training center in lake placid, ny, and is believed to have died in his sleep. Our earlier report delves into what a bobsled powerhouse holcomb was, a sentiment echoed by international olympic committee president thomas bach, who said, \" he was already a sporting legend. \" part of holcomb's legend included a battle with a degenerative eye disease that nearly robbed him of his sight and spurred a 2007 suicide attempt. The new york times reports he was told that year — as the 20/60 vision he had thanks to contact lenses degraded further — he required a cornea transplant that would force his retirement from the sport, as any future collision could threaten the transplant. He tried to take his own life using sleeping pills, but later that year underwent a new procedure that inserted contacts behind his irises and restored his vision to 20/20.",

        "summary": "Japanese emperor akihito first spoke to his people via video message after the country had been ravaged by an earthquake and tsunami in march 2011, reports reuters. The second time was monday, and his words have been just as headline grabbing. In what the guardian calls \" a masterclass in the art of circumlocution, \" the 82-year-old hinted of his desire to abdicate: \" when i consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, i am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state with my whole being, as i have done until now. \" such a move hasn't occurred since 1817 — predating the country's modern era, which began half-a-century later — and would be complicated. The bbc explains that akihito \" is constitutionally not allowed to make any political statements, \" which an abdication request could be perceived as. He has no political power, and the law would need to be changed to allow for a transition of the chrysanthemum throne; whether to do so is now up to parliament, reports the wall street journal. In his 10-minute statement, akihito said, \" when the emperor has ill health and his condition becomes serious, i am concerned that, as we have seen in the past, society comes to a standstill. \" the guardian notes the mourning period can last as long as a year. A complicating factor: changing the law could open a window for discussion on broadening the rules of succession to allow women to take the throne, something traditionalists oppose. Akihito's eldest son, 56-year-old crown prince naruhito, is next in line, but has only a daughter.",

A similar story out of idaho has a somewhat better ending: also on saturday, a 79-year-old woman parked at her house and then tried to get out of her 2000 ford excursion; she was trapped as it either rolled or slid backward, according to a facebook post by the kootenai county sheriff's office. A 17-year-old boy who works for her saw the scene unfold and tried to help, but the car ended up pushing both of them across the street and over an embankment. They both ended up pinned, but the teen was able to get out. The woman was extracted by the fire department and survived, though she did suffer significant injuries and possible hypothermia.

The car was parked in the lot of an apartment complex not far from the spot where brown was killed. The dead man inside was the only one to lose his life during the riots that swept the city in the wake of the decision. But for all the attention brown's death has attracted, the death of deandre joshua, 20, has garnered little. The new york times, which speaks to his family, describes it as a \" footnote to ferguson's story, \" and a \" bitter mystery \" for those who loved him. His family tells the times that joshua wasn't involved in any of the marches or protests that followed after brown's death, and dispels the rumors that he was an unnamed grand jury witness. He did have one link to the case, though: he and twin brother dont ' a were childhood friends with dorian johnson, the man who was walking with brown when officer darren wilson stopped them. A former girlfriend places him with her, at a salon near st. Louis, when news of brown's death broke. Police have said nothing about possible suspects ( his family knows of no enemies ) or motives. What they have revealed are some graphic details: the st. Louis post-dispatch reported that joshua's body had been doused with accelerant in an attempt to light him on fire; his arm, fingers, and legs were burned, and the new york daily news notes the fire was likely extinguished on its own. His car was parked in the northwinds apartments lot, but his family says that he had left his family home around 2am to go visit a new girlfriend who didn't live in those apartments.",

        "summary": "Most parents would celebrate a school that specifically bars students from using marijuana on its premises. Not an illinois couple. Js and ms, as they're identified in court documents, are suing the state after a schaumburg school district barred their 11-year-old daughter from using a medical cannabis patch and cannabis oil drops to regulate seizures resulting from chemotherapy treatment for leukemia, reports usa today. Though medical marijuana was legalized in the state in 2014, consumption or possession on public school property remains outlawed. In a lawsuit filed wednesday, the couple argue the statute not only makes it hard for their daughter to attend school — putting them at risk of violating a state law requiring that kids attend — but also violates her right to due process, reports the chicago tribune. School superintendent andrew duross says he reached out to the illinois state board of education after the family requested that school officials administer the girl's medication as needed. The request wasn't unusual — school officials administer drugs to others, duross notes — but the board made clear that possessing or using medical marijuana on school premises would violate state law. District officials \" share the same concerns and care about [ the student ] and her family in this situation … but we cannot legally grant the request, \" duross says. The family's lawyer has asked a judge to allow the use of medical marijuana in this case, until the state law can be revisited.

        "summary": "A new poll from the wall street journal and nbc news contains some stats that president trump might be boasting about soon, but also some warning signs for the white house. The big takeaway is that trump's overall approval rating has hit an all-time high of 45 % — and that came in a week when he was deluged with negative press coverage about his summit with vladimir putin. Of course, as the journal notes, that percentage is still among the all-time lows for modern presidents in their first term. Other highlights: big republican support: trump enjoys an 88 % approval rating from republicans — the split is 64 % who strongly approve and 24 % who somewhat approve. Among recent presidents, only george w. Bush in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks has had a higher percentage within his own party, at 96 %. That contrasts with the 9 % of democrats who approve of trump. Possible trouble: the president's standing with independents dropped 7 points in a month to 36 %. Plus, independents favor a democratic-controlled congress by 20 percentage points, up from 7 in june. What's more, the percentage of americans who think russia interfered in the election rose 8 points to 65 %. Highs and lows: overall, 50 % of respondents approve of trump's handling of the economy, but only 26 % feel the same way about his handling of the us relationship with russia. On the latter issue, 53 % of republicans approve of the us-moscow relationship, compared with 14 % of independents and 6 % of democrats. Overall, 51 % don't approve.",

Eugene wright filed suit wednesday. The lawsuit — as per the meadville tribune — claims wright was arrested june 15 by two police officers and the executive director of stairways behavioral health after another man with the same name made threats against himself and others at a doctor's office that morning. The lawsuit states wright tried to explain they had the wrong person, but they refused to check the id and social security card in his wallet or call his employer to confirm that he was working when the threats were made. The lawsuit states wright was taken to meadville medical center, where employees also failed to confirm his identity despite him having been a patient there in the past. Against his protestations, wright was injected with anti-psychotic medication and another chemical used for anxiety disorders, according to the lawsuit. The mix-up came to light when wright's daughter showed up. Since the incident, wright says he's had trouble sleeping and has dropped weight, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. By way of apology, he says he received a $ 50 gift certificate to montana's rib and chop house and $ 25 to walmart. \" the experience that i went through, this should never happen to anybody.

Eugene wright, 63, from meadville, pennsylvania, is suing the local council and hospital for false imprisonment amongst other claims. A man with the same name had allegedly been making threats at a doctors ' office on the day of the incident. Meadville city manager andy walker declined to comment on the case. He told the bbc he was aware of a letter in november about a possible lawsuit but that no formal notification had yet been received. Police apology mr wright, who says he repeatedly stated that he was not the man the officers were looking for, is suing for false imprisonment, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, civil rights violation and invasion of privacy. He says he was walking outside his house to his vehicle after work when he was approached by two police officers and an official from a local psychiatric centre, and was arrested. The lawsuit says mr wright told the officers he was not the man they were looking for, but no-one checked his identity to make sure they had the right person in custody. The alleged mistake was only uncovered when mr wright's daughter arrived at the hospital, stating that her father had been at work at the time of the medical centre incident.

Eugene wright, 63, from meadville, pennsylvania, is suing the local council and hospital for false imprisonment amongst other claims. A man with the same name had allegedly been making threats at a doctors ' office on the day of the incident. Meadville city manager andy walker declined to comment on the case. He told the bbc he was aware of a letter in november about a possible lawsuit but that no formal notification had yet been received. Police apology mr wright, who says he repeatedly stated that he was not the man the officers were looking for, is suing for false imprisonment, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, civil rights violation and invasion of privacy. He says he was walking outside his house to his vehicle after work when he was approached by two police officers and an official from a local psychiatric centre, and was arrested. The lawsuit says mr wright told the officers he was not the man they were looking for, but no-one checked his identity to make sure they had the right person in custody. The alleged mistake was only uncovered when mr wright's daughter arrived at the hospital, stating that her father had been at work at the time of the medical centre incident.

Harwich argues that it was actually the site where the mayflower was built and departed from, and locals say the only reason the ship stopped in plymouth is because another ship carrying pilgrims ( the speedwell ) started leaking and had to get to the closest port. Now, 393 years later, harwich is elbowing its way in on the mayflower's legacy, barron's reports.

            "New york ( ap ) — responding to a furor over undercover videos, planned parenthood says it will maintain programs at some of its clinics that make fetal tissue available for research, but will no longer accept any sort of payment to cover the costs of those programs. Anti-abortion activists who recently released a series of covertly filmed videos have contended that planned parenthood officials sought profits from their programs providing post-abortion fetal tissue to researchers. Planned parenthood said the videos were deceptively edited and denied seeking any payments beyond legally permitted reimbursement of costs. The new policy — forgoing even permissible reimbursement — was outlined in a letter sent tuesday by planned parenthood's president, cecile richards, to francis collins, the director of the national institutes of health. \" planned parenthood's policies on fetal tissue donation already exceed the legal requirements, \" richards wrote. \" now we're going even further in order to take away any basis for attacking planned parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda. \" the videos were released, starting in mid-july, by a group of anti-abortion activists calling themselves the center for medical progress. Activists posed as representatives of a biomedical firm and sought to negotiate the purchase of fetal organs from some planned parenthood personnel.

Amusingly, the wall street journal reports that the food network may have given deen the boot regardless of the whole brouhaha: her contract ends sunday, and her agent has been negotiating an extension for weeks and still hadn't resolved the matter before this controversy erupted. The reason behind the uncertainty? a big ratings dip over the past season. Plus, more bad news for deen: tmz reports that the caesars casino company is severing ties with her, closing all four of her restaurants and then re-opening them with different branding. Not surprisingly, the new york post reports that deen has hired a top \" crisis pr guru. \"",

It seems the president got a little crossed up doing the signature asean handshake among world leaders gathered on the philippines stage. As npr notes, if you watch video of the good-natured incident, it's not so bad. But still images capturing trump's facial expressions have become a smash hit ( see them in the photo gallery ). One image in particular tweeted by new york times photographer doug mills was going viral, reports the washington post, which notes that it might be \" revenge \" of sorts for mills, who'd been complaining about paltry access granted to photographers during the trump trip. Mills wasn't the only pool photographer to publish the awkward images, and the post suggests that trump's defenders, perhaps even trump himself, will point to it as an example of biased coverage.",

        "summary": "If you've tried a warm glass of milk to help ease you into sleep at night and it hasn't worked, perhaps it was just milked at the wrong time. The wall street journal reports on a somewhat whimsical sounding potential treatment for anxiety and insomnia: \" night milk. \" that would be milk taken from cows at night; it's been found to be naturally higher in sleep-promoting compounds. South korean researchers recently put the theory to the test in a study published in the journal of medicinal food. In this case, the subjects were lab mice that were fed milk in powdered form that had been collected either during the day or at night. The latter contained notably higher levels of tryptophan ( 24 % more ) and melatonin ( almost 10 times more ), and the researchers found night-milk \" shortened the sleep onset and prolonged the sleep duration \" of drug-induced sleep. On the anxiety front, the journal reports that those mice who received night milk were more likely to explore open spaces, \" an indication of reduced anxiety \"; further, their behavior was similar to that of mice who had been administered the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. The big \" but \" in this study is that the subjects were, again, mice, not humans. But that doesn't mean humans haven't tried night milk. The new zealand herald reports on a night-milk powder called indream3 that's produced by synlait. A sleep trial partly funded by synlait at otago university found that the product \" reduced the time to onset sleep [ and ] increased the deepest phase of sleep \" in humans. It's apparently only available in south korea right now; sleep review magazine reports that a german company also makes its own version, a crystallized product called nachtmilchkristalle. ( it also apparently pays to sleep naked. )",

A glass of milk at bedtime has long been touted as a sleep aid. But the study found that milk collected at night, or night milk, had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day. Night milk significantly decreased the rodents ' physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed. Mice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said. Night milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in south korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow's milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24 % more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice",

Milchkristalle gmbh offers this \"night milk \" in crystallized form. Tony gnann, founder of milchkristalle gmbh, says in a release, \"we all know the problem of falling asleep, especially with temperatures like we have at the moment. \" the company says that the lactose makes it easier for the body to access the melatonin, which it says accelerates the effectiveness of the product. The company says it also uses a patented light regime and special food so the cows produce the milk rich in melatonin. The milk is then dried by a gentle process at 30 degrees below zero, which the company says ensures the conservation of the sleep hormone with valuable proteins."

The protestors, apparently aligned with an anti-fascist group, chanted \"racist scumbag, leave town \" outside carlson's home in northwest washington on wednesday. They spray-painted an anarchy symbol on his driveway and banged on his front door. Carlson wasn't home, but he told the washington post that his wife, thinking it was a home invasion, hid in a pantry and called the police. According to the police report, she said she heard \"loud banging and pounding on her front door. \" the protests anti-fascist group smash racism d.c., which accused carlson of putting \"fear into our homes, \" posted videos of the protests on twitter. The account was subsequently suspended. Fox news did not immediately respond for comment thursday night. In a statement issued thursday, fox news ceo suzanne scott and network president jay wallace denounced the protests: \"the incident that took place at tucker's home last night was reprehensible, \" scott and wallace said in their statement. \"the violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable. We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view. Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation. Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all americans, to find common ground. \" [ photo by rich polk/getty images ] have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

His quest for those things didn't go well — it involved the book the secret and lotto tickets, cnn reports. After dropping out of college — to avoid seeing \" beautiful girls i could never have \" — he decided winning the lotto was his only chance at happiness. But despite meditating to invoke the \" law of attraction, \" and multiple road trips to arizona to buy powerball tickets, he didn't win. Rodger also had a series of outbursts against his supposed \" enemies. \" after spotting a couple kissing in starbucks, a jealous rodger followed them to their car and splashed coffee on them. It made him realize he \" was capable of killing them. \" he later splashed iced tea and coffee on another couple and a pair of women, and then took his liquid-based aggression a step further, by shooting up a kickball game with a super-soaker full of orange juice. In a more serious incident, he tried to shove girls off a 10-foot ledge at a party — but wound up falling off himself and breaking his leg instead. You can read the full timeline of his leadup, complete with sickening quotes, at cnn.

The suspect had been arrested for public drunkenness the previous night and was required to pay eight dollars and fifty cents before he could be released from jail.

He's now suffered what the bangor daily news describes as a \" devastating blow \" to his business: a water main burst near the store, which he'd opened about a year ago, flooding its basement with at least six feet of water and ruining about 90 % of his stock. He says there was no time to save anything, telling wgme, \" i would have drowned in the water. \" among the washed-out king items: seven original typed manuscripts, dozens of first- and limited-edition books, foreign-language prints, signed tomes, and other hard-to-find ephemera. Some items were so rare they weren't even for sale — he simply kept them on display for his customers. \" you can't replace this stuff, \" he tells the daily news. On his store's website, winters describes how he first became a \" constant reader, \" as king would put it, of king's work after a friend lent him the stand in 1998. \" i was hooked after that, \" he says. He details his meticulous gathering of anything king-related over the next 20 years, in which he \" would visit every single bookstore in every city i visited and lived. \" king himself is distressed about the news. \" i ' m horrified, \" he tells the daily news. \" as a book lover, my heart goes out to him. \" he also said he'd see if he could help winters. In the meantime, winters has been avoiding phone calls from customers, family, and even his wife, who still lives abroad. \" i don't even want to talk to them, because i don't know what to tell them, \" he says. \" it's a mess. \"",

One good friend would always have a book with her, or within five feet, at all times. They were monumental in size and i couldn't understand how your attention could be captivated for its entirety.

The va investigation began in 2015 when it started receiving complaints from those who called for help and were put in telephone limbo. In one case, a suicidal florida vet told a local news station he was put on hold over and over, up to 10 minutes at a time, per the military times. Altogether, the report found the backup center had transferred nearly two dozen current service members, veterans, or family members to voicemail. And the reason calls weren't returned? backup center staff said they didn't know they had a voicemail system. The va has already started to remedy the issues — including more staff at peak times and upgrading its phone system — and says it will implement other suggested changes by sept. 30.

            "The new poster for star wars: the force awakens was released sunday morning and it had fans freaking out! aside from reminding moviegoers that the release date of the new star wars film is fast approaching, the poster goes to great lengths to capitalize on the franchise's rich history and attract the loyalty of new enthusiasts of the film franchise as well as fans of the original films.

The movement started with a small strike in new york city last year, and has ballooned since, with an august edition hitting 60 cities — though the ap notes that in many of those places only a few people actually showed up. But this time the strikes come as the living wage issue is heating up. \" i think there's growing recognition that a nerve has been touched, \" the head of the service employees international union tells the new york times. \" this isn't going to blow over. \" here's how that debate is shaking out: fifty-three democratic congressman sent a letter to executives at mcdonald's, wendy's, burger king, domino's, and yum! brands yesterday calling on them to increase wages, bloomberg reports. President obama himself jumped into the fray in a speech yesterday, saying that fast food employees \" work their tails off and are still living barely above poverty. \" he also tackled the idea that this was a racial issue, in some of his first comments on race since the trayvon martin shooting, politico observes. \" the opportunity gap in america is now as much about class as it is about race, \" he said. \" the gap in test scored between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between white kids and black kids. \" obama said he'd support raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour. But protesters and the labor organizations backing them are pushing for a more dramatic $ 15 an hour. Some experts worry that number would have drastic effects on prices and hiring. \" it might lead to the substitution of automation for workers, \" says one professor who's been a vocal advocate for wage bumps. He estimates that the price of a $ 3 hamburger would jump to $ 3.50 or $ 3.60. The industry is dismissing the movement. The national restaurant association calls it a \" coordinated pr campaign engineered by national labor groups, \" while mcdonald's contends that the demonstrations were not strikes, but staged protests from outside groups, cnn reports. But some workers undoubtedly are striking. \" i ' m tired of working for $ 7.25, \" one milwaukee mother and popeye's employee tells the nation. \" we've been busting our butts and we finally want a raise, \" agreed a charleston bojangles ' worker. \" i ' m glad to be one of",

        "summary": "New fossil evidence dug up in namibia lends credence to the theory that we should blame \" ecosystem engineers \" for the world's first mass extinction, and that's not a euphemism for man, asteroids, or aliens. Instead, per a vanderbilt university study published in the october issue of the palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, and palaeoecology journal, the end of the era of ediacara biota ( early multi-celled, soft-shelled creatures ) brought about 540 million years ago was likely to blame on the metazoans, the earliest animals that started to proliferate during a \" short \" 30-million-year stage known as the cambrian explosion. The washington post describes these early animals as \" utterly weird \" creatures that were often \" little more than pipes or fleshy bags glued to the seafloor \" ( some scientists have compared them to \" frisbees or even lumpy mattresses \" ) and that often didn't move, much like sea coral today. But they may have wreaked enough ancient havoc to cause major damage to the ediacarans, possibly wiping them out completely. \" these new species … changed the environment in ways that made it more and more difficult for the ediacarans to survive, \" study lead author simon darroch says in a release. Darroch and his team say they found a well-kept group of fossils of both ediacarans and metazoans, suggesting an \" ecological association \" between the two, though it apparently wasn't one that ended well for the ediacarans: in a 2015 study, darroch's team found evidence of \" stressed-looking \" ediacarans near animal burrows, with evidence of \" the last of the ediacara biota clinging on for grim death. \" the ediacarans are long gone, but darroch warns history has the potential to repeat itself. \" there is a powerful analogy between the earth's first mass extinction and what is happening today, \" he says. \" the end-ediacaran extinction shows that the evolution of new behaviors can fundamentally change the entire planet, and today we humans are the most powerful ' ecosystems engineers ' ever known. \" ( to wit: our own extinction may be next. )",

One clue it's a fake story: the israeli official quoted is named as defense minister yoshe ma ' alon, but he left the post months ago. However, this did not deter pakistani defense chief khawaja mohammad asif, who responded to the fake nuclear threat with a tweet that sounds uncomfortably close to a real one: \"israeli def min threatens nuclear retaliation presuming pak role in syria against daesh. Israel forgets pakistan is a nuclear state too. \" israel's defense ministry tweeted back that the story is \" entirely false, \" reports the new york times. Pakistan hasn't yet responded. This, however, isn't asif's first threat regarding his country's nuclear arsenal.

He was named as a defendant in a lawsuit the chain filed after meadow's family filed a suit of its own, accusing target of not providing enough security.

They went in to hold him until police arrived, but walls grabbed the girl when they confronted him. Last year, walls was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison by a judge who criticized target for suing turner, cbs pittsburgh reports. Judge donna jo mcdaniel said she considers turner and his friends heroes who saved the girl's life, and she thinks target is suing to make the meadows family back down.

The judge was also critical of target's naming michael turner as a defendant in a lawsuit claiming he helped cause the attack by bringing the encounter with walls into the store from outside.

            "Pittsburgh ( kdka ) – leon walls was sentenced to 10 to 20 years for his role in an east liberty target stabbing in 2013. Allegheny county judge donna jo mcdaniel recommended a long term mental health facility, but criticized the mental health aspects of pennsylvania's criminal justice system, saying she doesn't believe there is an appropriate mental health facility that can house him long-term. The judge was also critical of target's naming michael turner as a defendant in a lawsuit claiming he helped cause the attack by bringing the encounter with walls into the store from outside. Judge mcdaniel said turner and others helped save the teenaged stabbing victim's life and are heroes in her eyes.

Keneally charges $ 40 an hour to do anything from cook a meal to sew buttons, reports a sponsored piece in the bushwick daily that notes she's a mom, not a maid — so she won't clean your apartment. So why not just use one's own mother's ( presumably free ) services? keneally says what she is offering is for those in need of a mom, just not their mom — a mom, she writes on her site, who will \" make that pecan pie that you really really love \" but won't \" question your lifestyle choice \" or \" compare you to your sister maggie or your cousin jake. \" keneally adds that she offers \" an understanding of what the world is like for younger people living here that parents in dubuque, iowa, might not have. \" the \" younger people \" part is key: keneally's services really are for millennials, and she says she's declined requests from people in their 40s and up. Even with just her handful of clients, she's already getting calls from talent and production agencies who want to turn it into reality tv. Just like a sage mother would advise, however, she says she isn't rushing into anything. ( this guy waits in line for a living. )",
