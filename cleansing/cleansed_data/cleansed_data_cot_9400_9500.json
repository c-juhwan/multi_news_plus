The organization says its 379 member clinics performed a total of 165,172 procedures in 2012, resulting in the birth of 61,740 babies — an all-time high, and 1.5 % of total births, reports the los angeles times. The rising percentage of ivf births reflects the rising average age at which women give birth, reuters notes. The clinics reported that they were making progress in reducing multiple births by persuading couples to transfer fewer embryos per cycle. Among women under 35, a single embryo was transferred around 15 % of the time, and twins were the result of around 30 % of treatments. Triplets or higher multiples were the result around 1 % of the time.",

Sart's 379 member clinics, which represent more than 90 percent of the infertility clinics in the country, reported that in 2012 they performed 165,172 procedures involving in vitro fertilization ( ivf ), in which an egg from the mother-to-be or a donor is fertilized in a lab dish.

The average age of first-time mothers is now about 26 years; it was 21.4 years in 1970.

            "Media caption a sea lion pup was rescued from a san diego restaurant a hungry sea lion has been rescued after finding its way into a restaurant in the us city of san diego. Staff found the eight-month-old female pup, which was severely underweight and dehydrated, asleep in a booth. The pup was taken to seaworld's animal rescue centre, where it is hoped she will recover. Experts say sea lion mortality is rising because their food supply has been hit by high ocean temperatures linked to the el nino weather pattern. Chef bernard guillas said the sea lion had got into the marine room restaurant through the back door after making her way up from the beach next to the building. \" she said ' can i see the menu? ' i asked if she had a reservation, \" said the chef, whose photos of the pup were widely shared on social media. Staff at seaworld treated the pup to a big meal after her rescue.",

        "summary": "The fbi is finally on the case: the agency is revamping its data-collection system to more accurately portray how many deaths come at the hands of police officers each year, the guardian reports, giving itself a pat on the back as part of the impetus behind the initiative. Officials say the new system, which will be in place by 2017, will publish stats on encounters that cause death or serious injury to civilians using blunt weapons, stun guns, and physical force, per the washington post. Senior fbi official stephen fischer concedes to the guardian that the agency had \" identified a need for more robust and complete information about encounters between law enforcement officers and citizens that result in a use of force. \" in october, fbi chief james comey had called it \" ridiculous, \" \" embarrassing, \" and \" unacceptable \" that papers like the guardian and the washington post had more comprehensive statistics on these violent encounters than his own agency. Although the fbi posts annual figures from the country's 18,000-plus law enforcement agencies for \" justifiable homicides, \" it's an honor system: police departments aren't required to report how many people were killed by cops, the guardian notes. This can cause issues when highly populated states like new york and florida provide incomplete data or sometimes none at all, the wall street journal has noted. Fischer notes to the guardian that the fbi will also start publishing \" such details as age, sex, and race of the officers and subjects \" and the circumstances surrounding each incident — info it's been collecting for years but never published with the annual figures. \" frankly, i ' m glad to see the fbi … catching up to what the people have been demanding for a long time, \" a member of an obama task force on modern policing tells the guardian. Not that the system will be perfect: the post notes that reporting will still be voluntary, as the fbi can't legally force departments to do so. ( the feds are now probing the chicago pd. )",

The results — presented tuesday at the australian psychological society congress and to be published in the european journal of psychology — find that of 261 high-level us execs in the supply chain management arena, 21 % had \" clinically significant levels \" of psychopathic traits, including a lack of empathy and egocentrism, per becker's hospital review.

Brooks tells abc.net.au that his team looked at around 1,000 top executives, but it was the supply chain management group that was the \" most interesting, \" with those ceos seeming to be able to robotically make decisions in the best interest of the company. \" ruthlessness is a big [ trait ], \" brooks says, per becker's. \" they're very calculated. \" so how do these types of people end up in such high positions in the first place? brooks says that when companies recruit, they're often hyperfocused on skills, not personality — and the \" chaos \" the new bosses cause often comes to light only after they've started. Brooks says he's working on a tool that will help companies weed out candidates with psychopathic tendencies, including a closer look at their problem-solving skills, followed up by a probation period to see how well they play with others.

            "Paul aker, arrested for student loan. Photo via fox 26 ( screen capture ) there are 94 u.s. Marshals that serve at the pleasure of the president and the attorney general. They typically spend their days executing warrants on federal criminals, conducting domestic and international fugitive investigations, implementing extraditions and deportations of fugitives, protecting witnesses in federal cases or judges and are generally involved in the worst of the worst federal crimes. However, now it seems the u.s. Marshal service is arresting people for not paying their student loans. According to fox 26 in houston, paul aker says 7 people in full combat gear showed up at his house and he was arrested for a $ 1,500 federal student loan that he took out in 1987. That year the average student loan debt was under $ 10,000. To put that in context, the average student loan debt in 2015 was $ 35,000. So, $ 1,500 seems like a joke to dispatch a federal marshal much less a full team of combat-ready police. Still, aker was taken to court and set up on a monthly payment plan to ensure the government got it's $ 1500 back from the 29-year-old student loan. It is still unclear why federal time and money is being spent to go after loans like this but texas congressman gene green told the station that debt collectors are managing to get judgments in federal court for them. Aker wasn't the first, nor the last. There have been 1200-1500 people in the houston area alone who have been hauled into federal court for not making payments on their student loans. This while fortune 500 companies would owe as much as $ 600 billion in taxes if they didn't hide their money in offshore accounts. Check out the full report below:"

The suggestion, first reported in the us press, was that they were planning a series of \" commando-style \" attacks, something european security agencies have feared since the co-ordinated killings in mumbai two years ago in which 174 people died.

        "summary": "More details have emerged about kalamazoo mass shooting suspect jason dalton — but none explain what could have driven him to kill six people in a saturday night rampage, apparently picking up fares as an uber driver between murders. Neighbors in rural michigan tell the detroit free press that the 45-year-old is an insurance adjuster and \" nice guy \" who lives with his wife and two children, ages 15 and 10. Neighbors say he loved cars and worked part-time as a mechanic. They say he bought a gun after his tools were stolen. \" we knew he had a gun. I think he had it just for protection. He wasn't a hunter or anything like that, but i know he liked guns, \" a neighbor says. Other developments: police say the death toll was thought to be seven until a 14-year-old girl who had been pronounced dead squeezed her mother's hand, mlive.com reports. The girl, who had been placed on life support for organ donation, is still in extremely critical condition, but authorities are hopeful. \" the only word to describe it is wow, \" a michigan state police spokesman says. \" it's absolutely a miracle that she's alive and we're definitely hopeful for her continued improvement. \" there's nothing to connect the three groups of victims to each other or to dalton, nbc news reports. Police say the first was a woman shot and injured outside an apartment building at 5: 42pm. Four hours later, richard smith, 53, and his 17-year-old son, tyler, were shot dead at a car dealership 15 miles away. Soon after, mary jo nye, 60, dorothy brown, 74, barbara hawthorne, 68, and mary lou nye, 62, were shot dead in a cracker barrel parking lot and a 14-year-old girl was injured. They were on their way home from a play. Dalton was arrested without incident early sunday; he's expected to appear in court monday, the ap reports. Authorities say a semi-automatic handgun was in his car and the killings had \" no rhyme, no reason. \" he was in contact with at least one person during the rampage, but authorities do not expect to charge anybody else. \" we just can't figure out the motive, \" kalamazoo public safety chief jeff hadley says, per cnn. \" there's nothing that gives us any indication as to... What would have triggered this. \" uber has confirmed that dalton drove for the company, though they haven't said whether he was driving for them saturday night, the ap reports. In a",

Npr reports researchers sampled dozens of college freshmen and sophomores to figure out what time of day was best for their brain performance. While most colleges have classes that start at 8am, the study found classes shouldn't start until after 11am to foster the best learning in students, according to a press release. While it's not the same for everyone, people in their teens and early 20s typically have a different biological clock than their elders. \" it's like making an adult wake up at 5am every single day, \" researcher jonathan kelley tells npr. \" it is just not a good idea. \" the study shows colleges need to offer more afternoon and evening classes, but it's not so simple as pushing everything later due to students'different \" chronotypes, \" quartz reports. The study found a two-to-one ratio of \" night owls \" to \" early birds. \" but that's still a lot of morning people. One solution is offering more online classes that allow students to start whenever they're best ready to learn.

It upheld a march ruling from a maryland district court, which found the president's travel ban violated the equal protection clause of the constitution, the guardian reports. The next stop for the travel ban, which is also being contested in the 9th circuit court of appeals, is likely the supreme court. The 4th circuit court of appeals states it was \" unconvinced \" trump's travel ban \" has more to do with national security than it does with effectuating the president's proposed muslim ban. \" cnn has the full text of the ruling. While the white house has said the ban is needed to keep the country safe, trump's own statements have given reason to believe the ban is meant to target muslims. For example, the president's campaign website once advocated a \" total and complete shutdown \" of muslims entering the us. The judges ruled trump's past statements should be considered in regard to the proposed ban. They also stated the president's power to control who enters the country is \" broad \" but not \" absolute. \"",

In a rare move, the court had granted a full hearing earlier in the month, meaning 13 judges had heard arguments. The ruling was a 10-3 majority. The revised ban has also been blocked with an even broader injunction by a federal court in hawaii, meaning the administration has been fighting in two separate appeals courts. As the ninth circuit has yet to rule on the hawaii decision, even if the fourth circuit had ruled in favour of the trump administration the president would not have been able to implement the ban. Trump has previously vowed to fight the case to the end. Trump's revised order, which temporarily barred new visas from libya, somalia, sudan, iran, yemen",

Researchers investigated dna from 5,309 adults, focusing on telomeres, the caps on the ends of our cells ' chromosomes, time reports. They found that drinking sugary soda was associated with shorter telomeres — and it's known that telomere length may be linked to life span, according to a university of california-san francisco report. Shorter telomeres also appear to be linked to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In the study, a daily 20-ounce soda was associated with an extra 4.6 years of aging — the same figure seen in smokers. About 21 % of subjects said they drank that much soda daily, while the average intake was 12 ounces. Researchers also looked at the effects of diet soda and fruit juice on telomeres; while \" 100 % fruit juice was marginally associated with longer telomeres, \" they write in the american journal of public health, diet sodas and non-carbonated \" sugar-sweetened beverages \" weren't associated with telomere length. Still, the study points to the dangers of soda beyond its role in obesity. \" the extremely high dose of sugar that we can put into our body within seconds by drinking sugared beverages is uniquely toxic to metabolism, \" says a study author.

The findings were reported online oct. 16 in the american journal of public health. The length of telomeres within white blood cells – where it can most easily be measured – has previously been associated with human lifespan. Short telomeres also have been associated with the development of chronic diseases of aging, including heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer. \"regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence disease development, not only by straining the body's metabolic control of sugars, but also through accelerated cellular aging of tissues, \" said elissa epel, phd, professor of psychiatry at ucsf and senior author of the study. \"this is the first demonstration that soda is associated with telomere shortness, \" epel said. \"this finding held regardless of age, race, income and education level.

        "summary": "\" mayhem \" in ukraine, declares the new york times, amid reports that anti-government protests have boiled over in kiev's bloodiest day since president viktor yanukovich turned down an eu deal in november. Nineteen were killed in street clashes, including six policemen, reports the bbc, and details are a bit chaotic. Reuters reports the two felled officers were killed by gunfire. However, it's unclear whether police are using live ammunition or rubber bullets; protesters were spotted with guns, but not witnessed using them. Riot police then attempted to blaze a path through the stone barriers cordoning off independence square using two armored personnel carriers, as protesters lobbed rocks, fireworks, and petrol bombs; those vehicles got stuck and erupted in flames with police still inside. Unrest is also spreading to western ukraine, where protesters have attacked police and government offices in several regions, cnn reports. Yanukovich is meeting with the opposition in kiev as ukraine's former foreign minister urges the us and eu to support the opposition, and leaders in the ukrainian republic of crimea are telling the president to crack down with \" emergency measures, \" the bbc reports. The times reports that, against that chaotic backdrop, protesters were heard singing the national anthem in the square. The ap reports that a significant portion of their protest camp is now on fire, and says police are moving in using water cannons and stun grenades. The government has brought the subway to a halt to prevent reinforcements from bolstering the number of protesters, who, apparently disheartened by their lack of progress, earlier today left the barricaded area surrounding independence square and marched toward the parliament building to demand that yanukovich give up his \" dictatorial \" powers. But reuters reports they were cut off from the building by a line of trucks, and clashes began. See more photos at the bbc.",

According to ars technica, the buoy was moored nearly 1,000 feet underwater off the coast of northern california before a storm knocked it loose, which is when daniel sherer and patrick anderson of a&s fisheries found it. \" if you lose something in the ocean, it doesn't stay yours forever, it becomes salvaged, \" argues attorney david sherer, who may be — in his own words — an \" old trial dog \" with \" very little \" experience in maritime law, but who is daniel sherer's father. \"it's his rollerskate, and he can sell it to whoever or keep it all he wants, \" the 79-year-old attorney tells the daily beast. The fishermen were originally seeking $ 45,000 for the buoy, which they value at $ 400,000, but have lowered their asking price to $ 13,000. Regardless, the government isn't playing ball. In fact, federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit last friday not only demanding the return of the buoy but also $ 115,000 in damages. The government is accusing the fishermen of holding the buoy \" hostage \" and ruining a federal research project meant to collect data on ocean conditions during el niño, reports courthouse news service. It claims the fishermen's handling of the buoy may have wrecked the buoy's data. Meanwhile, an actual maritime lawyer tells ars technica that maritime law doesn't operate on the principle of finders-keepers. The lawsuit is scheduled to be heard in june.

The harvard extension cultural studies club, in tandem with the ny-based satanic temple, had originally scheduled the event — a parody of the catholic mass — to take place at 8pm on campus. ( the harvard crimson noted they were going to omit the use of a consecrated host. ) but uproar ensued, and while the group made clear that harvard didn't give it the boot, it noted that \" misinterpretations about the nature of the event \" led it to shift the event off-campus, the crimson later reported. Except the group then withdrew its sponsorship after it failed to secure an agreement with a harvard square bar to host the event. But about 50 would-be celebrants, including what the crimson describes as \"four individuals in hoods and one man in a white suit, a cape, and a horned mask \" assembled at nearby chinese restaurant the hong kong around 10pm for what seemed to be a black mass. Harvard president drew faust earlier issued a statement saying that the university would not prohibit the black mass but \" will vigorously protect the right of others to... Address offensive expression with expression of their own. \" she wrote that she would attend a holy hour at st. Paul's church to reaffirm her \" respect for the catholic faith, \" and was joined there by 1,500 others, who marched to the church in a eucharistic procession that began at mit, the boston globe reports.

In a speech today, obama will offer to overhaul the corporate tax code, reducing the rate and reaping a onetime windfall in the process, the wall street journal reports. In exchange, the the white house wants the gop to agree to use that windfall to pay for new jobs programs. Until now, obama has insisted that corporate rate cuts come packaged with reform on individual taxes. It's unclear where this windfall would come from, but many republicans believe it should be spent covering the costs of cutting rates — an idea the administration is rejecting. Obama has previously suggested slashing corporate rates from 35 % to 28 %, while ending certain tax advantages and imposing a minimum tax on foreign earnings to keep things deficit-neutral.

            "Obama: pay gap 'morally wrong ' by peter schroeder - president obama is changing gears on the economy, highlighting income inequality as a growing problem in advance of pitched fall battles with congressional republicans over funding the government and raising the debt ceiling. [ watch video ] the focus is intended to make it easier for obama to argue that new taxes on the rich — and not cuts to social spending — should be imposed to lower the deficit. It also dovetails with obama's call for congress to raise the federal $ 7.25 minimum wage and to end the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. \"this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it's bad economics, \" obama said in remarks last week in galesburg, ill., where he began a new push on the economy. \"the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979-2007, but the typical family's incomes barely budged, \" he said.

The bill consists of a single sentence: \" an alien may not be denied admission to the united states because of the alien's religion or lack of religious beliefs. \" the bill is not expected to get far in the gop-controlled house, though beyer's office says one republican, new york's richard hanna, has agreed to co-sponsor the bill along with 54 democrats. Trump himself appears to be cooling on the ban, the guardian reports. On fox's kilmeade &amp; friends wednesday, trump said the proposal was only a suggestion. \" it's a temporary ban, it hasn't been called for yet, nobody's done it, this is just a suggestion until we find out what's going on, \" he said while discussing newly elected london mayor sadiq khan, who rejected trump's offer to make him an exception to the muslim ban. In india, meanwhile, the ap reports that hard-line hindu protesters in new delhi fully in favor of the ban lit a ritual fire on wednesday, added trump photos to their collection of statues of hindu gods, and prayed that he would become president. \" only donald trump can save humanity, \" said vishnu gupta, founder of the nationalist hindu sena group.

Hoboken mayor dawn zimmer told msnbc today that two top christie staffers said she couldn't have sandy relief funds — unless she agreed to a particular redevelopment project. With hoboken 80 % underwater following the hurricane, zimmer sought $ 127 million in relief cash. So far, the mayor — who hasn't oked the redevelopment plan — has received a $ 142,000 contribution to the cost of one backup generator as well as $ 200,000 in other grants, msnbc reports. The site notes that emails, diary entries, and public records back zimmer's case. Zimmer says lt. Gov. Kim guadagno and community affairs commissioner richard constable were behind the threat. \" it's not fair for the governor to hold sandy funds hostage for the city of hoboken because he wants me to give back to one private developer, \" zimmer said on up w/ steve kornacki. Constable's department calls the allegation \" categorically false, \" the star-ledger reports, while a christie rep notes zimmer's previous praise of the governor: \" what or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess. \" zimmer's reply: \" i'd be more than willing to testify under oath and answer any questions and provide any documents, take a lie detector test. \"",

But investigators never believed him, and he ultimately pleaded guilty to all three murders. \" you monster. You thought you would get away with this, \" watts ' father-in-law said at the sentencing hearing, per the denver post. \" you carried them out of the house like trash. You buried my daughter shannan and nico [ the couple's unborn baby boy ] in a shallow grave and then you put bella and cece in containers of crude oil. \" \" this is perhaps the most inhumane and vicious crime i have handled out the thousands of cases i have seen, \" said the judge before delivering the sentence. Watts, 33, pleaded guilty to avoid a death sentence; he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for each of the murders plus 48 years for unlawful termination of a pregnancy and 12 years for tampering with the bodies, the greeley tribune reports. His parents also spoke at the hearing, telling him they forgave him but struggled to understand what he had done. \" we still don't have the answers, \" said a statement from watts ' father, read by his attorney. \" i hope one day, christopher, you can help us. \" watts ' own attorney described him as \" devastated \" and \" sincerely sorry. \" ( the woman watts was dating when he murdered his family says he lied about everything. )",

Jason suffered a broken nose and needed stitches, but the situation worsened unexpectedly the following monday.

He was taken to the hospital ( see an image here ), where a ct scan revealed a fracture more severe than originally thought, per the atlanta journal-constitution. He had surgery to repair the fracture last monday, but the following day doctors realized that the fracture had severed an artery. Unable to control the bleeding, they eventually put jason in a \" paralytic state. \" the teen had more surgery sunday night and was to have another operation this week.

As the afp reports, a \" superhuman \" effort is under way to ready the banks in time, per the central bank governor. He made the comment yesterday, and not exactly to cheers: some 200 employees of bank of cyprus, the country's largest lender, protested outside his office, clamoring for his resignation. One head that did roll, according to the bbc: the bank's chief executive, yiannis kypri, who was reportedly fired this morning. Meanwhile, authorities are scrambling to put in place capital controls designed to prevent a bank run. The ap spoke with an anonymous banking official who shared some of the as-yet unannounced details: the controls will likely be in place for a week, he says, though the finance minister yesterday described the time frame as \" a matter of weeks, \" and bloomberg predicts they could persist for years, as they have in iceland. While huge money transfers will not be permitted, some easing is expected; daily withdrawal limits may rise from $ 130 to $ 386, and payroll payments will get the green light. As for the still undefined levies, the wall street journal shares the latest: large bank of cyprus depositors are still rumored to be looking at a 40 % cut; the largest deposit holders at no. 2 bank cyprus popular ( also called laiki ), which is to be shut down, may only be able to recoup 20 % of their funds — and it could take several years to do so.",

She was wearing nothing underneath. \"i totally forgot, \" graf said sheepishly through a translator. \"we have very good suits and they are very tight. … you just want to breathe and you want to take off your suit. \" when she realized her faux pas, graf quickly zipped the suit back up with a mortified smile. \"only afterward, \" she said, \"did i realize that maybe this video will appear on youtube.

Right now, however, researchers are showing off the technique using a model plane. It works by pulling carbon dioxide and hydrogen from water using a catalytic converter, discover explains. Those gases are turned into a liquid hydrocarbon fuel that could, experts hope, power both planes and ships, afp reports. \" we don't necessarily go to a gas station to get our fuel, \" vice admiral philip cullom tells afp. \" our gas station comes to us in terms of an oiler, a replenishment ship.

            "Washington ( afp ) - the us navy believes it has finally worked out the solution to a problem that has intrigued scientists for decades: how to take seawater and use it as fuel. The development of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel is being hailed as \" a game-changer \" because it would signficantly shorten the supply chain, a weak link that makes any force easier to attack. The us has a fleet of 15 military oil tankers, and only aircraft carriers and some submarines are equipped with nuclear propulsion. All other vessels must frequently abandon their mission for a few hours to navigate in parallel with the tanker, a delicate operation, especially in bad weather. The ultimate goal is to eventually get away from the dependence on oil altogether, which would also mean the navy is no longer hostage to potential shortages of oil or fluctuations in its cost.

            "Washington ( afp ) - the us navy believes it has finally worked out the solution to a problem that has intrigued scientists for decades: how to take seawater and use it as fuel. The development of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel is being hailed as \" a game-changer \" because it would signficantly shorten the supply chain, a weak link that makes any force easier to attack. The us has a fleet of 15 military oil tankers, and only aircraft carriers and some submarines are equipped with nuclear propulsion. All other vessels must frequently abandon their mission for a few hours to navigate in parallel with the tanker, a delicate operation, especially in bad weather. The ultimate goal is to eventually get away from the dependence on oil altogether, which would also mean the navy is no longer hostage to potential shortages of oil or fluctuations in its cost. Vice admiral philip cullom declared: \" it's a huge milestone for us. \" view gallery dr. Heather willauer explains how scientists at the naval research laboratory in washington, dc can … \" we are in very challenging times where we really do have to think in pretty innovative ways to look at how we create energy, how we value energy and how we consume it. \" we need to challenge the results of the assumptions that are the result of the last six",

        "summary": "Ever wonder why getting to your destination seems to take forever, but the return trip passes in a flash? japanese researchers this week shed light on the phenomenon. Writing in plos one, the team notes that \" studies on the return trip effect have failed to confirm its existence in a situation that is ecologically valid in terms of environment and duration. \" so they dug into the \" return trip effect \" by asking 20 men, ages 20 to 30, to watch two point-of-view movies, about 26 minutes long, featuring either an outbound and return walking trip, or two one-way walking trips on city streets. The men had to verbally state each time they thought a three-minute interval had passed; afterward, they were asked to rate the films ' length on an 11-point scale, with -5 indicating the first was a lot longer, and +5 indicating the second was far lengthier. Participants didn't experience the trips any differently during the films. Afterward, however, those who'd witnessed the round-trips \" consistently \" found the return leg to be shorter, vox reports. \" the return trip effect is not a matter of measuring time itself. Rather, it depends on time judgment based on memory, \" ryosuke ozawa tells the los angeles times. Vox points to research that shows our brains track the passage of time using two systems, one mathematical and one language-based, with the latter creating \" stories \" about the timing of events we've experienced. As vox puts it, \" it appears this second system was the one fooled by the return trip effect. \" the researchers echo this, writing the results indicate \" that the return trip effect does not affect the timing mechanism itself, but rather our feeling of time postdictively. \" ( when it comes to walking, how you do it can change your mood. )",

At first, other users appeared unsure whether the twitching robot was some sort of glitch or prank, motherboard reports. But a recording of the incident by youtube user rogue shadow vr shows most of the users gradually realizing the user behind the robot, who was apparently utilizing full-body tracking, was having a genuine medical emergency. Audio picked up the user struggling to breathe. \" there was nothing we could do, \" rogue shadow vr says. \"we didn't even know what part of the planet this person lived on. \" video of the chat shows avatars gathering around the robot while asking if he's ok and what they should do. When the robot becomes responsive — the user has since recovered — other users implore him to \" be safe \" and call for help. Motherboard notes the compassion on display was surprising as vrchat is \" kind of a shithole, where users harass each other and scream about incoherent, often racist memes. \" \"it was definitely interesting to see the way people could come together and show concern for somebody they don't know, \" rogue shadow vr says. While it's unclear what caused the seizure, vr companies warn users to take regular breaks and consult a doctor if they have medical issues.",

According to jeffrey reinhardt's $ 49,000 lawsuit, he suffered a compressed disc and tears to his back and neck muscles after being bashed by the suitcase on the january 2013 flight from portland, ore., to las vegas, fox reports. Reinhardt, who says the suitcase fell after a flight attendant came over to help the passenger, is seeking $ 10,000 for medical bills, $ 5,000 for lost income, and $ 34,000 for pain and suffering. Reinhardt's suit holds the airline responsible for allowing the passenger to bring the oversized suitcase on board and for failing to train the flight attendant on putting luggage in the overhead bins, although he isn't seeking damages from his fellow passenger, reports the oregonian. A 1998 study found that baggage falling from overhead bins injures around 4,500 passengers every year, reports mashable, which notes that while lawsuits aren't that common, there is apparently at least one lawyer out there specializing in \" overhead bin malfunctions. \" ( another flier managed to get her lost luggage back recently — after 20 years. )",

Another previous victim describes her experience to the times: when she went out back, men wearing black caps over their faces asked her, at gunpoint, where \" the money \" was, she says. Her family lost tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of gold. Many indian-americans live in the area, and thefts have previously occurred — but in those cases, the homes weren't occupied. The recent cases involve robbery at gunpoint. Locals have been frustrated with police, who haven't confirmed whether the latest crimes are linked, the times reports ( cbs notes that officials do say it's possible ). \" the first, second, third home invasion, ok, you don't think it's a pattern, \" says an activist. \" but after the third, you agree it is a pattern, but yet you don't want to talk to the press? \" an official has, however, gone on tv to warn indian-americans to keep their homes safe, and police as well as the fbi are investigating.",

In this case, the parachute was attached to the plane, not a human, reports the arkansas democrat gazette. The drama unfolded tuesday morning after former walmart ceo bill simon ran into trouble with his small plane, a cirrus sr-22, soon after taking off from bentonville, ark. Simon tried to make it to a nearby air field, but realized he wasn't going to make it. \" i ' m going to need an all-crash here. We're going to try to find a place over here that's clear, \" simon says in air traffic control recordings, per cbs news. That's when he deployed the plane's parachute and descended onto a stretch of road. He clipped a pickup near the ground, but all three people on the plane and the three in the truck escaped with minor injuries. \" they were losing altitude... So they popped the emergency chute on the plane, which brought them down slowly, \" says craig sout of the fayetteville police. A parachute on a plane? as it turns out, they're standard on cirrus aircraft, explains james fallows at the atlantic, who bought one himself. Veteran pilots scoffed at the \" training wheels \" when the chutes first came out 15 years ago, but the simple fact is that they save lives, he writes. \" small-aircraft flight is perilous, \" he adds. \" and the parachutes make it less so. \"",

Did the bacteria dodge the antibiotics and infiltrate the body's nervous system? maybe the lyme triggered a different illness? should patients stay on antibiotics long-term? most specialists thinks the latter is a bad idea for a host of reasons, but it's the only relief for some patients, including the woman featured in the globe story. If lyme sounds awful, it's nothing compared to the emerging threat of the powassan virus. It is rarer — about 6 % of ticks in new york's hudson valley were found to carry it in a recent study, compared to about 50 % for lyme — but far more lethal, reports the poughkeepsie journal. About a third of those afflicted die. Last week, sen. Chuck schumer called on the cdc to launch a study of powassan and to expand research into all tick-borne diseases. At livescience, robin diamond writes that such research can't come soon enough. Doctors for too long have resorted to a \" knee-jerk diagnosis \" of lyme, often to their patients'detriment, but the new studies show that we need a much broader view of \" all the illnesses tiny ticks can carry, the big problems they can create, and what doctors and patients can do to stem the tide. \"",

            "The department of defense \" has no legal authority \" to use appropriated funds for president donald trump's border wall between the u.s. And mexico, two democratic senators wrote in a letter to defense secretary james mattis. \" until we can have a wall and proper security we're going to be guarding our border with the military, \" trump said monday at the white house. \" that's a big step. \" trump originally floated the idea of the military paying for the wall over twitter and in a discussion with mattis late last month. \" such a controversial move could only be funded by cutting other vital priorities for our service members, mere weeks after the department communicated its needs to the senate defense appropriations subcommittee during omnibus appropriation negotiations, \" democratic sens. Jack reed and dick durbin wrote. \" we conclude that the department of defense has no legal authority, with or without a reprogramming request, to use appropriated funds for the construction of a border wall. \" the letter from reed, of rhode island, and durbin, of illinois, comes on the heels of reports that trump suggested the ideato \" several advisors \" after being disappointed by the amount of money allocated for border security in the $ 1.3 trillion omnibus. Dana white, the pentagon's chief spokesperson, confirmed last week that mattis had \" initial \" talks with trump about diverting a portion of the dod's budget to construct a wall on the border. The pentagon did not immediately respond to cnbc's request for comment. Congress would have to appropriate the money to make it work — a notion sen. Tim scott, r-s.c., touched on over the weekend. Scott said that congress would \" absolutely \" need to weigh in on reprogramming defense funds to the border wall. \" the reality of it is, as commander-in-chief, he can certainly send signals through secretary mattis, have a conversation with congress about where those dollars should be spent, \" scott said told cbs ' \" face the nation \" on sunday."

Dalelv says she was on a work trip in dubai and had been drinking with colleagues at a bar. She asked a male colleague to escort her back to her hotel room for safety reasons, but she says the man instead led her to his room, where he pulled her inside and raped her. Dalelv called the cops the next day, and was taken to a police station. But there, she says, the officers didn't believe her. \" they asked me, ' are you sure you called the police because you just didn't like it? ' i said, ' well of course i didn't like it, ' \" she says. They kept her in jail for four days without explanation. When she was informed of the charges for sex and drinking, a manager told her to say the sex was voluntary, and the charges would disappear. Instead, the cops added a new charge: making a false statement. Dalelv remains out of prison while an appeal is pending.

Japanese researchers who analyzed drawings going back 40,000 years think prehistoric artists were high on hallucinogenic drugs, reports live science.

In fact, modern humans under hallucinogens produce similar psychedelic images.

Wreckage from the globemaster aircraft was found near mount gannett in 2012 after having spent decades buried under the ice of colony glacier, and pow/mia teams have scoured the area for remains of the 52 people who were on board. The remains that investigators have managed to identify will be returned to their families for burial with full military honors, reports fox news. The first burial will be that of pvt. Leonard kittle, who will be laid to rest in his hometown in kansas on saturday. His younger sister, 82-year-old beatrice crawford, says the military declared everybody on board dead a week after the crash. \" they told us that they were no longer with us, that they'd given up the hunting, \" she tells the new york times; bad weather stymied immediate recover efforts, and the wreckage was later ided as the c-124 globemaster. Military officials say that 35 service members have yet to be recovered, and the site will be monitored to see if the glacier gives up any more remains, the ap reports. At the time of the crash, the ap reported that the plane exploded and disintegrated over as many as three acres; a compass, a survival kit, and a hockey puck were among the other items recovered at the scene.

In fact, despite demonstrations and a slew of online petitions ( like this, this, and this ) aimed at getting nestlé to stop what it's doing, the company would, in a perfect world, boost the 700 million gallons of water it now uses. \" if i could increase it, i would, \" says tim brown, who heads nestlé waters north america, in an interview with radio station kpcc. \" the fact is, if i stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water. We feel good about what we're doing, delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of california, \" he said, per the guardian. ( in the same interview, nasa jpl's top water scientist points out that bottling water requires as much as 50 % more water than turning on the tap. ) brown says nestlé wastes some 30 % of the groundwater it draws from the state, but the company this week announced plans to cut that figure by 12 % at its bakersfield and tulare bottling facilities — two of five in the state — for a savings of 26 million gallons. That isn't nearly enough to help combat \" the worst drought we've seen in a long time, \" says charity food &amp; water watch. \" it's irresponsible of the state to allow nestlé to bottle water that's supposed to be a public resource, \" a rep says. \" we're calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit. \" in an editorial for the san bernardino county sun in late april, brown argued that \" bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought \" and noted that the 700 million gallons nestlé uses \" is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two california golf courses. \" ( another big company is similarly under fire. )",

That proof? the axes and scrapers used there 500,000 years ago still had residue of animal fat on them — a find that haaretz describes as an \" archaeological first. \" it also appears that the fat in question came from one of the biggest animals of all: researchers at the site known as revadim in southern israel found an elephant rib with cut marks. What's not clear is whether these ancestors hunted the elephants and other game or scavenged remains they happened across, but the discovery shows that people of the age were at least adept at processing the carcasses. \" archaeologists have until now only been able to suggest scenarios about the use and function of such tools, \" a professor at tel aviv university says in a post at eurekalert. \" it makes sense that these tools would be used to break down carcasses, but until evidence was uncovered to prove this, it remained just a theory. \" the find is significant because it dovetails with the idea that humans began eating more meat around this time, reports livescience, itself an important milestone for the species. \" in order to be able to use animal resources, they needed to have tools in order to cut and butcher, \" says the professor. The tools found fit the bill so nicely they remained largely unchanged for many years. ( another intriguing discovery making headlines: an ancient croc called the \" carolina butcher. \" )",

The president-elect made the announcement monday morning, praising the retired neurosurgeon's \" brilliant mind, \" reports politico. \" we have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities, \" said trump. Carson, 65, has never held public office, but he has said his own experience growing up in poverty in detroit would give him insight into this role. In his previous public comments on federal housing, he has criticized the obama administration's efforts as \" social engineering, \" notes the new york times.

According to nbc news, justice department lawyer erez reuveni told a virginia courtroom friday that more than 100,000 visas had been revoked in the week since trump's ban on refugees and visitors from seven muslim countries went into effect. A lawyer for the legal aid justice center says \" you could almost hear the collective gasp in the courtroom. \" the state department later said it was actually fewer than 60,000 visas and that reuveni included expired visas and visas exempt from the order, usa today reports.

Nearly every visa given to someone from iran, syria, iraq, libya, somalia, yemen, and sudan was canceled, whether they were currently in the us or not.

Rick scott is calling on fbi director christopher wray to resign, after the fbi admitted it received a tip about the suspect in the parkland shooting as recently as january, but failed to follow through on it. The fbi admitted in a statement friday that it received a call on jan. 5 detailing concerns about nikolas cruz, the 19-year-old law enforcement officials believe is responsible for the deaths of 17 people at marjory stoneman douglas high school earlier this week. The fbi determined \" protocols were not followed \" when a tip was phoned into the fbi's public access line, but was never forwarded to the fbi's miami field office and received no further investigation. Scott called that \" unacceptable \" in a statement he issued friday. \" the fbi's failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable, \" scott said. \" the fbi has admitted that they were contacted last month by a person who called to inform them of cruz's'desire to kill people, ' and'the potential of him conducting a school shooting.

            "Parkland, fla. ( reuters ) - the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it had failed to act on a tip warning that the man now accused of killing 17 people at a florida high school possessed a gun, the desire to kill and the potential to commit a school shooting. The disclosure sparked angry disbelief from residents of the miami suburb of parkland still reeling from wednesday's massacre, the deadliest shooting ever at a u.s. High school, and led florida's governor to call for the fbi chief to resign. A person described as someone close to accused gunman nikolas cruz, 19, called an fbi tip line on jan. 5, weeks before the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school, to report concerns about him, the federal bureau of investigation said in a statement. \"the caller provided information about cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting, \" it said. That information should have been forwarded to the fbi's miami field office for further investigation, but \"we have determined that these protocols were not followed, \" the agency said. U.s. Attorney general jeff sessions said he has ordered a review of fbi procedures following the shooting, carried out by a gunman armed"

        "summary": "Two men have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the tragic warehouse fire in oakland that claimed the lives of 36 during a concert in december. Ghost ship property manager derick almena and creative director max harris were arrested monday and were each charged with 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter, reports the la times. The alameda county district attorney claims the pair \"knowingly created a fire trap with inadequate means of escape, \" giving concert-goers only one exit on the night of the fire — an illegally constructed staircase. A statement describing the conditions of ghost ship, a warehouse almena used to rent space to artists and organizers, says it was cluttered with flammable materials from \"floor to ceiling, \" including \" carvings, mannequins, paintings, artwork, scraps of wood, pianos, \" but lacked fire suppression equipment. The cause of the fire remains undetermined, and with most forensic evidence burned in the blaze, will likely stay a mystery. In a combative interview on today days after the incident, almena told host matt lauer that the project was intended to build the artistic community, reports ap. \" this is not profit, this is loss, \" he said. \"this is a mass grave. I ' m only here to say one thing, that i am incredibly sorry and that everything i did was to make this a stronger, more beautiful community and to bring people together. \" oakland's mayor celebrated the arrests, saying that the pair deceived city officials and \"deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. \"",

        "summary": "When rick perry goes before a senate panel thursday for his confirmation hearing to be energy secretary, he will surely be asked why he should lead an agency he once promised to eliminate. But a new york times story suggests another line of questioning: it asserts that when he accepted the job, he had little understanding of what the department or its secretary actually did. Perry, the story says, thought the position meant that he would function as a sort of ambassador for the nation's oil and gas industries, unaware that the department's biggest task is maintaining and protecting the us nuclear arsenal. As a counterpoint, a post at new york suggests that the story \" falsely impugns \" perry and lays out arguments from critics making that case, among them that the times doesn't attribute the claim to any source. The times story has this key quote from perry 2016 adviser michael mckenna: \" if you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, ' i want to be an advocate for energy. If you asked him now, he'd say, ' i ' m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex. ' it's been a learning curve. \" but mckenna now tells the daily caller that the newspaper misinterpreted his remarks and that perry \" of course \" understood what his role would be from the start. Meanwhile, another big part of the department's budget is maintaining 17 national labs that perform research on everything from solar panels to dark matter, and npr reports on concern about their fate. A member of the union of concerned scientists voices another worry: \" that a secretary who doesn't fundamentally accept the science of climate change isn't necessarily going to direct the assets of the department of energy towards advancing that mission, \" says ken kimmel.",

Though the secret service has denied reports that agents escorted omarosa from the building tuesday, sources tell the daily beast she caused a \" ruckus \" and was denied a visit with trump before she left. Appearing on good morning america on thursday, omarosa said such reports — and others suggesting chief of staff john kelly limited her access to trump — were the result of \" one person \" with a \" personal vendetta \" against her. But, noting she had to be \" careful \" since her resignation is effective jan. 20, omarosa also said \" there were a lot of things i observed over the past year that i was uncomfortable with \" as an african-american, reports usa today. A longtime friend says omarosa only planned to work for a year as director of communications for the office of public liaison; he notes she was also irked by trump's endorsement of roy moore, per the washington post. Regardless of the reason, however, omarosa's exit \" on the day that black voters helped catapult democrat doug jones to an upset victory in the senate race in alabama \" leaves housing and urban development secretary ben carson as the only black official among trump's senior staffers and highlights \" the stark lack of diversity in trump's administration and the gop's diminishing appeal to minority communities, \" the post reports.
