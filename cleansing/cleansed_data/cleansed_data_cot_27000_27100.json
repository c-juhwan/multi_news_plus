            "When i flew to dublin in early november, the irish government was busy helping the irish people come to terms with their loss. It had been two years since a handful of irish politicians and bankers decided to guarantee all the debts of the country's biggest banks, but the people were only now getting their minds around what that meant for them. The numbers were breathtaking. A single bank, anglo irish, which, two years before, the irish government had claimed was merely suffering from a \"liquidity problem, \" faced losses of up to 34 billion euros. To get some sense of how \"34 billion euros \" sounds to irish ears, an american thinking in dollars needs to multiply it by roughly one hundred: $ 3.4 trillion. And that was for a single bank. As the sum total of loans made by anglo irish, most of it to irish property developers, was only 72 billion euros, the bank had lost nearly half of every dollar it invested. The two other big irish banks, bank of ireland and, especially, allied irish banks ( a.i.b. ), remained ireland's dirty little secrets. Both older than ireland itself ( the bank of ireland was founded back in 1783; a.i.b. Is made up of three banks founded in the 19th century ), both were now also obviously bust. The irish government owned big chunks of the two ancient banks but revealed less about them. As they had lent vast sums not only to irish property developers but also to irish homebuyers, their losses were also obviously vast â€” and similar in spirit to the losses at the upstart anglo irish. Even in an era when capitalists went out of their way to destroy capitalism, the irish bankers set some kind of record for destruction. Theo phanos, a london hedge-fund manager with interests in ireland, says that \"anglo irish was probably the world's worst bank. Even worse than the icelandic banks. \" ireland's financial disaster shared some things with iceland's. It",

After losing a five-year battle to keep her rent from spiking from $ 820 to $ 3,500 per month, adele sarno's little italy home will likely be taken over by her landlord: the italian american museum, which, according to its website, is \" dedicated to the struggles of italian-americans and their achievements and contributions to american culture and society, \" the new york times reports. The irony isn't lost on sarno. \" i was here all my life, \" she tells cbs new york. Of museum founder joseph scelsa, she notes, \" i ' m more the italian one than he is. \" the situation is \" absolute hypocrisy, \" adds the director of an affordable housing group. \" you're fighting a museum that purports to exhibit italian-american culture and then proceeds to evict a living artifact. \" sarno, who has a monthly income of $ 750 and gets assistance from social security and relatives, says she believed her apartment was rent-controlled, but a judge ruled otherwise. She can't afford a rent hike. The museum, which plans to sell sarno's building, said she would need to be out by april 6. Sarno managed to delay the eviction and is to appear in court on april 2. If she's forced to leave, she says she and her 19-year-old cat, tosha, will likely be forced to move in with her daughter in wisconsin. It's a \" beautiful place, but not for me, \" sarno tells dnainfo. \" i ' m a new yorker. \" sarno isn't the museum's only casualty: the nearby il palazzo restaurant was handed an eviction notice last week after a late rent payment in february. It closed its doors yesterday, dnainfo reports. Says the eatery's 71-year-old owner: \" it feels like my heart's ripped out. \"",

The result of secession would be like a divorce â€” the fate of north sea oil, nuclear weapons, scottish debt, the monarchy, and \" union jack \" will have to be debated, the ap adds. The most contentious and critical point of argument has been the pound, which the british treasury says it will not share. As for salmond? \" it's our pound and we're keeping it, \" he says.",

        "summary": "Coming to a dozen tv stations near you, for the next seven weeks: an hour-long film in which former obama supporters talk about their disillusionment with the president. The hope and the change â€” directed by the same guy who made pro-sarah palin film the undefeated â€” debuted at the republican national convention and will start airing on six cable and six broadcast stations tomorrow, politico reports. The movie was actually one of the goals of the controversial citizens united court case, which allowed unlimited corporate campaign donations. The hope and the change \" would have been a criminal act under mccain-feingold before my court case, \" says citizens united president david bossie. A previous film made by bossie, that one focusing on hillary clinton in 2008, was declared a form of electioneering and blocked. This film won't suffer the same fate, thanks to the citizens united court case. And in related news, billionaire investor joe ricketts is moving forward with what the wall street journal calls \" one of the biggest electioneering efforts by an individual in the 2012 election. \" ricketts will spend $ 10 million on pro-romney ads and $ 2 million on ads supporting republican congressional candidates in the last weeks of the campaign. ( you might remember ricketts from his reported jeremiah wright attack plan, which he later rejected. )",

The men in the jeep yelled racial epithets at reat and the others, and one brandished a gun. They also threw bottles and bottle rockets hard enough to break the car's window, according to courthouse news service. Reat and the others made it back to wheat ridge and called 911. Dispatcher juan rodriguez, who has since been fired, told them â€” \"for reasons that remain unclear, \" per the court ruling â€” that they'd have to return to the scene of the crime if they wanted help. \" i said, ' i ' m here at home, this is where i feel safe so please send somebody, ' pal tells the denver channel. \" he said, ' no.

They were standing outside their car when the red jeep came back and opened fire. Reat was shot and killed, and the suspects have still not been identified.

The court ruled reat and the others were free to ignore rodriguez's instructions. \" it cannot be said that any of rodriguez's actions, as foolish as they were, ' limited in some way the liberty of a citizen to act on his own behalf, ' \" the ruling states, per cns.

News out of the fda tuesday, however, wasn't quite as encouraging, with the agency releasing two reports based on its inspections of theranos facilities, the new york times reports. Among key issues are allegations the $ 9 billion-plus firm shipped an unapproved blood-collection tube over state lines and that there were multiple qc issues. Usa today notes the company is also accused of not sufficiently addressing complaints the small containers might obscure blood clotting. The fda's findings were the result of surprise visits in august and september to theranos operations under the agency's authority to regulate medical devices, a source familiar with the situation tells the wall street journal. The reports, which the times concedes are \" heavily redacted \" and \" difficult to interpret, \" outline more than a dozen \" observations \" about flaws in qa processes and accompanying paperwork. The reports also said necessary audits weren't performed and proof wasn't readily available that parts suppliers were up to par. Theranos \" addressed and corrected \" all the fda's issues \" at the time of, or within a week of, the inspection \" and provided proof to the agency, a theranos spokeswoman said in a statement tuesday, via the journal. Still, theranos says it's cooperating with efforts to remedy any remaining issues, though it's been somewhat on the defensive after earlier reports about its struggles. The company says it's stopped using its nanotainer for all but one test until its gets the fda green light ( though the times notes that was only after \" explicit pressure \" from the fda ), and holmes said at a conference this week she'd make her company's data public so it could be validated.",

It was, potentially, al gore's own unwelcome version of \"the blue dress. \" former vice president gore famously had been enraged with the president he served under â€” bill clinton â€” for clinton's dalliance with white house intern monica lewinsky in the 1990s. After clinton's early denials of their sexual relations, lewinsky had given a special prosecutor her blue dress that she said was still stained with clinton's semen. Clinton eventually acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with lewinsky and was impeached by the house of representatives, but completed his second term.

Lynch said that \" none of us have any illusions that reform is easy \" and that \" change will not come overnight \" from the investigation, which is effective immediately, per msnbc.

Money is apparently the root of this problem: cumulus media's move is said to be the result of an impasse it reached with premiere networks over the cost of distribution rights, with the latter refusing to drop that cost to a number cumulus is happy with; premiere is the clear channel arm that syndicates limbaugh and hannity's shows. What does that mean for limbaugh and hannity, who have the no. 1 and no. 2 radio talk shows in america by a landslide? not much, maybe. They'd be wiped from more than 40 major-market cumulus channels, but they'd likely shift to clear channel stations in those markets. And, writing for the week, peter weber thinks limbaugh and hannity \" have the upper hand, \" because if they do move to clear channel, it can't really pay them anything less than it was demanding of cumulus. Politico points out that limbaugh was rumored to have soured on cumulus following a march earnings call in which ceo lew dickey said the company was still losing money because of limbaugh's \" slut \" comments. Sources say cumulus has been talking to other personalities, and will likely fill one of those holes with its current talent.",

A new report finds that between 365 million and 988 million us birds, or as much as 10 % of the country's bird population, die each year after flying into windows. And interestingly, skyscrapers account for less than 1 % of those deaths, science news reports. Buildings from four to 11 stories are biggest culprits, causing about 56 % of the deaths, while one- to three-story buildings cause about 44 % of the deaths. Per building, however, skyscrapers are deadliest, with each one doing in an average 24 birds per year, compared to just a few birds per smaller building. But that's because there are just 21,000 skyscrapers in the country â€” compared to 138 million smaller buildings. Why are windows so dangerous to birds? one reason: birds on long migration flights can be disoriented and confused by artificial lights at night. You can turn your lights off in an effort to help them out, or try bird-thwarting products like hawk stickers on your windows, gawker reports. As for how the window deaths compare to deaths by cat, a study last year found that cats kill as many as 3.7 billion birds per year.",

The biggest share of the deaths comes not from glass massacres at skyscrapers but from occasional collisions with the nation's many small buildings, says scott loss of oklahoma state university in stillwater. \"it's death by a million nicks. \" low-rise buildings four to 11 stories tall account for about 56 percent of deaths in the new estimate, loss and his colleagues report in the february condor: ornithological applications.

And the source of the deaths isn't what you might think. Rather than skyscrapers blocking migratory patterns, it's small buildings that are knocking out more birds. Buildings four to 11 stories tall cause around 56 percent of the avian deaths, with buildings one to three stories tall making up the remaining 44 percent.

        "summary": "Senators who oppose neil gorsuch's nomination to the supreme court might have a little more ammunition to work with this week: both politico and buzzfeed are out with reports suggesting that gorsuch copied other authors without attribution in his writings, particularly in his 1986 book the future of assisted suicide and euthanasia. One quick caveat: the author he's accused of pilfering from in that book defends him. \" i have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar, \" says abigail lawlis kuzma. She says the passages about a 1982 case involving a baby with down syndrome were \" factual, not analytical in nature, \" and \" it would have been awkward and difficult for judge gorsuch to have used different language. \" politico, however, showed the writings in question to six experts and finds disagreement on that. \"i've never seen a plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of, \" says syracuse university professor rebecca moore howard. And an associate law professor at campbell law school says gorsuch's writing would be investigated \" as a potential violation of our plagiarism policy. It's similar enough to the original work. \" both politico and buzzfeed go into depth with comparisons. One example: kuzma, in her indiana law journal article: \"esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula indicates that the esophageal passage from the mouth to the stomach ends in a pouch, with an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. \" gorsuch, in his book: \"esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula means that the esophageal passage from the mouth to the stomach ends in a pouch, with an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. \" the white house is defending gorsuch from what it calls a \" false attack, \" as is national review writer ed whelan: \" surprise, surprise. Another desperate 11th-hour smear, something that appears to have become a rite of passage for republican supreme court nominees. \" the full senate was expected to vote on gorsuch later this week, with republicans poised to exercise the \" nuclear option \" to overcome a democratic filibuster.",

The dress she had in mind has been passed down through five generations in her family, starting with her great-great grandmother mary lowry warren, who wore it when she wed on dec. 11, 1895, in buffalo, new york. In the 120 years since, it has been worn by nine other brides in her family, making so many trips that abigail and her mother leslie, who wore the dress as bride number 6 in 1977, were afraid that it was simply beyond repair, reports the lehigh valley express-times. When the keeper of the dress ( the mother of the last bride to wear it â€” that last wedding being in 1991 ) sent it to kingston, it arrived filled with holes, with disintegrating sleeves and browned satin. Not only had the dress been dry cleaned just once, lace patched the wear from 10 brides of different sizes trying to make it fit. Abigail, who is tall and thin, turned to a bridal designer, who spent 200 hours restoring it to its \" spectacular \" original design, reports jezebel, transforming the brown into a blush shade and painstakingly recreating the disappearing sleeves and their 80 hand-sewn pleats. Still, \" it is very, very fragile, \" says abigail, so she ' ll slip it on after the ceremony to wear throughout the cocktail hour during her oct. 17 wedding in perkasie, pennsylvania. Abigail will also wear her great grandmother's ring and a locket given to her grandmother by her grandfather. \" it's not just the dress that's been handed down, \" leslie says. \" it's the love. \" a 12th bride is already asking about it.

No details were released on the deal that persuaded carrier to stay in indiana, though sources tell the indianapolis star that state incentives were part of the package, and insiders tell nbc that carrier's parent company, united technologies, did not want to jeopardize its government contracts. United steelworkers local 1999 president chuck jones says he hasn't been briefed on the deal, but he is cautiously optimistic. The star notes carrier had already reached a severance agreement with workers.

Yet noaa researchers are noting just how much trouble an eel in the nose can cause after sharing a photo of an afflicted seal looking rather uncomfortable this week, before the eel was successfully removed, per cnn. The seal is actually one of \" three or four \" juveniles observed with an eel up its nose since the phenomenon was first spotted off hawaii's lisianski island in 2016, biologist charles littnan tells the guardian, adding \" we've been intensively monitoring monk seals for four decades and in all of that time nothing like this has happened. \" he tells live science, \" we have no idea why it's happening. \" in certain cases â€” littnan describes one in which an eel was so deeply embedded that \" it was like a magician's handkerchief trick, we just had to keep pulling and pulling \" â€” it may be regurgitation gone wrong. But as eels like to hide from predators, including monk seals digging around in coral reefs and rocks, they might see a nostril as a place of safety in a sudden attack. It could also be that juvenile seals aren't good hunters, as no adult seals have been found with an eel nose plug, though that doesn't explain why eels have only been seen in right nostrils. The poor seals are suffering along with the eels, none of which have survived past removal. Bacteria from rotting flesh can trigger an infection, per live science, which that adds a seal's nostrils are meant to close underwater. ( eels hurt tourists, too. )",

The coffin contained something wrapped in bandages and covered in black resin.

The scan showed a remarkable amount of preservation and detail, including all of the fetus's digits. The museum states the mummy was clearly the result of an important burial due to its arms being crossed over its chest and the elaborate carvings on the coffin. \"this groundbreaking find educates us further still in our conception of just how precious the unborn child was in ancient egyptian society, \" the guardian quotes the museum's head of conservation as saying. \"the care taken in the preparation of this burial clearly demonstrates the value placed on life even in the first weeks of its inception. \"",

Now, she's finally able to say goodbye to her brother as well â€” a brother who went missing 41 years ago. On june 23, a texas lab confirmed mark duane woodard was dead after comparing the dna of her parents to that taken from bones found in marion county in 1977. The ledger reports that a 19-year-old woodard vanished on april 14, 1975; he had intended to head from their home in florida to texas with friends that day, says wells. The charley project, which profiles missing persons cases, says he had as much as $ 3,000 in cash on him at the time; wfts reports by way of investigators that the group intended to buy marijuana in texas. Though wells always suspected her brother had been murdered, she tells the paper that when the polk county sheriff's office asked to meet with her to discuss an investigation, it never dawned on the 62-year-old they were referring to her brother. Progress on the case began in 2009, when a bone was sent to the university of north texas so that dna could be recovered and added to the missing persons database. The sheriff's office in polk county, which is about two hours south of marion county, surfaced woodard's case in a review last year of missing persons cases. Wells tells wfts her parents gave their dna \" seven or eight years ago \" after some remains were found in the area; so as part of its review psco sent that dna to texas. Marion county has now shifted the missing persons case to a death investigation, and is working in concert with polk county. \" this opens up an investigation that will make a very cold case very active, \" a marion county investigator says.

Marlon kimpson says he is praying for pinckney and for \" our mother emanuel ame church. \" \" i ask the nation to keep charleston in our prayers, \" he says. At the scene of the shooting, barriers have been put up and police have asked people to stay back because of a possible bomb threat, the guardian reports. Charleston mayor joe riley told reporters that while the motive is unknown, this is an \" unspeakable and heartbreaking tragedy in this most historic church, an evil and hateful person took the lives of citizens who had come to worship and pray together. \"",

He is now the leading conservative alternative to mitt romney, though newt gingrich promised to take his fight all the way to the republican convention. Mitt romney, who came in third in both states, is approaching the qualities of some cursed mythological figure who gets stronger on the outside while his insides decay: with each contest, romney gains delegates but appears to get weaker. In alabama, santorum won with 35 percent of the vote. Gingrich and romney both earned 29 percent. In mississippi, santorum captured 33 percent of the ballots to gingrich's 31 percent and romney's 30 percent. The republican presidential race is holding the pattern that first emerged on super tuesday: it remains a race of mathematics versus a movement. Though romney lost the marquee contests of the evening, he was expected to do well in hawaii and american samoa, perhaps giving him the most delegates of any candidate for the evening.

Screenshot by michelle starr/cnet a new discovery in mexico, however, is a first for human remains in a church: a statue of christ has been discovered to have teeth -- not teeth carved from animal bone or horn -- but actual human teeth. The 18th century lord of patience statue in the parish of san bartolo cuautlalpan -- known for its gruesome blood and open wounds -- was about to undergo restoration at the national school of restoration, conservation and museology. In preparation for the restoration, the team x-rayed the statue, to find eight adult human teeth adorning its mouth. \" it is common that the sculptures have teeth, but they are usually made of wood or bone carved individually or as a plate, but in this case has eight teeth of an adult, \" said team leader and school director fanny unikel in a museum video. \" the teeth were probably donated as a token of gratitude.

            "A jesus statue that has lived an unassuming life in a small town in mexico for the last 300 years has been hiding a strange secret: real human teeth. Exactly how the statue of jesus awaiting punishment prior to his crucifixion got its set of choppers is a mystery. But the statue may be an example of a tradition in which human body parts were donated to churches for religious purposes, said fanny unikel santoncini, a restorer at the escuela nacional de restauraciÃ³n, conservaciÃ³n y museografÃ­a at the instituto nacional de antropologÃ­a e historia ( inah ) in mexico, who first discovered the statue's teeth. \" we have to remember that these people were very, very religious.

        "summary": "While no official cause of death was given for roger ailes, who died thursday at the age of 77, the ap reports the fox news founder had a serious accident at home in florida just eight days ago. Palm beach police say ailes fell in the bathroom and hit his head. He was rushed to the hospital with heavy bleeding. No other details about the incident were given. Here's more on ailes'death: in an excerpt from his biography run by vanity fair, ailes talked about being diagnosed with hemophilia as a child, saying he used to think \" about the fact that any accident could be dangerous or even fatal. \" here's the moment fox news broke into its regularly scheduled programming to report the news of its founder's death. In his previous career as a gop political operative, ailes helped richard nixon get elected by making him a better tv presence, the washington post reports. He would later use fox news to do that for all republican candidates by \" providing conservatives with coverage so friendly they might well have produced it themselves. \" ailes also helped george hw bush get elected with what business insider calls \" one of the most infamous political ads of all time, \" which showed a revolving door letting men in and out of prison while accusing democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis of being soft on crime. The new york daily news reports ailes'death will make it harder for fox news to defend itself against more than two dozen lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and racial and gender discrimination because its former head won't be able to testify on behalf of the network or himself. Despite his ouster at fox following sexual harassment claims, us news &amp; world report argues ailes ' legacy is one of \" triumph \": \" there [ is ] no space between the republican party and right-wing media \" and \" washington [ is ] under united republican control, with a former fox news commentator sitting in the oval office. \" but slate counters ailes died a year too late for that to be the case: \" history will remember ailes not as a brilliant manipulator of mistruths, but as a sad, insecure predator who built a business on the subjugation of women's bodies. \"",

        "summary": "Now that california has lifted its moratorium on the death penalty, convicted murderer kevin cooper, 57, is once again preparing to be executed for high-profile slayings he says he didn't commit. \" i am innocent, \" cooper tells nbc news. \" and it's not my execution, it's my murder. \" cooper has been on death row since 1985, when he was convicted of the brutal 1983 slayings of doug and peggy ryen, their 10-year-old daughter, and another child who was spending the night in their chino hills, calif., home. The ryens ' 8-year-old son, left for dead with a slit throat, survived. He initially told police that three white or latino men committed the murders but has since come to believe that cooper was the lone killer. Prosecutors say cooper, who had escaped from a nearby prison the previous night, had been hiding out in a house near the ryen home. Wielding a hatchet, ice pick, and one or more knives, they say he slaughtered the victims and drove away in their station wagon. Cooper has maintained his innocence throughout, and there are plenty of people who believe him, saying police withheld information, ignored other suspects, and tampered with evidence, particularly blood samples. In 2004, cooper was three hours away from being put to death when a federal appeals court stopped the execution, deciding some of the evidence was flawed. \" you watch the clock as your life goes off, \" he says, \" minute by minute. \" nonetheless, many others say cooper is guilty, even former defense team members, writes san francisco chronicle columnist debra saunders. To think otherwise is \" utterly unreasonable, \" the california supreme court ruled in 1991. Cooper's conviction was upheld in 2009, keeping him on death row. Now, cooper tells nbc, he is appealing to california gov. Jerry brown to have \" an open mind \" about the evidence in his case and intervene.",

The new issue for the 34-mile bridge meant to connect macau, hong kong, and the city of zhuhai in china revolves around dolosse, reinforced concrete blocks used to keep waves from eroding structures. Drone photos taken last week of one of the bridge's man-made islands ( there are also new roadways and a below-water tunnel that will make up the final sea bridge ) seem to show some of the blocks underwater and not attached to a protective barrier, which has raised concerns on the hong kong side that the structural integrity of the island, which is being built by a chinese contractor, is compromised. China's hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge authority, however, is scoffing at the hubbub, with a senior official insisting the blocks are meant to be submerged. \" we have our ways to do it, and you [ hong kong ] may have your ways to do it, \" he says, per the south china morning post. A site review sunday by hong kong's highways chief confirmed that the seemingly \" random \" positioning of the dolosse, which weigh between 5.5 tons and nearly 9 tons each, was \" scientific, reasonable, and safe, \" per the scmp. A hong kong government engineer, meanwhile, noted the dolosse are placed in two different ways, for two different purposes: the ones closest to the island are to fend off wave erosion, while the ones making everyone nervous are actually meant to keep ships and other vessels from getting too close to the island and smashing into the undersea tunnel.

The results of what the new york times calls a \" major, long-awaited study \" on rhesus monkeys are in, and they cast serious doubt on the notion that eating a restricted diet increases lifespan. For the past 25 years, scientists kept the monkeys hungry, feeding them a diet 30 % to 40 % below normal. And in the end, the monkeys lived no longer than their well-fed peers. The findings contradict the results of a 2009 study on monkeys, along with decades of studies on rodents. \"this shows the importance of replication in science, \" says one doctor who specializes in longevity. As for why skinny mice live longer, it may be that the low-cal diet works better in animals with generally short lifespans, but not so much with primates. The los angeles times sees a silver lining, however, noting that the diet seemed to help the monkeys in the study ward off cancer.",

The wework team known for communal work spaces has just launched a building of communal living spaces in new york city's financial district where rent starts at $ 1,375 monthly. That price will get you a spot in a two-person, fully furnished space that includes a common kitchenette and bathroom, but no bedrooms. Instead, beds are separated from the main living space by a curtain. Wework calls it an experiment \" designed to bring people together. \" gizmodo calls it a \" glorified college dorm. \" but a $ 125 fee gives renters access to quite a few amenities. In addition to internet, cable, and a supply of san pellegrino and beer, residents enjoy a chef's kitchen, bar, roof deck and jacuzzi, wellness room, laundry room with ping pong and billiards, and a housekeeping team, reports forbes. There are also options for people who like their privacy. A private bedroom starts at $ 2,000 a month, while a private studio apartment fetches $ 2,550. That's not exactly a steal; mashable reports the price of welive's studio apartment is above average for manhattan, queens, and brooklyn, though slightly below average for the financial district. There's a room in a three-bedroom apartment in the same area for $ 1,250, per gizmodo. Yet a co-founder hopes people will be \" empowered by ( the ) environment \" and develop a sense of community. The start-up aims to bring in $ 605.9 million per year, buzzfeed reported last year. Some 50 units now available in new york will eventually expand to 200 and a second location outside of washington, dc, will officially launch in may. Spots there will start at $ 1,000 per month.

            "A norwegian news website is forcing readers to take a quiz about the contents of an article before they are able to comment on it, in an attempt to stop abuse and vicious arguments breaking out below stories. Nrkbeta, the technology section of nrk, the country's public broadcaster, asks its readers to answer a series of multiple choice questions before they can post a comment. It is hoped that ensuring that readers have read the article will lead to a better online dialogue, but also that the few seconds it takes to fill out the quiz will act as a cooling-off period. Many websites have struggled to ensure that comment sections are friendly and welcoming, with debates often quickly turning to mud-slinging, especially on controversial or partisan topics."

The credit-monitoring company, facing a flood of complaints about its handling of the breach, bowed to public pressure tuesday and said it would drop fees until nov. 21 for people seeking to freeze their credit reports, the new york times reports. Experts have suggested that people affected by the breach consider freezing their credit files, which would prevent thieves from using stolen information to get loans and credit cards in their names, the ap reports. Consumers have also been advised to closely monitor their credit reports for a long time to come. A class-action lawsuit was filed against equifax last week after the breach became public. Authorities in states including massachusetts also plan to sue the company over what analysts say could be the worst leak of personal information ever. Massachusetts attorney general maura healey says the breach \" may be the most brazen failure to protect consumer data \" that her office has ever dealt with. Sen.

Almost perfect circles, they're the subject of local myths, the bbc reports. Researchers still don't know what causes them, but new findings could help them figure it out â€” even as the phenomenon becomes increasingly weird. Experts have discovered that the circles ' layout matches that of skin cells, a press release reports. \" it's a completely amazing, strange match, \" says a researcher in japan. What makes it even more amazing is that it is highly unusual to have matching patterns on both the tiny and large scale, the release notes. The team was inspired to compare the patterns as they noticed a few things fairy circles and skin cells have in common, livescience reports. Both fairy circles and skin cells exhibit a life cycle \" of birth, growth, and death, \" the scientists say in their study, and both may have to compete for space. Using satellite images, the researchers drew lines between the circles, comparing the lines to cell walls. Then they calculated the number of neighbors each fairy circle had. Turns out most fairy circles â€” and most skin cells â€” have six neighbors, and the percentages of each with other numbers of neighbors are also very similar. In case this wasn't otherworldly enough, the findings could someday help researchers investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial life based on pattern analysis, the press release notes.

        "summary": "There's still no proof there was ever life on mars, but evidence is starting to pile up that conditions were once ripe for life to begin, nasa scientists say. The curiosity rover's exploration of the gale crater has found signs that liquid water flowed on the planet's surface for tens of millions of years, cnet reports, giving life ( of the microbial kind at least ) much longer to get going than researchers had previously believed. The rover had already determined that the planet once had the right chemical ingredients for life, reports the guardian, and sediment deposits have now revealed that lakes and rivers were once common on its surface, with large amounts of water remaining underground even after those dried up. Curiosity team members say the new findings suggest that early mars was much like early earth. \" what i get excited about is imagining a mars 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, a planet with a thick atmosphere, maybe a blue sky with puffy clouds and mountains and lakes and rivers, \" john m. Grunsfeld, a nasa science administrator, tells the new york times. Grunsfeld, who's also a former astronaut, says the curiosity mission has given vital clues to how and where to search for evidence of martian life. \" we don't know if life ever started on mars, but if it did, we now have a better chance of discovering it, \" he says.

The reason why? damon's divisive comments following bombshell allegations of men sexually harassing women in hollywood. The petition cites a recent abc news interview where damon describes the allegations as a \" spectrum of behavior \" and called out the \" difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. \" ( even his ex minnie driver felt the need to slap damon on the wrist for these comments. ) the petition also accused damon of trying to \"squash \" the reporting that first brought accusations against mogul harvey weinstein to light. \"damon's inclusion would trivialize the serious nature of the charges against sexual abusers like weinstein, \" showing \" massive disrespect for the brave women speaking out, \" it read.

Myers said areas like charlottesville, virginia, may rake in some of the highest snowfall accumulations, depending on how quickly the storm moves and whether it remains on course.

The virginia state police said friday night at around 8 p.m. They were working 335 accidents. The hardest hit area so far was in roanoke, virginia, along i-81, a spokesman with the virginia department of transportation said. The roanoke regional airport said it had cancelled all remaining flights for friday night. An accident on i-26 in western north carolina has closed the entire interstate, and some drivers have been stuck so long on the road they have run out of fuel, according to cnn affiliate wspa-tv.

And there may be a simple way to improve his mood, even his health: challenge him. Researchers at the university of california at berkeley say food puzzles â€” think mazes or other toys that make a cat work for its food â€” bring out a cat's instinct to hunt, making the animal more active, less needy, and less prone to stress â€” because, apparently, lying around the house all day can be pretty stressful for a born predator. In more than 30 cases, researchers say the puzzles were able to alleviate specific health or behavioral concerns in cats, reports gizmodo. For example, an 8-year-old obese cat lost 20 % of its body weight after using food puzzles for one year, researchers say. The puzzles â€” initially created to entertain animals in labs and zoos, per a release â€” also appeared to solve one cat's aggression issues and another cat's fear of people. They might even work for cats who pee all over the house, per nine.com.au. There are lots of food puzzles available for purchase, but you can also just throw food in a water bottle or paper bag and watch your cat paw it around. Experts suggest trying out a few puzzles to see what's right for your cat and starting with the easiest ones first. ( your cat's attitude might depend on the color of its fur. )",

Another character in the video then shoots the rabbit as it hurtles through space, while shrieking can be heard. \"any questions? \" asks the child. \"any questions? \" a scene in which cain looks down across a valley wraps up the video. \"the rabbit is fine but our current tax code is killing small business! \" according to text below the youtube video. On monday, youtube pulled the video from their website with the following explanation: \"this video has been removed as a violation of youtube's policy against spam, scams, and commercially deceptive content. Sorry about that. \" a short while later, the video was returned to the video-sharing website. Youtube said that the removal was a mistake. \" occasionally, a video flagged by users or identified by our spam team is mistakenly taken down. When this is brought to our attention, we review the content and take appropriate action, including reinstating videos that had been removed, \" a youtube spokesperson told politico. The video followed another disturbing \"cain connections \" video, in which a goldfish is thrown out of its bowl onto the ground. \"this is our economy on stimulus, \" says the same child actress, as the goldfish flops around in the mud. \"any questions? \" cain was a candidate in the gop presidential nominating contest, but suspended his campaign in december 2011 after politico reported that multiple women had accused him of sexual harassment.

Or at least that's the lesson william oliver apparently took away. The 30-year-old atlanta man recently started a gofundme page to raise $ 15,000 to buy his girlfriend an engagement ring, mashable reports. Oliver says he was inspired to make a big show of his love for his girlfriend after she bought him 30 gifts for his 30th birthday. So why then isn't he using his own money? oliver says crowdfunding is a chance to \" let everybody who loves us show us. \" that way he can buy a ring that \" we all can be proud of. \" elite daily, which rounds up a handful of the many incredulous twitter reactions to oliver's fundraising attempt, accuses him of taking \" the easy way out \" when it comes to saving up for a ring. And refinery29 says the fundraiser is \" slightly inappropriate, \" especially because a decent ring can be had for way cheaper than $ 15,000. In fact, the macon telegraph reports the average engagement ring in 2016 cost $ 6,163 â€” less than half what oliver is asking for. While oliver argues that \" teamwork makes our dreams work, \" it seems most people aren't convinced. Despite being shared more than 12,000 times since march 28, oliver's gofundme page has raised just $ 600. ( this bride took on the saleswoman who called her ring \" pathetic. \" )",

Now the effort is complete, and authorities have found 850 matches with the fbi's dna records, the ap reports. Twenty-nine people have been charged as part of the city's $ 6 million effort, with six convictions; those convicted have faced sentences lasting between two and 45 years. More charges are likely to be on the way, the houston chronicle reports. \" it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims, \" says a prosecutor. \" we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible. \" but the backlog's toll is clear. During the years that the kits were left untested, six of those charged are believed to have committed additional rapes, the chronicle reports. Existing dna records might have helped stop some repeat crimes had the testing been conducted earlier, officials say. Houston is far from the only city facing the problem: similar efforts are underway in memphis, cleveland, and detroit. \" this is not a houston problem. It's not a texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years, \" says mayor annise parker. Now houston's crime lab is \" a model for the nation, \" says its director.
