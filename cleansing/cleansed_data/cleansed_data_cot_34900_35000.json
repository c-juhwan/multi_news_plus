        "summary": "Three presidents have opted not to deliver their final speech in person; president obama was not the fourth, tonight giving what was his last state of the union address. He kicked it off with a wide grin, noting that for \" this final one i ' m going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa. \" over the next 70 minutes he explained \" i don't just want to talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond. \" indeed, as the new york times observes, the speech \" was more a broad statement of his vision rather than a policy prescription \" ( though he did announce a new effort to cure cancer led by joe biden ). At the center of that vision: what the ap terms an \" implicit call \" to give democrats a third consecutive term in the white house. He \" sought to contrast republicans ' bleak appraisals of the state of the nation with his own upbeat argument, \" per the times, as evidenced in lines like \" anyone claiming that america's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. \" he also made what some are seeing as subtle references to donald trump: \" each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of lincoln, adhere to the'dogmas of the quiet past. ' instead we thought anew, and acted anew. \" \" when politicians insult muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country. \" \" the future we want... Is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics. \"",

The wall street journal reports the 100 kilowatt-hour battery gives the carmaker a range unmatched by major car companies; it's the first to push past the 300-mile mark. The battery will be available in the model s sedan and model x suv ( the latter's range is 289 miles ). More: tesla ceo elon musk had big words in a conference call with the media, reports the bbc. \" these are very profound milestones and i think will help convince people around the world that electric is the future. \" it's a profound milestone with a price: the verge reports the model s p100d with ludicrous mode kicks off at $ 134,500, up $ 9,500 compared to the p90d. For the suv, tack on an extra thousand. But hey, buying one is kind of charitable: tesla again emphasized that the revenue is what facilitates the production of the much more affordable tesla model 3 that's in development. As for the *, tesla itself explains the model s p100d with ludicrous mode now actually becomes the third fastest accelerating production car ( as opposed to concept car ) ever, able to go from 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds.

Des plaines police allege they were called to the kiddie junction daycare center in des plaines by daycare management after they discovered one of the teachers had been distributing gummy bears to the class of two-year-olds to \"calm the kids down for nap time, \" commander chris mierzwa tells people. Mierzwa says during a police interview the teacher told them that two other co-workers were also allegedly giving out the gummy bears. Mierzwa alleges the teachers had been giving the toddlers at the daycare the gummy bears since november 2016. \"not every child was given it, \" he says. Des plaines police • for more compelling true crime coverage, follow our crime magazine on flipboard mierzwa says the teachers admitted to giving the toddlers the gummy bears but said they didn't think administering the sleep aid was inappropriate because it was an over-the-counter medication. \"the bottle specifically said it shouldn't be given to children under 15, \" he says. \"the problem is you shouldn't be giving anything to a child that hasn't been authorized by"

Amazon says it had its best holiday season ever, shipping more than 1 billion items, reuters reports. Amazon stock went up 1.6 % with the news. According to cnn, amazon says it sold enough tvs to reach the top of mount everest nine times, enough kitchenaid mixers to make 7.5 million cookies at the same time, and a watch every 1.5 seconds. Other popular items included keurig coffee pods, virtual reality headsets, finding dory, and pokemon games. But amazon's most popular items were its echo and echo dot. \" despite our best efforts and ramped-up production, we still had trouble keeping them in stock, \" one amazon executive says. An expert estimates the online retailer sold up to 5 million of the voice-controlled devices, and usa today reports it sold nine times more of them than it did last year. Dec. 19 was the busiest shopping day on amazon, and dec. 23 was the most popular day for instant amazon now deliveries ( a lot of people were getting oreo cookies, for some reason ).

So surmise paleontologists at the university of washington, who excavated the 17-inch-long bone a month after it was found by other scientists looking for extinct marine invertebrates in april 2012, reports livescience. The team spent the next year and a half preparing the fossil before they sorted out that what they had on their hands was in fact the first dinosaur bone ever found in the state. ( t. Rex is a type of theropod, by the way, though at 36 feet this dinosaur was a bit smaller. ) \" for the longest time, i was unconvinced that we were going to be able to say anything else besides, ' it's a large bone, ' \" one researcher says. \" i couldn't tell if it was a dinosaur, couldn't tell if it was a marine reptile, couldn't tell anything about it. \" they were \" lucky, \" he adds, that it was preserved enough for them to find two clues. First, the bone has a hollow cavity, and second, a feature called a \" fourth trochanter, \" both suggesting a theropod, they report this week in plos one. The find makes washington the 37th state to lay claim to a dino fossil; the area was in fact largely underwater at the time, reports the seattle times. A few theories are floating around about why a land roamer has been found there, including that it made its way north from oregon or california.

The 45-year-old woman, who has not been identified, stepped into a 5-inch gap as she got off the orange line at massachusetts avenue station around 5: 30pm, reports the boston herald. Per abc news, dozens of people then helped push and rock the train until the woman could get her leg out. \" it was twisted and bloody. Skin came off. She's in agony and weeping, \" boston globe reporter maria cramer tweeted from the scene. Per cnn, the woman couldn't walk or stand from a cut on her left thigh, deep enough to expose bone, but pressed bystanders not to call an ambulance. \" it's $ 3000, \" she said, according to cramer. \" i can't afford that. \" cramer later reported an ambulance ride for a person with her injuries costs about $ 1,200. But the woman \" made it a point to say ' you don't understand, i have terrible insurance, ' \" a witness tells cnn. \" everyone just kept saying don't worry about that, you need medical help. \" the woman eventually went with emts to boston medical center following a recommendation for surgery. While it's unclear what her medical bills will total, the new york times editorial board sees a clear problem. This case is \" one you might expect to see in an impoverished country \" and suggests \" far too many of america's politicians have placed too little value on the well-being of its citizens, \" the board writes, citing a 2010 study that found hospital costs were 60 % higher in the us than in 12 other countries.",

The affordable care act has improved access to health care, especially for lower-income families that now qualify for medicaid or subsidies to buy private health insurance. Wider access, however, has not come cheaply for most people. As a result, many americans, including those who are insured, have determined that they must avoid going to the hospital, visiting doctors or filling prescriptions that they need.

An angry crowd in newark, nj, held up protest signs, per the guardian. \" 1000+ people camped out to get #szechuan sauce but mcdonalds had 70, \" one annoyed fan tweeted. \" drove 4 hours at 6am... No sauce, wouldn't even give us a poster, \" another complained. \" mcdonalds you suck. Only 10 posters &amp; 20 packets … to a store, \" tweeted a third. The condiment craze dates back to 1998 when mcdonald's launched the spicy sauce to promote the movie mulan. Rick, one of the stars of the snarky science-fiction cartoon, makes it his mission to get some, explains the huffington post, resulting in sauce-themed memes and prompting a petition.

        "summary": "After police in manhattan found a 61-year-old man dead in a parked car in late august, they identified him as geoffrey corbis and said it appeared he died of natural causes. Turns out, his name was actually geoffrey weglarz, and he died by suicide after ingesting poison he bought on the dark web. How weglarz came to this end under a different name is the subject of a fascinating new york times story by michael wilson. A friend says weglarz \" had it all \" — a wife and son, a big house in connecticut, a passion for acting, and a career in software design that took him around the world. Then came the divorce and weglarz's departure from dell in 2011. ( the connecticut post also mentions medical and mental health issues. ) two years later, weglarz told pbs ' newshour in a story about jobless older americans that he'd applied to 481 jobs with no luck, and had only $ 2,000 to his name. And another bad turn: weglarz was accused of throwing a sandwich at a pregnant mcdonald's worker in 2013, and he changed his surname to corbis to avoid unflattering news reports. He never did shake his financial struggles. Shortly before he died, he told his sister he'd acquired poison used for euthanasia. \" that way, when i ' m ready, i can go painlessly and fast, \" he reportedly said. She thought she knew the outcome when weglarz sent her a text shortly before 6pm on aug. 24. \" stuff does taste as bad as i thought it would, \" it read. The times has more, including on a final, vain bank visit. ( a suicide pact is suspected in another nyc case. )",

            "A neighbor walking his dog in the east village saw the man one night, sitting motionless behind the wheel inside a parked car. Two days later, he was still there. The windows were up, the engine off — this during an august heat wave. The neighbor called 911. Soon the block of east 12th street was busy with police officers and their bosses, the car roped off with yellow tape. There were no signs of foul play. A team from the office of chief medical examiner arrived that afternoon, aug. 31, and removed the body to determine the cause of death. People who lived and worked nearby kept their distance. The police later released the man's name, geoffrey corbis, 61, of bridgeport, conn., and said he appeared to have died of natural causes about two days before he was found there. None of those initial findings would prove true. Not the cause of death. Not his name",

Meanwhile, turkey's foreign minister has said nato will take command of the international mission in libya within a day or two. \" compromise has been reached in principle in a very short time, \" ahmet davutoglu was quoted as saying after a conference call with his us, french and british counterparts. Turkey, a nato member, had earlier raised objections to the organisation taking command without certain conditions first being agreed.

Delbert hosemann said on friday that his office had not yet received a letter from kansas secretary of state kris kobach, who with vp mike pence is leading the presidential advisory commission on election integrity. Noting that mississippi has previously fought in federal court to protect voters ' privacy, hosemann used colorful language to signal his reply, adding, \" mississippi residents should celebrate independence day and our state's right to protect the privacy of our citizens. \" at least 27 states have refused or expressed reservations about turning over what kobach calls \" publicly available voter roll data, \" per cnn. They include pence's home state of indiana, where secretary of state connie lawson tweeted that state law prevents the release of anything more than a voter's name, address, and congressional delegation. Kobach's letter asked for information that could include registered voters ' birth dates, party registration, voting history, and the last four digits of social security numbers. Even kobach backtracked on friday, saying he won't share his voters'social security numbers \" at this time, \" per the kansas city star. Other states were adamantly opposed. \" i have no intention of honoring this request, \" said gov. Terry mcauliffe of virginia, per the washington post. He said the commission was based on \" the specious and false notion that there was widespread voter fraud last november. \" trump has cast doubt on hillary clinton's popular-vote victory by citing massive fraud, without evidence.",

But while those demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, that changed today after a self-immolation by an elderly man, reuters reports. Choi hyun-yeol ( ided as choi yeon-yeol by the ap ), listed as being either 80 or 81, set himself on fire on a flower bed near the protest, and burned cotton and a small bottle of gasoline were reportedly found at the scene. Spectators put out the fire with protest banners and paramedics rushed choi to the hospital, where he's in critical condition with third-degree burns to his face, neck, and upper body, per reuters; the ap also notes he's having trouble breathing. \" the patient is old and has severe burns, so his survival can't be guaranteed, \" a hospital rep says, per reuters. Today's protest was larger than usual in advance of saturday's 70th anniversary of the end of japan's colonial occupation of the korean peninsula. Between 1,000 and 2,000 people were estimated to have gathered, including three surviving \" comfort women \" who were forced into military brothels because, as the new york times puts it, \" imperial japan's military authorities believed sex was good for morale. \" choi was said to be part of a civic group that speaks up for forced labor victims, reuters notes, and though it's not clear why he set himself ablaze, a seoul police official tells the ap a five-page note was found in his bag bashing japan's wartime conduct. Self-immolation is just one extreme measure seen at these protests: per the news agency, demonstrators have also cut off their own fingers and thrown excrement at the japanese embassy.

        "summary": "Paypal's giving fund charitable platform, which says it allows people to donate directly to more than a million charities, raised more than $ 7 billion last year — but a new lawsuit alleges that many charities may never receive the donations intended for them. The suit alleges that in order to receive the funds, a charity must be registered with paypal. If it is not, per the suit, paypal gives the charity six months to register; if it does not do so, paypal will distribute the donations to different nonprofit organizations. In addition, the suit notes that this practice forces nonprofits into a paypal business account they may not want, \" thus generating revenues for paypal \" via fees if the accounts are used to conduct business. Paypal says it is reviewing the lawsuit and is \" fully prepared to defend ourselves in this matter, \" per the guardian. The federal class-action suit was filed on behalf of terry kass, an illinois resident who used the giving fund platform late last year, and the north shore health center, one of the charities to which she tried to donate. Though kass found a paypal page for the legal aid clinic when she made her donations, an employee of the center later told her the donation had never been received. That's when she followed up with paypal and found out that 10 of the 13 charities to which she had attempted to donate were not registered with giving fund. The suit alleges that paypal did not inform any of the charities of the need to register in order to receive the donations, and that before distributing the funds to a different charity, they are placed in an interest-bearing account that benefits paypal. Per npr, the suit claims thousands of charities have been affected by paypal's practices.",

What will we do without him? \" chris sellers, national post: \" as i ponder ford's tragic passing at the terrible age of 46, just when he seemed to be turning his life around, he strikes me far less as an extraordinary individual than as an extraordinary collision of unfortunate circumstances, crammed into a single otherwise average guy and installed, tragically and against all logic, in the chief magistrate's office of a city of 2.6 million people. \" stephen marche, esquire: \" after ford confessed to smoking crack, and refused to step down — still one of the craziest political decisions ever undertaken -- his poll numbers went up. He stumbled on a fact nobody had realized before: such is the loathing of the political class among voters that craziness will be taken as authenticity. \" marche, one of several commentators to describe ford as the precursor to donald trump, writes that the \" most salient political fact in the world is that the next rob ford could easily be the next president of the united states. \" michele mandel, toronto sun: \" the late, great rob ford may have been a clown, but he was our clown.

Previously, only deaths that occurred during official wars were considered secret, and the kremlin insists the change is just a mundane bit of bookkeeping, and there's no reason — ( cough ) ukraine ( cough ) — to think otherwise.

The backdrop, of course, is that russia swears it's not sending soldiers into ukraine, and it says that the many, many russian troops that have shown up there have gone as volunteers on their own time, not as part of a military mission. The washington post zeros in on a possible reason for the upgraded secrecy law: the kremlin may be able to shrug off concerns from the west, but \" if there was one weak spot in russian support for the kremlin's aims in ukraine this year, it was the population's strong aversion to sending in russian troops. \" the law will help silence any criticism, raising the possibility that a new military push is imminent.",

        "summary": "A former portsmouth, va., police officer was found guilty of manslaughter thursday after shooting an unarmed black teen last year — the second fatal shooting of his career. Though stephen rankin was charged with first-degree murder, a jury convicted him of the lesser charge and recommended he spend two and a half years in prison, reports the guardian. He faced up to 10. Prosecutors said rankin, 36, intentionally killed 18-year-old shoplifting suspect william chapman in a walmart parking lot on april 22, 2015, after chapman resisted arrest. However, rankin — a us navy veteran with training in mixed martial arts — said he shot chapman twice in self-defense as chapman \" came towards me aggressively \" after a taser was knocked from rankin's hand as the two scuffled. \" i felt i needed to save my life, \" he said, adding he immediately gave chapman cpr. The guardian reports rankin also shot and killed an unarmed man from kazakhstan in 2011, though judge johnny morrison ruled jurors couldn't hear about that since a grand jury declined to indict rankin. In that case, rankin said 26-year-old kirill denyakin, shot 11 times, reached into his waistband and charged at him. Prosecutors also couldn't share with the jury text messages rankin sent before chapman's death; one read \" people are just bad, \" another referenced sodom and gomorrah. It's not clear whether chapman actually stole something from walmart. Rankin is due to be sentenced oct. 12, though his lawyers plan to appeal. The virginian-pilot reports he's the 13th us officer to have a jury convict him of murder or manslaughter since 2005.",

Jurors at portsmouth circuit court found stephen rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter for killing william chapman in april last year. It was rankin's second fatal shooting of an unarmed man in the city. Chapman's mother, sallie, wept as the verdict was read out by the court clerk. Rankin stared directly ahead as his supporters sat in silence. Rankin had been charged with first-degree murder and using a firearm to commit a felony but the judge had told jurors they could convict him on lesser charges. The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 13 hours after hearing four days of detailed testimony from witnesses to the shooting, a series of experts and rankin himself. Rankin, 36, was terminated from his job at the police department after being indicted for murder. Prosecutors argued that rankin intentionally killed chapman with premeditation after chapman resisted arrest and defied his orders. The officer tried to stop chapman in the parking lot of a walmart superstore on the morning of 22 april 2015 to investigate a suspected theft from the store. \"the law does not say that because you do not comply you have to die, \" commonwealth's attorney stephanie morales said during her closing argument on tuesday. Morales told jurors that chapman should have \"lived to face prosecution \" for resisting arrest or assaulting an officer. \"the defendant brought a gun to what at worst was a fistfight, \" she said. Rankin and his attorneys had insisted, however, that the officer opened fire only as a last resort after chapman fought with him aggressively and then charged towards him.

        "summary": "We may have been wrong about how the first people arrived in north america. The widely accepted narrative, as explained by smithsonian magazine, is that humans walked across a land bridge between siberia and alaska 13,000 years ago. But lately some have begun to suspect early humans actually arrived by boat further down the coast. A recent discovery by an anthropology student in canada supports that idea. Ctv news reports alisha gauvreau and her team were excavating on an island about 300 miles northwest of victoria when they found evidence of an ancient village. A hearth buried 8 feet underground contained charcoal dated to 14,000 years old, history reports. Spears, tools, and fish hooks found nearby were dated similarly. At 14,000 years old, the village is one of the oldest settlements ever found in north america — older than ancient rome and three times older than the pyramids of giza, the vancouver sun reports. \" we just kind of sat there going, holy moly, this is old, \" gauvreau tells ctv. The discovery of the ancient settlement supports stories passed down by the elders of the heiltsuk nation. Those stories say the tribe's ancestors survived the ice age by living on a strip of coastal land that didn't freeze. \"to think about how these stories survived all of that, only to be supported by this archaeological evidence is just amazing, \" a member of the heiltsuk nation says. Gauvreau presented her findings this week at the annual meeting of the society for american archaeology. ( a university held ancient ice. Then the freezer broke. )",

Archaeologists working with the support of the hakai institute began excavations on triquet island last summer.

Buried some 2.5 meters underground, beneath layers of soil and peat, they discovered something even more intriguing. From the charred remains of an ancient hearth, the scientists used tweezers to painstakingly extract a few tiny flakes of charcoal.

( associated press ) new york ( ap ) — tom wolfe, the white-suited wizard of \" new journalism \" who exuberantly chronicled american culture from the merry pranksters through the space race before turning his satiric wit to such novels as \" the bonfire of the vanities \" and \" a man in full, \" has died. He was 88. Wolfe's literary agent, lynn nesbit, told the associated press that he died of an infection monday in a new york city hospital. Further details were not immediately available. An acolyte of french novelist emile zola and other authors of \" realistic \" fiction, the stylishly-attired wolfe was an american maverick who insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it.

        "summary": "The new york times broke the news earlier today that syria's bashar al-assad has fired scud missiles at rebel positions in northern parts of the country. The white house sees it as a \" serious escalation, \" and the washington post explains that scuds are an odd choice: they're big, not that accurate, and more suited to attacks on foreign countries than on enemies within the border. So what's going on? some theories from the above sources and from the danger room blog at wired: chemical weapons: scuds can be equipped with chemical warheads, and assad might be sending a warning to rebels and to foreign nations that he's prepared to let them fly. Desperation: assad is losing and he knows it. He may be holding off on chemical weapons for now, but he's \" throwing everything else he has against the rebels, \" writes spencer ackerman at wired. \" he's even chucking naval mines onto dry land to attack his foes. \" rebels ' air defenses: assad could be worried that his planes will be shot down by shoulder-fired missiles, says university of kentucky professor robert farley.

The target was the sheikh suleiman base north of aleppo, which rebel forces had occupied. The development may also represent a calculation by the syrian leadership that it can resort to such lethal weapons without the fear of international intervention, partly because washington had set its tolerance threshold at the use of chemical weapons.

But now a source reveals to people why the baby arrived so early: kim \" was admitted with medical complications and her doctor made the decision that her baby needed to be delivered. Kim had a natural birth. If kim would have had very serious complications, her doctor would have decided to do an emergency c-section instead. \" the baby wasn't due until july 11, hollywood life reports. As for pictures or a name, we've got nothing, but a source told e! earlier that the baby \" has dark hair \" and \" looks just like kim. \" multiple sources say the name will start with a k, of course. People's source says kim and kanye are close to making a decision, and hollywood life's sources say their top pick at this point is kai georgia donda west. Donda is kanye's late mother's name. As for georgia, west was born there, and george was also kim's late dad's middle name.

An altercation between two groups broke out and shots were fired outside of the officer's residence, baker said. Johnson was not the intended target. Wreg johnson was the father of two young girls, according to memphis abc affiliate watn. Baker also said a vehicle was involved, but was not able to confirm whether it was a drive-by shooting.

        "summary": "Three michigan brothers went missing under odd circumstances in 2010, and now a box of remains in montana may offer closure on their fate. Per mlive.com, michigan state police are exploring whether there's a tie between the disappearance of the skelton brothers — 9-year-old andrew, 7-year-old alexander, and 5-year-old tanner — and a box found in september by cleaning staff in a missoula home's shed. Inside the box: the teeth and bones of three children, nbc montana reports. Testing determined the ages of the deceased children were 2 to 4 years old, 5 to 8 years old, and 6 to 10 years old, though it wasn't noted when they died. Montana's state crime lab has now sent the remains to the university of north texas for dna testing to see if they're related and to see if a link can be made with any children in a national database for missing persons. The last time anyone saw the skelton boys was thanksgiving day in 2010, when they were in their father's backyard. At the time the boys vanished, john skelton said he'd given the boys to an unnamed sanctuary group to protect them from his ex-wife. The cops believe he killed them, and in september 2011, skelton was convicted of unlawful imprisonment and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Police say there's a \" person of interest \" in the case, which is being investigated as a possible homicide, per a search warrant shown on abcfox; the box was found by a cleaning crew after the home's tenant had been evicted. The one roadblock to the dna testing: the bones are so tiny that it may be too difficult to draw the dna out. \" it may not be the answer we want, but it would just enable the family to have some closure, \" a friend of the boys ' mother, tanya zuvers, tells the detroit free press.",

The meeting was the brainchild of bill gates and warren buffett, and it kicked off their drive to convince the world's billionaires, starting with the forbes 400, to pledge at least half their net worth to philanthropic causes, either during their lifetimes or at death. Since that meeting, gates and buffett have held several more dinner parties around the world, pitching their idea to fellow deep-pocketed philanthropists. Gates says he actually considers the 50 % a \"low bar \" to get the super-rich started, hopefully spurring even greater gifts — buffett's pledging 99 %. \"this is about moving to a different realm, \" says gates. The pledges will be recorded on givingpledge.org. They already have a handful of givers signed up, and intend to send a barrage of emails to likely candidates to coincide with the fortune article.",

The wall street journal published an except from the yale law professor's new memoir, battle hymn of the tiger mother, over the weekend, and the 3,494 comments ( and counting ) include reactions like: \" i am in disbelief after reading this. \" the article was headlined \" why chinese mothers are superior, \" and chua, who has two daughters, explains just that, writing that the chinese raise such \" stereotypically successful kids \" by demanding perfection: she describes a household of straight as, hours of piano practice, and absolutely no sleepovers. She once called her daughter garbage. She once told her 7-year-old \" to stop being lazy, cowardly, self-indulgent and pathetic. \" writes chua, \" the fact is that chinese parents can do things that would seem unimaginable — even legally actionable — to westerners. \" so are said westerners ready for her method? in the new york times, judith warner writes that chua's \" publisher is clearly banking on her message finding wide resonance among american moms worn out from trying to do everything right for kids who spend hours a day on facebook. \" and in light of all the reports of chinese ascendancy and american decline, it's doubly timely. \" despite the obvious limits of chua's appeal, \" she taps into something most parents share: \" that parental actions, each and every moment of each and every better-lived day, have the ultimate ability to shape a child's life outcome. \"",

The breast-feeding through toddlerhood, nonstop baby wearing, co-sleeping, \"baby mozart \" co-watching; the peer pressure for never-ending singsong-voiced mommy niceness, the ever-maddening chant of \"good job! \"; compulsory school \"involvement \" ( that is, teacher-delegated busywork packaged as a way to show your child you care ), the rapt attendance at each and every school performance, presentation, sporting event — the whole mishmash of modern, attuned, connected, concerned, self-esteem-building parenting. The reaction came in waves. There were expert warnings, with moralists claiming that all this loosey-goosey lovey-dovey-ness was destroying the hierarchical fiber of the american family, and psychologists writing that all that self-esteem building was leading to epidemic levels of pathological ninnyishness in kids. Then there was a sort of quasi-hedonist revolt, cries of rebellion like christie mellor's \"three martini playdate, \" mother-toddler happy hours ( postpregnancy liberation from \"what to expect \" sanctimony! ) and take-the-kid-out-all-night hipster parenting. Then came \"free range \" parenting, an appellation with the added advantage of sounding both fresh and fancy, like a whole foods chicken; \"simplicity parenting \" ( recession-era lack of cash dressed up as principled rejection of expensive lessons ); and, eventually, a kind of edgy irritation",

The arizona republic identifies three of the victims: james pedroza was a vip host at the mirage in las vegas, while oklahoma resident anand \" happy \" patel and 23-year-old california native mariah coogan were instagram stars, according to the paper. On monday, coogan shared a photo of the plane, captioned with the words \" off to vegas, \" with her 27,000 followers. She later shared a video showing her smiling from a seat of the aircraft, its engine audible, reports the santa rosa press democrat, which notes one of coogan's posts named pedroza as the pilot. Pedroza had previously said he'd bought a share in the plane. A friend of the victims has since posted other videos from inside the plane to facebook, the phoenix new times reports. Citing friends who say pedroza's girlfriend, helena lagos, was also on board, kvvu reports pedroza was in the process of getting his pilot's license. Despite that, authorities haven't confirmed who was flying the aircraft or even who was on board when it went down at the tpc scottsdale champions golf course, less than a mile from scottsdale airport. Details about the plane, however, are trickling out. Citing faa records, the republic reports the registration of the 1970 single-engine piper pa-24 comanche \" was terminated or in question, possibly because of a paperwork issue or technical issues. \" a national transportation safety board investigator adds the plane was listed as having four seats, but could've been modified to carry six people.

The singer's gravity-defying 45-degree tilt, in which he leaned forward while keeping his body straight and shoes flat on the floor, first left viewers dumbfounded when it debuted in the 1988 music video for \" smooth criminal. \" as noted in a release, \" that is not how the human body works! \" but though a patented shoe was later revealed to play a key role in the maneuver, neurosurgeons at india's postgraduate institute of medical education and research say it wouldn't permit any average joe to complete the move \" that seems unearthly to any witness, \" per the bbc. Ankle support and solid core strength are also required, according to the study in the journal of neurosurgery: spine. Jackson's dance background meant he had core strength in abundance. But as even the strongest dancers can only achieve a 25- to 30-degree tilt on their own — the calf and achilles tendon taking strain they weren't designed for, per cnn — jackson had to be helped by a special shoe inspired by astronaut boots, which can be fixed to a rail in zero gravity. In addition to providing the necessary ankle support, jackson's shoes, patented in 1993, could attach to a nail or other anchor in the floor using a v-shaped slit in the heel. \" very inventive idea of him, \" study author manjul tripathi tells cnn, adding that \" even with that shoe, i am not able to do 45 degrees. \" the neurosurgeons also say that jackson has inspired new forms of dancing that \" have begun to challenge our understanding of the modes and mechanisms of spinal injury. \" ( this famous dance move is also best avoided. )",

        "summary": "As the issue of undocumented children streaming into the us heats up, one texas town has taken action. League city's city council last night passed a resolution, 6-2, that would see the city bar any federal request to operate a detention or processing center there, though the houston chronicle reports no such requests are known to have been made. The vote followed 90 minutes of what the galveston county daily news calls \" impassioned pleas \" from those on both sides of the argument, with some calling the measure — which cites a \" potential threat of communicable diseases reported to be prevalent \" among these migrants — \" brave \" while others described it as an \" embarrassment. \" a legal expert tells khou the measure doesn't have much legal footing: \" it's simply not the city's legal right to tell the federal government what they can and cannot do in the area of immigration. Even states don't have the authority to do this. \" heidi thiess, the councilwoman who drafted the measure, says she wanted the city to take preemptive action before any requests came in — and embolden other municipalities to do the same. It seems to be working: galveston county commissioners voted 4-1 yesterday in favor of a similar resolution, notes the chronicle. As the paper explains, border patrol is required to move unaccompanied children from countries other than mexico and canada to the office of refugee resettlement within 72 hours, but the detention network has been unable to keep up with the recent numbers. The feds yesterday looked at an empty houston middle school as one potential new housing option.",

Then, an answer, reports ketv in omaha, neb. Alex was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called hydranencephaly, meaning she was born missing a good chunk of her brain. Most babies with the condition die before their first birthday; the longest any known person has lived with hydranencephaly was 33 years, reports the pediatric brain foundation. ( a july 2014 study published in acta paediatrica puts the former figure at 35 years. ) the foundation notes that some children display no obvious symptoms of the condition at birth, but \" increased irritability, increased muscle tone, and the lack of purposeful movement generally initiate suspicion of an underlying cause. \" alex is now 10. She has part of her cerebellum, allowing her to maintain some awareness of her surroundings. \" she knows her mom and dad, her little brother, \" her father shawn simpson says. \" she knows when bad things are going on; she will cry or have a sad face. \" that experience is backed up by the acta paediatrica study. It observed that \" drastic loss of cortical tissue... Has encouraged the default assumption that these children are not conscious. \" to get a better window into whether that was the case, researchers surveyed 108 primary caregivers of children with hydranencephaly, asking questions like \" will your child echo or imitate you? \" ( 29 % said yes ) and \" does your child reach for objects? \" ( 26 % yes ). Their conclusion, in part: \" the indications that they are not only physiologically awake but conscious during waking makes it appropriate to apply the concept of quality of life to these children. \" ( this baby was born without a nose. )",

The calls offer a glimpse of darren wilson's messages in the moments before the shooting, while video reveals wilson heading to the hospital from the police station some two hours later, the post-dispatch reports. The radio calls, in combination with a witness tweet, suggest that the encounter between wilson and brown lasted just 90 seconds, the newspaper notes; you can hear the clips here. One notable radio call is missing from the record, the guardian reports. Wilson has said he radioed the words, \" shots fired, send all cars, \" but that his radio's channel was changed during the clash with brown. The post-dispatch notes that despite a search through all the county's police channels, it couldn't find the call. It's possible, however, that wilson's call was made on a \" receive-only \" channel; in that case, it might not have been broadcast, the paper reports. Meanwhile, the results of a grand jury's hearing on a possible indictment against wilson could arrive soon. If he isn't indicted, a return to work would be legal, according to police chief tom jackson — but first, wilson would face an internal department investigation, jackson says, per nbc news.",

The question has long been when they did, with a wide estimate putting it between 37,000 and 86,000 years ago based on the dna of people alive today. But now the complete genetic sequencing of a man's thigh bone, which is itself roughly 45,000 years old, suggests that we took a dip in the neanderthal gene pool 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, reports national geographic. The bone was found in 2008 in western siberia; it's the oldest human bone to have been recovered beyond africa and the middle east. \" this is an amazing and shocking and unique sample, \" one geneticist and co-author of the study — published this week in the journal nature — tells the new york times. Because long stretches of dna break into smaller ones over many generations, the researchers predicted that the neanderthal dna in the 45,000-year-old bone would be less fragmented than it is in us today, and they were right. By estimating the rate at which those dna strands fragment, they came up with the interbreeding estimate of 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. ( earlier this year, better radiocarbon dating suggested neanderthals died out earlier than we thought. )",

The image of a hand holding ecstasy pills was the key evidence in a case that sent 11 members of a drug gang to prison. Thomas says that amid a stream of messages on the phone of a suspect, there was a \" photograph of the hand holding pills that seemed like it was sent to potential customers saying'these are my wares, i ' m selling these, ' \" the bbc reports. The photo was sent to the force's scientific unit and while there was no match on britain's national fingerprint database, it was enough to link 28-year-old elliott morris to the supply chain. He was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison after a raid that seized large quantities of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, the birmingham mail reports. Thomas says it was the first conviction in wales based on a fingerprint taken from a photo — and there are likely to be plenty more. \" while the scale and quality of the photograph proved a challenge, the small bits were enough to prove he was the dealer, \" thomas says. \" it has now opened the floodgates and when there is part of a hand on a photograph, officers are sending them in. \" ( researchers say even people who don't use drugs might have cocaine in their fingerprints. )",

Scientists at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology claim to have developed the speechjammer by combining a directional microphone with a directional speaker. They say the gun can be used from around 34 meters, or 111 feet, away, although other directional amplification technologies do reach further, the raw story notes.

The groundhog saw his shadow this morning, signaling six more weeks of winter — or, depending on where you live, six weeks of winter. The ap notes that the season has brought very little snow and only a few extremely cold days to much of the east. Indeed, new york city hit a high of 63 degrees yesterday. The ap notes that the whole thing is a bit of a sham: phil's prediction is actually decided ahead of time by the inner circle, a group decked out in top hats and tuxedos that decides in advance whether he ' ll see his shadow. And he generally does. According to existing records, phil has now seen his shadow 100 times and hasn't seen it just 16 times since 1886.

A resulting algorithm correctly predicted the men's sexual orientation nearly 70 % of the time. Researchers presented the controversial findings at the american society of human genetics annual meeting in baltimore this week, though they have yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal. \" to our knowledge, this is the first example of a predictive model for sexual orientation based on molecular markers, \" says lead author tuck ngun in a press release. A skeptical molecular geneticist said such tests are prone to false positives due to \" spurious associations that are down to sheer chance, \" reports new scientist.

The so-called \" plague of cyprian \" devastated egypt and other parts of the roman empire from about ad 250-271 and likely quickened the empire's fall; between it and a plague a century before, \" about half the population [ of rome ] died, \" a historian tells the university of chicago press. Among the dead: two emperors, hostilian in ad 251 and claudius ii gothicus 19 years later. Saint cyprian, then a bishop in tunisia, described the plague's brutal effects: bowel \" discharge, \" incessant vomiting, bloody eyes, and \" in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion. \" scientists speculate it may have been measles or smallpox, but tiradritti explains that the weather conditions over the ensuing centuries would have \" completely destroyed \" the remains'dna.

Fox news rounds up reports of damage and, in one case, death thus far: as many as 30,000 in the nashville area are without power after 80mph winds raced through the city, and reports say one person was killed by the storms; east tennessee is now bracing itself. Sirens warning of tornadoes rang out in louisville, and possible tornadoes were reported in arkansas. That state has also seen flooding and power outages. \" this weather system will reach its peak intensity this afternoon into the evening. It will only get stronger and cover a larger area over the next 12 to 18 hours, \" a meteorologist told reuters.

            "Chicago ( reuters ) - a wide area of the central and southeast united states faces the unusual threat of tornadoes in january over the next 12 to 18 hours as an approaching cold front clashes with unusually warm air, a meteorologist said on tuesday. The first tornado warning of the approaching storm was issued for western missouri, said meteorologist bill bunting at the national weather service storm prediction center in norman, oklahoma. A warning is intended to signal residents to take cover because a tornado could be forming. A less urgent tornado watch is in effect for a region from extreme northeast texas through virtually all of arkansas, western tennessee and extreme southern illinois. \" it's a little unusual, \" bunting said of the tornado threat. \" we don't see this every winter with this kind of warmth preceding a storm system. \" bunting said a lesser threat of severe storms and possible tornadoes extends over a huge area as far north as chicago and extending east to cincinnati, ohio, and nashville, tennessee, and south into mississippi, alabama and louisiana. \" this weather system will reach its peak intensity this afternoon into the evening. It will only get stronger and cover a larger area over the next 12 to 18 hours, \" he said. In arkansas, forecasters predicted winds of up to 80 miles",

A suspected tornado swept through the southwest georgia town of adairsville, killing one person and injuring nine others in bartow county. Deal says eight people were injured in gordon county and two of the injured were in critical condition wednesday afternoon. There were reports that people were trapped in homes and businesses in georgia, and television footage showed large sections of a sprawling manufacturing plant had been destroyed. Crews hope to complete search and rescue efforts by 10 p.m. The same storm system was blamed for a death in tennessee. Most dangerous were powerful wind gusts that in several places were powerful enough to overturn tractor trailers. Wztv reports one person in the nashville area was killed as a line of strong storms packing up to 80 mph winds tore through the state, triggering tornado warnings and producing strong downpours of rain. The station reports four others were injured in a local trailer park and up to 30,000 in the area are without power.
