The lost boys actor appeared before the assembly judiciary committee yesterday to ask lawmakers to approve a bill that would expand paternal rights for fathers in ivf conceptions. The bill would allow patric another chance to seek custody of his 3-year-old son, conceived through in vitro fertilization with an ex-girlfriend. Though patric says he went to \" great lengths \" to become a dad and was involved in the boy's life, the ex was awarded sole custody last year. Abc news reports that patric is considered simply a sperm donor, since he and the mother were not married. Patric says he and the boy's mother signed an \" intended parent \" document, but the christian science monitor article is a bit confusing on a few points: it also says a judge awarded the mother full custody because there was no written agreement between the pair... And it says patric claims he couldn't make his case before a judge due to current california law. In any case, this bill would give courts greater discretion with regard to fathers in similar custody cases. The issue is a complicated one, and many women's rights groups oppose the bill, but the assemblyman who introduced it says it would only apply in cases where the fathers have been significantly involved already.",

Formerly, users who wanted to undergo a \" full delete \" had to pay $ 19 to do so.

The now 37-year-old former chemist for the massachusetts department of public health and the massachusetts state police was arrested in 2013 and sentenced in 2014 to 18 months in jail for getting high on the job using drugs lifted from the amherst lab where she worked, per npr. But this week the full extent of her activities discovered during the state's investigation were released, and it wasn't just an occasional drug dalliance that caused her troubles: from 2005 to 2013, farak was a heavy user of cocaine, lsd, and meth at the lab, among other drugs, and she even whipped up her own crack cocaine using lab supplies — which could call into question 30,000 cases she handled, per the new york daily news. And throughout her entire binge, no one noticed a decline in her work, with one colleague even calling her \" meticulous \" and \" dedicated to her work. \" farak's first experience with the lab's testing ( aka \" standard \" ) drugs was with meth, which she admitted she tried one year into her amherst stint out of \" curiosity, \" per the state ag's report; she researched the drug and thought, \" that's the one i am going to try if i am going to try it. \" she enjoyed the high and moved on to other drugs, including ones brought in by trafficking cops, after she ran through almost all of the lab's meth, trying coke, lsd, and a host of others. She narrowly avoided discovery during at least two visits from state police, and co-workers finally started noticing her \" deteriorating \" appearance and persistent inquiries about drug deliveries. In 2013 drugs were discovered missing, and she pleaded guilty in 2014 to evidence tampering, larceny of controlled substances, and unlawful possession charges. \" this is a statewide scandal, and i think it's going to take an enormous toll on the system, \" luke ryan, a lawyer who reps some of the defendants whose samples farak tested, tells the boston herald.

But, as drew mcweeny explains at hitfix, that's not exactly correct: leroy was \" a literary phenomenon in the late ' 90s, \" a secretive young author who counted bono and billy corgan among his fans, but who was actually a woman named laura albert. Albert's musician husband, geoff knoop, ultimately convinced his half-sister, savannah knoop, to pretend to be leroy in public appearances; she would wear cartoonishly obvious male disguises like sunglasses, hats, and wigs. Albert was always there, supposedly as leroy's manager. The dupe carried on for about 10 years before it unraveled, per vanity fair. \" since much of leroy's work referenced his struggles with identity and gender, there was something sort of brilliant about having a woman play the part in public, \" mcweeny writes. Still, it's odd that the official description of the leroy biopic calls it \" a hollywood-set transgender story, \" since neither laura albert nor savannah knoop was actually transgender, mcweeny notes. Also interesting: the reporter calls savannah \" kroop, \" not \" knoop, \" and says she was the one \" behind the complicated ruse, \" not albert. Stewart would reportedly play savannah, reports vulture, which does have the last name as \" knoop \" and says savannah co-wrote the script; the reporter says the movie is based on savannah's memoir and life rights.

A study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences finds people age at what the guardian calls \" wildly different rates, \" with biological ages not matching up to their chronological ones. Researchers studied 871 new zealanders born in 1972 or ' 73 at the ages of 26, 32, and 38. Using a set of 18 biological markers such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and metabolism, scientists calculated each subject's biological age — and while most came in around where they should be, there were others who clocked in as either \" younger \" or \" older. \" \" the overwhelming majority are biologically in their mid-40s or younger, but there are a handful of cases who are in pretty bad shape, \" one of the study's authors says, per the guardian. One \" extreme case \" had the unfortunate designation of basically being a 61-year-old, the paper notes. And those who ranked on the \" older \" side of things didn't just suffer the indignity of being given this label. \" already, before midlife, individuals who were [ aging ] more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain [ aging ], self-reported worse health, and looked older, \" the researchers write. Why knowing who seems to age faster than others is important: scientists hope to be able to study younger people's physiology for warning signs of diseases they haven't yet developed so that anti-aging therapies can be honed and maximized. \" what we need are measurements that can show whether these therapies are working, so we don't have to wait 50 years to see if someone is still alive or not, \" the scientists say, per the guardian.

She apparently feels little pressure, to boot ( beware, scientology jargon ahead ): \" when you really cognate that you are a thetan and you have a mind and body, and that the mest universe does not control you — it puts things into perspective. It takes the weight off you and things become very easy. \" she claims she's so utterly relaxed that other actors are begging to know her secret. It was \" such a compliment and testament to the auditing i have done \" when a fellow actor \" turned to me one day and asked, ' how are you always so relaxed? nothing seems to bother you.

But her victory there was only symbolic: delegates were awarded at the state's caucuses in march, which sanders won, receiving 15 delegates to 10 for clinton. Pollsters say sanders managed to defeat clinton among west virginia democratic voters who want the next president to be more liberal and those who want the exact opposite, reports politico, which notes that the state's registered democrats aren't that wild about democrats: 35 % of them plan to vote for trump in the general election.

He picked up at least 16 delegates in west virginia to 11 for clinton, giving him 1,430 to her 1,716. But when superdelegates are included, her total climbs to 2,238 delegates, which is 94 % of the 2,383 needed for the nomination. Sanders has now won primaries and caucuses in 19 states, as he told supporters tuesday night, but he will have to win more than two-thirds of the remaining 900 or so delegates to gain a lead over clinton in pledged delegates, cnn reports.

Mylan ceo heather bresch saw her salary leap to $ 18.9 million from $ 2.4 million — a 671 % increase — from 2007 to 2015. That was same period during which mylan, after acquiring epipen, began steadily raising its price by 500 %. Bresch wasn't alone. President rajiv malik's base pay jumped 11.1 % to $ 1 million and chief commercial officer anthony mauro's rose 13.6 % to $ 625,000, nbc reports, citing proxy filings. News of epipen's price hike has outraged consumers and doctors, and senators including chuck grassley and amy klobuchar are demanding investigations, reports the washington post. Bresch is the daughter of another senator, democrat joe manchin of west virginia. A company spokesman didn't respond to nbc's requests for comment, but officials have previously said mylan put a \"significant investment \" into epipen after acquiring it. After nearly dropping the old device, they instead launched a marketing and lobbying strategy credited with making the marker-sized stick a staple in us schools and household medicine cabinets. The device delivers a stab of epinephrine to the thigh that halts allergic reactions to such things as peanuts and insect bites. Federal legislation in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also helped make epipen a $ 1 billion-a-year product. It now accounts for 40 % of mylan's profits, bloomberg reports. Since the fda in 2010 recommended that epipens come in packs of two instead of one, the cost of a double pack has exploded to as much as $ 600 from $ 100.

The suit claims that baker was told by the hospital pathology department after the oct. 5, 2016, surgery that he removed the kidney and not the glands. However, two days later he told knapp that he hadn't heard from pathology, the suit alleges. Knapp says that baker called her on oct. 11 and said that she would need a second surgery because \" he did not get everything. \" instead of returning to baker, though, knapp had the gland and mass removed by a mayo clinic surgeon. According to the suit, knapp now suffers from incurable, progressive kidney disease in her remaining kidney, as well as pain, fatigue and, depression.

Anna hackenberg was walking along the beach at torrey pines state natural reserve in san diego with two friends one day last april. A week later, the 31-year-old urgent care doctor woke up in intensive care at scripps memorial hospital in la jolla, paralyzed from the chest down. She would later find out from her friends that she had been hit by a falling boulder, a freak accident on an otherwise calm day. The avid runner spent the better part of the next year re-learning how to perform everyday tasks and manage a wheelchair. But it took her just weeks to decide she would complete the rock 'n ' roll half-marathon in san diego as a handcyclist. The challenged athletes foundation says anna fell in love with handcycling at one of its clinics just months after her accident. It gave her a handcycle soon after that; in a december facebook post, she is pictured using it — and thanking the foundation for allowing her to \" feel the ocean breeze in my hair again. \" after months of training, she will compete in the half-marathon as a toyota-sponsored athlete on sunday. She will have more than 30 friends there cheering her on, and her strongest emotion is gratitude for what she has learned and the support she's received. \"nobody ever let me feel that there was anything to be sad about, \" she tells people. \"for that, i ' m truly grateful. \" her sister notes that anna \" could have let her injury define her. \" instead, she says, \"anna's body doesn't define her — her mind does.

The uk's royal college of physicians is singing a much different tune: it's urging smokers to give them a try. The lead author of a report released thursday says e-cigs are \" the first genuinely new way of helping people stop smoking that has come along in decades \" and could help at least half of all regular smokers dump cigarettes, reports the new york times. \" that's a huge health benefit, bigger than just about any medical intervention, \" says the director of the uk center for tobacco and alcohol studies at the university of nottingham. The report cites a british study that found e-cigarette use boosted a person's chance of quitting smoking by 50 % more than with nicotine patches or no aid at all. E-cigs \" have very little downside \" and should be \" encouraged and endorsed \" for smokers, the lead author tells the bbc, adding that they helped 20,000 british smokers quit in 2014. A public health professor with the university of michigan says america \" is focused exclusively on the hypothetical risks, none of which have been established, \" while the uk \" is focusing on potential benefits. \" the times notes that the royal college of physicians led the us before with its 1962 report on the dangers of smoking, but stanton glantz of the university of california says british researchers \" are going off a cliff \" and \" taking england into a series of policies that five years from now they all will really regret. \" he cites his own study that found e-cigarettes actually lowered a person's chance of quitting smoking.

Finally, the bill would allow doctors to reject requests for vasectomies or viagra if their \" personal, moralistic, or religious beliefs \" wouldn't let them do so in good conscience. Farrar tells the tribune, tongue in cheek, that semen not put toward a pregnancy \" is a waste \" because it's only supposed to be used \" for creating more human life. \" she tells the houston chronicle that while many are finding her bill \" funny, \" what isn't hilarious \" are the obstacles that texas women face every day … placed there by legislatures making it very difficult for them to access health care. \" gop state rep. Tony tinderholt, who has submitted a bill that would criminalize all abortions in texas, says in a statement he's \" embarrassed \" for farrar and that she needs to go take a biology class if she thinks comparing masturbation to abortion is valid.",

The first polls close in kentucky and indiana at 6pm, and things truly start picking up an hour later when polls start closing in virginia, georgia, and florida. It's possible we won't know big answers for weeks, but some early races on the east coast could provide a sense of where things are headed. Examples: bellwether race? at roll call, lindsey mcpherson is keeping an eye on the race for an open house seat in virginia. If democrat leslie cockburn defeats republican denver riggleman in the 5th district, which includes charlottesville, \" the wave election democrats have hoped for will be in full effect, \" writes mcpherson. Trump won the district by 11 points in 2016. Or maybe this one: another house race in virginia, in the 7th district, pits democrat abigail spanberger and against incumbent dave brat, the republican who upset eric cantor a few years ago. Nbc news reports that the race will test the strength of the \" pink wave \" of female candidates as well as whether college-educated suburban voters will turn against trump. \" it's a good early test of how far the'suburban revolt ' will take democrats, \" says david wasserman of the cook political report.",

        "summary": "President trump's address to congress tuesday night continues to reverberate in part because of the mostly positive reviews. Here's a look at some of the coverage: politico suggests the speech, and what it signifies about the president, could have a big effect on the 2018 congressional races. Would-be republican candidates leery of aligning themselves with a more bombastic trump could have a change of heart, and democrats ' hopes of big, easy gains might fade. Read it here. But, wait, what's all this about a suddenly \" presidential \" trump, wonders brian beutler in a new republic piece with a headline calling the media reaction to the speech \" shameful. \" another piece along these lines at cnn blasts the \" ridiculous gushing. \" in an essay at fox news, newt gingrich lauds the speech as the best of trump's life, one that shows he \" is a serious man focused on achieving serious results. \" read the op-ed here. A new york times analysis says the speech does not represent a substantive shift for trump, but a lesser nod to political reality. \" it is a recognition by the white house, from mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to mr. Trump said. \" read the piece here. Another analysis by greg sargent at the washington post says the speech deserves to be taken seriously, though he finds support for both sides of the \" new trump \" argument: \" the substantive evidence plainly weighs in favor of the argument that trump's evolution is largely cosmetic — that bannonism remains the driving force behind the trump presidency. However, it's at least possible we may be seeing the beginnings of a genuine search for a different rationale. \" he lays it out here. A post at axios says the speech's relatively optimistic tone was the result of others weighing in besides steve bannon and stephen miller, namely ivanka trump, jared kushner, and mike pence. ( newsweek says ivanka, in particular, \" set the tone. \" ) usual trump critic van jones of cnn praised the speech, saying that when trump singled out the widow of a navy seal, \" he became president in that moment. \" jones, however, then took all kinds of flak for the praise, notes the huffington post.",

Court papers filed in the case against five alleged human smugglers provide more insight into how the \" stash house \" came to be, and how police uncovered it. The houston chronicle reports that the tip came from a worried grandmother, who reached out to local police after being contacted by a smuggler who demanded $ 13,000 in order to transport her daughter and two young grandchildren to chicago — a trip the woman said her daughter had paid the smugglers $ 15,000 to facilitate. Pay the ransom, the grandmother was told, or the smugglers would \" make her family disappear. \" kprc previously reported the 24-year-old and her children didn't show up at a prescribed meeting place last tuesday night. The grandmother's tip brought police to the pearland-area home; neighbors told khou they had no inkling of what was going on inside, but it didn't take police long to figure it out: one set of officers stopped a ford mustang that was exiting the property and noticed \" a black semi-automatic handgun protruding from beneath the front passenger seat \"; other officers saw three men jump a fence and flee; still a third group observed men wearing only underwear inside, and called the department of homeland security. Why the lack of clothing? per the filing, the alleged smugglers locked up their hostages ' clothes and shoes to make fleeing difficult; deadbolt locks, boarded-up windows, a wooden paddle, stun gun, and firearms also assisted to that end. Those held there, some for at least six weeks, hailed from el salvador, mexico, guatemala, and honduras. An initial court appearance is today scheduled for the five accused, who are charged with hostage-taking and violence with a firearm. ( click for more on what was found inside the home. )",

In several of these, he is seen to be wearing a jacket stitched with the flag of the white supremacist state of rhodesia. In the manifesto — which you can read here, and is not signed — the author concludes, after two thousand words articulating his theories justifying racial violence: i have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real kkk, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and i guess that has to be me. Read the full document below: i was not raised in a racist home or environment. Living in the south, almost every white person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply beause of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country. But it is a superficial awareness. Growing up, in school, the white and black kids would make racial jokes toward each other, but all they were were jokes. Me and white friends would sometimes would watch things that would make us think that",

Is she back in the political game? \" i think she just needed a little time out of the spotlight to regenerate, \" a top bush adviser tells politico. \" but now that she's back she's throwing a lot of wattage. \" the star of the last convention, john mccain, will get a turn on stage to discuss national security and defense. And romney himself will put in a satellite appearance around the same time to discuss veterans issues, the ap reports. Notably absent from the slate: anyone named george bush. Much like paul, both former presidents will be honored in a video tribute instead. Of course the biggest question, at least for fashion cops in the audience, is this: will ryan wear a suit that actually fits?",

The bizarre case has its roots in 2011, when 16-year-old north port high school quarterback marcus freeman died in a march car crash on his way home from a painful dental visit; principal george kenney had taught him to hypnotize himself to deal with pain during games. A month later, 16-year-old wesley mckinley hanged himself after being hypnotized by kenney three times, including on the day before his death. Friends say wesley couldn't remember his own name after hypnosis sessions to improve his guitar playing. Nbc news reports 17-year-old brittany palumbo hanged herself in her closet 5 months later, after kenney hypnotized her to improve her sat scores. An investigation launched after wesley's death found kenney hypnotized up to 75 students, staff members, and others starting in 2006, the herald-tribune reports. A school district official had warned him to stop hypnotizing students three times by the time the deaths started. A lawyer for the families says kenney never admitted wrongdoing or apologized to the families. \" he altered the underdeveloped brains of teenagers, and they all ended up dead because of it. \" in 2011, the tampa tribune spoke with a psychologist who said that while it's \" not really likely \" that hypnosis can cause suicide, it can \" trigger some sort of mental health problem that was dormant. \" nbc news notes kenney had received training at a hypnosis center in the state, but he had no license to practice therapeutic hypnosis. Kenney resigned in 2012, pleaded no contest to two misdemeanors, served one year of probation, and is currently operating a bed and breakfast in north carolina.

            "Wsb-tv - atlanta a georgia man charged with vehicular homicide following the death of his bride is out of jail on bond. The deadly crash happened in late december in cherokee county, about 30 miles northwest of atlanta. The couple had just left their wedding reception when their car veered off the road and rolled down an embankment. The georgia state patrol issued a warrant for the arrest of ryan quinton earlier this week. Crime lab results show his blood alcohol level on dec. 29, the night of the crash, was.114. The legal limit in georgia is.08. Troopers say kali quniton and her husband ryan had just left their wedding reception at the nearby wheeler house when their sports car veered off the road and rolled down a steep embankment, trapping kali underneath. Chris thomas witnessed the horrific crash. \" i ' m thankful i didn't see anything other than the car, \" thomas said. Thomas said he saw quinton stumbling along the side of the road and called 911. \" he was shaken up. He wasn't making a whole lot of sense. He was hysterical, \" thomas said. Thomas said the hardest part for him was seeing the wedding party show up and learning what happened. \" they still had their bridesmaid's gowns on and they were all dressed up for a party,",
            "A georgia man has been charged with killing his newlywed in a december drunken driving crash — only hours after the two tied the knot. Ryan quinton, 28, originally told cops he'd seen a dog on a rural highway when he swerved out of the way and lost control of his pontiac firebird, ejecting 25-year-old kali dobson from the car. The vehicle came to rest in an embankment, on top of the blond-haired newlywed. Tests showed quinton had a 0.114 blood-alcohol level, above the state's.08 limit. Quinton, of jasper, was booked at the cherokee adult detention center on wednesday and charged with dui, weaving over a roadway, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. He was later released on a $ 25,000 bond, lt. Jay baker told the daily news. Kali dobson, 25, died at the scene before emergency workers could respond.

        "summary": "There are two camps when it comes to the so-called gospel of jesus ' wife: one that believes the coptic fragment is the real deal, and one that's convinced it's a fake. There's evidence to back up either side: radiocarbon dating indicates the papyrus dates to ad800, and tests on the ink suggest it's the same type used at that time. If the ink is authentic, it's \" conceivable \" that someone might have scraped ancient ink from another ancient document, mixed it with water, and created the piece, but \" no one has ever actually shown that this has ever been done, \" reports the atlantic. On the other hand, the document's words and phrases — even a grammatical error — appear to have been copied directly from another ancient document, the gospel of thomas, leading to doubts. Now new evidence suggests that if the story of the gospel's travels is true, a man who once owned the papyrus may have risked all to get it. The current owner remains anonymous, but documents show he or she bought the papyrus in 1999 from hans-ulrich laukamp, who died in 2002; laukamp apparently got it from east germany in 1963, but those who knew him say he was living on the opposite side of the berlin wall at the time and didn't collect antiquities. West berliners could visit east berlin but only to see relatives at christmas, and carrying a papyrus — which would've looked like a coded message — would have been risky, reports live science. Is it possible laukamp created a forgery? maybe. Through his manufacturing company, laukamp worked with scientists, engineers, and tradespeople who might've had the skills to pull off such a ruse. He'd also just built a new factory and a new house and opened a branch office in 1999. Creating a forgery would've given him extra cash, but so would selling off the real thing.

Eight fun iss facts to celebrate the 15-year milestone: in the past 15 years, 220 people from 17 countries have come and gone at the space station; more than 26,500 meals have been served, and the complex has expanded from three rooms to 13. Two of those rooms are bathrooms; there's also a gym and a 360-degree bay window. The space station has more livable room than a typical 6-bedroom house, nasa notes. And some of those meals? shrimp cocktail and macaroni &amp; cheese are among the favorites. The iss is 250 miles away from earth and is the second brightest object in our night sky ( our moon being the very brightest ). The iss orbits the earth every hour and a half, traveling 5 miles per second. You don't need a telescope to see it as it goes by. It weighs about 925,000 pounds, or more than 320 cars combined, per nasa. It's 357 feet end-to-end, or just 3 feet shy of the length of a football field with end zones included.

She describes the sensation that shot out from it as \" electric shock pain \" and the swelling was just as bad two months later, reports the new york daily news. Now, nearly two years later, the 29-year-old resident of peoria, ariz., is fighting for her health as she goes from one doctor and operation to the next trying to treat the condition that has resulted in blisters and sores forming up and down her arms and even into her scalp and down to her feet. She writes on her gofundme page that the diagnosis, complex regional pain syndrome, has been rated \" the most painful thing in the world. My condition is so bad that i ' m literally being burned alive. \" for the skeptical, \" the pain is real, \" the washington post writes in a look at kids with the condition. Crps is a rare autoimmune disorder thought to be caused by a disruption to the central nervous system. Some doctors call it a perfect storm, where someone with a genetic predisposition to chronic pain gets an injury that triggers the condition. Azfamily.com reports hansen has met with dr. Katina van der merwe, an expert on the condition who says of hansen, \" she will literally feel the heat come up and it will blister and develop to sores. \" sedatives like ketamine have helped some manage their symptoms, which are expressed differently from one patient to the next, but hansen wants more answers and says she ' ll travel anywhere for professional help. \" i ' m going to keep going, \" she says. \" i want my life back. \" ( this family's four children are mysteriously losing the ability to walk. )",

The vice president has been attacked in state media for remarks he made in tokyo yesterday, warning that the us is \" deeply concerned \" about attempts to change the status quo in the region, reports the guardian. Biden can't expect to make progress if he makes \" erroneous and one-sided remarks, \" a china daily editorial said, adding that \" if the us is truly committed to lowering tensions in the region it must first stop acquiescing to tokyo's dangerous brinkmanship. \" as biden arrived, china's defense ministry warned it was \" fully capable of exercising effective control \" over the zone, but signaled a willingness to defuse tensions, notes the new york times. The zone \" will not affect the freedom of overflight, based on international laws, of other countries ' aircraft \" and it will not be necessary to scramble fighter jets when incoming aircraft pose no threat, the ministry said. Before meeting president xi jinping, biden stopped off at the us embassy, where he urged chinese students waiting for visas to challenge authority, reports the ap. \" children in america are rewarded — not punished — for challenging the status quo, \" he said. \" the only way you make something totally new is to break the mold of what was old. \" in a separate development involving one of the many other areas where the us and china are at odds, washington warned south korea over its plans to let a chinese company develop its wireless network, reports the wall street journal. The warning about the huawei technologies deal is part of an american push to prevent allies from exposing critical networks to chinese technology — and potentially espionage. The issue will no doubt come up when biden visits seoul later this week as the last stop on his regional tour.",

And the reality may be worse: the times notes those figures are from 2012. \" residents who live along the great wall used to pull down bricks \" to sell for as little as $ 5 or use in the construction of their homes; other sections \" were destroyed during urban expansion or the building of roads, \" an expert on the wall tells the global times. A bump in tourism to parts of the wall that haven't been developed into tourist sites has inflicted further harm. Some of the wall's other predators are of a more natural variety: lightning, earthquakes, and floods have caused damage, and the asia times reports that trees have pushed their way through its cracks. In 2006, china enacted regulations that would punish those who take the great wall's bricks with a fine of as much as $ 805, \" but there is no specific organization to enforce the rules, \" and the situation is complicated when the damage occurs on the border of two provinces, per the global times. It runs through impoverished areas, too, and the new york times adds that the regulations are \" a mere scrap of paper \" there. ( it turns out china's great wall wasn't its first great wall. )",

It did come up, but the fireworks turned out to be on immigration and on his mandatory hpv vaccination, when rep. Michele bachmann ( r-minn. ) finally awoke from her slumber and, along with a very effective rick santorum, pummeled perry on the topic. As in the first debate, perry started strong and lost steam and ground later in the debate. It was the second uneven but not disastrous performance for him, topped off by an atrocious answer on afghanistan. All afternoon, the political chatter was about social security. Perry tried to tone down his rhetoric in a usa today op-ed. Mitt romney released a clip of perry saying it shouldn't be a federal program. Jon huntsman criticized them both. Louisiana gov.

Social security is essentially unconstitutional. It shouldn't be there. \" jindal stressed that perry was being bold in raising social security's viability.

And while she didn't quite deliver a perry contrast that her team had curtain-raised - one that focused on social security - she certainly hit him hard, and has signaled a new stage of the race.

            "Fireworks in tea party debate the issue in tonight's tea party debate was supposed to be texas gov. Rick perry's controversial statements on social security. It did come up, but the fireworks turned out to be on immigration and on his mandatory hpv vaccination, when rep. Michele bachmann ( r-minn. ) finally awoke from her slumber and, along with a very effective rick santorum, pummeled perry on the topic. As in the first debate, perry started strong and lost steam and ground later in the debate. It was the second uneven but not disastrous performance for him, topped off by an atrocious answer on afghanistan. All afternoon, the political chatter was about social security. Perry tried to tone down his rhetoric in a usa today op-ed. Mitt romney released a clip of perry saying it shouldn't be a federal program. Jon huntsman criticized them both. Louisiana gov. Bobby jindal endorsed perry and neatly sidestepped a question in a pre-debate interview about whether it's true that \"perry [ is ] vulnerable, especially to a general election audience for having the view that... Social security is essentially unconstitutional. It shouldn't be there. \" jindal stressed that perry was being bold in raising social security's viability. Sure enough, social security was the first topic in the debate and generated",

It's also the first time i can remember bachmann going after a republican rival in one of her fundraising pitches. And while she didn't quite deliver a perry contrast that her team had curtain-raised - one that focused on social security - she certainly hit him hard, and has signaled a new stage of the race.

        "summary": "Women are more likely than men to end a marriage — that's something that's already been established. But a new study casts that fact in a rather odd light. Researchers had thought that was the case with divorce because that's the case in general. Not so. \" the only prior research that had been done on who wanted the breakup was research on marital divorces, \" michael rosenfeld tells live science. The stanford sociology professor, who presented his findings yesterday in chicago, looked at 2,262 american adults in heterosexual relationships between 2009 and 2015. During that span 371 participants split with their partners, either ending a marriage or a dating relationship. Women unsurprisingly initiated 69 % of the divorces, but the genders were split evenly in who ended the dating relationships, regardless of whether the couples were cohabitating. If women were initiating divorce more often because they are more attuned to relationship troubles, they would also be more likely than men to end a dating relationship, phys.org reports. Rosenfeld theorizes women are actually more likely to initiate divorce because of what time calls \" arcane conventions of spousal roles. \" in the study, married women reported being less satisfied with their relationship than married men. But both halves of dating couples reported about the same level of satisfaction. Rosenfeld points out married women still earn less money than their husbands, do more housework, and spend more time caring for children — factors that could lead to increased desire for a divorce. Meanwhile, he says dating relationships \" lack the historical baggage and expectations of marriage, \" making them perhaps more fulfilling to women's desire for gender equality.",

Writing for the christian science monitor, the urban-brookings tax policy center fellow isn't arguing that you're reading your paycheck stub wrong. Rather, the number on that stub is only the half of it — literally. That's because non-salary sources actually account for about half of the average household income, at least, according to his tax policy center colleagues. They've come up with what they refer to as expanded cash income, or eci, which takes into account a wider range of income sources. The more obvious additional sources like dividends and interest only make up an average of 11 % of our real number. One big overlooked component: employer \" fringe benefits, \" like health insurance and the employer share of payroll taxes, which gleckman writes \" boost our incomes about 11 %, even though we don't pay tax on that compensation. \" another: government transfers ( social security, food stamps, worker's comp, veteran's benefits, etc ), which make up 8 % of the average eci. And while the eci isn't completely comprehensive ( gleckman notes it excludes medicare and medicaid ), \" the bottom line: you probably make more money than you think. And even if it is not taxed, it is still income. \" click for his full piece.",

            "Wages account for less than half of a us household's income. Surprised? gleckman breaks down where the rest of your money comes from. Can new york force homeless people into shelters? why cuomo says yes. Dr. Raymond martins, chief medical officer of whitman-walker health, welcomes patient eddie jones in washington, d.c., in july 2013. Employer-paid health insurance and other benefits can add almost seven percent to the average income of an american household, according to gleckman. How much money do you make? many americans know what their wages and salary are. But they might be surprised to know that, on average, wages account for less than half the income of a u.s. Household. Others might pull adjusted gross income off their income tax return. That adds sources such as business income; interest, dividends, and capital gains; alimony; and taxable social security benefits and pension distributions. Combined, they generate another 25 percent, but still leave out almost one-quarter of income. Where does the rest come from? my colleagues at the tax policy center have just completed a project that aims to better define income, which they call expanded cash income, or eci. It includes a lot of money that many of us might not consider income, but should. For instance, employer-paid health insurance and other non-retirement fringe benefits add almost 7 percent to the average income of an american household. The employer share of payroll taxes bumps it up by more than 3 percent and employer contributions to retirement plans adds roughly another 1 percent. Combined, those employer-paid benefits and contributions boost our incomes about 11 percent, even though we don't pay tax on that compensation. Gross compensation is total comp before your employer subtracts benefits including payroll taxes. If your boss didn't have to pay those taxes, your wages would be higher. The composition of income varies widely depending on who you are. For retirees, non-taxable social security benefits and ira and pension distributions are major sources of income. For low-income people,"

            "Wages account for less than half of a us household's income. Surprised? gleckman breaks down where the rest of your money comes from. Can new york force homeless people into shelters? why cuomo says yes. Dr. Raymond martins, chief medical officer of whitman-walker health, welcomes patient eddie jones in washington, d.c., in july 2013. Employer-paid health insurance and other benefits can add almost seven percent to the average income of an american household, according to gleckman. How much money do you make? many americans know what their wages and salary are. But they might be surprised to know that, on average, wages account for less than half the income of a u.s. Household. Others might pull adjusted gross income off their income tax return. That adds sources such as business income; interest, dividends, and capital gains; alimony; and taxable social security benefits and pension distributions. Combined, they generate another 25 percent, but still leave out almost one-quarter of income. Where does the rest come from? my colleagues at the tax policy center have just completed a project that aims to better define income, which they call expanded cash income, or eci. It includes a lot of money that many of us might not consider income, but should. For instance, employer-paid health insurance and other non-retirement fringe benefits add almost 7 percent to the average income of an american household. The employer share of payroll taxes bumps it up by more than 3 percent and employer contributions to retirement plans adds roughly another 1 percent. Combined, those employer-paid benefits and contributions boost our incomes about 11 percent, even though we don't pay tax on that compensation. Gross compensation is total comp before your employer subtracts benefits including payroll taxes. If your boss didn't have to pay those taxes, your wages would be higher. The composition of income varies widely depending on who you are. For retirees, non-taxable social security benefits and ira and pension distributions are major sources of income. For low-income people,"

The system, which would allow people to reveal counterfeit cash by breathing on it, is based on the ability of a longhorn beetle species to change color based on local humidity, chemistry world reports. Researchers in china are working on an inexpensive inkjet printing technology that works similarly; the ink adsorbs nearby vapors, including those in our breath, and changes color in response. \" it is particularly refreshing to see simple techniques such as inkjet printing being used to such great effect, \" says an outside expert. Comparable research appeared a few months ago, when scientists in michigan and south korea revealed a film which, when touched by breath, reveals images or words. That technology could be used to fight the creation of items like fake passports, wired reported; blowing on the passport could make a special logo appear, for instance. While it's expensive and difficult to create the equipment behind the film — perhaps deterring counterfeiters — it's cheap to produce the stuff once the gear is up and running, gizmodo reported.

        "summary": "The russia investigation caused so much tension between president trump and jeff sessions that the attorney general offered to step down, insiders say. Sessions — a longstanding trump ally who was the first gop senator to support his candidacy — made the offer in recent weeks after trump was infuriated by his decision to recuse himself from the investigation into alleged russian election meddling, sources tell abc news and the wall street journal. The sources say trump was deeply disappointed by sessions'decision, which he viewed as a sign of weakness, though the president rejected the ag's offer to resign. Sessions recused himself from the investigation after it emerged that during his confirmation hearings, he had failed to disclose meetings with russian ambassador sergey kislyak. Sources tell the washington post that trump considers the decision to be a major factor behind the appointment of a special counsel to lead the russia probe. Trump has also complained about the justice department's handling of his attempt to ban travelers from six muslim-majority countries. White house press secretary sean spicer declined to comment tuesday when asked whether trump still has faith in the attorney general. \" i have not had that discussion with him, \" spicer said.",

        "summary": "It's election day, and the media appear to agree that the biggest story is the virginia governor's race. Democrat terry mcauliffe is up against republican ken cuccinelli; mcauliffe has been leading in the polls, but it's very close — we're talking a single digit margin, for the most part. Mcauliffe has painted cuccinelli as a tea partier, linked him to the government shutdown, and made hay out of his support of anti-abortion \" personhood \" laws. In turn, cuccinelli has linked mcauliffe to obamacare and highlighted the federal investigations into an electric car company he co-founded. Libertarian robert sarvis has seen a significant amount of support in polls, and could act as a spoiler. If mcauliffe wins, it will be notable: since 1977, no one in the same party as the sitting president has been elected governor in virginia. More races to watch, by way of usa today, cnn, business insider, and the wall street journal: new jersey: the only other state to elect its governor the year after a presidential election. Chris christie is overwhelmingly likely to win re-election, so the real story here is whether his 2016 presidential campaign will effectively be launched today. ( if you absolutely need more details: christie is running against democratic state sen. Barbara buono, and he's hoping to become the first republican in the state since 1985 to get more than 50 % of the vote in a statewide race. ) new york city: with michael bloomberg leaving the mayor's office after three terms, democrat bill de blasio and republican joe lhota are vying to fill his shoes. De blasio has a huge lead in the polls, and would be the first democrat elected mayor of the city since 1989. He's promising to raise taxes on those making more than $ 500,000 per year in order to fund a universal pre-kindergarten program and to put an end to the city's controversial \" stop and frisk \" searches. Detroit: another big mayor's race, particularly because of the city's financial struggles. Businessman mike duggan is leading over wayne county sheriff benny napoleon; duggan would be the city's first white mayor since 1974. Other notable mayoral races: boston's longest-serving mayor, tom menino, is retiring; the city will choose its first new mayor in two decades. Two democrats are in the lead. And in minneapolis, \" it's like mayor soup, \" says one voter, with 35 candidates on the ballot to replace rt rybak, who isn't seeking re-election.

            "Albany, n.y. ( ap ) — an undeveloped, languishing new york state park named after donald trump should be renamed, two state legislators said thursday, citing what they say are discriminatory proposals from the republican presidential candidate. Sen. Daniel squadron and assemblyman charles lavine, both democrats, said they will introduce legislation they're calling the \" anything but trump act \" and want gov. Andrew cuomo to remove signs for the 440-acre site in westchester county. The legislation comes after trump proposed banning muslim immigrants from the u.s. Trump donated the land to the state in 2006 after plans for a golf course fell through. Budget cuts prompted the state to close the park in 2010, though signs for it remain. Lavine, of long island, suggests the state rename the park for peter salem, a muslim revolutionary war soldier from massachusetts who fought in battles in new york state. Other suggestions include folk singer and activist pete seeger. \" the rhetoric and discriminatory proposals we've seen from mr.

            "Albany, n.y. ( ap ) — an undeveloped, languishing new york state park named after donald trump should be renamed, two state legislators said thursday, citing what they say are discriminatory proposals from the republican presidential candidate. Sen. Daniel squadron and assemblyman charles lavine, both democrats, said they will introduce legislation they're calling the \" anything but trump act \" and want gov. Andrew cuomo to remove signs for the 440-acre site in westchester county. The legislation comes after trump proposed banning muslim immigrants from the u.s. Trump donated the land to the state in 2006 after plans for a golf course fell through. Budget cuts prompted the state to close the park in 2010, though signs for it remain. Lavine, of long island, suggests the state rename the park for peter salem, a muslim revolutionary war soldier from massachusetts who fought in battles in new york state. Other suggestions include folk singer and activist pete seeger. \" the rhetoric and discriminatory proposals we've seen from mr. Trump don't belong in the presidential election, and don't belong in new york state parks, \" said squadron, of brooklyn. \" he has dishonored the state, and should not be honored with a state park named for him. \" a spokeswoman for trump's campaign responded by calling the park \" a $ 100 million gift to the state. \" \" mr.

        "summary": "Uproar ensued after rev. Patrick conroy, chaplain to the house of representatives since 2011, submitted his resignation under pressure from house speaker paul ryan last month. Now conroy, who originally planned to step down may 24, has rescinded that resignation, submitting a new letter to ryan stating that there was no cause for him to be removed from the position and he intends to continue in his role, cnn reports. \" you may wish to outright fire me, if you have the authority to do so, but should you wish to terminate my services, it will be without my offer of resignation, \" the letter reads, per the washington post. In the letter, conroy says that ryan himself never confronted conroy, but ryan's chief of staff mentioned several reasons behind ryan's request for conroy's resignation — including telling conroy, \" maybe it's time that we had a chaplain that wasn't a catholic. \" conroy says ryan's chief of staff also mentioned a prayer conroy delivered during the tax-cut debate in november that some thought implied he was siding with the democrats ( conroy is a jesuit priest, and the jesuit community holds some liberal positions ), as well as an interview conroy gave to the national journal in january. But, conroy says in the letter, when questioned about conroy's ouster, ryan himself publicly stated it was because conroy wasn't offering \" adequate \" pastoral services. \" i have never been disciplined, nor reprimanded, nor have i ever heard a complaint about my ministry during my time as house chaplain, \" conroy writes, but if that was the reason behind ryan's request, he says he should have been offered a chance to correct the issue. Hours after the letter made headlines, ryan released a statement saying conroy would remain in his role and that the two will sit down together next week, the ap reports.",

Twenty volunteers, including nine daily contact wearers, allowed researchers to swab various parts of their eyes, plus the skin directly below. Scientists then performed genetic tests on the swabs and on the wearers ' used contact lenses. The tests showed three times more methylobacterium, lactobacillus, acinetobacter, and pseudomonas bacteria — which may cause corneal ulcers — on the eye surface of contact lens wearers than on the eyes of the other study participants, medical news today reports. The tests also revealed 5,245 bacterial strains found in the eyes of contact wearers were more similar to those in eyelid skin than the 5,592 bacteria strains in the eyes of non-wearers, according to a news release. Researchers suggest the pressure of the lenses might change the bacteria in the eye, or the changes may appear due to repeated contact with fingers. A doctor tells livescience that millions of people use contact lenses without issue, but complications that do arise are often serious. As the bacteria found in greater quantity in the eyes of lens wearers is believed to come from skin, \" greater attention should be directed to eyelid and hand hygiene to decrease the incidence of this serious occurrence, \" the study author says. \" our research clearly shows that putting a foreign object, such as a contact lens, on the eye is not a neutral act, \" a researcher adds. \" these findings should help scientists better understand the longstanding problem of why contact-lens wearers are more prone to eye infections than non-lens wearers. \" interestingly, the study found staphylococcus bacteria, often tied to eye infections, was actually more abundant in non-lens wearers — a discovery that has stumped researchers so far.

        "summary": "All eyes are on north korea this weekend for all the wrong reasons. Pyongyang celebrates the 105th anniversary of the birth of founder kim il sung, and there's fear it will mark the occasion with another nuclear test or some kind of missile launch. The us, meanwhile, is flexing its muscle with a buildup of military power in the region as the rhetoric between the two nations intensifies. Here's a look at coverage: the us has sent a plane known as a \" nuke-sniffer \" to an air base on okinawa in japan, reports stars and stripes. The air force wc-135 constant phoenix can detect radioactive debris in the atmosphere. The pentagon also has reportedly ordered the uss carl vinson aircraft group toward the region, though a us official calls reports of a possible preemptive strike on the north \" flat wrong, \" per reuters. In seoul, al-jazeera sees concern that the us will strike the north without consulting south korea. It cites an op-ed in the joongang ilbo newspaper warning that \" a preemptive strike could trigger a second korean war. \" but the wall street journal finds that people in the south are largely dismissive of the latest developments. An analysis at the los angeles times explores a range of possible actions and reactions from all the major players. It points out that us-china cooperation might yet stave off military action. And there's also the possibility the us would negotiate directly with the north. Kim might be aiming for another big payday from the south, suggests an op-ed at the guardian: \" it's important to remember that... Cash goes a long way, especially in north korea. That's why donald trump and rex tillerson should keep south korea in the loop. \" the birth anniversary of the nation's founder, april 15, is known as the day of the sun and is the nation's most important holiday. The pageantry \" reinforces the cult of personality around the kim family, \" observes reuters. The washington post also has background on the day, noting that this \" personality cult \" has allowed the kims to keep power. A former acting cia chief thinks president trump should reel it in, reports politico. Mike morell, who served under president obama, says \" bluster \" is \" raising the crisis. \" the north criticized trump as \" vicious and aggressive \" on friday and talked tough about retaliating in the event of any attack, while china tried to bring things down to a simmer.",

For starters, contrary to initial reports that clinton had gone a remarkable 6-for-6, it turns out there were several more flips involved, and sanders won his fair share of them, reports cnn. But the larger issue is that these coin tosses had very little impact on the bottom-line result of clinton being the winner, say current and former elections officials. That's thanks to the complex formula used in iowa to pick a winner via delegates: the ones decided by the coin flips were county delegates, who make up just a fraction of the state delegates who decide the outcome. One former election official tells the atlantic \" with absolute certainty \" that the coin tosses didn't mean much in the grand scheme of things — they just drew a lot of attention given how close the race was. The reason for the confusion over the total number of flips? some county officials used the party smartphone app to report results, and some didn't, reports the des moines register. The app makes clear when a coin toss was involved, and of the seven reported via the app, sanders won six, including one against martin o ' malley. Other coin tosses surfaced on social media, including this one that went in clinton's favor. The toss comes into play only when a caucus vote ends in a tie.

How many is not exactly clear — the state party doesn't track all the games of chance that occur as part of the complex process for divvying up delegates at hundreds of caucus sites across the state. But despite initial reports that hillary clinton had improbably run the table, it appears that bernie sanders won a sizable share of coin tosses as well, according to information provided on tuesday by the state democratic party. Delegates to the democratic national convention are the main prize of any caucus or primary, and the percentage of the vote in each of 1,681 iowa precincts is used to determine how many delegates each candidate earns. Yet because these percentages are often messy, the democratic rules call for precinct chairmen to use games of chance — coin flips — when the delegates can't be determined simply by rounding up or down. ( a photo of the relevant section was tweeted by univision's fernando peinado. ) games of chance have been included in the democratic caucus rules \"forever, \" said norm sterzenbach, a former executive director of the state party who oversaw the nominating contests in 2008 and 2012. \"it happens, but it"

Indeed. Here's proof: watch one of these coin-toss tiebreakers in this video, taken by univision reporter fernando peinado at a caucus precinct: except that doesn't tell the whole story. In fact, there were at least a dozen tiebreakers — and \" sen. Sanders won at least a handful, \" an iowa democratic party official told npr.",
            "Updated at 5: 32 p.m. Eastern on february 2, 2016 the democratic caucuses in iowa on monday were so close that more than a dozen delegates were awarded based on coin flips. How many is not exactly clear — the state party doesn't track all the games of chance that occur as part of the complex process for divvying up delegates at hundreds of caucus sites across the state. But despite initial reports that hillary clinton had improbably run the table, it appears that bernie sanders won a sizable share of coin tosses as well, according to information provided on tuesday by the state democratic party. Delegates to the democratic national convention are the main prize of any caucus or primary, and the percentage of the vote in each of 1,681 iowa precincts is used to determine how many delegates each candidate earns. Yet because these percentages are often messy, the democratic rules call for precinct chairmen to use games of chance — coin flips — when the delegates can't be determined simply by rounding up or down. ( a photo of the relevant section was tweeted by univision's fernando peinado. ) games of chance have been included in the democratic caucus rules \"forever, \" said norm sterzenbach, a former executive director of the state party who oversaw the nominating contests in 2008 and 2012. \"it happens, but it"

In a paper published in the journal trends in cognitive sciences, researchers say that when we see an expression on another face it activates what is called \" sensorimotor simulation, \" in which we automatically mimic the other's expression, helping us understand and react to the other person's emotion. This reaction takes place in the space of a few hundred milliseconds and happens completely unconsciously, researchers say. The facial muscles don't always move, but the relevant parts of the brain are still activated. The muscle reaction helps the brain access memories of similar emotional states, the researchers say. Medical news today notes that in the distant past, our ability to read a stranger's expression in a split-second could have meant the difference between life and death. \" it's kind of like an extreme version of putting yourself in someone else's shoes, \" lead researcher adrienne wood, a social psychologist at the university of wisconsin, tells the christian science monitor. \" you're putting yourself in someone else's facial expression. \" the researchers say that a better understanding of how we \" can infer complex mental states from even the slightest facial expression \" could help develop new treatments for people with social disorders.

Garrido's known attacks include a 1972 rape and kidnapping and three more assaults in 1976, one of which led to his conviction on kidnapping and rape charges. He served 11 years of his sentence, was paroled in 1988, and abducted dugard three years later in south lake tahoe, yet he was never a suspect. The da's office will partner with a senator to look into the mistakes made in the case, with an eye on creating new laws to make sure the situation is not repeated. The newly released materials also included video clips taken by nancy garrido, which had been doused with a chemical agent and were restored after hundreds of hours of work.

        "summary": "When there's a lot of snow out there, you can either make a snowman, a snow angel, or just x-ray the snowflakes. And if you do the latter, you can figure out how many different designs snowflakes take. Chemistry teacher and blogger andy brunning has created this graphic, which categorizes these designs into 39 different types, smithsonian reports. Based on japanese research, brunning's graphic logs 35 flakes and a combo of sleet, ice, hail, and a hydrometeor particle rounding out the rest. Though it doesn't confirm every snowflake is unique, the 39 categories have a pretty impressive 121 more subtypes. The variety depends on temperature and humidity, brunning writes on his blog — low humidity creates simpler shapes, while high humidity create more complex ones. A fellow scientist at caltech offers this poetic description for the snowflake's creation: \" the story begins in a cloud, \" he writes, when a droplet turns to ice. The ice turns into a prism and grows branches from its six corners, then is \" blown to and fro inside the clouds. \" temperature changes then \" morph the arms into different shapes and give us the diverse snowflakes and crystals we see. \" in the field of crystallography, scientists study these designs by passing x-rays through the flake. The design is simply an arrangement of atoms and the x-ray is diffracted as it passes through them; the diffraction pattern reveals the design, brunning explains.

            "Frequently asked questions... Things you always wanted to know about snow crystals... Why do snow crystals form in such complex and symmetrical shapes? to see why snowflakes look like they do, consider the life history of a single snow crystal, as shown in the diagram at right. ( click on the picture for a larger view. ) the story begins up in a cloud, when a minute cloud droplet first freezes into a tiny particle of ice. As water vapor starts condensing on its surface, the ice particle quickly develops facets, thus becoming a small hexagonal prism. For a while it keeps this simple faceted shape as it grows. As the crystal becomes larger, however, branches begin to sprout from the six corners of the hexagon ( this is the third stage in the diagram at right ). Since the atmospheric conditions ( e. G.

            "More than a few artists have proved that macrophotography has merits beyond simply magnifying very small things. It can also capture aesthetically beautiful images lurking beyond our usual visual perception, whether they're hiding inside a meteorite or on the wing of a dragonfly... Or inside falling snow. Just in time for winter and the onslaught of december snowstorms, russian photographer alexey kljatov has devised a clever way to bring the wonder of macrophotography to the minuscule world of snowflakes. Using a homemade rig comprised of a working camera lens, a wooden board, some screws and old camera parts, kljatov captures the breathtaking intricacies of snow, six-sided symmetry and all. The wide range of shapes kljatov manages to document certainly support the claim that no two snowflakes are alike. And while the tiny crystalline sculptures appear too perfect to believe, the dedicated photographer is able provide detailed instructions in both english and",
            "In the northern hemisphere at least, the idealised vision of christmas involves snow. Whilst no one snowflake is exactly the same as another, at least on a molecular level, scientists have none-the-less devised a system of classification for the many types of crystals that snow can form. This graphic shows the shapes and names of some of the groups of this classification. You might wonder what the shapes of snowflakes have to do with chemistry. Actually, the study of crystal structures of solids has its own discipline, crystallography, which allows us to determine the arrangement of atoms in these solids. Crystallography works by passing x-rays through the sample, which are then diffracted as they pass through by the atoms contained therein.
