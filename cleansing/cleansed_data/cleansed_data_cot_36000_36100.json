        "summary": "The execution of two murderers in oklahoma has been delayed once again amid legal battles over drug secrecy. A judge ruled last month that it would be unconstitutional for the state to conceal the source of the drugs it plans to use to execute clayton lockett and charles warner, but it took what the new york times calls \" a kafkaesque legal showdown \" over jurisdiction between the state's supreme court and court of criminal appeals before the former finally agreed to grant a stay of execution. The state supreme court blasted the appeals court for its refusal to \" exercise its rightfully placed jurisdiction \" before granting the stay a day before lockett, who raped and murdered a 19-year-old woman in 1999, was due to be executed, the oklahoman reports. Warner, who raped and murdered his girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter in 1997, was scheduled to die a week later. With the stay, the state's top court \" will be able to fully adjudicate the serious constitutional issues about the extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection procedures in our state, \" lawyers for the two men said, though the state accused the defendants of derailing the justice system with \" baseless speculation of theoretical harms raised in improper venues. \" after the execution of the two men was delayed last month because of a drug shortage, the state decided the warden responsible could choose from any of five lethal-injection options.",

        "summary": "\" we've just been banksy ' ed. \" so declared sotheby's of london on friday after a bizarre stunt apparently pulled off by the elusive artist himself — one of his prints shredded itself just after being sold at auction for $ 1.4 million. Banksy has since revealed how the shredding of his 2006 \" girl with balloon \" took place, but some think the artist may have inadvertently revealed more than that: perhaps an image of himself, or at the very least a close assistant. Details and developments: the ' how ': banksy posted a video online showing that he built a remote-controlled shredder into the print's frame \" a few years ago \" so he could destroy the work if it ever went up for auction. The video also captures the initial moments of that happening at sotheby's, and this video via usa today shows more reaction from the auction. The id buzz: the video posted by banksy appears to be taken from the vantage point of a man who was pictured at sotheby's filming the scene. You can see an image of him at lad bible. He's a middle-aged man with curly hair, and countless online speculators point out that he resembles a street artist named robin gunningham, one of the leading suspects in the who-is-banksy question. \" all of this is of course speculation but when it comes to banksy, let's face it, everything is, \" observes a post about the auction's \" mystery man \" at sky news. Id buzz, ii: caroline lang, chief of sotheby's switzerland, posted an image of another man who appeared to be activating a remote-control device, and she identified him as banksy, reports the new york times. Alas, the account is private and the photo unavailable. Inside job? sotheby's swears it wasn't in on the stunt, but some are skeptical. One dealer tells the times that he pointed out to staff before the auction that the print's frame was weirdly large, but they had no explanation. \" if the upper management knew, i can't speculate. \" plus, the print was placed in a relatively hard-to-access viewing spot before the auction, then was sold dead last in the 67-item sale, which was \" odd, \" he says. Good question: if banksy did indeed embed the shredder a \" few years ago, \" wouldn't the battery have needed replacement since then? so wonders scott reyburn at the times.

The number of democratic challengers outraising republican incumbents marked a record for this cycle, surpassing the more than 40 democratic candidates who had attracted more funds than republicans in the previous fundraising quarter, according to newly filed fundraising reports analyzed by the hill.

        "summary": "Well, this is awkward: maryland's attorney general, who has gone so far as to film a public service announcement against underage drinking and who is also currently running for governor, was at a wild-looking teenage party in june. The baltimore sun broke the news this week, running a photo ( see it here ) of doug gansler at the party ( in the same shot, there are three scantily-clad teens dancing on a table ). Gansler said he was simply there to talk to his son ( who he says wasn't drinking ), and he initially insisted he had no \" moral responsibility \" to intervene. But at a news conference yesterday, he admitted, \" perhaps i should have assumed there was drinking going on, and i got that wrong. There could be kool-aid in the red cups, but there's probably beer in the red cups. \" gansler and other parents helped organize and pay for the week-long beach trip that preceded the party, as a high school graduation gift, and the teens were apparently only instructed not to drink hard alcohol, with no similar rule about beer. He says he helped pay the rent on the delaware house, where almost a dozen grads were staying, the washington post reports. Two other adults ( ostensibly the \" chaperones \" he referred to in the news conference ) are shown in the photo, one of them apparently holding a wine glass. This isn't the first controversy to threaten his gubernatorial campaign: last week, it came out that he allegedly ordered state troopers to speed and run red lights while driving him even to routine appointments, and in august, he made racially charged comments about an opponent. ( meanwhile, some connecticut parents reacted very differently to their teens ' party. )",

Steve sinofsky, who presented the new operating system at its launch and has had a 23-year career with the company, was windows division president. He's leaving \" effective immediately, \" the wall street journal reports via a microsoft press release. Ceo steve ballmer applauded sinofsky's work, noting that \" the products and services we have delivered to the market in the past few months mark the launch of a new era at microsoft. \" taking over windows engineering will be julie larson-green, \" a specialist in user-interface design, \" according to an old microsoft bio. Cfo tami reller will take charge of the business side of the operating system. Some reaction to the shakeup, which news outlets are calling \" abrupt \" and \" unexpected \": the new york times spoke to \" a person briefed on the situation \" who says that the exit was a \" mutual decision \" made by sinofsky and ballmer. Adam clark estes, writing for the atlantic wire, isn't so sure. \" when the press release includes words like ' effective immediately ' and fails to mention the departing employee's future plans, you can probably bet that the employee's departure wasn't exactly mutual. \" at the verge, dieter bohn writes that sinofsky's departure had nothing to do with windows 8 but likely had everything to do with his personality. \" his attitude ( and skill set ) as an aggressive, tightly-siloed windows boss — not a holistic microsoft boss — may have done him in. Given that the future of microsoft's ecosystem would require tight collaboration between disparate divisions, sinofsky's future path as an executive at microsoft was essentially at an end. \" but sinofsky himself tried to put rumors to rest in an email sent to his fellow employees, as per mashable: \" some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing. I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read — about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership. \"",

According to the new jersey star-ledger, it took the jury most of the week to reach the verdict.

Both plan to appeal. Baroni and kelly were implicated in a 2013 scheme to punish the mayor of fort lee for not endorsing christie for re-election by closing lanes of the george washington bridge and causing a days-long traffic jam in the new jersey city. Christie himself was implicated in the scheme — both baroni and kelly testified that the christie administration used the port authority to make life easy or hard for new jersey officials, depending on their support for him — but he hasn't been charged and appears unlikely to be, reuters reports. Regardless, cnn calls friday's guilty verdict another \" major setback \" for christie's political career. Christie maintains he didn't know anything about the plot before or during the lane closures.",

        "summary": "For diabetics, monitoring blood sugar frequently involves pricking one's finger up to eight times daily with a needle, popular science reports. That could discourage people from carrying out the task. Fortunately, experts are on the case, and one possible solution comes in the form of what's basically a temporary tattoo, livescience reports. The device features a small square of temporary tattoo paper with electrodes and a special glucose-detecting enzyme printed onto it. The whole thing sticks to a patient's skin and uses an electrical current rather than a needle to determine blood sugar levels after meals. The current causes sodium ions in the body to move toward the tattoo, carrying glucose with them. In a study on seven subjects without diabetes, researchers found that the device worked as well as finger-pricking mechanisms in its task. And no one found the \" tattoo \" uncomfortable, though a few noticed some tingling in the first seconds of the 10-minute process. \" presently, the tattoo sensor can easily survive for a day, \" an engineer says in a press release. The sensors \" are extremely inexpensive — a few cents — and hence can be replaced without much financial burden on the patient. \" unfortunately, they're not ready for market yet; the team is still working on a way for the device to provide data patients can read themselves. In the future, similar processes could test how effective a patient's medicines are or even tell people their blood alcohol levels, researchers at uc san diego tell livescience.

The \"dad \" refers to lamyaa's father — who she lovingly calls \"baba \" — in saudi arabia. \"the message didn't really bother me, but i felt the need to prove him wrong, \" lamyaa told the daily dot in an email. \"it isn't uncommon for me to receive these types of comments as a muslim woman. \" to show the message-sender he was wrong, lamyaa quickly texted her father and told him she wanted to take off her hijab. \"sweetheart that's not my decision to make, \" her father responded. \"that's no man's decision to make. \" lamyaa took a screenshot of the empowering conversation and posted it to twitter to make a point — and to try and dismantle the stereotypes about muslim women who wear a hijab.

The national safety council predicts 409 deaths and 49,500 injuries on the roads between 6pm tomorrow and 11: 59 pm sunday, the highest projected numbers for the holiday weekend since 2008. One reason is that traffic has generally been increasing in recent years as the us emerges from the recession. But also, the fourth falls on a saturday, and weekend holidays tend to result in more cars on the road and more drinking, reports nbc news. Indeed, 41 % of vehicular deaths on the fourth involve blood-alcohol concentrations over the legal limit, per an insurance institute for highway safety report cited previously by the la times.

Even physicists who pored over every frame of that race are wowed after translating bolt the runner into bolt the mathematical model for a study in the european journal of physics. He uses an almost inhuman amount of energy to overcome air resistance, thanks in part to \" extraordinary stride length \" and \" lots of fast twitch muscle fibers, \" a cambridge physicist tells the bbc. Or just think of him as \" truly a freak of nature, \" writes george dvorsky at io9.com. Some of the eye-popping findings: only 8 % of the energy bolt expended in the race was used for motion; the rest was to overcome the aerodynamic drag of his large frame, explains insidescience. His maximum power output came less than a second into the race; figure about 3.5 horsepower, or enough to power a \" large vacuum cleaner, \" reports popsci. His top speed came about 7 seconds into the race at around 27mph. Even without the slight tailwind he had that day in 2009, he would have busted the record with a speed of 9.68 seconds, say the physicists. All of which might beg the question, is he doping? at let'srun.com, robert johnson makes a strong case for bolt being clean.

A recent study highlights the astounding physics behind this unprecedented human achievement. An interesting thing about bolt is that he's 6ft 5in tall. That means he needs to expend a bit more energy than the average sprinter in order to overcome the drag caused by wind resistance; he's actually not very aerodynamic relative to other runners. But that said, his record was the biggest increase since timing was introduced in 1968. He's truly a freak of nature. According to a mathematical model that now appears in the european journal of physics,",

His large frame means that he takes fewer steps per race than his opponents, but also comes with a cost: he faces more air resistance. Now, physicists calculate that less than eight percent of bolt's energy usage contributed to his motion during his world record-setting performance of 9.58 seconds in the 100 meters at the 2009 world championships in berlin. The remaining 92 percent of his effort worked to overcome the forces of aerodynamic drag.

            "Back in 2009, jamaican sprinter usain bolt ran the 100-meter dash in a record setting time of 9.58 seconds. A recent study highlights the astounding physics behind this unprecedented human achievement. An interesting thing about bolt is that he's 6ft 5in tall. That means he needs to expend a bit more energy than the average sprinter in order to overcome the drag caused by wind resistance; he's actually not very aerodynamic relative to other runners. But that said, his record was the biggest increase since timing was introduced in 1968. He's truly a freak of nature. According to a mathematical model that now appears in the european journal of physics,",
            "At 6 feet 5 inches, usain bolt is tall for a sprinter. His large frame means that he takes fewer steps per race than his opponents, but also comes with a cost: he faces more air resistance. Now, physicists calculate that less than eight percent of bolt's energy usage contributed to his motion during his world record-setting performance of 9.58 seconds in the 100 meters at the 2009 world championships in berlin. The remaining 92 percent of his effort worked to overcome the forces of aerodynamic drag. Researchers from the national autonomous university of mexico made these calculations after developing a mathematical model of bolt's sprinting performance, published in the european journal",
            "Image caption bolt's 2012 olympic record of 9.63 seconds in the 100m final was not his fastest 100m sprint scientists say they can explain usain bolt's extraordinary speed with a mathematical model. His 100m time of 9.58 seconds during the 2009 world championships in berlin is the current world record. They say their model explains the power and energy he had to expend to overcome drag caused by air resistance, made stronger by his frame of 6ft 5in. Writing in the european journal of physics, the team hope to discover what makes extraordinary athletes so fast. According to the mathematical model proposed, bolt's time of 9.58 seconds in berlin was achieved by"

The military opened fired on morsi supporters in cairo before dawn, leaving dozens dead, reports reuters. Morsi's muslim brotherhood estimates at least 70 people were killed. \" they are not shooting to wound, they are shooting to kill, \" says a spokesman. Witnesses say the police first used tear gas to try to disperse protesters, but soon escalated to birdshot and then bullets, reports ap. The violence came after both sides staged mass rallies yesterday. Egypt's military leader had encouraged supporters to stage a demonstration to give him a \" mandate \" to stop terrorism, widely interpreted to mean going after the brotherhood. And that appears to have been exactly what happened. \"this is a preparation for eliminating the brotherhood, \" a political science professor at the american university in cairo tells the new york times.",

Last month, hopkins managed to trademark use of the word, reports the national post and the guardian. Hopkins says readers complained they \" lost money \" thinking they were buying her books — with titles such as cocky cowboy, cocky soldier, and cocky biker — when they bought other novels with \" cocky \" in the title. \" i ' m protecting them and that's what trademarks are meant for, \" she says. But rival authors disagree. A petition calling for the end of the trademark has some 20,000 signatures, reports the new york daily news, while author and retired lawyer kevin kneupper has filed a separate legal challenge. It comes after hopkins sent letters to authors threatening legal action unless they changed their titles. \" i have to admit i am intimidated because i don't have many resources to fight this legally, \" author jamila jasper wrote of #cockygate on twitter, sharing a copy of a letter she received about her own book by the name of cocky cowboy. Noting she wrote a book with the same title 23 years ago, author yasmine galenorn says she \" can't imagine what the trademark office was thinking. \" the romance writers of america has hired an intellectual property attorney in hope of a resolution, and chocolat author joanne harris sees it going only one way. \" if it were really possible to legally forbid authors from using a certain common word in their book titles, then the whole publishing industry would be down the drain in a matter of days, \" she writes.",

The violence is often spurred by false rumors on social media and whatsapp that child snatchers, or robachicos, are in an area, the los angeles times reports. In one instance, a man and his nephew were in a village to buy fencing material when a mob attacked, abducted, and ultimately burned them to death. \" it was like a great spell had overtaken the people, \" one witness tells the times.

That man is now charged in the case. Police say 22-year-old diego uribe cruz attempted to rob his relatives and shot maria martinez, 32 — described as either his cousin or aunt — during an argument, per nbc chicago. He then \" systematically \" stabbed all other family members in the house as many as 45 times each, police say. The victims, some of whom were also beaten, included martinez's parents, brother, and two children, aged 10 and 13. Uribe's 19-year-old girlfriend, jafeth ramos, was at the scene and an accomplice, though she didn't shoot or stab the victims, police say. A neighbor tells the chicago sun-times that uribe was a frequent visitor and \" played with those kids all the time. That family loved him. \" authorities at first considered the crime to be a murder-suicide since all the doors to the home were locked. However, uribe's blood was found inside the house and cellphone records placed him at the scene, police say. Three types of knives used in the killings also couldn't be found at the scene, and a rifle at the home didn't match the weapon used to kill maria martinez. Police say uribe and ramos — who allegedly stole a few hundred dollars, an xbox, and other items, per fox 32 — have admitted their involvement in what one officer calls the worst case he's seen in his 28-year career; both are charged with six counts of first-degree murder.",

The dust storm whomping the red planet since may 30, which covered a quarter of its surface a week ago, now circles the entire sphere. Nasa's solar-powered opportunity rover powered down in mars ' perseverance valley on june 10 as dust clouds reaching up to 40 miles in elevation blocked the sun's rays. Still, researchers expect it to power up again when the storm passes. In the meantime, they have the chance to study a martian storm unlike any seen in the past decade. The \" historic number of spacecraft \" currently operating on mars means \" this is the ideal storm for mars science, \" one that will hopefully provide knowledge \" essential for future robotic and human missions, \" nasa's jim watzin tells cnn. One big question nasa doesn't yet have the answer to: why do some dust storms peter out after a week while others persist for months? that's where nasa's curiosity rover, which arrived on the red planet five years after the last big storm, comes in. Thanks to a nuclear-powered battery, curiosity will continue sending data back to earth from the gale crater, half a planet away from opportunity, per cnet. The storm poses little risk to its instruments, though some extra exposure time is needed to capture images, according to nasa. A tweet from curiosity's official twitter account wednesday describes the martian haze as at the \" highest [ level ] i've ever seen, \" about six to eight times thicker than normal for the stormy summer season, per cnn. \" still safe.

The military veteran tells the washington post his air force training may have helped keep him calm under pressure. After the bear fled the scene, the friends noticed a bear cub in a nearby tree, suggesting the attack was likely a mother bear trying to protect her offspring.

A washington state 34-year-old who was born jeffrey drew wilschke apparently legally changed his name to just that back in 2011, and since then, he's made the news every time he's had a run-in with the law. Most recently, zopittybop-bop-bop was accused of tearing down fliers at the evergreen state college library sunday, then scuffling with a responding police officer ( including allegedly trying to grab his gun, trying to stab him with a pen, and successfully biting his finger a few times and hitting him in the head with a handcuff case ) and fleeing. He then allegedly threw rocks and a brick at a second officer who saw him running, all while somehow fighting off hits from tasers, batons, and officers ' fists alike, the tri city herald reports. A third officer had to get involved before zopittybop-bop-bop was finally arrested. He's been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, third-degree assault, third-degree malicious mischief, and malicious harassment. Zopittybop-bop-bop first made headlines in 2012, when he faced charges of drug possession, weapons violations, and probation violation in wisconsin; the following year, he was arrested on drug charges in iowa. In this most recent case, the prosecutor couldn't verify that zopittybop-bop-bop was the suspect's legal name, although zopittybop-bop-bop insisted in court he had legally changed it. Per kgw, he has said in the past that the name represents \" the explosion of awareness of the interconnectedness of the infinite love in the universe. \"",

' \" giuliani tells the ap. \" they said september, which is good for everyone, because no one wants this to drag into the midterms. \" giuliani tells the washington post that mueller floated the sept. 1 deadline \" as an incentive that if we do the interview, we can have more control over the termination date. \" trump's legal team still has not decided whether he will indeed sit for an interview, and if he refuses to do so, that could result in a subpoena. \" and if they subpoena him, there will be litigation. So no timeline on that, \" giuliani said. The obstruction allegations against trump are just one part of mueller's wide-ranging inquiry, meaning his work would continue even if the september deal happens, notes the times. Giuliani told the newspaper the allegations boil down to james comey's word against the president's. \" we want the concentration of this to be on comey versus the president's credibility, and i think we win that and people get that. \" giuliani's interviews come as the president ramped up his opposition to the \" witch hunt \" by promising to order the justice department to investigate whether the fbi spied on his campaign.",

Cyrus followed up sunday's raunchy show with similarly raunchy pictures of her behind, posted on twitter last night and this morning. In related news, billy ray cyrus ( whose birthday was sunday — happy birthday, dad! ) tweeted that night, \" thanking god for so many blessings tonight. Continue to pray for world peace. More love... Less hate. \" many assumed it was a reference to the hate directed at his daughter, fox news reports, but cyrus explained in a later tweet that he was actually talking about the situation in syria. Meanwhile, quite a few others did react to miley's awards show performance: the parents television council, not surprisingly, is outraged. It responded by asking congress to pass legislation allowing viewers to drop cable channels they don't want ( read: mtv ), the hill reports. ( amusing side note: billy ray is an advisory board member of the ptc, people reports. ) rush limbaugh, who addressed miley's performance on his show yesterday, is similarly displeased, salon reports. He called the performance \" pure, unadulterated rot \" that was \" just this side of onstage pornography. \" it's not just the sexuality that has some people upset: on vulture, jody rosen calls the performance a \" minstrel show, \" noting that miley has been \" toying with racial imagery \" a lot lately, but the vmas performance — particularly when she spanked the butt of a black backup dancer — pushed things over the line into \" what we may as well just call racism. \" on the huffington post, kia makarechi agrees: \" all the elements of nu-cyrus that critics have called foul on in recent weeks were on display: black people used as props, black cultural signifiers like twerking used as a means of connoting that miley's now wild and dangerous, and little in the way of new or evocative imagery. \" click for more of the best reactions.",

That may sound odd, but a study published thursday in cell metabolism found that a man's weight may change the information carried in his sperm and predispose his children to obesity, reports the new york times. Researchers compared epigenetic markers in the sperm of 13 lean men and 10 obese men, as well as the sperm of six obese men before and after weight-loss surgery, live science reports. According to the study, the sperm of lean men and obese men had very different epigenetic markers for genes related to brain development. Meanwhile, the sperm of obese men before and after surgery had major differences in epigenetic markers for genes related to appetite regulation. The study provides \" early evidence that sperm carries information about a man's health \" and not just his genes, live science reports. The study's author, romain barres of the university of copenhagen, says the results could mean men should change their behavior when trying to have children in the same way women change their behavior while pregnant. The results of the study seem to confirm earlier research by barres, which found rats fed fatty food tended to have fatter offspring, according to the times. But the new study doesn't actually show if the changes in epigenetic markers affected the participants ' children, and experts have expressed concern over the study's small sample size.

        "summary": "You ' ll remember the international astronomical union's redefinition of a planet in 2006 as the move that demoted pluto to a mere dwarf planet. But scientists recall the change for another reason: the new classification is incredibly vague. Basically, any nearly round celestial body that orbits the sun and has sucked in or flung away all objects around its orbit is now deemed a planet, reports motherboard. While the latter requirement is what felled pluto, the iau definition as a whole refers only to planets in our solar system, notes ucla planetary scientist jean-luc margot. \" i want a classification that applies both to the solar system and to exoplanets, \" he tells new scientist, and he's come up with a mathematical formula, based on the size of the planet's orbit and the mass of its sun, to make it happen. The formula determines if a celestial body has the mass necessary to clear its orbit and \" when a body has sufficient mass to clear its orbital neighborhood, it also has sufficient mass to overcome material strength and pull itself into a nearly round shape, \" margot says in a release. The formula can be applied to 99 % of 5,000 known exoplanets, he adds, and would allow scientists to identify a new exoplanet without the need for high resolution images. Oddly enough, if the iau adjusts its definition to include margot's formula at the next general assembly in 2018, the moon would become a planet because it has the critical mass necessary. Keep in mind, however, that \" the iau has not defined the term'satellite, ' \" margot says. \" when they do, that will affect what they might decide about double planets versus satellites. \" ( this astronomer thinks pluto should be a planet again. )",

        "summary": "Johnny depp, what were you thinking? critics everywhere are panning the actor's latest flick mortdecai — adapted from kyril bonfiglioli's comic novels — which has a dismal 8 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes. It's a good thing the reviews are funny, because the movie, apparently, isn't. Johnny depp plays lord mortdecai, \" a clueless mash-up of christopher walken and pepé le pew, \" in \" this forgettable piece of bargain-basement low art, \" writes brian truitt at usa today. Mortdecai is \" a whirlwind of horrible british accents, too much gagging and not enough good gags, and weak dialogue that, while not exactly terrible, is terribly boring. \" there are \" many unfunny sex, fart, and fat jokes \" to sit through, too. The film \" is nearly unbearable, \" writes stephen whitty at the star-ledger. Depp, \" who used to be at least an interesting actor, \" is actually \" embarrassing \" to watch. As for gwyneth paltrow, who plays mortdecai's wife, \" she is what other women occasionally damn with faint praise as ' well-groomed ' and about as sexy as a mannequin. About as interesting, too. \" kyle smith sums it up like this: \" mortdecai is mortdifying, a mortdal sin of a movie that's headed for the cinematic mortduary. \" there's one funny moment in the whole picture. Aside from it, the plot and comedy are \" so boring, \" he writes at the new york post. Essentially, \" mortdecai typifies playful english wit in much the same way as wimbledon is known for its monster truck rallies. \" \" johnny depp has done so much for us. Let us now return the favor and pretend mortdecai, a disastrously misjudged career low, never existed, \" elizabeth weitzman writes at the new york daily news. The flick is a gag-inducing, \" baffling display of wasted talent, time and resources \" and \" treats mortdecai's casual sexism, homophobia, blind privilege and obscene entitlement as delightfully charming. \" for more: is mortdecai every cast member's worst movie?",

The new hampshire resident \" passed away in manchester on april 16, 2015, as the result of a heroin overdose, \" her family writes in her obituary. Though the tribute recalls the good things in her life ( she loved harry potter and was known for \" her trademark red lipstick \" ), it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the bad: she attended just one year of community college before \" her addiction took over, \" the obituary reads. \" she made a lot of bad decisions including experimenting with drugs. She fought her addiction to heroin for at least five years and had experienced a near fatal overdose before. \" the obit pleads, \" if you have any loved ones who are fighting addiction, molly's family asks that you do everything possible to be supportive, and guide them to rehabilitation before it is too late. \" her father tells wmur that as soon as he saw police at his door last thursday night, he knew what had happened — even though his daughter had just visited the weekend before and seemed to be doing ok. She'd gone to rehab three times in the past year, he tells the washington post, and after that last attempt had gotten a pizza-delivery job that had her working 55 hours a week to pay off her car. Her body was found in the restaurant's bathroom. \" i see a lot of obituaries from families that are losing [ young people ], and they're all saying they died suddenly, \" her dad says. \" but that's not the truth. If we could save one life... That would mean that molly didn't die in vain. \" ( this 27-year-old's obituary was just as candid. )",

The majority of this newest leak, which is twice the size of the previous 10-gigabyte leak, appears to be the business and corporate emails of the avid life media ceo, according to ars technica. Avid life media is the parent company of infidelity website ashleymadison.com. Researchers believe this second data dump, which contained a note reading, \" hey noel, you can admit it's real now, \" is legitimate. Motherboard reports people within the company had been trying to discredit the earlier leaked data, which included customer passwords, email addresses, and more. In addition to biderman's emails, the newest leaked data appears to include the source code for the ashley madison website and apps, along with more customer data. Researchers say the source code could let other hackers do even more damage. Gizmodo notes that this most-recent release also brings up the question of just how much stolen data the hackers still have. Hackers have previously stated they are attempting to punish ashley madison for its immoral business practices, as well as its cheating customers. Usa today reports the company is calling the hack \" an act of criminality. \" ( click to read about one woman who discovered that her ex used the site. )",

And in a new survey, more than three-quarters of americans identified it as a serious problem in their community. I ' m talking, of course, about alcohol. In a survey by the ap-norc center for public affairs research on american attitudes toward substance use and abuse, 76 percent of respondents named alcohol as a serious problem in their communities.

In what the daily express reports is important news for anyone who'd rather their guests not guzzle their entire wine stash, university of cambridge scientists found drinking wine from large glasses encourages people to drink more wine and more quickly. Over 16 weeks last year, a bar on the cambridge campus alternated between using three sizes of wine glasses: small 8oz glasses, standard 10oz glasses, and large 12oz glasses, reports the telegraph. \" we found that increasing the size of wine glasses, even without increasing the amount of wine, leads people to drink more, \" study co-author rachel pechey says in a release. In fact, sales by volume spiked 9.4 % when wine was sold in the large glasses, compared with the standard ones. \" one reason may be that larger glasses change our perceptions of the amount of wine, \" pechey says, though smaller wine glasses didn't appear to make people drink less or at a slower pace. Co-author theresa marteau says \" there's some evidence to suggest that people consume more rapidly when they perceive that there's less. \" but she points out another potential factor, per time: a wine's aroma, which is said to increase flavor, is reportedly \" greater in a large glass. \" marteau notes a condition could be added to alcohol licenses requiring bars to serve wine in small glasses since that \" could reduce the amount that people drink. \" an earlier cambridge study found large portion sizes and tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks.",

Simply put, hot pursuit is \" ill-conceived, not funny, overbearing, and not in any way worth watching, \" writes claudia puig at usa today. There's no chemistry between the movie's stars and no jokes to keep them occupied, she writes, putting most of the blame on screenwriters david feeney and john quaintance. Puig concludes the flick is \" a stone-cold, super-lazy sitcom version \" of 2013's the heat.

What did his wife say about his expensive buy? \"the guy's saying, 'the blood of 10,000 kings is on this carpet ….your wife will love you, ' \" ben told the daily express newspaper in the uk. \"i buy the rug and i got home and i ' m like, 'honey, i got this awesome istanbul rug; it's persian and turkish and it's got the blood of 10,000 dead kings, ' and she said, 'that's great, but we already ordered the rug that we need for the living room '. \"so now i have a $ 2,500 terry cloth mat when you get out of the tub. \" while affleck realizes his purchase may have been a little extravagant, he isn't the only celebrity to spend his cash on something crazy.

In his toast, obama only lightly touched on us-china tensions, saying: \" our countries together are stronger when we accept the diversity of the views and the contributions and uphold the rights of all our people, \" the washington post reports. In return, xi spoke of the \" goodwill \" between the two countries and said \" more can be accomplished through enhanced china-us cooperation. \" ( zuckerberg spoke to xi in his own language when the chinese leader met with tech leaders earlier in the week. )",

        "summary": "Back in 1995, tupac recorded a song called \" old school \" in which he paid tribute to the rap artists who'd come before him. Among those he mentioned was t la rock, whose single \" it's yours \" in 1984 — mixed in the dorm of rick rubin at nyu — became a seminal record and helped turn t la rock into a \" bona fide star, \" writes joshuah bearman at gq. \" six months after it was recorded, the song had avalanched into a genre-defining phenomenon, \" writes bearman. So why isn't t la rock more of a household name today? that's probably the result of what happened in 1994. The rapper — real name clarence ronnie keaton, though he often went by \" t \" as a youth — suffered a traumatic brain injury while trying to break up a fight in the bronx. When he woke up in the icu, he remembered almost nothing about his life. The profile traces t's slow recovery, initially at a nursing home filled with elderly residents, as he slowly pieced his life back together with the help of his mother. He would stare at old photos of himself and listen to old recordings, and the memories came back in patchwork fashion. The story also looks back at how t came to find his place among the early rap pioneers in the first place. The good news is that t is once again performing, often in shows alongside other rap pioneers such as kurtis blow. Bearman describes one such performance in newark: \" when the song rolled to the edge of the verse, t didn't miss a beat. He knew all the words, and the crowd did, too. T looked out at his fans and grinned. Among the many things he had forgotten was that he was, in fact, remembered. \" click for the full, fascinating story.",

But after a brutal attack put him in a nursing home, he had to fight to recover his identity, starting with the fact that he'd ever been a rapper at all. This story is a collaboration between gq and epic magazine. He was nervous. He hadn't been onstage since the accident. Here he was, 34 years old, a veteran performer, but he felt like an anxious teenager, picking up a microphone for the first time. Would he find the words? he felt somewhat reassured when he summoned the rhythm in his head. He'd approached the mic a thousand times before, first on street corners and in clubs in new york and later on stages around the world. But he surely never anticipated performing in this venue — the rec room and sometimes synagogue of the haym salomon home for nursing and rehabilitation near coney island, brooklyn. Above the makeshift stage hung a long sheet of butcher paper, heralding the haym salomon talent show in bubble letters. After a resident named betty finished reading poems from her grandchildren, it was his turn to take the stage.

A vaccine to protect against a form of meningitis known as meningococcal b was given to 90 % of new zealanders between 2004 and 2006 in response to an outbreak, reports cnn. Later, however, researchers noticed rates of gonorrhea — caused by a bacteria closely related to the one that causes meningococcal disease — had fallen along with those of meningococcal b. With a closer look at 15,000 cases, researchers found the gonorrhea infection rate was 31 % lower among people who'd received the single-component meningococcal b vaccine, known as menzb, than among those who weren't vaccinated. Menzb is no longer in use, but updated version 4cmenb contains the same component and was later used in quebec, canada. Researchers say gonorrhea rates have also fallen among the vaccinated population there, stat news reports. \" this is the first time a vaccine has shown any protection against gonorrhea, \" the author of the study in the lancet tells the bbc. She adds more research is needed since \" the mechanism behind this immune response is unknown. \" ( could mouthwash prevent gonorrhea, too? )",

        "summary": "In traditional, opposite-sex relationships, most women still do the vast majority of chores — regardless of how many hours they work or how much money they make. But for same-sex couples, where there isn't the traditional gender-based division of labor to fall back on, the chores are more often shared and divvied up according to personal preference. So finds a survey of 103 same-sex couples and 122 straight couples put out this week by the families and work institute; all were dual-earner couples. Though nbc news reports same-sex couples didn't share an \" overabundance \" of chores, they did out-share their straight counterparts in a number of areas: in same-sex couples, 74 % share child care, 62 % share sick child care, 44 % share laundry, and 33 % share household repair. The corresponding figures for straight couples are 38 %, 32 %, 31 %, and 15 %. So does that increased sharing lead to increased happiness regarding chores? perhaps surprisingly, not hugely. \" i probably went in with the bias that sharing is going to be better, \" acknowledges the diversity strategy leader for study-sponsor pwc. But on a scale where 5 is most satisfied, when it comes to the division of household responsibilities, gay men scored 4.18 and lesbians scored 3.99; straight men scored 4.02 and straight women 3.82. There was a happiness trigger, though: communication. Per the study, \" when couples discussed what each one wants in terms of labor division, their overall happiness went up markedly, and when they did not, they were much more likely to be dissatisfied with their domestic workload. \" study author ken matos highlights the finding. \" that's probably the biggest takeaway of the survey, \" he tells the washington post. \" how important it is to talk and say what you want.... The people who said they bit their tongue had a lower satisfaction with division of household responsibilities. \" ( should women simply let things get dirty? )",

            "When it comes to dividing the labor at home fairly, straight couples may have a lot to learn from gay couples. A new study finds that same-sex couples tend to communicate better, share chore duties more fairly and assign tasks based on personal preference -- rather than gender, income, hours worked or power position in the relationship. Straight couples, meanwhile, tend to talk less and fall into to traditional gender roles, what one family describes as \"pink chores \" and \"blue chores. \" in dual-income straight couples, women and those who earn less money or work fewer hours tend to take primary responsibility for stereotypically female -- and more labor-intensive -- chores such as child care, grocery shopping, washing dishes, cooking and laundry, according to a survey of 225 gay and straight dual-income couples being released thursday by pricewaterhousecoopers and the families and work institute. The survey, while a relatively small sample, has interesting findings.

He didn't do so himself. No charges have been filed. Some developments: giuliano told police that his sister called from next door about a prowler trying to break into her home. He grabbed a gun and confronted the youth, who was clad all in black and wielding a knife. Police say a scuffle ensued, and giuliano shot the youth multiple times, reports the hartford courant. Tyler, who was adopted by the giulianos a few years ago, is described as a friendly kid without a history of trouble with the law. \" he was just a sweet person and he always made everyone laugh, \" one classmate tells ap.

        "summary": "Talk therapy is a simple but powerful way to stop people at high risk of suicide from harming themselves, according to new research. In a study published in the lancet psychiatry journal, researchers who tracked tens of thousands of danes over an 18-year period found that suicides were down 26 % over a five-year period among people who had attempted suicide and received talking therapy sessions at a suicide prevention clinic, compared to those sent home with no treatment, the bbc reports. In the first year, those who received talk therapy were not only 27 % less likely to attempt suicide again, they were 38 % less likely to die of any cause — and the positive effects could still be seen more than a decade later. The researchers say the study is the first solid evidence \" that psychosocial treatment — which provides support, not medication — is able to prevent suicide in a group at high risk of dying by suicide. \" a study co-author tells bloomberg that even though previous studies showed that one in six people who survive a suicide attempt go on to harm themselves again within a year, many suicide survivors who don't require hospitalization for a mental illness are simply sent home without being referred to a counselor. The researchers, who say the study reinforces the fact that it's \" very important to offer support for people who have attempted suicide, \" plan follow-up studies to determine which kinds of therapy work best. ( a world health organization study this year found that with a death every 40 seconds, suicide \" kills more than conflicts, wars, and natural catastrophes. \" )",

        "summary": "It is being called the \" frozen trucker \" case, and it has sparked debate amid neil gorsuch's supreme court confirmation hearings. As a federal appeals court judge last year, gorsuch dissented from a ruling in favor of a trucker fired for abandoning a broken-down trailer in freezing temperatures in illinois. His dissent in the 2-1 ruling is being targeted by democrats, who say his opinion shows that he will side with big business over the interests of ordinary americans like trucker alphonse maddin, who testified that he unhooked the trailer and drove to safety because he feared he might freeze to death. A look at coverage: the guardian reaps the facts of the case: maddin was low on fuel one night in january 2009 when he pulled over after transam trucking gave him \" muddled information \" on a refueling location. After the brakes on his trailer froze up, he was told to either \" sit tight \" and wait for a repair truck, or try to drive on while dragging the disabled 50-foot trailer, which would have been both illegal and unsafe. After three hours in an unheated cab waiting for help, maddin drove off without the trailer to find warmth. He returned from a nearby gas station after the trailer was repaired and delivered the load, but was fired for abandoning it. Maddin tells the ap that it is \" surreal \" to find his case at the center of a supreme court nomination debate. \" it makes me consider what would the consequences be if my case had gone to the supreme court level and had been adversely impacted by his ideology, \" he says. In his dissent, which can be seen in full here, gorsuch argued that the trucking company was within its rights to fire maddin for disobeying orders. He interpreted a federal law banning companies from firing drivers who \" refuse to operate \" unsafe trucks very narrowly, arguing that it did not apply to maddin, because he unhooked the trailer and operated the truck. Sen. Al franken slammed gorsuch's logic on tuesday, cnn reports. \" it is absurd to say this company is in its rights to fire him because he made the choice of possibly dying from freezing to death or causing other people to die possibly by driving an unsafe vehicle, \" he said. \" i would've done exactly what he did, and i think everybody here would've done exactly what he did. \" gorsuch defended the decision when asked about it tuesday, tpm reports. \" the law as written said that he would be protected if he refused to operate and i think by any plain understanding he operated the vehicle, \" he said",

        "summary": "In another outburst of things actually getting done on capitol hill, house and senate negotiators have rolled out a bipartisan farm bill — only two years overdue. The nearly $ 1 trillion, five-year bill cuts federal spending by around $ 23 billion, including about $ 8 billion from the food stamp program. The bill will be voted on in the house tomorrow but it's not clear when it will reach the senate. The new york times predicts that the food stamps measure could be a problem both for senate democrats, who approved a cut half the size last year, and for house conservatives, who initially approved a whopping $ 39 billion food stamp cut. The ap details the changes to subsidies, which will remain generous, although direct payments paid whether farmers actually farm or not will end, saving around $ 4.5 billion a year. There will be more money for crop insurance programs, but the money an individual farmer can receive on all federal payments and loans will be capped at $ 125,000. Farm lobbyists are broadly in favor of the bill, the hill finds, but meat and poultry lobbyists will oppose it because two key priorities were not added, including a measure to ditch new country-of-origin labeling rules. Anti-hunger groups are also firmly opposed to the bill because of the food stamp cuts. \" they are gutting a program to provide food for hungry people to pay for corporate welfare, \" fumed the chief of the new york city coalition against hunger. Buried deep in the bill is a provision that will please marijuana legalization advocates, the washington post reports. For the first time, colleges and universities will be allowed to grow hemp for research purposes, at least in the 11 states that allow cultivation of the plant.",

One man is said to be critically wounded, while eight others ranging in age from 21 to 46 were \" seriously injured, \" the news agency notes. Around 400 people were enjoying the evening, barbecuing and watching a basketball game, when shots rang out, with witnesses on the scene grabbing their kids and fleeing, leaving overturned strollers in their wake, clickondetroit.com reports. \" through the grace of god, no children were shot, \" detroit's assistant police chief says, per the ap. Authorities speculate the shooter was going after the dead man, the news agency notes, but it's been hard to gather info as the detroit free press reports that party attendees aren't being cooperative with police. Meanwhile, a shooting at a block party in philadelphia left seven people injured last night, the ap reports — and per nbc philadelphia, three of those injured were children. Lt. John walker of the philly police says the gunman in this case apparently just started shooting in the street at around 10 last night, hitting anyone in his path. An 18-month-old girl was grazed on the neck by a bullet; also hit were an 11-year-old girl in the knee and shoulder, and a 13-year-old boy in the chest, per nbc.

            "Robots are being applied in fields described as the three ds, that is, tasks that are dirty, dangerous or dull. A fourth application is use in regions inaccessible to humans such as outer space, remote mountainous or desert land areas, and deep undersea. The jobs most at risk are low skill, routine, highly structured, simple, and rule based, in environments that are static ( unchanging ) and structured ( e.g. On fixed known routes ). For example chess is easy for a robot because the operating environment, the chess board, is very simple and the rules are few and easily defined. Whereas ironing and making beds is hard for a robot because of the unlimited combination of shapes, sizes, appearance, and positions of clothes, sheets and blankets. Even walking and avoiding obstacles is hard for present day robots. The relatively high initial cost of robots means that they tend to be used only by large companies or in defence. It is unlikely that all the humans will be replaced by robots in any task, it is much more likely that fewer people will be needed because for many years robots will be assistants. The future is most likely to be one of productivity gains rather than mass redundancies. Robots are usually thought of as being mobile but they don't have to",

Less than a minute later, an officer described shots as \" coming from upstairs in the mandalay bay, \" per the times. Within minutes, an officer who'd reached the 31st floor of the 43-story mandalay bay commented that he could hear \" automatic fire coming from … one floor above us. \" per a times analysis of video of 15 seconds of the attack, about 90 shots were fired in just 10 seconds. Police communications suggest the shooting had ended by 10: 25pm, when officers arrived outside suite 135 on the 32nd floor, though a hotel security guard was at one point shot through the suite door. It took almost an hour for swat teams to secure the floor before paddock's room was accessed using an explosive device.

        "summary": "So as to not disturb the neighbors, many apartment dwellers in sweden are banned from noisy activities like vacuuming or drilling after 10pm. One activity that is allowed, however, is loud sex — and that's just the way it should be, says health minister gabriel wikstrom. \" my neighbors are once again having noisy sex. You're my only hope: could you ban risqué exercises after 10pm? \" a swede tweeted wikstrom on wednesday, per the local. The 31-year-old's response: \" sounds nice for them, i think. Good for their well-being and thus public health as well. \" the government's apparent endorsement of noisy sex quickly went viral, though wikstrom says his real message didn't exactly come across. The problem: sex gets a bad rap and is too often related to sexual abuse, stis, and unwanted pregnancies. Then there's the fact that sweden's sex rate is falling: a 2013 poll showed the average swede had 3.8 encounters per month, down from five monthly romps in 1996. \" that's a 24 % decline, \" wikstrom says. \" it is often linked to stress, pressure, and people feeling they don't live up to a certain body ideal. That's a problem, \" he continues. \" obviously the state shouldn't tell people how often to have sex, \" but \" we're humans, we need intimacy. \" in other words, \" swedes should have all the sex they want to have, \" even if it's noisy, he tells the bbc. \" i ' m sure there's a lot about our neighbors that can annoy us, but if they have actually managed to get down to business, you have to be forgiving. \" but does the minister follow his own advice? \" it's a pretty personal question, but … it happens, \" he says. \" i am satisfied with my sex life. \" ( an italian had sex so loud it was considered stalking. )",

Unfortunately for marcelo pinheiro — a leader of the comando vermelho ( red command ) criminal group, wanted in brazil since 2012 on murder, armed robbery, drug-trafficking, and other charges — only the first part of the alleged scheme went to plan. Authorities say pinheiro, also known as marcelo piloto, received an 18-year-old woman into his cell saturday before knocking her unconscious and fatally stabbing her 16 times with a dessert knife, per the guardian. Pinheiro's lawyer, who visited shortly before lidia meza came calling for unknown reasons, immediately called for murder charges to be laid in paraguay. But paraguayan president mario abdo benitez wasn't having it. He ordered pinheiro's extradition to brazil, where the cartel boss is now held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison, per the guardian. At the time of his arrest in paraguay last december, reuters referred to pinheiro as \" brazil's most wanted arms trafficker, \" noting he'd allegedly funneled arms, ammunition, and drugs to brazilian communities via paraguay. Saturday's murder comes a little over a week after the targeted assassination of pinheiro's former lawyer in a paraguayan city near the brazilian border, per the buenos aires times.

The nightly show, which debuted in january 2015, didn't grab young adults and hadn't had much impact on social media, comedy central president kent alterman tells variety, adding wilmore's \" strong voice and point of view \" simply didn't strike a chord with viewers. \" we didn't feel that we see enough traction to justify doing another year, \" alterman says of the show created and executive-produced by jon stewart. Per nielsen, both wilmore's show and trevor noah's daily show have struggled in the ratings, the new york times reports, but wilmore has lost more than half of the audience he was handed from stephen colbert's the colbert report, and alterman says noah is doing just fine and gaining ground with young viewers. While wilmore expressed his gratitude to the network for the opportunity he's had — he was also a correspondent on stewart's daily show for years — he seemed shocked it pulled the plug before election 2016. \" i ' m saddened and surprised we won't be covering this crazy election or'the unblackening, ' as we've coined it, \" he said.

        "summary": "Environmental groups first asked the environmental protection agency to ban chlorpyrifos back in 2000. Fifteen years later, the epa agreed to move forward with a ban on the pesticide, which has been linked repeatedly to problems including autism, attention deficit disorders, and developmental delays in children. But the ban hadn't yet taken effect when president trump was sworn into office, and late last month, epa administrator scott pruitt announced that the agency had reversed its decision. The pesticide, patented by dow chemical, which has close ties to trump, would not be banned after all because \" thousands of american farms... Rely on \" it. Now, three environmental groups are suing, asking a federal appeals court to order the epa to ban the pesticide, the intercept reports. \" it's outrageous that the new epa administrator would reject the scientific findings of its own agency, \" says an activist and attorney. The epa, which spent years reviewing studies on chlorpyrifos before agreeing to the ban, had issued its own assessment of how the chemical affects health; in that report, the agency concluded that some young children are exposed to levels more than 14,000 % higher than the limit set by the agency. The epa concluded there were risks of exposure via drinking water, residue on food, and drift to schools and homes, the guardian reports. Yet in its reversal, the epa said more study is needed. Dow, naturally, opposed the ban and had hired a lobbyist to fight it; the intercept notes that dow also contributed $ 1 million to trump's inaugural committee, and the company's ceo heads trump's manufacturing council. Four democrats on the house energy and commerce committee have also asked the committee chair to investigate the epa's reversal and whether intervention from dow played a role.",

An overnight airstrike wiped out a mobile medical unit run by a french relief organization, reports the ap. At least five staffers from the international union of medical care and relief organizations were killed south of aleppo, though it remains unclear who was behind the strike. It comes a day after what is shaping up to be a much bigger issue: an airstrike hit a humanitarian convoy delivering aid to aleppo, and us officials now say russia was likely responsible, reports the new york times. Russia denies it. Two us officials tells reuters that a pair of russian war planes were spotted above the convoy before it was hit, while moscow says the us \" has no facts \" to back up the allegation. In fact, russia says it's not even clear that the convoy was hit from the air, notes al jazeera. Whatever the cause, civilians are bearing the brunt of the fallout, because the un has halted all further aid convoys in syria. All this comes as pro- and anti-government forces battled anew near aleppo and hama, and as the un plans a high-level meeting on wednesday.

Npr checks in on the progress being made in china on a full-scale replica of the titanic that's being built hundreds of miles from the ocean. An infomercial played at the site touts an aug. 30, 2017, completion date ( and features an american who proclaims, \" the chinese are amazing! \" ), and the man at the helm of the project has an unexpected excuse for the missed deadline: \" the movie didn't mention how big it was, \" says su shaojun, referring to the james cameron film that inspired him to build the replica and a countryside resort around it. Su's assertion seems to contradict a statement he made in late 2016 about the titanic's complete blueprints essentially being lost after it sank but pieced together by su's group, which he said spent years amassing blueprint fragments that were in private hands, per cnn. The project in daying, sichuan province, has years to go, though the hull is finished. Su sees the land-locked location ( the ship will float in a not-yet-made man-made reservoir ) as a smart one, saying it lies between chengdu and chongqing, which are home to a collective 40 million people. \" the person who designed china's disneyland came here and said we'd have more visitors than them, \" he says. The originally stated plan to make the attraction \" hit \" an iceberg has apparently been shelved following criticism, but still might be a part of the finished project should it get finished. \" we [ wouldn't ] call it ' hitting the iceberg.
