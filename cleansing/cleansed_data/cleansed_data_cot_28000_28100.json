        "summary": "The families of the 22 people killed in the bombing at ariana grande's concert in manchester in may will each receive $ 321,000. The payments are made possible by the we love manchester emergency fund, which collected donations from the public following the terrorist attack, reports the guardian. Some $ 2.6 million raised as part of grande's benefit concert is also included. Each of the 57 people who spent at least seven nights in a hospital as a result of their injuries have already received approximately $ 77,000 each, while another 96 injured received $ 4,500 each. The fund is expected to total between $ 20.5 million and $ 22 million, with 5 % going to cover the costs of administering it. Officials are still determining how the remaining funds will be spent once all payouts have been made, reports tmz. Discussions include whether to set aside additional funds for those with mental health issues, people who suffered life-changing injuries, or those who were discharged from the hospital quickly but had to return for surgeries, the chair of the fund says. \" there are some gray areas, \" she tells the guardian. Additional payments to victims are expected to come from the government's criminal injuries compensation scheme. A charity concert featuring rick astley, noel gallagher, and others — scheduled to take place when manchester arena reopens on sept. 9 — will raise money for a memorial honoring the victims, reports the bbc.",

Joseph dyer, 54, says ed murray, 62, forced him to have sex in a bedroom they shared at the home of dyer's mother four decades ago. Murray, a democrat elected in 2013, denies dyer's claims and says they're based in grievances between various estranged sides of his family. Regardless, murray announced tuesday — hours after dyer went public with his allegations — that he would be stepping down as seattle's mayor effective wednesday evening. \"while the allegations against me are not true, it is important that my personal issues do not affect the ability of our city government to conduct the public's business, \" murray says in a statement. The first allegation against murray came in the form of a lawsuit filed in april, the washington post reports. A man claimed he was repeatedly raped by murray when he was a homeless teen in seattle in the 1980s. The lawsuit, which was later withdrawn, was followed by three other men accusing murray of sexually abusing them as teens, according to cnn. Murray ended his re-election campaign in the face of the allegations. He denies any claims of sexual abuse, saying he's being targeted for his progressive politics and support for gay rights. Seattle city council president bruce harrell will take over mayoral duties for at least the next few days. He calls the accusations against murray \" unspeakable. \"",

        "summary": "A former ss guard is on trial for allegedly serving as an accessory to hundreds of mass killings at a nazi concentration camp, the ap reports. Johann rehbogen, 94, isn't accused of a specific crime, but he served at stutthof concentration camp in what is now poland. More than 60,000 jews and other holocaust victims were killed there — by gas chamber, lethal injection, exposure, starvation, or simply being shot. Rehbogen, who was at the camp from 1942 to 1944, denies knowing about the killings. But others say he had to know: \" anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives, \" says prosecutor andreas brendel. As he was under 21 at the time, rehbogen is being tried in juvenile court in germany and faces a possible 15-year sentence — which he likely wouldn't serve if found guilty due to his age, per the bbc. He's only appearing in court for two hours at a time but seems alert when asked questions by the judge. For the grandson of one survivor, seeing germany continue to prosecute holocaust perpetrators is empowering: \" her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure, \" says ben cohen of his grandmother, judy meisel. \" to have germany listening to her is very powerful for her. \" ( a \" hero \" who foiled the nazi's nuclear dreams is dead. )",

Wolfgang schäuble's key statement, per the bbc: \" the ecb ( european central bank ) has made it clear that without a reform program for cyprus the aid can't continue. Two big cypriot banks are insolvent if there are no emergency funds from the european central bank. Someone has to explain this to the cypriots and i think there's a danger that they won't be able to open the banks again at all. \" one of its plan b options may involve russia, which received a cypriot delegation in moscow. The wall street journal reports that the group intended to discuss a \" long-shot plan \" in which russia would hand over billions and get a share in the country's banks and offshore energy fields in return. But as of today, \" there were no offers, nothing concrete, \" says cyprus ' finance minister, \" we're happy with a good beginning. \" the other plan bs the bbc floats: bank mergers or a bond issue. In the meantime, the country is considering \" contingency measures \" that could be put in place should the banks reopen, such as daily withdrawal maximums and slowing the pace with which transactions clear.",

And a police official tells ap that adam had some kind of personality disorder. Adam had lived with his mother, a kindergarten teacher at the school who is now presumed dead. She was divorced from adam's father. Police brought ryan lanza in for questioning after the shooting — in fact, he was mistakenly identified as the shooter — but now don't think he played any role.

It's incredibly tight, and with hours to go the parties and some super pacs are doing what they can to give their candidate an edge — not all so successfully. President trump gave handel a boost on twitter monday morning, tweeting, \" the dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and border security. Their obamacare is dead with 100 % increases in p's [ premiums ]. Vote now for karen h. \" cue the analyses of a tweet. The washington post thinks trump is trying to tell supporters that the success of his agenda requires a handel win. \" that's not the case, of course, given the composition of the house. But if handel falls in a district that leans republican, it suggests that other similar districts might also go blue next november. And it suggests, too, that trump may be a drag on the party, not a boon. \" the hill reports both candidates are uniting in denouncing a last-minute campaign ad produced by the principled pac that suggests a link between ossoff and the shooting that wounded rep. Steve scalise. An image of the majority whip on a stretcher is shown ( kathy griffin and the severed head later make an appearance ) as a voice narrates, \" the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting republicans. When will it stop? it won't if jon ossoff wins on tuesday. \" the super pac apparently wasn't the only one to try to make such a connection. The washington post has these lines spoken by brad carver at a saturday get-out-the-vote event for handel. \" i think the shooting is going to win this election for us, \" said carver, the gop chair of an adjacent congressional district. \" because moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism. I get that there's extremists on both sides, but we are not seeing them.... Democrats have never given this president a chance. \" whoever wins, nate silver lays out an argument at fivethirtyeight that the ensuing insights made about the victories will likely be \" dumb. \" a narrow win would reflect \" what we know about the political environment, \" and he feels that win will \" be portrayed as a more important predictive signal than it really is. \" but there's a catch. \" sometimes dumb things matter if everyone agrees that they matter",

So if either democrat jon ossoff or republican karen handel wins narrowly, it will be portrayed as a more important predictive signal than it really is. A blowout result would be a bigger deal. But even then, georgia 6 is a slightly unusual district, and the election would be one data point among many. Georgia isn't even the only special election on tuesday; south carolina's 5th congressional district is holding one also.

A win, conversely, would have a morale-boosting effect; republicans would probably tell themselves that they could preserve their congressional majorities by turning out their base, even if some swing voters had abandoned them. Georgia 6 is a tough district to diagnose because its politics in presidential elections shifted a lot from 2012 to 2016.

A complaint has been made to the gainesville police department about hamill, and screenshots of facebook posts were sent to the gainesville sun. In those screenshots, hamill appears to write things like, \" who knew that reading jewish jokes before i go to bed would not only make me feel better about myself but also help me to sleep better as well. Here is one for everybody, ' what's the difference between boy scouts and jews? ' anybody know? well it is because ' boy scouts come back from their camps. ' \" in another post apparently from hamill, he allegedly wrote, \" stupid people annoy me. Put them in an oven and deal with them the hitler way. Haha. \" hamill, 28, was sworn into the gpd in 2016; the department says it is reviewing the complaint against him and that he has been suspended with pay for now.

Clearly, a lot of thought went into selecting the name — as page explains, it's a reference to human language and the innovation it represents. But picking a catchy moniker is just the beginning of a much more complicated process. As with any rebranding these days, firms also have to make sure they've lined",
            "As sergey and i wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \"google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. \" as part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses. \" from the start, we've always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. More we did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like google maps, youtube, chrome, and android. And we haven't stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We've long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable",
            "So google is now part of alphabet, a new holding company that will manage google and all of its other products. Why is the new company called alphabet? google/alphabet ceo larry page says it's because alphabet means a \"collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with google search! \" but the domain name for alphabet is abc.xyz — not alphabet.com ( which is currently getting hammered with traffic it seems ). It looks like neither google nor alphabet own alphabet.com — bmw does. Alphabet is part of the bmw group and a business mobility solution with a focus on fleet management and financing. Alphabet was founded in 1997, so it's unlikely that the company will give up its long-established domain name. Alphabet international gmbh recently won the international auto finance network awards.

In an open letter released by the trump organization, the business leaders — including paypal founder peter thiel, who recently donated $ 1.25 million to trump's campaign — explain that trump's economic plan is, in their opinion, better than hillary clinton's, fortune reports. The trump plan \" cuts taxes, stops trade cheating, reduces regulations, unleashes america's powerful energy sector, and eliminates our growth-draining trade deficit, \" all while creating millions of jobs and trillions in additional income, they write. Clinton, on the other hand, \" will raise taxes, continue to increase the already oppressive regulatory burden on both consumers and businesses, stifle efforts to make our nation energy independent, and negotiate more bad trade deals that ship our jobs and factories offshore. \" the full letter is available on trump's official website. The signers also include hedge fund manager carl icahn, new york jets owner woody johnson, home depot co-founder and former ceo bernie marcus, former los angeles dodgers co-owner and president jamie mccourt, and david perdue, former reebok and dollar general ceo. Not all of trump's business world donors signed the letter; fortune notes that renaissance technologies co-founder robert mercer, colony capital's tom barrack, cerebus capital management's stephen feinberg, and bp capital's t. Boone pickens are all missing. Earlier this month, a dozen business leaders wrote their own letter calling trump bad for the economy because he's \" too reckless, \" fox business network reports; those signers included wikipedia founder jimmy wales and the former kellogg company ceo. As for thiel, new york looks at why he's donating to trump now, theorizing that the move could be \" a first-round investment \" in the cable channel many think trump will launch if he loses the election.",

The endeavor, which entails swapping out an older oral polio vaccine, began on sunday, reports the new york times, and officials hope it wraps up by may 1. Why the switch? the old vaccine protected against three strains of polio ( types 1 through 3 ), which, per the bbc, can cause paralysis ( as was the case with fdr ). The new vaccine covers two strains ( types 1 and 3 ). Type 2 polio was eradicated in 1999, per the times. And, as oral polio vaccines are made with live, weakened strains of the virus, the weakened strain can mutate and become dangerous. That has happened most often with type 2 polio. \" so removing type 2 from the vaccine takes away that risk, \" a cdc doctor tells the bbc, \" and ensures we have a vaccine which will work better dose by dose. \" and for the switch to accomplish that, global buy-in is needed. The changeover will be monitored by thousands of people in the 155 participating countries, which include afghanistan and pakistan ( the only two countries that are still polio-endemic ) and more developed countries, such as russia and mexico. One potential hiccup, per the times, is the fact that the new boxes and vials of vaccine are almost identical. According to reports, millions of vials of old vaccine will need to be destroyed by incineration, boiling, or being entombed in concrete and buried, among other methods. However, a who official put the number at a \" few vials, not trucks full of vaccine. \" ( refusal to vaccinate is behind the resurgence of measles, study says. )",

She was an advocate for syrian refugees and entered parliament in 2015 after time with oxfam and the bill and melinda gates foundation. Quartz reprints the full text of cox's first speech in parliament, in which she talks about immigration and integration, saying, \"we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us. \" cox's husband tells the telegraph his wife would have wanted people to \" fight against the hatred that killed her. \" \"hate doesn't have a creed, race, or religion; it is poisonous. \" the bbc has a roundup of reactions to cox's death from friends and politicians, who called her \"quite simply one of the nicest, most decent women ever to enter the house of commons. \" thomas mair, the man suspected of killing cox, is \"a quiet man who was friendly but appeared to be a loner, \" the financial times reports.

Australia has some of world's highest rates of skin cancer, which accounts for 80 % of all cancers diagnosed in the country, the wall street journal reports. A recent study found that 1 in 6 melanomas in australians between ages 18 and 29 could be prevented if all tanning salons were banned. \" the clear weight of medical evidence supports a ban, \" says the health minister of the state of victoria, which is banning the devices in salons toward the end of next year. Of course, the ban has its complications. In new south wales, salons have been selling the beds off at big discounts to consumers for home use, which some worry is far more dangerous. Queensland, the most recent state to ban the beds, will pay $ 1,000 per bed in compensation to salon owners, reports the abc, but that's not exactly appeasing some. One tanning salon owner in brisbane says he plans to \" go down fighting, \" noting that his beds cost him $ 40,000 each. \" what am i going to do with all this equipment, hand it back to them for $ 1,000? to be honest with you, i ' m not going to hand it back, i ' ll go to court. \"",

        "summary": "As the fda considers how to regulate e-cigarettes, a recent study finds very tentative reason for concern: when it comes to promoting cancer development in certain types of lung cells, it may not matter whether you're smoking the real thing or the nicotine-laced vapor in an electronic cigarette. How the test-tube study worked: researchers grew human lung cells, which had been altered to have mutations related to cancer risk, in two types of liquids. One had been exposed to e-cigarette vapor, the other to tobacco smoke. Both sets of cells changed — in ways associated with cancer, the new york times reports. There are a number of caveats, from the researchers themselves: no actual smokers were involved, and no connection between e-cigarettes and cancer was proven. And the study hasn't yet been published; its results were aired at a january meeting of lung cancer researchers, and received little attention at the time. But lead researcher dr. Steven dubinett stressed what it does show: how in the dark we are about the long-term health consequences of using e-cigarettes and their ingredients. As far as ingredients go, e-cigarettes generally contain three: nicotine, flavoring, and propylene glycol. Scientific american notes that propylene glycol, the synthetic liquid used to help products stay moist, is \" generally recognized as safe. \" but it's typically eaten ( in everything from soda to salad dressing ), not inhaled — so it's not clear whether inhaling it is truly safe.

Researchers involved in the little-noticed study emphasized that their findings were preliminary and that the study did not involve people but specially treated human lung cells. Many researchers have expressed the belief that e-cigarettes pose a far lower cancer risk than conventional cigarettes because they do not burn tobacco, a major source of carcinogens. However, the findings, which were presented in january at a meeting of lung cancer researchers, may attract the interest of federal officials who are considering how to regulate e-cigarettes. In a report to investors sent tuesday, david j. Adelman, an industry analyst at morgan stanley, said the report, while preliminary, could \"result in legitimate questions from public health officials. \" the study involved scientists from boston university, the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas and the university of california, los angeles and was funded by the national institutes of health.

After a quick online check revealed the winning numbers ( short the mega ball that would have landed him a $ 22 million jackpot, per kptv ), panisa recalled hearing reports about a winning ticket that had been sold in the area and needed to be claimed quickly.

The national institute of migration ( inm ) said the huge number of children, from different nations in central america, were discovered in just a single one-week period in march. The figure included some 163 children who were abandoned because they were not traveling with an adult family member or an acquaintance, the inm said in a statement. In many cases, the children had been left in dangerous or difficult transit points by guides who had been paid between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000, it said. The children were found between march 17 and 24 across 14 states, the inm said, without specifying the ages and nationalities of the children. \"the children showed signs of extreme fatigue, foot injuries, dehydration, disorientation and not knowing where they were abandoned, \" it said. Authorities arrested nine suspected traffickers in connection with the case.

Granados and the girón brothers were fleeing their native central american countries where gang violence is spreading. The three are part of a surge in unaccompanied children and teenagers flowing across the mexican border to the united states. A report issued in november by the u.s. Conference of catholic bishops ( usccb ) showed the sharp increase. Every fiscal year between 2004 and 2011, the report said, the number of children detained by immigration authorities averaged about 6,800. But apprehensions jumped to more than 13,000 children in fiscal year 2012 and to more than 24,000 in fiscal year 2013. Up to 120 unaccompanied youths are arriving each day, and some estimates suggest that the annual number could soon reach 60,000, according to a feb. 21 story in the los angeles times. Immigrant-rights activists say more and more unaccompanied minors are arriving for various reasons. Many are fleeing gang violence, like granados and the girón brothers.

The figure included some 163 children who were abandoned because they were not traveling with an adult family member or an acquaintance, the inm said in a statement. In many cases, the children had been left in dangerous or difficult transit points by guides who had been paid between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000, it said. The children were found between march 17 and 24 across 14 states, the inm said, without specifying the ages and nationalities of the children. \"the children showed signs of extreme fatigue, foot injuries, dehydration, disorientation and not knowing where they were abandoned, \" it said. Authorities arrested nine suspected traffickers in connection with the case. Inm has said the numbers of immigrant children traveling alone through mexico \"has increased significantly \" in recent months. Some 140,000 undocumented immigrants, the vast majority from central america, attempt to make the perilous journey through mexico into",
            "Irene granados celebrated her 16th birthday while walking through the desert two years ago trying to reach the united states — and safety. Brothers javier and denis girón, 13 and 17, floated on a raft across the rio grande last year — also in a bid to reach safety. Granados and the girón brothers were fleeing their native central american countries where gang violence is spreading. The three are part of a surge in unaccompanied children and teenagers flowing across the mexican border to the united states. A report issued in november by the u.s. Conference of catholic bishops ( usccb ) showed the sharp increase. Every fiscal year between 2004 and 2011, the report said, the number of children detained by immigration authorities averaged about 6,800. But apprehensions jumped to more than 13,000 children in fiscal year 2012 and to more than 24,000 in fiscal year 2013. Up to 120 unaccompanied youths are arriving each day, and some estimates suggest that the annual number could soon reach 60,000, according to a feb. 21 story in the los angeles times. Immigrant-rights activists say more and more unaccompanied minors are arriving for various reasons. Many are fleeing gang violence, like granados and the girón brothers. But children are also being sent by families who believe they could qualify for immigration reform — if congress ever acts on it — or for president barack obama's"

        "summary": "A psychiatric group has told its members they're not obligated to adhere to something called the \" goldwater rule, \" which has long prevented members of the profession from commenting on the mental health of public figures. The american psychoanalytic association emailed its members this month to that effect, though the atlantic explains it wasn't so much a change in policy as a reminder that the goldwater rule is not officially part of the group's ethical guidelines. One thing of note: this apa has 3,500 members, but the larger american psychiatric association, with 37,000 members, still has the rule in place. The development comes amid lots of chatter about president trump's behavior, which is \" so different from anything we've seen before \" in a president, a past leader of the smaller apa tells stat. Coverage: milestone? the move \" represents the first significant crack in the profession's decades-old united front aimed at preventing experts from discussing the psychiatric aspects of politicians ' behavior, \" writes sharon begley at stat. In a statement, however, a spokesperson emphasized that the group isn't encouraging members to go against the goldwater rule, notes time. It's just that \" we don't want to prevent our members from using their knowledge responsibly, \" adds the former leader. Still opposed: the american psychiatric association reiterated that its own policy is unchanged. In march, the group formally reaffirmed its view that it's unethical for doctors to speculate on the mental health of a person they haven't personally evaluated. The full policy is here. ' gag rule '?: last week, dr. Leonard glass of harvard wrote an essay in psychiatric times likening the goldwater prohibition to a \" gag rule \" and calling it \" an unacceptable infringement on my right and duty. \" in the essay, he resigned from the american psychiatric association. Why goldwater: in 1964, about 1,200 psychiatrists responding to a magazine survey declared conservative candidate barry goldwater unfit for the presidency, explains the los angeles times. He later sued for libel and won, and the larger apa's ethics board established the rule in 1973. An expert weighs in: you don't have to search the topic long before finding someone arguing that trump has narcissistic personality disorder. Well, the psychiatrist who literally wrote the definition for that disorder wrote a much-publicized letter to the editor earlier this year to the new york times in which he states clearly that trump doesn't meet the criteria. \" he may be a world-class narcissist, \" writes allen frances, \" but this doesn't make",

Officers did note that he \" appeared to sway and have leg tremors \" at one point, and \" winced as if in pain. \" but, uh, the injury was never again mentioned or noticed following the test. The police documents also paint a picture of bieber being about as snotty as you've probably come to expect: he was initially \" agitated and condescending, \" frequently using profanity, and then came the kicker: \" he then got upset and said, ' i ' m 19 years old. I ' m just out having a good time. What were you doing when you were 19? ' \" hilariously, the officer he'd questioned responded that when he was 19, he was not driving around in a lamborghini, to which bieber helpfully pointed out, \" yeah, well, i bet you didn't have millions of dollars in your bank account either. \" another awesome police moment: one officer mentioned to another that bieber and his pal appeared to be having trouble driving the cars, to which bieber responded, \" what? i've been driving lamborghinis since i was 15. \" unfortunately for those hoping to see bieber put away for a long time, tmz notes that the police case is shaky: cops initially said he was drag racing and \" reeked of booze, \" but neither claim now appears to be true ( his blood alcohol content was an \" inconsequential \" 0.014 ).

But scientists only know this thanks to a chance discovery. Researchers were mapping the queensland trough, a basin next to the great barrier reef off australia's eastern coast, when they noticed eight \" hills \" hundreds of feet tall more than half a mile below the surface. After that discovery, they realized that a portion of australia's continental shelf about 20 miles away \" looks like a massive bite has been taken out of [ it ], \" study author robin beaman tells australia's abc. He put two and two together and concluded the \" knolls were the remains of a very large undersea landslide, \" per the bbc. Because coral fossils from the knolls date back 300,000 years, researchers believe the knolls broke off from the section of shelf known as the gloria knolls slide at least 300,000 years ago in what beaman dubs a \" catastrophic collapse. \" researchers say the landslide would have produced 7.7 cubic miles of debris. To put that in perspective, almost everyone on earth could fit into one cubic mile. The force likely caused a tsunami up to 90 feet high, but the nearby great barrier reef would've acted \" like a giant porous breakwater, \" beaman says. Since researchers found \" a lot more marine life there than we ever anticipated, \" beaman notes the site will serve as a great place for further research, including on cold water corals.

Created to improve on the company's already exceptional mattresses, some of which have lasted more than 100 years, it's now being updated a decade of research and work later. The new vividus takes 320 hours to make and will set you back $ 149,000, reports bloomberg. The bed consists of a wooden frame made of slow-growth northern swedish pine; a box spring of pure steel springs with layers of cotton, wool batting, and horsehair; and a mattress pad that has its own layers of cotton, wool, and horsehair, each hair braided by hand and then unwound to maximize bounce. Why horsehair? its strands are hollow, so it naturally wicks away moisture. Whether one of the world's most expensive beds is also the best is, of course, arguable, but the bloomberg writer who tried one out writes, \" i ' m spoiled forever. \" ( he justifies the cost by looking at the investment over decades. ) the mashable reporter who tried four of the world's priciest similarly concludes, \" i ' m not sure what it says about me that the most expensive bed was my favorite, but it was. It was a sinfully accurate combination of firm and soft. \" meanwhile, hästens ' fifth-generation owner, jan ryde, declares the bed to be his company's best and says his his first night in the new model \" was like rediscovering sleep, \" per gotham magazine. The ty warner penthouse at the four seasons hotel new york boasts a hästens, but it ' ll cost you $ 50,000 for the night.

A new cnn/orc poll shows the republican contender with his biggest lead yet: 36 % of registered republicans and republican-leaning independents support him, while his next-closest opponent, ted cruz, sits 20 percentage points back at 16 %. Ben carson continues to fall and sits in third at 14 %, followed by marco rubio at 12 %. The rest of the republican candidates didn't hit 5 % support. Chris christie sits in fifth with 4 %, while jeb bush fell 5 points down to 3 % since the last cnn/orc poll in mid-october, reports abc news. The poll looks at how voter education plays a role: cruz leads with 22 % support among gop voters with college degrees, while trump sits fourth with 18 %. However, trump leads by a mile among voters without degrees. He has 46 % support, compared to cruz's 12 %. Trump is also leading on most issues. He's at least 30 points up on any gop candidate when it comes to the economy, federal budget, illegal immigration, and isis. All told, 52 % of respondents say he has the best shot of winning the election. This latest poll surveyed 1,020 adults from nov. 27 to dec. 1, and trump only expects his numbers to climb in the wake of the san bernardino shooting, which happened dec. 2. \" whenever there's a tragedy … my numbers go way up because we have no strength in this country, we have weak, sad politicians, \" he tells cnn, per the hill.",

        "summary": "An 11-year-old girl's kidnapping and rape in santa ana, calif., may be solved after 17 years thanks in part to a discarded water bottle. For years, detectives had few leads apart from a surveillance video from a gas station showing a man in a van covering the girl's mouth with his hand while an unknown man pumped gas, police say, per ktla. However, dna evidence taken from the victim was recently submitted for analysis. Two dna profiles emerged. One matched dna from 36-year-old ismael salgado, who lived in santa ana in 1999, police say, per the los angeles times. The second sample didn't match any in california or national databases, but detectives soon identified an old friend of salgado's who had also lived in santa ana at the time of the crime. While following jose plascencia, 36, in arizona, detectives saw him throw away a water bottle and retrieved it for analysis. Dna from the bottle then proved a match to the case. According to police, salgado and plascencia dragged the victim and a friend into their van on feb. 3, 1999, as the girls were walking home. The friend was able to escape, but when the victim tried to do the same, the suspects \" pulled her back in by her hair, \" a police rep tells kabc. They stopped to get gas, then raped the 11-year-old repeatedly at two different locations before releasing her, police allege. Both men are now held at the orange county jail on suspicion of kidnapping to commit a sex offense and forcible rape, per the orange county register. Bail is set at $ 1 million each.

But in what officials tell abc news is the first such case on record in the states, a human got the disease from a dog; the small outbreak ultimately involved four people, all of whom recovered, reports nbc news. The outbreak of pneumonic plague — the most serious of the three forms, and the only one that humans can transmit to each other — was in rural colorado. That fits with one doctor's statement to nbc that the \" plague is virtually always confined in this day and age to rural regions in the west. \" that's thanks in large part to populations of prairie dogs, who typically spread the disease through fleas. In this case, an american pit bull terrier developed a fever and jaw rigidity last summer and had to be euthanized the very next day. The dog's owner went to the hospital four days later with a fever and bloody cough. A colorado health official tells abc the source is a surprise. \" primarily... Dogs don't get sick at all or they get a minor illness. \" more often, cats play with prairie dogs, pick up infected fleas, and spread the bacteria to people when they cough infected blood or mucus. Another surprise, per nbc: human-to-human transmission may have occurred for the first time in 90 years. In addition to the owner and two veterinary workers, a friend of the owner was infected. While she did interact with the dog, the timeline of her infection suggests she may have gotten it from the owner. ( a study may have identified the true root of the black death. )",

These bacteria are found in many areas of the world, including the united states. How do people become infected with plague? people most commonly acquire plague when they are bitten by a flea that is infected with the plague bacteria.

Finally, people can become infected from inhaling respiratory droplets after close contact with cats and humans with pneumonic plague.

They also say paranoia involves unsafe car chases and \" derogatory \" team names.

The case brought against the justice department by five plaintiffs — including alexis bortell, who uses medical marijuana to treat her epilepsy, and former nfl player marvin washington, who sells marijuana-based pain relievers — heads to a new york court on wednesday, reports the new york times. The case before judge alvin k. Hellerstein has what fresh toast calls \" immense promise \" for pot advocates, as plaintiffs argue that current law classifying marijuana as among the most dangerous narcotics violates constitutional rights. Filed in federal district court in manhattan in july, the suit gained increased attention after jeff sessions last month opened up the option for prosecutors to enforce federal law in states where marijuana has been decriminalized. The lawsuit claims the schedule 1 drug has been used by everyone from thomas jefferson, who apparently found it eased his migraines, to ancient egyptians, who used it to treat eye sores and hemorrhoids, and is only banned based on efforts to target hippies and black americans after the 1960s. The cannabis cultural association, another plaintiff in the suit, argues \" the controlled substances act has been enforced against people of color exponentially more than caucasians, \" a lawyer tells the cannabis business times.

So ended a painful journey that divided two siblings in a time of riots and spiking homicide rates that almost seemed to conspire against the younger dionay, the atlantic reports. \" we come from the same cloth, \" smith once told dionay. Indeed, both were raised in black communities, but smith grew up in a vibrant family home while dionay was raised by their drug-using dad. \" i know that you're in an environment that is not conducive to, you know, everyday life, \" smith went on. \" but understand that it's possible to do more than just this. \" smith helped dionay find work, but the younger brother fell into drug dealing and other alleged crimes including rape, kidnapping, and forgery. Meanwhile, baltimore saw violence surge after 25-year-old black man freddie gray died in police custody and riots shook the city. Murders, down 40 % between 1993 and 2014, skyrocketed 92 % in the following months and never returned to earlier levels. The atmosphere became toxic for dionay, a father of three, who was apparently killed by a fellow drug dealer, the baltimore sun reported at the time. \" nothing that i ' m saying is any different than i say with any other person who's fallen as a victim of crime, \" smith told the media through tears. \" as i often say, the day of the funeral doesn't end it for families. This goes on forever. There are children now without a father. \" ( see which city has an even worse murder rate than baltimore. )",

He plunked half a bushel onto the kitchen counter of his suburban home and began pulling ingredients from his cabinets and refrigerator. He let the crabs steam until their shells turned the color of fire. But before he could eat, smith had to run two errands. He slid a dozen crabs into a brown paper bag for his mother, collected his 5-year-old son, and hopped into his police-issued ford explorer.

            "It was an early sunday evening, july 2, 2017, and t. J. Smith, the chief spokesman for the baltimore police department, wanted a plate of maryland crabs. He plunked half a bushel onto the kitchen counter of his suburban home and began pulling ingredients from his cabinets and refrigerator. He let the crabs steam until their shells turned the color of fire. But before he could eat, smith had to run two errands. He slid a dozen crabs into a brown paper bag for his mother, collected his 5-year-old son, and hopped into his police-issued ford explorer. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the audm iphone app. The sun was drawing down over the northwest expressway, and as smith cruised south, he felt a rare lightness of spirit. The past two days had been quiet. On friday, he'd said goodbye to a top homicide commander with what had become their signature sign-off: \"i hope you have a fantastic weekend and i don't have to talk to you. \" unlike during most 48-hour stretches in baltimore, this weekend there had been no murders requiring the pair to coordinate. The following morning he would begin a 10-day vacation. His insides clenched when he saw the name. The latest homicide victim was his younger brother. He swung by",

Smith, 24, was found fatally shot about 8 p.m. Sunday in his home in the 1400 block of argyle ave. In the upton neighborhood of west baltimore.

In the first confirmed case of its kind, the cdc believes one texas woman infected another with hiv through sexual activity that included unprotected sex, the use of sex toys, and sexual contact while menstruating, reports the los angeles times. The women, both in their 40s, had been in a monogamous relationship for six months before the infection, which was first detected in early 2012. Other risk factors including iv drug use were absent, and it had been at least 10 years since the newly infected woman had sex with a man. Further, the paper notes that \" the viruses infecting the two women had [ greater than or equal to ] 98 % sequence identity in three genes. \" while it's not the first time such a transmission has been \" suspected... Not all the pieces were there to say it so clearly as this one, \" an epidemiologist tells npr, saying the case should serve as a warning that many kinds of sexual interaction can spread the virus. \" anytime there's intimate contact — even through the use of sex toys — prevention measures should be taken, especially when there's a chance of blood contact, \" he says.",

The complaint cites research showing that asian-american students must score 140 points higher than white students on sats, 270 points higher than hispanics, and 450 points higher than african-americans to equal their chances of admission.

        "summary": "Lincoln chafee, a former governor and senator of rhode island, launches his bid for the democratic nomination this evening, and clearly everything will have to go his way if he hopes to pull an upset. Which is why this facebook post from his wife, spotted by an editor at national journal, doesn't bode well: \"does anybody from my husband's staff remember his fb page access? \" yes, it's authentic, reports bloomberg. Stephanie chafee is looking for anyone who recalls how to log in to the page chafee used as governor, so it can be merged with his 2016 presidential page. It seems the former is getting more traffic. Once the campaign gets past that hurdle, chafee will have to work on name recognition. Npr helps with a primer on his political career, observing that \" it is not often that a person can be said to have personally ended an era, but chafee may well be remembered as the last liberal republican to serve in the u.s. Senate. \" chafee was originally a republican before becoming an independent and, finally, a democrat. Even while with the gop, however, he consistently ranked less conservative than even some democrats, thanks to his support of gay marriage, abortion rights, a higher minimum wage, and more taxes on the rich. ( as for the missing password, someday chafee might be able to use his brainwaves instead. )",

I think you can agree that $ 4 is a small price to pay for a whopping 895 calories ( and 34 grams of fat ). How does this stack up to other novelty sandwiches?"

Pompeo arrived in pyongyang wednesday for meetings with kim jong chol, director of the north's agency for inter-korean relations, reports reuters. An official at south korea's presidential blue house said pompeo is expected to finalize the details of president trump's summit with kim jong un, and pyongyang is expected to release the three american prisoners to him. \" we expect him to bring the date, time, and the captives, \" the official told the yonhap news agency. Pompeo, speaking to reporters travelling with him, said it would be a \" great gesture \" if the captives were released, though he couldn't guarantee it would happen. The former cia chief, who met kim jong un during his previous trip over easter weekend, said he planned to set a date and location for the trump summit — and to clarify expectations. \" we are not going to head down the path we headed down before, \" he said. \" we will not relieve sanctions until such time as we have achieved our objectives. \" the new york times notes in his comments to reporters, pompeo stumbled over kim's name, referring to him as \" chairman un \" — with un being part of kim's first name, not surname. The times shares one tweeted take: \" that's like, i dunno, calling winston churchill ' prime minister spencer. ' \"",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - north korea released three american prisoners and handed them over to u.s. Secretary of state mike pompeo on wednesday, clearing a major obstacle to an unprecedented summit between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un. The men, who were freed after pompeo met kim, were on their way home aboard the chief u.s. Diplomat's plane, and trump said he would greet them when they arrived at andrews air force base outside washington on thursday morning. \"we would like to express our deep appreciation to the united states government, president trump, secretary pompeo, and the people of the united states for bringing us home, \" the three said in a statement released by the state department as their plane stopped over in alaska. \"we thank god, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return.

While kim is giving up the last of his american detainees, whom north korea has often used as bargaining chips, their return could also be aimed at pressuring trump to make concessions as he tries to get pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal, something it has not signaled a willingness to do. The release gave trump a chance to tout a diplomatic achievement just a day after his decision to pull out of the iran nuclear deal drew heavy criticism from european allies and others. \"i am pleased to inform you that secretary of state mike pompeo is in the air and on his way back from north korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health, \" trump wrote on twitter. \"i appreciate kim jong un doing this and allowing them to go, \" trump told reporters at the white house.

After a roadside bombing, \" his comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. \" remsburg, now 30, spent three months in a coma, lost his vision in one eye, and continues grueling rehab daily back home in phoenix under the care of his parents. ( he enlisted at age 18, a year after his dad wouldn't give him permission to do so at 17. ) obama spoke of meeting remsburg before the accident — \" sharp as a tack \" — and twice since, which is pretty rare as these things go. \" men and women like cory remind us that america has never come easy, \" said the president. When he finished, \" the speech, and the evening, belonged to the purple heart recipient, \" writes russell berman at the hill. Sure, it was a \" political ploy \" to some extent, writes john cassidy at the new yorker, \" but it was also something bigger and more justifiable. \" obama invoked public service and the idea that all of us can do better. \" in a bitterly divided chamber, and a bitterly divided country, it was a fanciful vision to end the speech with, \" he writes. \" for a moment, though, you got the sense that even the president's foes gathered before him couldn't have disagreed with his sentiments. \"",

This year, the first three of those topics got one paragraph each — and tax reform was hardly mentioned. Instead, the president talked about how \"inequality has deepened \" and \"upward mobility has stalled. \" he put forth a series of modest proposals designed to provide \"ladders of opportunity into the middle class, \" such as raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers.

In his judgment, judge lee yeakel said the law is \" facially unconstitutional \" and would force doctors to act against their best medical judgment, the new york times reports. Yeakel wrote: \" the court is unaware of any other medical context that requires a doctor — in contravention of the doctor's medical judgment and the best interest of the patient — to conduct a medical procedure that delivers no benefit to the woman. \" an hour after yeakel's decision came down, the texas attorney general's office announced that it would be filing an appeal.",

But as usa today reports, trump has a history of friction with the bush family, with the elder bush himself referring to trump as a \" blowhard \" in the book the last republicans last year. In fact, things have been so dicey that the new york times wonders whether trump will attend the funeral, let alone speak at it, as is traditional. John mccain, for example, excluded trump from his funeral, but the wishes of bush were not immediately known. The newspaper notes that trump once mocked bush's signature \" thousand points of light \" push on the campaign trail, saying that \" nobody has really figured out \" what that means. But that animosity was not evident in trump's public statements saturday. \" whenever i was with him i saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family, \" trump wrote. \" his accomplishments were great from beginning to end. He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all! \" the formal statement, meanwhile, praised bush as a man of \" sound judgement, common sense, and unflappable leadership \" and said he \" set the stage for the decades of prosperity that have followed. \" notably, the statement also lauded the \" thousand points of light \" sentiment, saying it illuminated \" the greatness, hope, and opportunity of america to the world. \" ( see photos of bush throughout the years. )",

Swedish researchers have developed a transparent, wood-based material that could be used to let light into buildings, as well as for making solar cells, science daily reports. The transparent wood — the \" coolest building material ever, \" per gizmodo — is a \" low-cost, readily available, and renewable resource, \" researcher lars berglund says. Used in construction, the material ( which can be both transparent for windows and semitransparent for walls ) could reduce the need for artificial lighting by allowing more natural light into a space, per a press release. Now that they have successfully engineered the transparent wood, the researchers are working on scaling up the manufacturing process, as well as trying out different types of wood, according to science alert. To create the transparent wood, researchers stripped lignin ( a part of the cell wall that blocks light ) from commercial balsa wood, making it \" beautifully white. \" then the wood is impregnated with a transparent polymer, maintaining the wood structure while allowing up to 85 % light transmittance. \" we can create veneer from this material, \" berglund tells gizmodo, \" and then laminate it into larger structures, such as load-bearing panels and beams. \" the resulting panels, per science alert, are more durable than glass.

        "summary": "The drug company ceo that everyone loves to hate is back in the news again for making enemies. This time, however, martin shkreli is not accused of jacking up the price of a drug. Instead, critics says he's engaged in market manipulation in the biotech industry. Or as forbes contributor jay somaney puts it, \" rampant share price manipulation. \" the accusations revolve around a california company called kalobios pharmaceuticals that was on the verge of going under last month. After it announced it was winding down operations, an investment group led by shkreli swooped in and acquired 70 % of it. The stock soared 4,000 % in less than a week, recounts gawker — and this is where the situation gets a little wonky because it involves short-sellers and something called a \" short squeeze. \" the short-sellers got hosed when the last-second rescue turned their expected profits on the demise of the company into big losses. \" some market observers see signs of a deliberate short squeeze, in which short-sellers are forced to buy frenetically to limit their losses, \" writes michael hiltzik at the los angeles times. Shkreli then made another surprise move by abruptly announcing that he would stop lending shares of the company to a second wave of short-sellers who had gotten in the game to bet against the stock — another \" short squeeze, \" as the wall street journal headline put it. The price soared again. A sign of the craziness: one guy on e-trade went from $ 33,000 in profit to $ 106,000 in debt in two days, prompting him to open a gofundme account ( now closed ) asking for help, reports zero hedge. ( he made about $ 5,000, notes marketwatch. ) shkreli insists it's all aboveboard. \" this was a company on death's door and it was rescued by a well-known investor, \" he tells hiltzik. \" would you expect it to go down? \" but somaney, for one, calls what happened the \" mother of all short squeezes \" and thinks the sec should investigate. \" for a stock to go from pennies to almost $ 50 per share ( in less than two weeks ) \" makes no sense, he writes.",

        "summary": "Amazon is experimenting with a 30-hour work week — but before you get too excited, consider that the employees will only earn 75 % of what full-time employees earn. But they will be salaried and will get the same benefits as the 40-hour employees, the washington post reports. The pilot program, which was announced late last week, will involve entire technical teams ( including managers ) that work 30-hour weeks; in total, a few dozen employees will be a part of the experiment. Reactions: quartz notes that amazon has become \" known for its soul-crushing work culture, \" and points out that a 30-hour work week could actually end up improving productivity: studies have shown workers who put in fewer hours at the office are more productive. The christian science monitor notes that amazon is likely trying to draw more women to its workforce, as a more flexible work week could be attractive to mothers. At forbes, tim worstall expands on that idea: \" the gender pay gap is actually about children, \" he writes. \" never married no children women do not face a pay gap. The major cause is that in our society, rightly or wrongly, women take on, on average, the job of being primary caregiver to the partnership's children more often than men do.... Amazon has spotted a chance to get talent on the cheap as a result of other employers not offering child friendly, or child care friendly, working hours. \" fortune says the move could also come in response to increasing automation in the industry, which is reducing the demand for human labor. An analyst tells the post that, while many other companies have mentioned the desire to shorten the work week, not many have actually done anything about it. \" there has for a very long time been a stigma against working reduced hours, or part-time work, \" she says, and hopefully amazon's move can break that taboo.",

Weiner — who has failed at being a husband, at sex rehab and at politics because of his uncontrollable urges — has managed to be a model inmate at the federal medical center in devens, mass., according to the federal bureau of prisons. Prison records show he is scheduled to be released in may 2019, three months ahead of his scheduled release date in august 2019. There is no parole in federal prison, but inmates can earn up to 54 days off each year they serve for good conduct. If the queens democrat ends up getting sprung early, it will be his first success in close to a decade. Weiner's dramatic and seemingly never-ending fall from grace kicked off in 2011, when he resigned from congress after it emerged he had been sending photos of his privates to women online. In 2013, he lost his bid to become nyc's mayor when it emerged he had been continuing his sexting with strange women through the pseudonym \"carlos danger. \" weiner didn't hit rock bottom, however, until he admitted in court last year to sexting",
            "Nearly a year after he began serving 21 months behind bars for sexting an underage girl, anthony weiner is set to be released three months early for \"good conduct, \" radaronline.com can exclusively report. The former disgraced politician, 54, reported to the federal medical center in devens, massachusetts on november 6, 2017 — with a scheduled release date of august 2019.

More than 15 years after the final episode, \" seinfeld \" is the basis for \"psy-feld, \" a teaching tool designed to help medical students identify and discuss psychiatric disorders. Every monday and thursday, third- and fourth-year medical students in the hospital's psychiatric rotation are assigned to watch the 6 p.m. Episode of \" seinfeld \" on tbs. They begin rounds the following morning by discussing what psychopathology was demonstrated on the episode. Wang says george demonstrates signs of narcissism as he neglects his own girlfriend to focus on jerry's. But fellow third-year student ryan townsend isn't convinced. \"i wouldn't say he is completely narcissistic because he actually starts to enjoy the idea that she doesn't like him, \" townsend says from the other end of the table. \"narcissists can't stand the idea that people don't like them. \" the discussion is exactly what anthony tobia said he had in mind when he created what he calls psy-feld in 2009. Although not a course, it is required part of the training tobia provides. \"you have a very diverse group of personality traits that are maladaptive on the individual level, \" said tobia, an associate professor of psychiatry at rutgers-robert wood johnson medical school. \"when you get these friends together the dynamic is such that it literally creates a plot: jerry's obsessive compulsive traits combined with kramer's schizoid traits, with elaine's inability to forge meaningful relationships and with george being egocentric. \" database of shows yes, for those who remember, there is a \" seinfeld \" episode with a subplot about kramer acting out diseases for medical students.

Thought critics aren't exactly bashing it, the film isn't getting anything close to the kind reviews that skyfall did back in 2012. Here's what critics are saying: \" it's not — as some critics have said — the worst \" bond flick, writes david edelstein at vulture. It's \" satisfying \" enough, and actually \" fun, even if it's a mishmash, leaving you shaken, not stirred. \" but the film doesn't \" deliver the nipping, slightly syncopated rhythms of the best bond films, \" and the bad guys don't get the send-offs you'd expect. Meanwhile, craig, who had planned to reclaim some of the earlier films ' irony, doesn't quite manage. Rex reed titles his review as follows: \" bland, james bland. \" spectre is actually \" one of the least interesting and most preposterous chapters in 007 history, \" he writes at the observer. \" we've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers. \" craig, in particular, looks bored. Steven rea, however, is a fan. \" it's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on earth, \" he writes at the philadelphia inquirer. He adds a \" trim, terse, and tough \" craig \" has proved himself the perfect bond for the millennium, \" and doesn't disappoint here, though \" at almost 21/2 hours, spectre can drag. \" \" it's not the best bond you've ever seen, but on a scale of 1 to 10, it's a solid 008, \" writes stephen whitty at the newark star-ledger. \" the jokiness is toned down, and the grown-up elegance — mostly courtesy of a guest appearance by monica bellucci — is heightened. \" he adds that the movie has a \" slow middle \" that tries to wrap up forgotten plot points from the earlier craig movies, and a \" terrible theme song. \"",

        "summary": "After many decades of power going back and forth between the labour and conservative parties, the conservative-liberal democrat coalition that took power after the 2010 election was seen as a fluke — but up to a dozen parties have a shot at being in government after today's election, which analysts say is the strangest — and closest — in memory. Confusion and coalition-building could continue for days or weeks after the results are in, and the only certainty seems to be that neither labour nor the conservatives will be able to win a majority of parliament's 650 seats and form a government alone. Some key players and factors: the conservative party. Polls show david cameron's party in a dead heat with ed miliband's labour, reuters reports. Cameron has tried to portray the party as the only option for stability and continued economic recovery — and promised a referendum on staying in the european union if it wins. The labour party. Miliband's party, which was drummed out of power in 2010, has been campaigning on a better deal for workers and higher taxes for the rich, the new york times reports, and like the conservatives, is expected to have to find smaller parties for coalition partners even if it gets the most votes. Liberal democrats. Party leader nick clegg — cameron's deputy prime minister under the coalition agreement — may end up playing kingmaker once again, but voters have not viewed his party's role in the coalition kindly: the party is expected to win only around half the seats it did in 2010 and even clegg's own seat may fall to a labour rival. Scotland. The scots voted against independence in september, but in the wake of the referendum, huge numbers of scottish voters deserted labour for the scottish national party, which is expected to win the third-highest number of seats in today's vote. Labour may have to secure the backing of the left-leaning snp to form a government, but cameron has signaled that he will consider such an alliance with the scottish nationalists illegitimate, reports the guardian. The uk independence party. This anti-immigration, anti-european union party is polling in third, according to the ap, but will only win a few seats at most under the uk's \" first past the post \" electoral system. Still, even a handful of seats can make a big difference when parties try to build coalitions, so ukip could play a key role — as could the green party, welsh nationalists plaid cymru, and the patchwork of parties that represent northern ireland.

The naturally-occurring bacteria, which thrives in warm, moderately salty water, causes around 80,000 illnesses and 100 deaths in the us yearly and killed at least 11 people in florida last year, according to florida today. Health officials say the bacteria is especially dangerous to people with weak immune systems and is fatal around 50 % of the time when it gets into people's bloodstreams, the broward-palm beach new times reports. \" a person can contract the virus by eating tainted raw shellfish and oysters, \" a florida health official says. \" and people who swim in seawater who have open wounds are also vulnerable to the bacteria. \" symptoms of infection include fever, chills, and skin lesions, the new times notes, explaining that while many people have probably already swum in bacteria-infested waters and been ok, people with weak immune systems should probably steer clear of florida waters for now. Researchers say that illnesses caused by vibrio bacteria are set to rise as the oceans get warmer.

She eats with plastic utensils, applies hand lotion and cuticle oil regularly, and avoids bright nail polish that might stain. \" i see girls in public with designs, a nice purple, \" she tells california sunday magazine. \" i ' m so jealous. \" but as a hand model, george can also use her perfectly thin-fingered, spotless, size-seven hands to earn $ 1,000 for a day's work. And in an advertising world full of hand-related products like jewelry, watches, nail polish, handy wipes, and toilet paper, there's a small but lucrative market for hand models to earn extra money or even make a career of it, forbes reported in 2014. \" a top girl... Can make around $ 75,000 a year, \" says the president of body parts models inc., and voa news says the most elite hand models pull in $ 10,000 a day. So what does it take? \" perfect hands, \" vanessa helmer wrote last year at modeling.about.com. That means \" slender hands, straight fingers, uniform nail beds, \" good skin tone, and male hands that aren't \" too hairy, \" she explains. Hand models also need to be comfortable \" doubling \" for models or celebrities in close quarters — running arms under their armpits, say, or putting hands on their face \" to make it seem like my hands are theirs, \" writes hand model susan schell at xojane. It's also important to convey \" moods \" with hands ( \" i know it sounds crazy, \" admits model katrina nelson ) and keep hands steady when they go numb from being held up so long. A sense of humor might help, too: \" working one hand job to the next is my slogan, from manhattan to malibu, \" says top hand model adele uddo.

Police say martin befriended breonna constantino — the stepdaughter of the business owner — while both were working at a strip club.

Investigators soon discovered the fire was started with gasoline, but it was a potato stuffed into the tailpipe of the owner's van that eventually led them to martin. The owner turned the potato over to police, and tests revealed the dna of 28-year-old matthew garguilo, who just happened to be willow's boyfriend at the time. Police say garguilo confessed that he watched martin break into the business — which had to be destroyed along with a neighboring restaurant, per the new york daily news — start the fire inside, and stuff the potato into the van's tailpipe in an attempt to make it blow up, reports wtnh. Garguilo claimed martin acted alone, though he said he did handle the potato, police say. He also said martin had previously set a fire at her mother's house, though fire officials blamed an electrical issue, reports patch.com.

Here's what the pundits are saying: the word \" trump \" wasn't spoken, but the speech, with its calls to \" reject any politics that targets people because of race [ or ] religion \" and praise of america's economic progress \" felt like a point-by-point refutation of the worldview \" put forward by donald trump since he launched his presidential bid, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Obama, with his insistence that america is already great, cast trump as \" simply the latest in a long line of fear peddlers at a time of national anxiety, \" he writes. This could be considered \" a reasonable, albeit liberal, and even uplifting state of the union address, \" but only by those who knew nothing of the last seven years of obama's presidency, according to jonah goldberg at the conservative national review, who blasts obama for years of \" unrelenting presidential condescension, insults, and cynicism. \" goldberg took particular exception to how obama \" celebrated his ridiculous and dangerous iran deal \" and yet failed to mention the capture of 10 us soldiers by iran that occurred prior to the speech. Michael crowley at politico also noticed that obama praised his iran deal without mentioning the latest incident. It was another \" mismatch between obama's vision and the experience of most americans, \" he writes, criticizing obama for talking about successes like closer ties with cuba while \" skimming over or skipping entirely several major global headaches \" like afghanistan and the syrian civil war. Obama's final sotu was an inspirational call to america's better nature — and to those who \" yearn for more civility \" in politics, according to the new york times editorial board. Obama's speech was a reminder that \" the optimism that made him the first african-american president and then the resilience that helped the nation weather economic and global crises over the past seven years are what position it best for the future, \" the board writes. ( in the gop response, nikki haley also took a swipe at trump. )",

What's more, 32.8 % of items at farmers markets aren't fresh produce: they're processed or refined products like cookies, cakes, pies, and jams. The study admits that farmers markets do have upsides, however, like generally fresher produce and a slightly higher rate of organic foods. ( but a two-year-old study says organic foods are no more nutritious or safe than conventional foods, except that germs in non-organic meats are more often resistant to antibiotics, the cbc reports. ) meanwhile, the growth rate of farmers markets is in decline over the past five years after markets outpaced farmers'supply and the number of shoppers, the los angeles times reports. \" i think we've glutted the marketplace, \" says a farmers market manager in los angeles.

A new study out of the united kingdom published today found fidgeting may help offset the negative health effects of sitting for long periods of time, forbes reports. Previous studies have shown sitting for hours at work can take years off your life. Now, a 12-year study of thousands of uk women found those who sat for more than seven hours a day without fidgeting much had a 30 % higher chance of death than those who sat for less than five hours, according to the study. But moderate to heavy fidgeters sitting for longer than seven hours saw no such increase. \"our results support the suggestion that it's best to avoid sitting still for long periods of time, and even fidgeting may offer enough of a break to make a difference, \" university of leeds researcher janet cade tells forbes. Researchers believe fidgeting may increase the metabolism enough to offset all the sitting, but further study is needed. \" the findings raise questions about whether the negative associations with fidgeting, such as rudeness or lack of concentration, should persist if such simple movements are beneficial for our health, \" cade says in a press release.

But peering into the structure of a piece this big is something that the miami university professor explains had never been done before. Rakovan took the pieces to los alamos national laboratory, whose lujan neutron scattering center offered him the chance to employ neutron diffractometry — the use of neutrons allowed him to penetrate several centimeters into the stone without damaging it, something x-rays and electrons could not.

During the past lujan center user run cycle, heinz nakotte, new mexico state university professor and lead scientist for the single-crystal diffraction ( scd ) instrument, and sven vogel, instrument scientist for the high-pressure/preferred orientation ( hippo ) instrument, helped rakovan probe the stunning pieces at los alamos. The authors are preparing a scientific report. Three of the four samples turned out to be single-crystal pieces of gold, rather than the commonplace multiple-crystal type. Of particular interest was a golf-ball-shaped nugget that at one time was believed to be",

Found in a river in venezuela years ago, it's estimated to be worth about $ 1.5 million. There had been questions about its authenticity but monday's exam proved it was created entirely by nature."

The departure of executive editor tom krazit a couple of weeks ago seemed to be a harbinger, as noted by kara swisher for re/code, and a series of dismayed tweets yesterday from gigaom staff all but confirmed the official announcement that came later. \" gigaom recently became unable to pay its creditors in full at this time, \" reads a statement on the website. \" all operations have ceased. … the company does not currently intend to file bankruptcy. \" founder om malik, who left gigaom a year ago, posted on his own blog: \" gigaom is winding down and its assets are now controlled by the company's lenders. It is not how you want the story of a company you founded to end. \" the experimental site, started in 2006, was known for its tech conferences and white-paper research, per the times.
