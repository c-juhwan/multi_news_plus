That marks what atlas obscura calls the vault's \" first real-world run \" — which came much sooner than anyone would have imagined when the vault opened in 2008. The premature test run came in part due to the syrian civil war, which atlas obscura notes forced icarda to move its headquarters from aleppo to beirut, and while its seed collections there survived, access in aleppo became limited. Thus, it asked for the loan in september 2015; since then, it duplicated the seeds until it now has a complete set. The icarda collections range from india to the middle east, northern africa and the americas, and include legumes and winter cereals. The vault, the world's largest agricultural gene bank located on the svalbard archipelago between mainland norway and the north pole, was built as a master backup to the world's other seed banks.",

        "summary": "On thursday, the 950-ton pedestrian bridge at florida international university collapsed in deadly fashion; on friday, a florida department of transportation employee finally heard the voicemail an engineer left on a landline three days prior, reports the ap. In the message, denney pate with figg bridge group noted cracking had been discovered on the north end of the concrete span, and while it would require repairs, \" from a safety perspective we don't see that there's any issue there so we're not concerned about it from that perspective. \" \" although obviously the cracking is not good and something's going to have to be, you know, done to repair that, \" he continued. The new york times describes pate as the head engineer of figg bridge group, which handled the bridge's design. The times quotes a national transportation safety board official as saying cracks aren't necessarily perilous; the ntsb's investigation into the collapse, which killed at least 6, is ongoing. Indeed, the miami herald reports concrete construction often experiences some cracking. As for why the message went unheard for so long, fdot says the employee was in the field on an assignment and didn't return to the office until friday.

Yes, you just read that: 30-year-old civil servant hugh aggleton finished the man v.

The race — dubbed one of the world's \" strangest \" by the telegraph — started in 1980 after a debate between a customer and a local pub owner: who was faster, horses or people? the answer seems obvious, but humans may actually be better at long-distance running: \" we're essentially the tortoises of the animal world rather than the hares, \" says harvard professor dan lieberman. Everything from our balancing inner ears to flexible tendons to cooling sweat glands aid us in the long run — while horses, however speedy, can only cool off fully by panting, which is hard while running because their \" huge viscera... Slams into the diaphragm with every step, \" lieberman says. His research in nature suggests that early humans may have been able to hunt down animals in the african savanna by outlasting them in marathon runs. \" that means if [ aggleton ] had lived long ago, he probably would have been able to chase down dinner, \" says npr.",

The jackpot for the latest drawing on wednesday, may, 15, 2013, has ballooned...

The next drawing will be held saturday. A jackpot of $ 475 million ranks as the second largest in powerball history and third biggest overall.

There's also \" cross-selling \" of powerball and mega millions tickets _ states being able to sell both powerball tickets and mega millions tickets _ that began in january 2010.

He is set to appear in a jefferson county court this morning on a variety of charges — first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals, criminal mischief — linked to the arvada explosion. Shortly before cops arrived at the fire around 1: 30am, neighbors tell the station they heard a loud explosion and came out to see the residence in flames and their own lawns littered with glass and debris. Lindauer's ex-wife divorced him about a year ago and is listed as co-owner of the house; neither she nor her three children were home at the time, abc notes. No serious damage was done to any structure other than the home, which had \" significant \" fire and heat damage that kept firefighters from entering initially, a fire department spokeswoman told the new york daily news. A neighbor tells abc that her husband spotted lindauer in the yard \" after the explosion … [ he said he ] didn't respond when he asked him what happened. \" the graffiti has since been covered up. \" they're very nice people, very good neighbors.

To wit, the piece begins with davis recounting how shortly after she first met the writer and actress, dunham had a hysterectomy — and davis was right there with her, courtesy of the stream of photos dunham started texting her, including \" a close-up of her pubic area, showing off tattoos and hair and the place where the doctor had drawn incision marks in blue ink. \" dunham seems to edit herself on just one occasion in the piece, which is when her split with girls co-creator jenni konner comes up. Otherwise, she's bare on things like the following: the reason behind her split with jack antonoff, whether he cheated on her with lorde, her concerns over her desire to adopt a hairless black puppy and name it rosa ( \" i ' m worried people will get mad bc of rosa parks \" ), more mentions of antonoff ( he hates cats; recounting texts she recently sent him ), why she didn't donate to hillary clinton's campaign, what she was thinking when she made her #metoo gaffe, her ptsd and treatment, the artist she's now casually seeing, and how sex is for her now. What's the motivation? davis addresses that: \" she texts me increasingly intimate details that she knows i ' ll put in this article, as if she were trying to be the director of her own candid, sympathy-generating magazine story...

Netanyahu further asserted that iran sought to cover up the weapons program before signing a 2015 deal with the international community. \"iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons program, \" said the israeli prime minister. His office billed it as a bombshell development, though tom dichristopher of cnbc writes that netanyahu's presentation \" largely rehashed what the world long ago accepted: that iran sought to develop nuclear weapons. \" still, the timing is significant, given that president trump must decide by may 12 whether to continue to go along with the 2015 deal or reimpose sanctions, reports the guardian. The newspaper notes that netanyahu spoke to trump by phone over the weekend and met in person with new secretary of state mike pompeo on sunday. \" we've shared this material with the united states and the united states can vouch for its authenticity, \" netanyahu said on monday. Iran did not immediately respond to the claims, but its foreign minister tweeted before the presentation that netanyahu is \" the boy who can't stop crying wolf \" in regard to accusations about iran. Netanyahu said israel had obtained 55,000 documents and 183 cds from the \" nuclear archives \" of iran.",

Public support for the war, and a decision to expand troop levels could become a political liability for the president ahead of congressional elections next year. Currently, there are about 67,000 u.s. Troops and 40,000 allied forces in afghanistan. Under one of the final pentagon options presented to the white house, three additional combat brigades would be deployed and a division headquarters set up near kandahar in southern afghanistan, a taliban stronghold, as part of a 30,000-troop increase. U.s. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said obama has settled on a troop increase but has yet to make up his mind about its size.

German researchers report that nearly everyone shown altered images of leonardo da vinci's famous brunette perceived the original as happy. \" we really were astonished, \" neuroscientist juergen kornmeier tells afp. The point of the analysis was to determine how people respond to visual clues such as facial expressions. Researchers from the university of freiburg report in nature that they chose to study reactions to the 16th-century masterpiece because of the \" emotional ambiguity \" of her expression. To some observers, they note, mona lisa's slight smile appears to dissolve into a sneer the longer you stare at it. To test that theory, the team manipulated a black-and-white copy of the tableau, creating eight altered images. Four curved her mouth upward in progressively \" happier \" images, and four curled her lips down to seem \" sadder. \" then they displayed the images in random blocks of nine to 12 people, repeating 30 times, per phys.org. On a happy-to-sad scale, researchers expected the original to be judged the most ambiguous, but in fact 97 % deemed her \" happy. \" in a second round presenting eight \" sadder \" versions with more curve to the lips, the original mona lisa was still rated happy, but the other images \" were perceived as a little sadder. \" the results show that context is important as the brain scans an image using past sensory experiences, kornmeier tells afp.

Tirado. \" the 17-year teaching veteran says she'd given her 8th-grade us history class two weeks to finish an explorer notebook project, but several students didn't hand it in, per abc action news. That's when she learned about the school's \" no zero \" policy. As the west gate student/parent handbook explains in red lettering, \" no zero's- lowest possible grade is 50 %. \" so tirado says she asked school officials what to do, and was told, \" we give them a 50. \" and she said, \" oh, we don't. This is not kosher. \" but she was still fired sept. 14 without cause, which the school can apparently do because tirado had just started teaching there in july and was still in her probationary period, per the orlando sentinel. Meanwhile, students are writing supportive messages on a facebook post showing her whiteboard message, and tirado's opinions are getting a full airing in the media. \" i ' m so upset because we have a nation of kids that are expecting to get paid and live their life just for showing up and it's not real, \" she says.",

The strategy mostly worked, but some high-tech archeology is finally revealing the camp's secrets, reports livescience. British archeologist caroline sturdy colls led a team that conducted the first digs at the site in poland — treblinka was actually two separate camps — discovering three previously unidentified mass graves and the apparent location of one of the camp's two gas chambers. They found the latter by scanning the ground with lasers to reveal a brick wall and foundation, and colls says the gas chambers were the camp's only brick buildings. Nearby, the team found tiles stamped with the star of david, which meshes with eyewitness accounts that the gas chambers were set up to look like bathhouses. \" treblinka had never been looked at since the period after the war, \" says colls. \" and everybody had assumed that because the history books said it was destroyed, it was. \" her team re-interred any remains they found after consulting with poland's chief rabbi, \" and it was heartwarming to see the reverence with which they treated \" them, writes curt schleier at the jewish daily forward. He got an early look at a show about the findings that airs at 8 eastern tonight on the smithsonian channel. Treblinka: hitler's killing machine is important and \" worth watching, \" he writes, especially as the number of holocaust survivors dwindles.

Lee, a 53-year-old naturalized us citizen, worked for the cia and had a top-secret security clearance between 1994 and 2007, when he moved to hong kong, reports the bbc. Intelligence officials believe lee is responsible for the collapse of cia operations in china between 2010 and 2012. When lee visited the us in 2012, fbi agents searched his hotel rooms in hawaii and virginia and found evidence that he was the mole who exposed the spy network, the new york times reports. According to court documents, the evidence included handwritten notebooks with the \" true names and phone numbers of assets and covert cia employees, as well as the addresses of cia facilities. \" lee has been charged with unlawful retention of national defense information, which has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Sources tell nbc he is unlikely to be charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty, possibly because the government doesn't want to expose more secrets in a trial.

Critics are mixed on the film as a whole, though no one disputes that it's as bombastic as might be expected from luhrmann. Among the bad reviews is joe morgenstern's in the wall street journal. He calls the film \" dreadful, \" noting that the tale of american excess is \" told idiotically, full of noise and furor, signifying next to nothing. \" it's \" a spectacle in search of a soul. \" another ouch: \" given the lifelessness of the enterprise, there's little point in belaboring its failure to convey the novel's themes. \" \" luhrmann's vulgarity is designed to win over the young audience, \" writes david denby in the new yorker, \" and it suggests that he's less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste. \" other critics are more measured. \" the best way to enjoy baz luhrmann's big and noisy new version of the great gatsby — and despite what you may have heard, it is an eminently enjoyable movie — is to put aside whatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you, \" recommends ao scott in the new york times. Sure, it's \" a gargantuan hunk of over-art-directed kitsch, but it makes for a grandiose, colorful, pleasure-drenched night at the movies, \" writes dana stevens at slate. \" far from betraying the spirit of fitzgerald's novel, luhrmann treats the book with a loving mix of straight-ahead reverence and postmodern playfulness. \"",

        "summary": "Donn fendler was big national news back in 1939: the 12-year-old got separated from his family on a hike up maine's highest mountain and became the subject of an increasingly desperate search. As the new york times recounts, mothers across the us sent his mother prayers via western union. Incredibly, nine days after he went missing, an exhausted fendler found an occupied hunting camp in the woods — about 35 miles from mount katahdin — and was returned to civilization. Fendler's story is making headlines again in the wake of his death at age 90 last weekend. His account of how he survived is retold in his children's book lost on a mountain in maine, which the bangor daily news notes became required reading for the state's fourth-graders. One smart move: the boy scout found a stream and kept following it, his brother tells maine public radio. \"there were plenty of times i wanted to give up and just say the heck with it, \" fendler himself recalled in the documentary finding donn fendler. \" like those last few days. But you just keep going. Like i told you, it's your will to live. \" along the way, he lost his jeans and his shoes, fell down an embankment, and was feasted upon by mosquitoes. Prior to finding the hunting camp, \" he came across an old cabin and there was a potato sack in there and a few other things that he could use, \" says his brother. \" but he ate berries and drank water and really didn't have anything to eat, and he was below 70 pounds when they found him. \" ( this popular children's author left a moving request upon her death. )",

        "summary": "An animal whose pedigree stumped even charles darwin has at long last found its place in the tree of life. A study released tuesday in nature communications concludes that the macrauchenia patachonica, or the \" long-necked llama, \" is part of a sister group of the perissodactyla placental order, which includes horses and rhinos. The two groups split about 66 million years ago, reports the afp, right about the time a massive asteroid struck the earth, causing the extinction of land-roaming dinosaurs. Macrauchenia, which looked like camels without humps and weighed up to 1,000 pounds, lived in what is now south america until the late pleistocene era, between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago. \" its outstanding feature, however, was its nose, \" says study co-author and american museum of natural history curator ross mcphee. \" we have no soft tissue fossils, \" he continues, \" so we don't know whether the nose was developed into an actual trunk, like an elephant's. It would not have looked very much like anything alive today. \" the new study built on a 2015 study that attempted to determine the animal's lineage through the analysis of ancient collagen, the structural protein found in skin. Cnn reports that mcphee and university of potsdam paleogenomics expert michi hofreiter extracted mitochondrial dna from a macrauchenia fossil found in south america and employed new techniques in genome recovery, which together allowed them to identify the animal's origins without the dna of close relatives. Darwin was the first to find the animal's fossils, while in patagonia in 1834, but neither he nor richard owen, the renowned paleontologist he sent the fossils to, was able to place the creature in any known lineage. ( as for the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, it hit in exactly the wrong place. )",

        "summary": "Poop isn't just poop, not if you're creative and dedicated to solving the world's sanitation problems. Now, thanks to a machine called the omniprocessor, fecal matter can become clean water and electricity. \" the water tasted as good as any i've had out of a bottle. … i would happily drink it every day. It's that safe, \" bill gates, whose foundation helped fund the development of the machine, writes on his blog. The world's sanitation problem is a big one — 40 % of people relieve themselves in the open or have improper sanitation, and the waste of another 2 billion isn't properly disposed of, wired reports. \" diseases caused by poor sanitation kill some 700,000 children every year, \" gates writes. \" western toilets aren't the answer, \" because of the immense infrastructure required. Enter the omniprocessor. Its designer, peter janicki, says it's three machines in one: \" a steam power plant, an incinerator, and a water filtration system, \" as wired puts it. The size of two school buses, the machine processes waste from 100,000 people. A steam engine dries out raw sewage and boils sludge to separate solid waste from water. An incinerator then burns the solids to create steam that drives the engine and generates its own electricity. Meanwhile, the water vapor emitted by the sludge dryer is filtered and condensed back into water. Gates wants to get the $ 1.5 million machines to governments and entrepreneurs in india, africa, and beyond, starting with senegal this year, business insider reports. The machines will help \" people … grow up in a healthy way, \" gates says. \" they ' ll live much higher-quality lives. You will save a lot of lives. \" ( gates also put his money toward the ebola fight. )",

            "Bill gates walks up to the water tap, but before he can drink, his entourage pulls him to one side. One woman takes off his glasses and rearranges his hair. Another dabs on a little makeup. And, at one point, someone hands him a mason jar. Once it's filled with water from the tap, he takes a sip from the jar, and a gates foundation photographer captures the moment. Then there's another water-sipping photo-op with peter janicki, the man who offered him this drink on the outskirts in sedro-woolley, washington, about 70 miles north of seattle. \" it's water! \" gates says, with mock surprise. Janicki's omniprocessor converts human waste and sludge into electricity and water the gates notes bill feigns surprise because five minutes ago, the water was human waste pumped in from a local sewage facility."

The panel is investigating russian interference in the 2016 election and any contacts between trump's campaign and russia. As one of trump's closest aides, hicks is a key eyewitness to his actions over the past several years. She was his spokeswoman during the 2016 presidential campaign and is now white house communications director. As the interview went into the afternoon, several members of the committee said during breaks that hicks was declining to answer any questions from her time in the white house. Others who have worked in the white house, including former strategist steve bannon, have also declined to talk about that time in interviews with the committee. \" there are some questions that she's not going to answer, \" said republican rep. Chris stewart of utah. Democratic rep. Mike quigley of illinois, another member of the panel, said hicks and her lawyer were \" following the orders of the white house not to answer certain questions. \" another person familiar with hicks'testimony said her lawyer is responding to questions about that time period by saying the white house has advised her not to answer and by saying she will take some questions \" under advisement. \" the person declined to be identified because the committee meetings are behind closed doors. The washington post notes that lawmakers are interested in hicks ' role in drafting a misleading statement explaining the 2016 meeting between donald trump jr., jared kushner, paul manafort, and a russian lawyer at trump tower.

        "summary": "Smoking's bad, quitting's better, but don't start smoking in the first place if you can help it — because even those who give it up and think they're in the clear after a few years may have an unpleasant surprise lying in wait. Scientists from cancer research uk say that lung cancer can remain dormant for more than two decades, then suddenly morph into an aggressive form of the cancer that's difficult to treat. The study published in science reveals that initial genetic \" faults \" take place — and many of them are from smoking — but then those anomalies remain unknown for years, until new faults form later on and combine with the foundational faults to trigger a fast-moving growth of the disease. Lung cancer is the no. 1 cancer killer in the us of both men and women, and the survival rate is low compared to other cancers, according to the most recent numbers available from the american lung association: while the five-year survival rate for lung cancer that's detected early is 53.5 %, that rate plummets to 3.9 % if the tumor has spread to other organs. As the scientists in this study explain, lung cancer is notoriously difficult to treat because when the various genetic faults start cropping up down the line, they're genetically different and appear in various parts of the tumor; targeted treatments in one part of the tumor, therefore, aren't effective at wiping out cancer in other parts, notes cancer research uk. This study was admittedly small — researchers examined just seven patients who were smokers, ex-smokers, or non-smokers — but these sobering statistics and treatment challenges are lighting a fire under scientists to conduct more research like this that may eventually enable earlier intervention. \" if we can nip the disease in the bud and treat it before it has started traveling down different evolutionary routes, we could make a real difference in helping more people survive the disease, \" cancer research uk's chief scientist says.

            "Spatial and temporal dissection of the genomic changes occurring during the evolution of human non – small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) may help elucidate the basis for its dismal prognosis. We sequenced 25 spatially distinct regions from seven operable nsclcs and found evidence of branched evolution, with driver mutations arising before and after subclonal diversification. There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with apobec cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in apobec-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection. The regionally separated driver mutations, coupled with the relentless and heterogeneous nature of the genome instability processes, are likely to confound treatment success in nsclc. Space"

According to a police report, 24-year-old jason falbo said, \" they were in my path so i just kept mowing, \" but a witness whose horrified 7-year-old son was also present said falbo laughed as he drove out of his way to run over the duck family, then laughed as he backed up over them. The mother duck and four of her 11 ducklings made it back to a pond, but two of the ducklings drowned. \" they should have just thrown away the keys, \" the witness tells the palm beach post. \" there is no justification for what he's done. \" as part of the plea deal, falbo also pleaded guilty to domestic battery by strangulation about a month before the duck incident and will spend three years on probation, reports the sun sentinel. He's also banned from keeping animals or living with somebody who has pets. Last month, he wrote a letter to the judge urging him not to \" destroy my chance to be a pillar of the community \" and saying he plans to become an x-ray technician.

The official state news agency said that daraya has been \" cleansed \" of the \" remnants of armed terrorist groups. \" anti-government groups claimed 440 people across syria were killed by government forces yesterday, one of the highest single-day death tolls since the uprisings against bashar al-assad's government began in 2011. The majority of yesterday's killings were in the damascus area, along with 40 in aleppo and 28 in the heavily sunni deir al-zor. In other news, a grim-faced syrian vice president farouk al-sharaa was spotted in public for the first time in weeks today, reports the ap, ending speculation that he had defected.",

About 320 bodies, including women and children, were found in houses and basements in the town of daraya, southwest of damascus, according to activists who said on sunday most had been killed \" execution-style \" by troops. Activists uploaded several videos to the internet showing rows of bloodied bodies wrapped in sheets. Most of the dead appeared to be young men of fighting age, but at least one video showed several children who appeared to have been shot in the head. The body of one toddler was soaked in blood. Due to restrictions on non-state media in syria, it was impossible to verify the accounts independently. Clashes are raging across syria as the 17-month-old rebellion grows increasingly bloody, particularly in the northern city of aleppo, where the army and rebels appear stuck in a war of attrition. Fighting in aleppo on sunday was the heaviest in the past week, according to reuters journalists on the ground. Fighter jets dropped bombs and fired missiles on rebel-held districts in the south of aleppo, syria's largest city, as residents fled in panic.

Al-sharaa was last seen at the funeral of four top syrian government officials who were killed in a blast in damascus on july 18. Since then, speculation has circulated that he defected to jordan in what would have been a blow to bashar assad's regime. Jordan and al-sharaa's office repeatedly denied he defected. On sunday, reporters saw al-sharaa exit his car and walk to his office for a meeting with alaeddin boroujerdi, head of iran's powerful parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy. An associated press reporter at the scene said al-sharaa looked serious and steered away from reporters covering the meeting. He did not make a statement.",

Both decisions revolve around subsidies for people who signed up for obamacare on the federal exchange, as opposed to a state exchange. This morning, a three-judge panel in dc ruled that the federal enrollees aren't eligible for subsidies, which the washington post called a \" potentially crippling blow \" to obamacare. Without those subsidies, millions of low- and middle-income people who signed up would likely be unable to afford their premiums. Later, however, a three-judge panel from a federal appeals court in richmond, va., ruled in a separate case that subsidies for those on the federal exchange are fine, reports cnn. Or, more specifically, it said that the law's language was murky and thus deferred to the irs on the matter, reports reuters. The irs has previously said that the subsidies can go to people no matter whether they signed up on a federal or state exchange.

People reports 16-year-old sara manitoski, who was found unresponsive in her cabin bed after friends came back from breakfast, died of toxic shock syndrome, with the coroner's conclusion based on symptoms of the condition that sara exhibited, as well as evidence of staphylococcus aureus bacteria found on a tampon in her body. Per the coroner's report, sara had told others on the trip she didn't feel well on march 14, 2017, complaining of stomach cramps, the comox valley record reports. She went into her cabin for the night close to 10pm, and when her cabin mates returned from breakfast around 7: 30 the next morning, she was still in bed, her alarm going off. Cpr by teachers and paramedics was unsuccessful in resuscitating her. Per the mayo clinic, tss is caused when staphylococcus aureus bacteria creates toxins, causing high fever, seizures, and even death. Women are most at risk, especially young women who may not have built up antibodies, but men, kids, and postmenopausal women are also vulnerable. Other risk factors include burns or cuts on one's skin or a viral infection like the flu. Still, the condition is extremely rare — only 40 us cases were reported in 2016, per people — and for menstruating women, there are ways to prevent it, including swapping tampons out every few hours so bacteria doesn't have a chance to breed. \" there is such little education on this and it needs to be brought to light, \" sara's sister said on facebook in december, per fox news. \" such an unnecessary and tragic thing to happen to such an amazing young lady. \" ( this model has made it her mission to spread the word on tss. )",

Police were also investigating 1,067 other drug-related killings, dela rosa said, without giving details. On sunday, duterte railed against the united nations for criticizing the wave of deaths. The united states, a close ally of the philippines, said it was \"deeply concerned \" by the reports, and u.s.

To wit, the ap calls support for the extension \" unclear, \" and notes that sen. Patrick leahy wanted tighter restrictions on the government's power and may seek to amend it. In the house, some members of the freshman class elected on promises of making government smaller are skeptical. \" i still have some concerns, and at this point i ' m leaning against ( voting for ) it, \" said maryland rep.

In congo's shadow was published in april and excerpted in the telegraph last week, documenting what linton says was her \" nightmare \" after she got \" caught up in the fringes of the congolese war. \" but as buzzfeed notes, critics are outraged at a story they say is filled with inaccuracies, stereotypes, and out-and-out lies. After first describing africa as \" rife with hidden danger \" — including malaria, wild animals, and \" random acts of violence \" — she relays how congolese rebels invaded her village. \" i tried not to think what the rebels would do to the'skinny white muzungu with long angel hair ' if they found me, \" she writes, piling up what the guardian calls \" white savior in africa \" cliches, including talk about zimba, a \" smiling gap-toothed child with hiv whose greatest joy was to sit on my lap and drink from a bottle of coca-cola. \" online reaction has been fierce, especially from zambians, with a #lintonlies hashtag and even a parody account on twitter for that child who supposedly downed a coke in her lap. \" i did not have coca cola with that woman! \" the bio under the parody's avatar reads. Adding to the pile-on: gerard zytkow, who says in a facebook post that he owns a nearby fishing lodge and that there were no attacking rebels. \" i would like to wring her neck for writing so much rubbish, \" he writes, per buzzfeed, adding her book should be banned as a work of \" mindboggling and nonsensical fiction. \" in a statement, linton says, \" i am genuinely dismayed and very sorry to see that i have offended people as this was the very opposite of my intent. I wrote this book with the hope of conveying my deep humility, respect, and appreciation for the people of zambia and my sincere hope of making a positive impact. \" meanwhile, her book isn't doing so hot on amazon, where it's garnered nearly all one-star reviews.

        "summary": "Police are investigating nigella lawson's husband after photos were published in a uk tabloid yesterday showing him apparently grabbing her throat as they sat outside at a restaurant in mayfair. Witnesses tell the mirror that multimillionaire art dealer charles saatchi grabbed the tv chef's neck four times during a heated conversation, as lawson cried and appeared afraid. Saatchi eventually walked off as lawson continued to cry at the table before joining him in their waiting car. Saatchi tells the evening standard they were just having a \" playful tiff \" over their children, and insists \" there was no grip \" and he was just holding lawson's neck \" to emphasize my point. \" but \" it was utterly shocking to watch, \" says one witness. \" she raised her voice and got angry but at the same time was trying to calm him down, almost like you would try to calm down a child. \" she even kissed him at one point, the onlooker says. \" she ­appeared to be a woman who loves him but was clearly unable to stop him being abusive, ­frightening, and ­disrespectful to her. \" a scotland yard spokesperson confirms to the telegraph that officers are investigating, though he says lawson did not lodge a complaint against her husband of 10 years. She was spotted leaving their house with a suitcase yesterday morning, the daily beast reports, but saatchi says she was just trying — at his recommendation — to get away from the paparazzi.",

Just two days after it was reported that the evidence bag that apparently once contained the alleged victim's rape kit was found open and abandoned at her mother's front door, authorities are now saying it was a hoax, cbs chicago reports. \"the forensic evidence in this case was not tampered with, \" frank sedita, the da for new york's erie county, said at a news conference today. \"we believe that a person — the complainant's mother — is engaged in an elaborate hoax. \" according to the chicago tribune, sedita presented video evidence showing the rape kit was never out of the possession of authorities and was, in fact, never put in a bag at all, but a box. Cbs reports the bag found by the accuser's mother was actually given to her by a nurse during the rape test aug. 2 to put her daughter's clothing in. The accuser's lawyer, who quit the case yesterday due to being misled by the accuser's mother about how she obtained the bag, had originally claimed the bag was authentic. The apparent hoax came after it was revealed that the rape kit failed to turn up any of kane's dna. \" that speaks volumes to how important that dna evidence is, or the lack of it is, \" kane's lawyer says. \"why else would you do this if you weren't trying to undermine something you weren't happy with? \" charges against the alleged victim's mother are unlikely, as it doesn't appear it's illegal to lie to a private lawyer in new york. Sedita says it appears the accuser's lawyer was not involved in the hoax, and nothing has yet been presented to indicate the accuser herself was involved.",

Zach norris, who became interested in vintage watches after inheriting one a few years ago, says he found the 1959 jaeger-lecoultre deep sea alarm watch in a basket full of cheap watches with dead batteries, reports hodinkee, which calls it one of the greatest vintage watch finds of recent years. Only around 900 such watches, one of the first to feature an alarm for divers, were made. Norris delivered the timepiece to san francisco in person when he found a collector willing to buy. \" i knew i didn't want to keep it because it's kind of above my means to have a piece like that, \" norris tells ktvk, offering advice for others seeking treasure in thrift stores: \" you can do it. Research everything. Just take your phone in there and if you see something that looks goofy, you haven't seen it before, google it. You never know. \" he plans to use some of the cash to pay for his wedding later this year and has also donated some of it back to goodwill.

The ap and bbc report that the isolated indigenous tribe located on india's north sentinel island has apparently killed an american \" adventure tourist, \" with local media identifying the man as missionary john allen chau. Fishermen who took chau to the island — which he'd reportedly visited several times — say he was shot to death with arrows, his body left on the shoreline. A source tells afp, via ndtv, that the 27-year-old had first tried to get onto the island on nov. 14, failed, and then went back on friday. He left the fishermen's dinghy in a canoe and was bombarded with arrows when he got to shore, though \" he continued walking, \" per the source. When the fishermen saw tribespeople \" tying a rope around his neck and dragging his body, \" they got out of there. The next morning they cautiously re-approached the island and said they saw chau's body on the beach. It has traditionally been illegal to make contact with the sentinelese, though ndtv notes that a ban on foreigners visiting the island without prior government approval was lifted earlier this year — a decision criticized by a tribal-rights advocacy group. Police say seven fishermen have been arrested, and helicopters are said to have been deployed to look for chau's body, though how they ' ll retrieve it once they find it is unknown, as the notoriously hostile sentinelese are known to even attack choppers. Sources say chau was a \" preacher \" who'd been interested in converting the tribe. \" when a us citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts, \" says a rep for the us consulate in chennai, per the ap.

The thaw and sea level rise is expected to happen over the next few centuries, meaning that while there won't be a dramatic rise tomorrow, the result will be a very different planet, mother jones reports. Researchers believe the thaw is linked to climate change and while the point of no return has already passed, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions could at least slow the process down. \" if we have indeed lit the fuse on west antarctica, it's very hard to imagine putting the fuse out, \" a climate scientist who has studied polar ice sheets for decades tells the new york times. \" but there's a bunch more fuses, and there's a bunch more matches, and we have a decision now: do we light those? \"",

            "Looking for news you can trust? subscribe to our free newsletters. If you truly understand global warming, then you know it's all about the ice. That's what matters. Planet earth has not always had great ice sheets at the poles, of the sort that currently exist atop greenland and antarctica. In other periods, much of that water has instead been in liquid form, in the oceans — and the oceans have been much higher. How much? according to the national academy of sciences, the globe's great ice sheets contain enough frozen water to raise sea levels worldwide by more than 60 meters. That's about 200 feet. And it makes all the sea level rise that we've seen so far due to global warming appear piddly and insignificant. That's why scientists have long feared a day like this would come. Two new scientific papers, in the journals science and geophysical research letters, report that major glaciers that are part of the west antarctic ice sheet appear to have become irrevocably destabilized. The whole process may still play out on the scale of centuries, but due to the particular dynamics of this ice sheet, the collapse of these major glaciers now \"appears unstoppable, \" according to nasa ( whose researchers are behind one of the two studies )"

Except that directv and wifi services don't work outside the continental us or when the plane is flying above water — a fact the airline neglected to tell her, david alleges in a $ 5 million federal class-action lawsuit she filed against united, the record reports. \" this information [ that the services do not work ] is not disclosed to those who purchase directv or wifi on-board. It is not until after the purchase that the consumer learns he or she will not receive some or all of the service that has been paid for, \" david's complaint states, per the asbury park press. But united has a completely different take on things, issuing a statement that says her suit doesn't fly. \" on our directv-equipped planes, we clearly inform our passengers in writing on the screen before they confirm their purchase that ' live directv programming is not available while the aircraft is outside of the continental united states ' and that ' wi-fi service is available over the continental us, ' \" the statement reads, per the road warrior voices website. In the meantime, why — as andrew bender writing for forbes queries — is david \" creating a federal case \" out of her encounter rather than simply asking for her eight bucks back? because she thinks other people may have been scammed out of their money, too, her lawyer says, prompting her to file the complaint class-action style, per the new york post. \" defendants have earned millions of dollars, or more, from providing or purporting to … provide in-flight directv and wifi service, \" attorney jennifer sarnelli writes in the complaint. ( this guy filed a class-action lawsuit because he's upset about who makes blue moon beer. )",

Helene stapinski learned about alice in wonderland syndrome when her 10-year-old daughter complained \" everything in the room looks really small \" while having a bad headache. Well, stapinski writes in the new york times, she suffered similar perceptive problems as a child, and she soon discovered her son, mother, sister, brother, and cousin did too. So she contacted experts and learned that: british psychologist dr. John todd named the disorder in 1955 ( another name for it is todd's syndrome ). Possible causes include stress, migraines, infections, drugs ( cough medicines in particular ), and maybe epilepsy. It's no hallucination. The syndrome is likely triggered by a change in the brain's parietal lobe, which helps us perceive the environment and spatial relationships. One expert she contacted, grant liu, wrote in neurology that the syndrome can make objects appear bigger or smaller, closer or further, or wavy when they're really straight. ( it can also alter one's sense of time. ) the syndrome went away for 60 % of his subjects over the course of his 10-year study. And stapinski isn't alone. Rik hemsley wrote in the guardian in 2008 about how the syndrome's \" fisheye lens \" limited his social life and forced him to work at home, if at all, during most of his 20s. Only in his early 30s did it diminish and allow him to have a life. Yet \" it's not dangerous, \" a headache expert told nbc news. \" i've never met anybody who has so many [ episodes ] that it affects their life in a severe way, once they're reassured that it doesn't indicate a dangerous or ominous thing. \" and yes, some say alice in wonderland author lewis carroll, who suffered from migraines, may have had the syndrome, too.

Fred barley, 19, emerged, and he had an amazing story to tell — and thanks to the cops ' compassionate reaction, his story became even more amazing, per wsb-tv. A homeless biology major who'd come to register for his second semester, barley had pedaled a 20-inch bike six hours from conyers in the scorching georgia heat with just his tent, a few belongings, some water, and a box of cereal, setting up his tent until the dorms opened in august so he could job-hunt. The officers were stunned and brought him to a motel, where they paid for two nights. \" i could tell he was a good kid... Who had been dealt a bad hand, \" officer dicky carreker tells the herald-gazette.

According to reuters, that's how the vessels ended up passing through saudi arabian waters before suffering mechanical difficulties in iranian territory.

Instead, 10 sailors were captured by iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps. And the problems continued. \" it is clear that some, if not all, crew members provided at least some information to interrogators beyond name, rank, service number, and date of birth, \" reuters quotes the report as saying. Information given up by sailors included passwords to phones and laptops and the capabilities of their vessels. The detained sailors also shouldn't have eaten on camera, as the video was used as propaganda by iran, cnn reports.

Sailors who blundered into iranian waters in january divulged sensitive information to their captors while held at gunpoint by iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps, a u.s.

It said some of the 10 crew members gave away capabilities of their vessels, one of them disclosing his vessel's potential speed and suggesting it was on a \"presence \" mission to demonstrate u.s. Military power in the gulf. The incident, which embarrassed the united states, rattled nerves days before implementation of a u.s.-nuclear accord between iran and world powers negotiated by the administration of u.s.

But being selfless and nice pays off more in the long run, reports the los angeles times. Researchers in poland looked at how extremely self-centered people fare compared with those who are more empathetic and work at building loyal and trusting relationships. Dividing up college freshmen into small groups, the researchers found that after three months, those who reported high narcissistic personality traits enjoyed an early surge of popularity but eventually lost out to the emotionally intelligent, whose social skills revealed themselves more slowly. \"it seems that a quieter and less needy ego, coupled with abilities to perceive, understand, use, and manage emotions, ensure better relationships in the long run, \" the authors write in personality and social psychology bulletin. But those categories are not clear cut: it turns out that most of us fall somewhere in between. The students who fared the worst were those who scored low in both categories — \" a particularly unfortunate combination, \" the authors write. On the other hand, some narcissists also possessed enough emotional intelligence to make lasting friends. \" at the extreme of both, such a person could be a presidential candidate or a manipulative sociopath — or both, \" melissa healy writes in the times. Narcissists tended to \" churn \" through friends, which the researchers said was not a good strategy for keeping long-term allies, or staying popular.

The obama administration, he writes, has been trampling civil liberties from the get-go and getting a free pass from the media. But now that the media is the target, there's suddenly hell to pay. \" for years, the obama administration has been engaged in pervasive spying on american muslim communities and dissident groups, \" writes greenwald. Don't forget its renewal of the patriot act, its embrace of warrantless eavesdropping, and its overzealous prosecution of whistleblowers. The media largely stayed silent. \" leave to the side how morally grotesque it is to oppose rights assaults only when they affect you, \" he writes. \" the pragmatic point is that it is vital to oppose such assaults in the first instance no matter who is targeted because such assaults, when unopposed, become institutionalized. \" if a gop president had obama's record on civil liberties and transparency, progressives would be outraged, writes greenwald.

        "summary": "Argentine president cristina fernandez dropped a bombshell on the mysterious death of alberto nisman today, telling state media that suspicions \" have been converted into certainty. The suicide ( i ' m convinced ) was not a suicide. \" that's in direct contrast to her statement monday, which said she believed the special prosecutor committed suicide, notes the ap. Her comments come after the release of nisman's 289-page criminal complaint that accuses her administration of the cover-up he was to describe the day after he was found dead. Intercepted phone calls show argentina offered to protect iranian officials from charges linked to a 1994 bombing in exchange for oil, the complaint states, per the new york times. Negotiations between the two countries allegedly began in syria in 2011 when argentina's foreign minister indicated it would be better to improve trade with iran than pursue an investigation. Afterward, intelligence agents were tasked with \" constructing a false hypothesis, based on invented evidence, to incriminate new authors, \" according to the complaint. Talks mentioned blaming the bombing on right-wing groups and swapping oil for argentine grains and weapons, the complaint states, though a deal never came to fruition as argentina couldn't convince interpol to lift arrest warrants. But trade between argentina and iran \" improved significantly \" after 2010, an expert says, per the times. A rep for fernandez says the complaint is \" absolutely feeble. \" meanwhile, more questions in nisman's death: a locksmith discovered a \" barely closed \" service door to his apartment, while investigators say a fresh fingerprint and footprint were found in a third entrance connected to another apartment, the ap reports. A prosecutor adds that nisman's hand showed no gunpowder residue, though that's perhaps due to the small caliber of the gun used.",

Such delegates are democratic party insiders free to support any candidate at the convention, and clinton has the support of six of them in new hampshire, the hill reports. That means she's expected to have the same number of delegates from the state as bernie sanders, who won 15 delegates to clinton's nine in his huge new hampshire primary victory. Two superdelegates are still uncommitted. It will take 2,382 delegates to win the democratic nomination, and thanks to superdelegate support, clinton currently has 342 delegates while sanders has just 42, according to the ap. Clinton — who debates sanders in milwaukee thursday night — was out of public view on wednesday as her campaign assessed its next moves, reports cnn, which notes that while a clinton adviser describes superdelegates as her \" only true firewall, \" she presumably hasn't forgotten how dozens of delegates switched to obama after he won their districts in 2008.",

Still unidentified, the woman says she would have aborted her child if she'd known, and now worries for the future of her 8-year-old daughter — who has a 50 % chance of inheriting the incurable brain condition. It's the first time england has faced such a case of genetic responsibility: \" this could really change the way we do medicine, because it is about the duty that doctors have to share genetic test results with relatives and whether the duty exists in law, \" says anna middleton, an ethics expert at cambridge university. It's \" unhappy \" news, she notes, and \" you cannot take back that information once you have given it. \" the woman who's suing has a dark backstory: her dad murdered his wife in 2007 and was diagnosed with huntington's disease two years later, but asked doctors at st george's hospital in south london not to tell his pregnant daughter for fear she'd get an abortion. The doctors agreed, but in 2010 the woman received her own diagnosis, giving her a 50 % of succumbing to huntington's. So she sued st. George's healthcare nhs trust, a case that's now proceeding after being thrown out by a high court and reinstated on appeal. On the brighter side, the bbc reported last year that an experimental drug can correct the defect that causes huntington's. \" for the first time we have the potential, we have the hope, of a therapy that one day may slow or prevent huntington's disease, \" says the study's lead researcher.

        "summary": "Living under harsh conditions like extreme weather or food scarcity? then you're more likely to believe in powerful, judgmental gods, according to a new study. A group of researchers from various fields reached their conclusion after synthesizing historical data from 583 societies around the world, phys.org reports. \" when life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods, \" says study co-author russell gray, who adds that religion may help people come together and beat the odds. If true, the guardian says, this could explain the rise of christianity and islam in regions plagued by famine and dire climatic changes. But there's more: the researchers also sought links between religion and other factors, like politics and farming. Sure enough, the study found that societies with \" political complexity \" ( a hierarchy of figures outside the local community ) and animal husbandry often believe in high gods who impose a moral code. In the end, researchers could match societies to their religious beliefs with 91 % accuracy, the washington post reports. The findings also overlap with research showing that religion brings people together after a disaster like an earthquake, or that societies facing dire threats tend to restrict people's behavior. But studies until now have tried explaining religion either by environmental or cultural factors — not both. Gray also separates himself from \" evolutionists... Trying to bang religion on the head, \" he says. \" i think the challenge is to explain it. \" ( for more on religion, read about the mormons ' \" sacred undergarments. \" )",

        "summary": "On wednesday, the dow jones industrial average closed above 20,000 for the first time since it was established in 1896, leading to much fanfare … and just as much skepticism about the milestone's significance. Quartz, for example, calls hitting this benchmark \" meaningless, \" offering a mathematical illustration — as well as an explainer about a \" weird \" figure called the dow divisor — that shows why we can basically \" ignore the dow \" when it comes to assessing the overall economy. Other takes from around the web: the new york times lays out some basic facts on the numbers, noting that only 30 companies make up the dow and that the percentage jump from 10,000 points to 20,000 isn't nearly as impressive as its climb to 1,000 for the first time, in 1972. A former reagan budget chief calls this \" the greatest sucker's rally in history \" and the \" greatest short of all time, \" predicting a plummet is heading our way. Trump supporters are already singing \" hail to the chief \" for the numbers spike, but slate says to keep the bubbly corked. It reasserts what quartz and the times are saying ( namely, that the dow isn't reflective of the economy as a whole ) and notes the middle class isn't likely to reap major benefits from the event. As for trump's personal finance blueprint: it simply hasn't had time to pan out yet, so he can't take the credit for this one. The australian financial review calls the development \" fake news, \" claiming that no \" sentient and sensible human being should base any investment decision on the dow. \" it all comes down to the concept of \" reflation. \" the number that forbes says we should be keeping our eyes on more than the \" hype \" over the dow: the 30-year us treasury yield.",

Samples: \" chris matthews, joe scarborough, pat harvey, brian williams, soledad obrien, wolf blitzer, meredith viera, tavis smiley, and anderson cooper, keep up the great work and follow cronkite's lead.

        "summary": "Not content to have won the internet, google now looks to be eyeing another conquest: tv. The search and advertising giant has reportedly been in talks with media companies about the possibility of licensing their content for an online tv service that would rival traditional cable providers, the wall street journal reports. Sources say the service would include both live tv and on-demand programming, a la netflix and hulu. And google is not alone: intel and sony are said to be working on similar ideas, and apple has also been trying to get into the tv market. \" google feels the need to beat apple to the punch, \" says a source privy to the content of google's meetings, per the new york times. But it's all just talk at this stage. Google started working on a similar service two years ago, but talks with media companies went nowhere. Though things have changed since then — broadband is faster and online tv more common — subverting the traditional media system is still a big task. Intel has struggled in its tv efforts because many channels are already locked into contracts with big cable providers and can't license to anyone else, reports the times. Google and others would likely still have to pay for the same bundles cable providers do — ones with popular and unpopular channels — and somehow find a way to compete on price, the journal reports.",

            "Google's renewed push was first reported by the wall street journal tuesday afternoon. Intel is trying to create a similar over-the-top service, but it has run into roadblocks set up by time warner cable and other incumbent television distributors. These include contracts between existing distributors and some channel owners that prohibit the channels from being licensed to new competitors like intel. An intel spokesman declined to comment on tuesday. Another challenge involves channel owners like the walt disney company and viacom, who could stand to benefit or suffer greatly from the potential service, depending on how it is developed. Some owners doubt that there is much of a market for cable via the internet in the first place, and they are content with the three methods of distribution they have today: cable companies like comcast, the satellite providers directv and dish network, and the fiber optic providers verizon fios and at&t u-verse. But if intel, google or another firm succeeds in selling a cablelike bundle, some of those existing distributors would almost certainly start doing the same thing. That would represent a sea change for the cable industry, whose firms have historically stayed with their own regional footprints and avoided direct competition with each other. One of the reasons directv recently tried, unsuccessfully, to buy hulu was because the web site could have helped position the company in an over-the-top marketplace. One of the country's smaller cable companies, cox communications, is already trying what amounts to this service in orange county, calif. There, the company recently started selling a bundle of nearly 100 channels to its customers who have broadband but not cable tv. The company has called it a \"small trial, \" and it declined to comment on its status on tuesday. \"we are still early on, results and customer feedback will determine if we proceed with any future plans on this product, \" todd smith, a cox spokesman, said.
