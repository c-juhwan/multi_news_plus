The chicken breast hit a 13-year-old girl and left her with a welt, while the green drink hit a senior citizen participating in the race with the help of a walker, reports q13fox.

Those runners, by the way, were raising money for cancer research as part of a susan g. Komen run.

        "summary": "A booming economy would seem to be good news all around, but a new study finds a strange thing: more middle-aged people and seniors tend to die in a strong economy than in a weak one, reports medical news today. Specifically, netherlands researchers found that death rates in developed countries rose for people 40-44 and 70-74 as the gdp ticked up. Every 1 % rise in the gdp translated into an increase in the death rate for both groups of about 0.36 %. So what's going on? the scientists aren't sure, but they float a number of theories rounded up by livescience. A strong economy means more people are schlepping out to work in the morning, which theoretically raises the risk of traffic accidents and work-related stress, at least for the 40-somethings. As for the older group, they might be getting less care from adult children tied to their jobs. The researchers say these are just best guesses, however, and say the topic needs more study.",

The researchers looked at 19 developed countries, and compared the historical figures of gross domestic product ( gdp ) — an indicator of national economic well-being — to death rates among 40- to 44-year-olds, and 70- to 74-year-olds, between 1950 and 2008. The results showed that over the decades, there has been a close link between an increase in gdp and a decrease in death rates in all of the countries studied. But a closer look at economic fluctuations revealed a different trend. In almost all of the countries in the study, death rates rose during booming economic years, and decreased in downward-trending years.

The new york times reports on the start of the trial for artur mas, who was charged with civil disobedience for banding together with two other politicians to set up the past referendum, which ended up garnering a majority of votes for secession from all those who cast ballots. The nonbinding vote had been declared illegal by spain's judiciary, and now prosecutors want to keep mas and his two cohorts from running for office for a decade. The separatist demonstration outside the courthouse turned into a \" pro-independence show of force, \" per politico europe, with mas supporters waving banners and yelling, \" you are not alone. \" mas conceded he did help the 2014 vote along — al jazeera notes he was catalonia's regional leader at the time — but he insisted he was only supporting an initiative that tens of thousands of volunteers organized ( and which was deemed illegal by the courts just days before the vote ). Only about 2.3 million out of 6.3 million eligible citizens voted, but of those, more than 80 % said they wanted to break free from spain. Mariano rajoy, spain's conservative prime minister, and his government don't want the autonomous region to succeed in its attempt to secede, though one of his reps told reporters after mas ' monday hearing: \" no one is being judged for his political ideas, \" per politico. Mas had earlier noted in court that \" independence isn't on trial here, democracy is on trial, \" al jazeera notes.",

        "summary": "It took years of pressure by indigenous groups, but an inquest is underway in canada into the deaths of five first nations teens who drowned in two rivers in thunder bay, ontario. As the cbc reports in a lengthy look at the issue, the five male teens were between 15 and 18, and they drowned in separate incidents between 2000 and 2011. All had come to thunder bay from remote, impoverished communities to get a high school education. Did they drown accidentally? were they killed? did they commit suicide? the inquest aims to answer those questions, as well as those surrounding the deaths of two other first nations teens in non-drowning incidents. \" you're sending your kids out to get an education and they come back in a bodybag, \" says joe meekis, a former chief of keewaywin first nation. So much time has passed, however, that the prospect of fresh evidence in the cases is slim. Still, the inquest is shedding light onto larger issues at play: the struggles of first nations teens who arrive in a city and stay with boarding families, ill-equipped to deal with the strange new world and the racism they encounter. Many turn to alcohol. One of the drowned youths was a gifted painter named kyle morriseau, whose father, christian, draws solace from a first nations legend about a slumbering giant. The giant promises that his people's spirit will rise in seven generations — kyle's generation. Christian morriseau says his son allowed his life to be taken to raise awareness about the troubles of first nations students. \" i know today, by what happened to him, that kyle fulfilled his dream of wanting to do something meaningful, \" he says. \" i ' m proud of my son. \" ( read the full story. )",

        "summary": "A coast guard member has been removed from the response to tropical storm florence for flashing what some took as a white-power sign, the washington post reports. During a live msnbc coast guard briefing, the man — sporting a crew cut at a desk in the background — looks at the camera and flashes an \" ok \" sign by making a circle with his thumb and index finger while scratching his face ( see the video here ). The clip quickly hit twitter, where many people called for the guy's firing ( \" this needs to be investigated and this man needs to be ousted/removed/discharged! \" reads one ). Not long after, the coast guard sent the unidentified member packing: \" the coast guard has... Removed him from the response, \" the organization tweeted. \" his actions do not reflect those of the united states coast guard. \" now media outlets are revisiting the roots of \" ok \" as a possible white-power sign. Seems it all started on a feb. 28 thread on 4chan's / pol/ board, where commenters invented the notion that the thumb-finger circle sign means white power, buzzfeed reported in april. The comment \" our goal is to convince people on twitter that the ' ok ' hand sign has been co-opted by neo-nazis \" was followed by others reading \" we successfully false flagged \" and \" hahahahahaahahahaha... \" it later became an issue when gop operative zina bash made the sign during the brett kavanaugh hearings and sparked a tweetstorm of criticism ( her husband said bash was just resting her hand in a \" random way, \" per the post ). Which leaves it uncertain: is this an online joke or a white-power symbol — or did one become the other?",

Virgin group founder richard branson is giving certain staff parental leave on full pay for one year after the birth or adoption of a child. It follows the introduction of a law in the u.k. Allowing new moms and dads to share 50 weeks leave between them, 37 of them on partial pay. \" as a father and now a granddad to three wonderful grandchildren, i know how magical the first year of a child's life is but also how much hard work it takes, \" said branson. Related: how companies are keeping new moms on the job but there are some limits on virgin's generous new offer. It only applies to 140 staff working in london and geneva for virgin management, the virgin group's investment and brand licensing company. There's also a service requirement: employees must have spent more than four years at the company to take home full pay during their parental leave. Those with less than two years service will be eligible for 25 % of their salary for 52 weeks. It's the second new perk for virgin management staff in less than a year. In september, branson gave them permission to take unlimited leave",
            "New york ( thestreet ) -- richard branson's virgin management is taking employee benefits to a new level, announcing today a policy allowing up to one year of fully paid leave for new parents. Virgin management said it will allow new moms and dads, including adoptive parents, to receive up to 100 % of their salary over a 52-week period of shared parental leave.

        "summary": "For claire nelson, her moment of \" complete and utter terror \" came in the middle of a hike in california's joshua tree national park. Per the bbc, the new zealand native, who was visiting the us and cat-sitting for friends, headed over to the park on may 22 for a solo trek. But instead of some exercise and sun, she reenacted james franco's 127 hours after falling 22 feet off a boulder and smashing her pelvis, the new york post reports. \" i knew there was nothing i could do to stop myself, \" the 35-year-old says, per the bbc. \" it was like going in slow motion. \" in terrible pain, barely able to move, and with no phone service, nelson first panicked, then kicked into survival mode. That included popping aspirin, crafting a sun shield out of a stick and plastic bag, and setting goals: the first half of each day was dedicated to screaming for help, the second half to keeping the sun at bay in the 100-degree-plus desert. When nelson ran through her water, she turned to her own urine, which tasted like \" bad, flat beer, \" she tells the post. She also made short videos on her phone, which she's not sure she can watch yet. On her fourth day out there she spotted a helicopter and heard a voice say on the pa system, \" claire, we're looking for you \" ( a friend had reported her missing ). She was rescued late friday afternoon and taken to a hospital, where she had reconstructive surgery on her pelvis. Though grateful to be alive, what's now throwing nelson is the us health-care system and her mounting bills. \" i ' m being scanned for every pill i take, every injection i get, \" she tells the bbc. \" i have a barcode and everything's going on a tab somewhere. It's disconcerting. \" a gofundme page aimed at helping her pay for everything has raised more than $ 19,000. More on nelson's ordeal on what appears to be her twitter feed.",

He added, per the washington post, that the \" vast majority of fbi employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection \" with comey. Another contradiction to the white house is how mccabe sees the probe into the russia-trump ties. Although trump spokeswoman sara huckabee sanders had mentioned wednesday that that investigation was \" probably one of the smallest things that [ the fbi has ] going on their plate, \" per the new york times, mccabe had a different label for the inquiry and its priority on the fbi's to-do list: \" highly significant. \" mccabe didn't reveal whether trump himself is being investigated, but he did talk about trump's claim in his pink-slip letter to comey that the director had told him personally, \" three times, \" that he wasn't under investigation. Mccabe told the senate committee that, as a rule, fbi members don't fill someone in on whether they're being investigated, a claim backed up by ex-fbi agents who said such remarks would be \" unthinkable, \" as the ap puts it. There's been \" no effort to impede \" the probe so far, mccabe assured the committee, per politico. He also said if anyone from the white house or anywhere else tries to interfere, he'd be the first to say so. \" i absolutely do, \" he replied when asked if he would give his word he'd sound the alarm if anyone tried to hinder the investigation, per the post.

Instead, the texas cop with 10 years on the austin police force drew his firearm and shot and killed high school senior david joseph, who was unarmed, and the austin pd on monday fired freeman for those actions, calling it excessive force. \" officer freeman's decision to draw his weapon when he exited his vehicle was unwarranted, \" police chief art acevedo said. Freeman, 41, responded to complaints from several residents that morning that a young black man was bothering locals and chasing a man. \" sounds like this guy could either be, he's 10-86 ( subject with mental illness ) and losing it or high or something, \" freeman, who is also black, told a dispatcher. Because the suspect was possibly \" displaying symptoms of substance-induced excited delirium, \" freeman was supposed to wait for backup, per kxan — but instead got out of his car and drew his weapon. Freeman warned david not to come closer, but david reportedly rushed him, and freeman fired, just out of view of his cruiser's dashcam. Per an attorney for david's family, autopsy and toxicology tests showed no gunpowder residue on david's body ( meaning freeman and david weren't in an \" up-close struggle \" ) and that david had xanax, pot, and antihistamines in his system and wasn't a drug-induced danger, fox 7 reports. \" my family is glad to hear that officer freeman will not hurt any other unarmed black men, \" david's brother said in a statement. Meanwhile, the combined law enforcement associations of texas and the local police association say david's death was what the austin chronicle calls an \" unwelcome byproduct of insufficient training. \" it's not yet known if freeman, who has 10 days to appeal, will face criminal charges.",

John and kurt schwartz began their 3,000-mile journey this week, telling mashable that manning the oars nude cuts down on blisters, sores, and other problems that pesky clothing causes. \" it's kind of a running joke in the rowing community that, if you're going to do this, you'd better be prepared to row naked, \" says john.the duo set out from the canary islands on wednesday in a 24-foot craft that kurt, 29, explained looks less like a typical rowboat and \" more like a rocket ship \" with a cabin on each end — one for sleeping, one for supplies — sandwiching an open middle. Autopilot and foot pedals help with steering, per old city life, and the brothers plan to alternate rowing in two-hour shifts with someone always on the lookout for an imminent collision with a cargo ship. \" you're not going that fast and you're looking at nothing but blue ocean for 45 days or so, \" john, 33, tells mashable by phone. The brothers, who rowed on their college crew teams, are among a dozen teams competing in the talisker whisky atlantic challenge, which bills itself as the \" world's toughest row. \" the schwartzes are hoping to raise $ 25,000 for thesamfund.org, a charity that helps young adults with cancer, in honor of a friend who died of melanoma. No word if the other teams have opted to row au naturel, though john insists nude rowing really is a thing. \" it's not atypical.

The houston rockets have offered lin a hefty $ 25 million, three-year contract that could force the knicks to let go of the electric point guard. The big problem is the third year of the deal, during which is houston set to pay lin $ 14.8 million; for cap purposes, houston's offer works out to $ 8.4 million a year. But if the knicks match it the team would get charged the full amount in the third year and therefore get slammed by the nba's new luxury tax, resulting in a salary and tax payout as big as $ 60 million. Lin is the most popular knick in a decade and fans are freaking out. The team has until 11: 59pm tomorrow to make up its mind; but as the team recently signed aging point guard jason kidd and traded for raymond felton, another point guard, on saturday, it certainly looks like it doesn't intend to sign lin. Even knicks star carmelo anthony didn't exactly offer much support for lin. \" it's not up to me, \" said anthony. \" it's up to the organization to say that they want to match that ridiculous contract. \" kidd, who signed a three-year, $ 9.5 million deal with the knicks on thursday, was arrested for drunk driving early sunday after crashing his suv into a pole, reports the new york daily news.

Other government officials chimed in, and a former government minister issued a rebuttal in this video, reports business insider. In a followup video, regan clarified: \"i was never implying that conditions in denmark were similar in any way to the current tragedy on the ground there in venezuela, \" she said. \" i was merely pointing out... That socialism is not the way. \" jensen, for his part, took that as a victory. \" thanks to all who helped put pressure on trish and fox to have them correct their claim, \" he wrote, with translation from the times.

For starters, he survived the holocaust thanks to a risky gamble. For another, he's a prolific toy inventor and the brainchild behind the transformers franchise. And if that's not enough, he also happened to change the game of poker. The chain of events begins in poland during world war ii. While in a concentration camp, orenstein saved himself and his brothers by lying and saying they were all mathematicians and scientists. They escaped execution by working on a special project, which itself was a bogus one cooked up by german scientists eager to avoid the war themselves, per newsweek. Regardless, orenstein's gamble paid off, and he emigrated to the us after the war. The story recounts how the entrepreneurial orenstein became a toymaker and the holder of more than 100 patents. Decades ago, he made a mint with suzy homemaker appliances, johnny lightning racing cars, and dolls of all kinds. Then, at a toy fair, he saw a little noticed toy car that turned into a plane, and voila, he pitched to hasbro the idea that turned into the transformers behemoth. That's a storied enough life for anyone. But in his 60s, orenstein took up poker as a pastime. He realized the game was boring to watch and came up with the idea of putting a camera beneath the table so viewers could see what players had. His \" hole-card-cam \" ( yes, he's got the patent for that, too ) is now a poker staple and a key factor behind the game's current popularity. ( read newsweek's piece in full here. )",

        "summary": "It's a headline-generating mea culpa. Brian williams today admitted that he was not aboard a helicopter that took fire and was forced down on a march 24, 2003, mission during the invasion of iraq. The claim has been repeated by the nbc news anchor and the network over the years — most recently this past friday during a segment on a tribute for a retired soldier at a new york rangers hockey game. The claim came undone after crew members on the 159th aviation regiment's chinook that was hit told stars and stripes that williams and his crew were actually aboard a chinook that lagged about an hour behind the three that came under fire; williams ' chopper eventually landed by a downed helicopter after being forced down by a looming sandstorm. Willliams had this to say to stars and stripes: \" i would not have chosen to make this mistake. I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another. \" politico points out that a crew member of the downed chinook commented on the hockey game story on saturday on facebook, writing, \" sorry dude, i don't remember you being on my aircraft. I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened. \" politico reports williams has also posted a lengthy apology on facebook, which reads in part, \" you are absolutely right and i was wrong. In fact, i spent much of the weekend thinking i'd gone crazy. I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since i found my own writing about the incident from back in ' 08, and i was indeed on the chinook behind the bird that took the rpg in the tail housing just above the ramp. \"",

The north carolina couple, parents to 2- and 4-year-old girls, found out lindsey has polycystic ovary syndrome while trying to conceive a third time, usa today reports. She took fertility drugs, and as soon as doctors realized she was carrying at least six babies — they later discovered it was actually seven — the justices were asked about selective reduction, which would mean terminating some of the pregnancies so the others might have a better shot of surviving. \" steve and i didn't even have to look at each other, \" lindsey tells wcnc. \" that was just not going to be an option. \" the babies, given names by their parents that spelled out \" messiah \" ( mercy, evie, shiloh, sage, issac, aspen, and honor ), needed to make it to the critical 23-week mark — but didn't. They found out issac had died at 12 weeks; at 16 weeks, they found out the other six babies were all girls. But at 21 weeks, lindsey started having contractions, and on sept. 23, she gave birth to mercy. \" we said goodbye to mercy, and i was laying on that table for two hours trying to do everything i could in my power, which was nothing, to relax and stop having contractions, \" she says. The other five babies were born and survived about two hours as their parents held them. Despite the sadness, \" i would do the past... 21 weeks again and again and again if i had the choice, \" lindsey says. They're telling their story to spread the idea of hope amid sorrow — on their blog, they write, \" it was in that operating room that we experienced the greatest pain and sorrow we have ever experienced. But it was in that operating room that we beheld and embraced the glory of god like never before. \" ( another story grabbing headlines this week: the baby who completed a bucket list before his ever-so-brief life began. )",

The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in germany who, like kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before kathleen ( and whose daughters mike peterson ended up raising ). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, wral and the ap report. A new trial was ordered. The alford plea entered by peterson friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict. He walked out free afterward, though his wife's sister declared in court, \" you will be a convicted felon forever. \" peterson had said earlier he didn't want to take the plea, but he didn't think he'd ever get a fair second trial by prosecutors. \" i am not going to put my life and my freedom in their hands. \" ( prison inmates say a fellow inmate was thrown down the stairs and killed by the \" beat up squad. \" )",

Somehow, a wood-and-steel bench that weighed more than 100 pounds broke free from the wall and hit the boy, killing him, the record reports. Brendan, a student at another local school, was a member of an indoor soccer team; practice was about to start at 6: 30pm when the ball rolled near the table. Berkley street also uses the gym as a cafeteria, and the fold-down tables and benches are stored vertically in the wall. Typically, they're secured with a key, and authorities don't know whether this one was properly secured or whether brendan perhaps touched it. Only the left bench fell, while the table and the right bench remained in the wall. The bench apparently hit his head and he immediately collapsed; someone reportedly saw him trapped beneath the bench and ran to lift it off. The coach, an off-duty police officer, performed cpr as parents called 911, but jordan was pronounced dead around 7: 30pm at a nearby medical center. The gym is closed through at least the weekend as officials investigate. The record notes that the us consumer product safety commission has heard of several child deaths related to the tables, most of which occurred while they were being moved. In at least one other similar incident, a foldaway table fell away from a wall in massachusetts, killing a 4-year-old boy in 2000. \" they don't look very safe, \" a parent whose child attends berkley street tells news 12. \" i've never been comfortable with them. \" ( a 2-year-old boy died in san francisco when a dolphin statue fell on him. )",

But the tweet caught fire, garnering more than 470,000 favorites and more than 203,000 retweets — meaning messina would need to write a check out for nearly $ 220,000. \" i was originally planning on donating personally $ 1,000, \" she says. The 19-year-old, who doesn't have $ 200,000 lying around, put a halt to the offer the next day. But she didn't want to totally renege, so she created a gofundme to at least partly make up the gap. As of friday, she'd raised more than $ 60,000. She explains on the fundraising page that she got the idea to donate to st. Jude after a friend told her about visiting with his grandmother in the hospital over the holiday. \" it made me start thinking about the children who were spending their holidays in the hospital, and how it really was a reality for others, \" she says. Per the spokesman-review, st. Jude posted an acknowledgment of her efforts online. And a woman who says she's a st. Jude patient also made note. \" i want to say thank you, \" she tweeted. \" without the generosity of people donating, so many of us would not be here today. I owe my life to st jude. \"",

        "summary": "Pope francis has changed church teaching about the death penalty, saying in a new policy published thursday it's always \" inadmissible \" because it \" attacks \" the inherent dignity of all humans. The vatican says francis has approved a change to the catechism of the catholic church, the compilation of official catholic church teaching. Previously, the catechism said the church didn't exclude recourse to capital punishment \" if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor, \" per the ap. The new teaching, contained in catechism no. 2267, says the previous policy is outdated and that there are other ways to protect the common good. \" consequently the church teaches, in the light of the gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, \" reads the new text, approved in may. In a letter, the head of the vatican's doctrine office says the development of catholic doctrine on capital punishment didn't contradict prior teaching but was an evolution of it. Francis has long railed against the death penalty, insisting it can never be justified, no matter how heinous the crime. During his 2015 us visit, he told congress he'd long advocated \" for the global abolition of the death penalty, \" per the new york times. He announced his intention to change church teaching on capital punishment last october, when he noted the death penalty violates the gospel and amounts to the voluntary killing of a human life, which \" is always sacred in the eyes of the creator. \" he acknowledged in the past even the papal states had allowed this \" extreme and inhuman recourse, \" but he said the holy see had erred in allowing a mentality that was \" more legalistic than christian \" and now knew better.",

Morsi rescinded the temporary extra powers that he granted himself last month, but he kept the referendum on a draft constitution on track for dec. 15, reports al-jazeera. Those two issues have led to weeks of protests across the country. Morsi's critics want the referendum delayed because they think the proposed constitution is biased against them. Earlier today, a state-sponsored newspaper reported that morsi was beginning preparations to declare martial law. After that, however, the military stepped into the controversy for the first time by calling for \" serious \" dialogue between the government and opposition.

At least seven people have been killed in the unrest, as demonstrators opposing and supporting morsi clashed near the presidential palace.

A referendum on a draft constitution would, however, still go ahead as planned on december 15, said selim al-awa, an official acting as spokesman of a meeting morsi held earlier on saturday with other political leaders. \" the constitutional decree is annulled from this moment, \" al-awa said. Harvard associate professor tareq masoud tells al jazeera that the opposition's refusal of dialogue was an ' error'the decree and the referendum were at the heart of anti-morsi protests that have rocked egypt in the past two weeks. At least seven people have been killed in the unrest, as demonstrators opposing and supporting morsi clashed near the presidential palace. He said that constitutionally, morsi was unable to change the date for the referendum. But he added that, if the draft constitution were rejected, a new one would be drawn up by officials elected by the people, rather than ones chosen by parliament as for the current text. Al jazeera's sherine tadros, reporting from cairo, said the withdrawal of the november 22 decree was a \" huge development \", but \" for the opposition, this may only go half way in terms of their demands being met. \" \" the big question"

Skyfall, directed by sam mendes, contains plenty of the action-packed elements we've come to expect from 007 — but also has some serious heart, critics say: \" the latest addition to the bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling, plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis, \" writes joe morgenstern in the wall street journal. \" we need 007, even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations, to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. \" writing in slate, dana stevens says bond travels to \" deeper and darker places than he's visited in a long while, maybe ever, \" in an \" unexpectedly somber, even elegiac film. \" it's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his. \" it sure beats casino royale, writes manohla dargis in the new york times. This film \" gets bond just right \" as it \" grasps the spy's existential center... There's brutal death here, but there's also a pervading sense of mortality that makes the falling bodies register a little longer than they sometimes do in a bond movie. \" \" this is bond like you've never seen him, almost freudian in his vulnerability.

' \" only rather than the dinner dishes or scattered toys, \" this \" was referring to the world's oceans and the vast quantities of plastic with which humanity has filled them. As al-jazeera reports, 20-year-old boyan slat's answer to his own question is what he calls simply the ocean cleanup, a pilot project he's looking to get off the ground and into the water near japan's tsushima island next year. The idea is to deploy a mile-plus-long barrier moored to the seabed in an area rife with plastic — longer term, slat aims to take on the great pacific garbage patch, eventually cleaning half of it — and let ocean currents push trash to the barrier to be collected. Notes gizmodo: \" these barriers aren't nets — sea life gets tangled in those. They're big, v-shaped buffers anchored by floating booms. \" and they work because most trash is found in the top six or seven feet of water, allowing critters to pass through below. \" the reason we picked that location is because the current and wave conditions are very favorable for our tests, and there really is a lot of plastic, \" he says. So how is a 20-year-old dutch kid going to pull this off? his crowdfunding effort pulled down $ 2 million, he's got a team of about 100 scientists helping develop the project, and he's attracting some high-profile buy-in from the likes of the mayors of tsushima and los angeles, and even mtv, which calls him \" a 20-year-old captain planet. \" ahead of next year's pilot, the project will deploy 50 ships this summer to make a high-res map of plastic in the pacific between hawaii and california.

        "summary": "\" if you were handed $ 1,100 a month, would you amount to anything? \" so asks the los angeles times in a sunday headline atop a piece about a unique experiment underway in germany. Michael bohmeyer, a 31-year-old internet entrepreneur in berlin, is behind mein grundeinkommen ( my basic income ), which, so far, is giving 26 people $ 1,100 each month to spend any way they choose. It's all about helping people feel secure and free, he says, and it's an idea that springs out of his own experience. In an august 2014 interview with vice, he explained that he had that year made the choice to stop working and start \" living off the approximately $ 1,300 i get out of my company. I just wanted to put my feet up and do nothing. Instead, i found a crazy drive to do things. I had a million new business ideas, i take care of my daughter, and i work for... Local community radio. \" the money for mein grundeinkommen comes from crowdfunding ( more than 31,000 donors so far ), and when enough donations are collected, more people are selected via a random drawing from a pool of 66,000 applicants, according to the times. Deutsche welle reports things kicked off in july 2014, and the winners thus far have included students, the unemployed, and two children, ages 4 and 8. How are the winners using the cash? one recipient spent a month's stipend on partying ( bohmeyer: \" he needed to get that out of his system \" ). Another quit his call-center job and went back to school to become a kindergarten teacher. And another intends to \" hire a new employee to help my ecological vegetable garden business grow. \" \" the one thing that everyone tells us is that they're able to sleep much better, \" bohmeyer tells the times. Not much really changes in recipients'day-to-day lives, he adds, \" but there is a big change that takes place in their minds. People feel liberated and they feel healthier. \" ( a surprising number of people don't know what their partner makes. )",

The bbc reports that changed in a startling way on tuesday with the shock 11th-hour confession of wojciech janowski, 69. The former polish diplomat to monaco was on wednesday found guilty of ordering the hit that killed his partner's billionaire mother at age 77, as well as her driver. The two were exiting a hospital in nice where pastor had been visiting her son when a gunman fired on them. The chauffeur died four days later; pastor, who was heir to a real-estate empire within monaco, died roughly two weeks after the attack. The local reports her family owned some 4,000 apartments, and prosecutors argued the crime was a financial one. They said janowski's businesses were failing, and that the € 500,000 he and his common-law partner of 28 years, sylvia ratkowski, received from her mother each month was at risk, as the payments would cease upon ratkowski's own death; she had been diagnosed with cancer in 2012. Janowski's personal trainer was handed a 30-year sentence for helping arrange the hit. He quoted janowski as saying to him, \" this cannot go on, sylvia's illness has deteriorated, we have to get rid of the old woman. Can you help me? \" janowski has been sentenced to life in prison, as were the gunman and the man who acted as lookout. The confession was actually read aloud by janowski's lawyer as janowski cried next to him. The times reports the lawyer had asked that his client be acquitted of the driver's murder; he was not.

The posturing comes even as the situation on the ground grows thornier; essentially the country has split in three, a dire front-page new york times analysis concludes, with radical islamists dominating a sunni region in the north, hezbollah and other pro-regime forces controlling the country's midsection, and kurds staking out an autonomous region. \" it is not that syria is melting down, \" one analyst says. \" it has melted down. \"",

            "Motorola's next flagship phone won't only have sensors that will know when you are going to take a photo or when it is in your pocket, but it will be the first smartphone assembled in the u.s. During an interview at the all things d conference, ceo of motorola dennis woodside revealed the company's plans for the long-rumored \" moto x \" phone, which will have a oled screen and will be released later this summer. Woodside wouldn't detail any other specifications of the phone, but said that it will have long battery life and that sensors on it will allow it to know when you are using it. The phone will be made at flextronics ' 500,000-square foot facility in fort worth, texas, which was once used to make nokia phones. While the phone will be designed, engineered and assembled in the u.s., not all the components in the phone will be made in the u.s. The processor and screen, for example, will be made overseas. \" there are several business advantages to having our illinois and california-based designers and engineers much closer to our factory, \" motorola said in a statement. \" for instance, we ' ll be able to iterate on design much faster, create a leaner supply chain, respond much more quickly to purchasing trends and demands, and",

The couple — kate mcclure, 28, and mark d ' amico, 39 — started the campaign after bobbit rescued a stranded mcclure last october by giving her $ 20 in gas money on a philadelphia freeway. Thousands of donors responded to the feel-good story by pumping $ 402,706 into the campaign over nine months, but bobbit didn't get all of it. \" mark d ' amico and kate mcclure gave johnny about $ 75,000, \" says bobbit's lawyer. \" there should be close to another $ 300,000 available to johnny. \" d ' amico and mcclure say they gave bobbit over half the money but are keeping the rest until he gets clean: \" giving him all that money, it's never going to happen. I ' ll burn it in front of him, \" d ' amico tells the philadelphia inquirer. Giving so much money to a drug addict is like \" giving him a loaded gun. \" but bobbit wonders how mcclure, a receptionist, paid for a new bmw and vacations including a helicopter trip in the grand canyon. D ' amico, meanwhile, admits he took gambling money from the fund but swears he repaid it. As for bobbit — who admits to a daily opiate addiction — he's back on the streets of philadelphia and blames everything on the couple's \" greed. \" gofundme is looking into the campaign and says it will \" work to ensure... That the donors ' intentions are honored. \" ( bobbit originally hoped to spend his sudden windfall on helping others. )",

        "summary": "With president obama's term coming to an end, the sons of julius and ethel rosenberg are again calling on the president to clear their mother of the espionage charge for which they believe she was wrongly executed in 1953 in an intense cold war case. Michael and robert meeropol say their father was a soviet spy but grand jury testimony shows their mother was not, per the telegraph. It actually shows ethel's brother, david greenglass — who worked at the headquarters of the manhattan project and later served 10 years for spying — initially said he'd never discussed atomic secrets with his sister. The meeropols believe greenglass lied six months later, when he said he saw ethel transcribing secrets, to cover-up his wife's own role in the case. Greenglass later admitted he was pressured to lie by prosecutor roy cohn, who went on to become president-elect donald trump's mentor, per the boston globe. With that in mind, the meeropols say obama's \" presidential proclamation \" ( a pardon implies guilt, they say ) may be their last hope to exonerate their mother in what would be \" the first time that the united states has admitted that the federal government has wrongly executed one of its citizens, \" per the telegraph. The brothers plan to deliver a letter and case documents to the white house on thursday, but they're not alone in this fight, per the springfield republican. They're backed by the boston globe editorial board, michael moore, noam chomsky, and more than 40,000 others who've signed a petition. ( click for more on the case. )",

Mr. Boehner is holding the line against any increase in tax rates, even for the richest americans that currently are in the 35 percent tax bracket.

Walmart had been hostess's biggest customer, accounting for 40 percent of the baker's production of ho hos, suzy-qs, fruit pies and sno-balls, among other sugary snack cakes. If walmart wins the bankruptcy court auction for the twinkies brand — or any other hostess asset — it could mean that the snack foods would be available in the us only in the 4,479 walmart and sam's club stores. Walmart over the years has acquired numerous defunct labels, such as white cloud toilet paper, which it snatched up after procter &amp; gamble failed to renew its trademark. Walmart declined comment. Hostess, liquidating after management and unions failed to reach a labor deal with its bakers union, has received interest from about two dozen bidders in the first round of a bankruptcy auction, according to bloomberg news"

Well i was wrong, and i am sorry. \" \"i learned given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country, it is not ok for that to be part of any costume, halloween or otherwise. \" she continued: i have never been a p.c. Kind of person, but i do understand the value in being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity, \" she said. What did megyn kelly say about blackface? during a roundtable discussion about offensive halloween costumes on tuesday's megyn kelly today, she said: \"you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for halloween.

As such, the government today announced it's lowering the recommended level of fluoride in water for the first time in more than 50 years. Fluoridation began to take hold following the government's 1962 recommendation that it be added to drinking water, reports cnbc. Today's adjustment brings the official recommendation to the bottom of its previous spectrum: from 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter down to a flat 0.7 milligrams. Cnbc explains the previous range was due to variations in water consumption decades ago and gives the example of southern kids drinking more than their peers during hot, unairconditioned summers. Too much fluoride has become a common cause of splotches on teeth, a cosmetic condition called fluorosis. The ap reports one study found about 2 out of 5 adolescents have tooth streaking or spottiness from too much fluoride. The cdc notes that \" drinking water with the right amount of fluoride keeps the tooth surface strong and solid and prevents about 25 % of cavities during a person's lifetime. \" according to its 2012 stats, 67.1 % of americans receive fluoridated water.",

        "summary": "A skull thought to be that of nat turner, the controversial rebel leader whose slave revolt in virginia in 1831 left about 60 white people dead, including women and children, will finally be presented to turner's descendants friday. Former gary, ind., mayor richard hatcher was given the skull by a local civil rights activist in 2002, when hatcher was looking to build a national civil rights museum in the city. Hatcher says he's been trying to locate turner's descendants ever since he got the skull, and was only recently able to find them, the chicago tribune reports. He ' ll present the skull to two of them during a private national civil rights hall of fame luncheon in gary. Turner was hanged and decapitated after the revolt, and it's not clear what happened to his remains. There was a rumor, however, that turner's skull had made its way to a university lab in chicago at some point. The skull being given to turner's family was originally presented to army capt. Albert franklin at the turn of the 20th century from a virginia woman who said her father, a doctor, tended to turner after his death. Franklin's family passed the skull down for more than three generations before franklin gave it to rev. Franklin breckenridge in 2002 and breckenridge gave it to hatcher. Franklin acknowledges there's no proof the skull is really turner's, just \" this story that was passed down in the family. \" a county clerk from the county where turner launched his insurrection hopes the descendants receiving the skull will have it tested to confirm it is turner's. He also believes it should be returned to the county where turner lived and died, the baltimore sun reports.",

Morsi's spokesperson yesterday said the president's new legal immunity would be limited only to \" sovereign \" issues — which is what the judicial organizations wanted — but judges say the dispute between the judicial and executive branches continues, egypt independent reports. One political analyst says morsi's move was intended to look good to the public, \" but, in reality, his declaration has not changed, \" the los angeles times reports. Meanwhile, hundreds of opponents of morsi thronged in tahrir square today, and their numbers were expected to increase by the afternoon, reuters reports. Police fired tear gas into the crowd and demonstrators occasionally clashed with them in the streets; hundreds have been injured so far, and one muslim brotherhood activist killed. Experts say that even if morsi's immunity is limited to sovereign matters, there is room for a broad interpretation of that; human rights watch said his initial power grab gave him more control than the military junta that ruled before him.",

Women, on the other hand, were not happy in general if they viewed their marriage as an unhappy one, reports the telegraph. \" i think it comes down to the fact that when a wife is satisfied with the marriage, she tends to do a lot more for her husband, which has a positive effect on his life, \" says deborah carr of rutgers. \" men tend to be less vocal about their relationships, \" she adds, so whether he's happy or unhappy in the relationship doesn't have as much of an effect as his wife's attitude. In the study published in the journal of of marriage and family, the researchers also took note of this quirk related to illness: when a husband gets sick, the wife's level of happiness drops, but when a wife gets sick, the husband is no less happy. Reason? \"we know that when a partner is sick it is the wife that often does the caregiving, which can be a stressful experience, \" says carr. \"but often when a women gets sick it is not her husband she relies on, but her daughter. \" ( another study found the cost of your wedding and engagement rings can predict divorce. )",

They began investigating the facility after the observatory's wifi was used to send and receive child porn and a worker at the facility found a laptop with \" not good \" images on it, ktsm reports. Court documents state that after the facility's chief observer told agents that the only person who could access the observatory during the hours that the child porn was downloaded was a janitor, the fbi seized a laptop. The documents state that when he discovered that the laptop was gone, the janitor \" feverishly \" searched the facility for it and warned the observer that somebody had been breaking in to steal internet service. The journal reports that the fbi closed the observatory for security reasons after the janitor warned the observer that a serial killer might \" enter the facility and execute someone. \" the observatory reopened monday after association of universities for research in astronomy announced there was no longer a threat to staff.",

Correction: this story has been updated to reflect that the nsf, nso and aura decided to evacuate the observatory without advisement or assistance from the fbi. Mystery solved. Authorities say it wasn't aliens, but a janitor's unsavory tastes that ultimately led to the closure of an observatory in southern new mexico. Advertisementskip the sunspot observatory was evacuated when that same janitor made veiled threats against the facility after federal agents seized a laptop he used to access child pornography. The closure on sept. 6 sparked international attention since authorities refused to release any details, while news outlets and conspiracy theorists filled in the blanks with rumors of geomagnetic storms, alien sightings and apocalyptic asteroids.

        "summary": "With tax time fast approaching, there's a new hoop to jump through: those without health insurance may be facing obamacare penalties for 2014 — and for 2015 if they don't nail down coverage by feb. 15, npr reports. Those who were uninsured in 2014 may face a tax penalty of either 1 % of income or a flat fee of $ 95 per adult, $ 47.50 per child under the age of 18 ( whichever fee is higher ). And anyone who misses the end of the affordable care act's open enrollment on feb. 15 will be ponying up even greater penalties for 2015: the higher of either 2 % of income or $ 325 per adult, $ 162.50 for kids under 18. Beyond that, the 2016 penalty will be assessed at 2.5 % of income or $ 695 per person, adjusting every year after that for inflation. Because many people don't think about taxes until the w-2s start trickling in ( often at the end of january ), there won't be a lot of time for them to consider buying health insurance, npr notes. And they may still choose not to: about 11 % of the uninsured who opt out simply can't afford it, while 27 % say it's less expensive to pay the tax penalty than to purchase health insurance, cbs news reports. Tax preparers aren't looking forward to telling the uninsured they're going to have to pay the irs a little extra, but they're trying to educate consumers about eligibility for regular fee exemptions or hardship exemptions, such as being homeless, having lots of medical debt, or experiencing the death of a loved one.

        "summary": "Three young women, two young men, and a mom who'd taken her daughter to a rap concert at a nightclub in corinaldo, italy, have died, and dozens more have been injured, after a moment of panic that led to a stampede saturday. Police rep col. Cristian corrazza tells the ap the ages of the deceased teens range from 14 to 16, while the mother who died was 39; he adds that more than a dozen of those injured are said to be in serious condition. The tragedy is being partly blamed on the lanterna azzurra ( \" blue lantern \" ) club being overcrowded — corrazza notes up to 1,000 were reported inside — and also on something akin to pepper spray that may have prompted the panic, per ndtv. \" the cause may have been the dispersal of a stinging substance, the young people fled and trampled over each other, \" the local fire department tweeted. The presence of a sprayed irritant still hasn't been confirmed. The mostly young crowd that had gone to see rapper sfera ebbasta was congregated outside one of the club's exits when a group reportedly started \" surging \" toward a low railing or wall; that barrier then gave way. A video apparently taken of the incident and cited by the new york times shows crowds of people outside the club, then a section of people falling. A radio report notes most of those who died ( cnn has their names ) suffered crushed skulls. Reports on the number of those injured range from 35 to around 60. Italy's interior minister, matteo salvini, lamented the \" six broken lives \" and railed into the person or persons who \" out of nastiness, stupidity, or greed transformed an evening of partying into tragedy, \" per the ap.",

        "summary": "A tesla in autopilot mode created yet more unfortunate headlines for the company when it slammed into a police cruiser in laguna beach, calif., on tuesday. Police say the patrol vehicle was totaled but it was thankfully unoccupied at the time of the crash, ktla reports. A tesla in semi-autonomous mode hit a semi-truck in the exact same area last year, and police say they're looking into whether lane markings or other features in the area are creating difficulties for the technology. \" why do these vehicles keep doing that? we're just lucky that people aren't getting injured, \" a laguna beach police sergeant tells the los angeles times. The tesla driver, a 65-year-old man, suffered minor injuries but refused transportation to the hospital, police say. Tesla stresses that the self-driving technology should only be used when the driver is alert and has both hands on the wheel. \" tesla has always been clear that autopilot doesn't make the car impervious to all accidents, and before a driver can use autopilot, they must accept a dialogue box which states that ' autopilot is designed for use on highways that have a center divider and clear lane markings, ' \" the company said in a statement. In greece, meanwhile, police say an american driver involved in an accident friday night claims his tesla suddenly malfunctioned while in autopilot mode, the ap reports. ( after a fatal autopilot mode crash in march, tesla said the driver's hands were not on the wheel. )",

Al kossow, software curator at the computer history museum in mountain view, california, announced to a public mailing list that the code for the lisa computer has been recovered and will be shared publicly once apple gives approval to do so, which is expected to happen sometime this year, the mercury news reports. 9to5mac points out that while lisa emulators exist, \" this is notable as it's not just a third-party hack solution \" but an apple-involved effort. Kossow adds that \" the only thing i saw that probably won't be able to be released is the american heritage dictionary for the spell checker in lisawrite. \" named after jobs ' eldest daughter, the lisa was one of the earliest computers to use a graphical user interface and mouse. Despite costing $ 150 million to develop and an ad campaign that featured kevin costner, only around 10,000 units were ever sold ( the mercury news points out that in today's dollars, the lisa cost an eye-popping $ 24,700 ). Following the failure, jobs was moved off the project by apple ceo john sculley, likely creating the rift that led to jobs ' 10-plus-year exile from the company starting in 1985. It also caused a second rift, between jobs and bill gates, a story that involves xerox and 100,000 shares of apple; gizmodo details it here.

He wrote that after the review is done, the museum will release a text on the significance of the lisa project and make the code available for all in 2018.

            "Before there was an iphone, imac or macintosh computer, apple had lisa. The lisa computer — which stands for \" \"local integrated software architecture \" but was also named after steve jobs ' eldest daughter — was a flop when it released in 1983, due to its astronomical price point at $ 10,000 — $ 24,700 when adjusted for inflation. But in the grand scheme of apple's history, the lisa computer's software laid the groundwork for what was to be the macos operating system. Some time next year, apple fans will be able to relive the company's early days — back when it was still a cupertino startup led by jobs and steve wozniak — thanks to the mountain view-based computer history museum. The museum's software curator, al kossow, announced in a public mailing list that the source code for the lisa computer has been recovered and",
            "You ' ll soon be able to take a huge trip down memory lane when it comes to apple's computer efforts. The computer history museum has announced that the source code for the lisa, apple's computer that predated the mac, has been recovered and is being reviewed by apple itself … sylvania homekit light strip the announcement was made by al kossow, a software curator at the computer history museum. Kossow says that source code for both the operating system and applications has been recovered. Once that code is finished being reviewed by apple, the computer history museum will make the code available sometime in 2018. While you've been able to run emulators of the lisa operating system before, this is notable as it's not just a third-party hack solution, but rather apple is directly involved and the full code will be available for everyone. Kossow explains:"

Demille award later in the evening — and that has now renewed whispers about the mega-star actually running, per the washington post. Winfrey has said in the past she would \" never run for public office, \" but she's given other hints she's not 100 % against the prospect. The post notes it's \" no longer all that far-fetched to think that someone known primarily for their work on tv and with absolutely no governing experience could not only run for president but also win. \" per the ap, twitter was abuzz after her speech sunday, with comedian sarah silverman tweeting: \" oprah/michelle 2020. \" winfrey's longtime beau and her best friend also weighed in. \" i thought that speech was incredible. I got goosebumps, \" bff gayle king told the los angeles times, and stedman graham, who's been with winfrey for decades, added: \" it's up to the people. She would absolutely do it. \" one other who thinks she's a winner: her potential rival. \" oprah will end up doing just fine with her network — she knows how to win, \" donald trump tweeted in 2012.",

In a statement posted on twitter, remnick explained that the point of an interview would have been to put pressure on bannon's views, not to give him a platform to espouse \" white nationalism, racism, anti-semitism, and illiberalism. \" in a statement, bannon said he had accepted the invite \" to face one of the most fearless journalists of his generation, \" but found that remnick was \" gutless when confronted by the howling online mob. \"",

All was well until they tried to use the note's gps to retrieve their carefully made package after it returned to solid ground. \" the problem was that the coverage map we were relying on ( looking at you, at&t ) was not accurate, so the phone never got signal as it came back to earth, and we never heard from it, \" one of the friends explains on reddit. Two years later, an at&t employee happened upon the bundle during a hike, about 50 miles from where the friends launched it, and took it to a retail store. At&t was able to identify the note's owner using the phone's sim card. \" we got the footage and data a few weeks later! \" the reddit user exclaims. The footage has since been named \" grand canyon from the stratosphere! a space balloon story, \" and features incredible images of the grand canyon from ground level to 18 miles above the earth.

            "Published on sep 10, 2015 in june 2013, a group of friends launched a high-altitude near space balloon a few miles from tuba city, arizona. The amazing footage of the grand canyon area was lost, then found two years later by an arizona hiker. Enjoy the video of our launch preparations, flight footage, and some data analysis of the flight. Max altitude: 98,664 ft ( 30.1 km ) time of flight: 1 hour, 38 minutes payload: gopro hero3, sony camcorder, samsung galaxy note ii phone. The gopro and camcorder were recording video footage, while the phone was taking still images.

            "It took five friends a couple months of planning to record the perfect gopro shot. It took two years to get the footage back. Members of the group recounted the amazing journey that took a gopro camera from the terrain of tuba city, ariz., to the edge of space and back in posts on youtube and reddit. The june 2013 expedition was designed to capture breathtaking aerial views of the grand canyon and its surrounding area via a gopro, camcorder and galaxy note ii launched on a weather balloon. After reaching a maximum altitude of about 18 miles, during a flight time of slightly more than 90 minutes, the payload fell to the desert floor – where it remained for about two years. The team was using the gps on the smartphone to track the package, but they encountered a problem during the descent. \"the problem was that the coverage map we were relying on ( looking at you, at&t ) was not accurate, so the phone never got signal as it came back to earth, and we never heard from it, \" the user trexarmsss wrote in a reddit post. The phone landed about 50 miles from the original launch point, nestled in an anonymous patch of sand. \"two years later, in a twist of ironic fate, a woman who works at at&t was on a hike one day and spotted our phone in the barren desert, \" trexarmsss wrote. \"she brings it to an at&t store, and they identify my friend's sim card."
