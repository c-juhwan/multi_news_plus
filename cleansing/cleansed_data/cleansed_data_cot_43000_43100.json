        "summary": "Believers in hell — or just those who think about it — may find themselves less satisfied with life on earth, a new study suggests. In the study published in plos one, researchers in british columbia investigated data from 63 countries, both on a national scale and an individual one. They compared those who believe only in heaven with those who believe only in hell. The more a country's population leaned toward the former, the happier that country was, livescience reports, and individuals who believed in heaven said they were more satisfied with life. The data, however, left open the possibility that people who are already unhappy tend to believe in hell, instead of the other way around. So researchers asked 422 people to write about heaven, hell, or what they did the previous day. Afterward, they were surveyed about their emotions. There wasn't much difference between the reported emotions of those who wrote about heaven and those who described their daily activities. But people who wrote about hell — whether they believed in it or not — reported more sadness. It may be that writing about hell simply makes people less happy; it's also possible that nonbelievers feared they could be wrong, a researcher suggests.",

But perhaps most surprising is what he reveals about his mom, pattie mallette, the person with whom he was once so close they may have shared prescription drugs. Over the past two years, he says, their relationship has been \" pretty nonexisting. \" he blames himself: \" i was distant because i was ashamed. I never wanted my mom to be disappointed in me and i knew she was. We spent some time not talking, so it takes time to rebuild that trust. \" he says she's currently living in hawaii, and that things between them are improving. He also discusses his dad — his parents were 17 and 18 when he was born, and his dad, jeremy bieber, sometimes appears to still be 18, like when he tweeted his appreciation of his son's nether regions after they were displayed in a nude paparazzi snap. Though bieber admits jeremy \" was immature \" and briefly walked out of justin's life when he was roughly four, jeremy resurfaced and \" has been in my life since. I was with him on weekends and wednesdays. \" and now, as billboard's chris martins puts it, bieber \" dotes \" on his dad. Bette midler, for example, criticized jeremy's aforementioned tweet, and bieber had something to say about that: \" this britt meddler, i don't even know who that is, honestly. I wanted to immediately say ' who is this lady? ' \" ( bieber's mom was pressured to abort him. )",

Allums joined the women's team in 2008 as a freshman; he came out as as man to his teammates during his sophomore year. Last summer, allums disclosed his gender identity to the team's head coach, mike bozeman, and arranged to officially come out on the team this season.

Foresight isn't what we expect from those creatures of impulse -- and, indeed, when is a baby a practical economic choice for a teen? it also struck me that the teen birth rate isn't the same as the teen pregnancy rate, if you catch my drift ( my drift being...

Allums joined the women's team in 2008 as a freshman; he came out as as man to his teammates during his sophomore year. Last summer, allums disclosed his gender identity to the team's head coach, mike bozeman, and arranged to officially come out on the team this season. Both bozeman and the george washington university have released statements in support of allums, but the support of transgender athletes within the ncaa remains largely untested. The athletic association currently defers to a student's state-issued id in order to determine a player's gender. That's not too much of a problem for a guy like allums, who wants to continue to play on a team consistent with his sex at birth. But the policy could end up posing difficulties for trans men and women athletes who want to play on teams consistent with their outward gender identities. In october, the national center for lesbian rights released a study proposing new model policies for dealing with transgender athletes"

After he was handed a four-year sentence on a drug conviction, tyrel martin marhanka killed himself, the washington post reports. Per the taipei times, a judge had just informed marhanka of his punishment for growing pot and smuggling pot and poppy seeds into taiwan, and when marhanka heard how much time he'd be spending behind bars, things got chaotic. \" four years? \" he was heard saying to his translator, who tried to assure marhanka he could appeal. Marhanka didn't want to hear that, yelled, \" i don't want to live anymore!, \" then plunged two sharp metal objects into the sides of his neck, witnesses say. Court officials say it appears marhanka brought in a pair of scissors by separating the tool into two blades and hiding the pieces inside a magazine to circumvent the building's metal-detecting door, reports afp. The times notes that marhanka severed arteries in his neck, and although court bailiffs tried to stanch the bleeding, it was just too much: marhanka died about a half-hour after being brought to a local hospital. Marhanka \" was cooperative during the investigation and the trial, \" a court statement reads. \" his attitude was mild and he did not show any signs that he would commit suicide. \" in a thursday afternoon press conference, the presiding judge admitted the court had been negligent and that security measures would be boosted, including installing at least one x-ray scanner when the court soon moves into a new building. Court officials note that marhanka had lived in taiwan since his mid-20s and had a taiwanese wife, as well as two elementary-school-age children.

        "summary": "Civilization at the edge of the tibetan plateau fell apart — or at least changed very suddenly — 4,000 years ago, and now, researchers believe they can explain why. In fact, it has to do with climate change, though not the way we currently think of it, science 2.0 notes. Rather than warming, it was global cooling that led to the sudden shift, researchers say in a press release. The changing temperatures prevented locals from growing their key source of food: millet. That either prompted their departure from the area or forced them to change the way they lived, new historian reports. Most of those who lived there left, according to science 2.0, but three centuries later, farmers in the area were growing wheat and barley, which can handle the temperatures. Jade d ' alpoim guedes and her team made their findings by looking at data from a different perspective. Experts had been mystified by the apparent shift from millet to wheat in the area, given that previous research suggested millet would have grown well there at the time. But that conclusion was based on assessing the growing season of millet — rather than the total amount of heat it needs. Guedes ' model \" turned over previous assumptions, \" she says. Now, history seems to be repeating itself: climate change's effects are being felt particularly acutely in the same region, though this time it's warming rather than cooling. That means millet could play a big role in the region's agricultural future, guedes says. ( speaking of cooling, climate change doesn't explain recent harsh winters, researchers say. )",

Philipps got her start on freaks and geeks and went on to gain fame starring in dawson's creek and cougar town. These days, she's a huge instagram star, having close to a million followers, and is well-known for being best friends with michelle williams; she also recently starred in i feel pretty, directed and co-written by her husband, has lucrative partnerships with various brands, and has a memoir coming out. The cut explained the appeal of her instagram feed in a profile last month: \" philipps has used the platform's stories feature to post daily ( sometimes hourly ) conversational videos about her charmed and wacky la lifestyle. She talks directly to her iphone's front-facing camera and begins many of her videos with a conspiratorial ' you guys,'drawing viewers in with the promise of unfiltered realness. Most of the time she's not wearing makeup, not that she needs to wear makeup. She shoots her footage while sitting in her car or lounging on her couch, twirling her hair in her fingers. \" philipps'talk show will \" feature comedic commentary, interviews, and segments that go behind her most popular instagram stories, \" according to entertainment weekly.",

Officials with costa rica's judicial investigation department say a woman's body was found at the back of the airbnb property where 36-year-old carla stefaniak had been staying, nbc new york reports. The half-buried body, covered in plastic bags, was discovered by tracker dogs, authorities say. In her last text to a friend, stefaniak complained that the power was going out and said \" it's pretty sketchy here, \" reports the bbc. She had been visiting the country with her sister-in-law, who flew out a day earlier. Stefaniak never showed up for her flight home wednesday. Marlo caicedo, one of stefaniak's brothers, says all communication from her stopped around 9pm that night, which was extremely unusual because it was \" her birthday and she loves to be on social media. \" he says the owner of the airbnb told investigators a security guard saw her leave in a car at 5am, though her flight wasn't until 1: 30pm. The body has not yet been identified, and caicedo says he is sure his sister is still alive. \" sincerely, i didn't feel bad or scared because i have so much positivity and so much faith that it's not my sister, \" he tells cbs miami. \" we're just waiting for the confirmation that it isn't her from the authorities. \" stefaniak's sister-in-law has started a gofundme fundraiser to raise money for the search.",

Department of agriculture said wednesday it saw \" completely unacceptable \" actions depicted on an animal welfare group's undercover video from a minnesota slaughterhouse that supplies hormel foods. Compassion over killing said the video shot last month at a quality pork processors plant in austin shows workers taking \" inhumane shortcuts that lead to extreme suffering \" to keep the slaughter lines moving. \" if usda is around they could shut us down, \" one worker can be heard saying on the video. Quality pork processors said it has already disciplined two employees shown on the video and will take further actions if necessary. Nate jensen, vice president of human resources and quality services at qpp, said the company was disappointed to see employees who did not appear to follow its policies requiring the humane treatment of animals. The usda said will investigate further if it confirms the video's authenticity. \" the actions depicted in the video under review are completely unacceptable, \" said adam tarr, a spokesman for the federal food safety and inspection service. The plant is one of a few across the country that's testing a relatively new inspection system that involves fewer usda inspectors and quicker processing lines. Erica meier, executive director of the washington-based compassion over killing, blamed the system for the alleged abuses, which she said included pigs",

An undercover video taken at one of the nation's largest pork producers shows pigs being dragged across the floor, beaten with paddles, and sick to the point of immobility. By law, pigs are supposed to be rendered unconscious before being killed, but many are shown writhing in apparent pain while bleeding out, suggesting that they weren't properly stunned. \" that one was definitely alive, \" a worker says.

            "Minneapolis — the u.s. Department of agriculture said wednesday it saw \" completely unacceptable \" actions depicted on an animal welfare group's undercover video from a minnesota slaughterhouse that supplies hormel foods. Compassion over killing said the video shot last month at a quality pork processors plant in austin shows workers taking \" inhumane shortcuts that lead to extreme suffering \" to keep the slaughter lines moving. \" if usda is around they could shut us down, \" one worker can be heard saying on the video. Quality pork processors said it has already disciplined two employees shown on the video and will take further actions if necessary. Nate jensen, vice president of human resources and quality services at qpp, said the company was disappointed to see employees who did not appear to follow its policies requiring the humane treatment of animals. The usda said will investigate further if it confirms the video's authenticity. \" the actions depicted in the video under review are completely unacceptable, \" said adam tarr, a spokesman for the federal food safety and inspection service. The plant is one of a few across the country that's testing a relatively new inspection system that involves fewer usda inspectors and quicker processing lines. Erica meier, executive director of the washington-based compassion over killing, blamed the system for the alleged abuses, which she said included pigs",
            "( screenshot from compassion over killing undercover video ) the pigs are not all right. An undercover video taken at one of the nation's largest pork producers shows pigs being dragged across the floor, beaten with paddles, and sick to the point of immobility. By law, pigs are supposed to be rendered unconscious before being killed, but many are shown writhing in apparent pain while bleeding out, suggesting that they weren't properly stunned. \" that one was definitely alive, \" a worker says. The video also appears to show pigs with pus-filled abscesses being sent down the line. Others are covered in feces. \" if the usda is around, they could shut us down, \" says a worker, wearing a bright yellow apron, standing over the production line.

While visiting a shelter the next day, he learned polk county animal control had euthanized the 3-year-old beagle almost immediately after he was found because of health problems — lefty had sight and hearing issues and turned in circles from a past head injury — and because a phone number associated with the dog's microchip was out of date. Durham, who moved from kentucky to florida in august, hadn't thought to update the information. And though animal control typically keeps animals for four days before putting them up for adoption, a vet determined lefty \" was not a healthy animal \" and should be euthanized, a rep for the polk county sheriff's office tells wtsp. While officials are offering durham a free pet from a shelter, she wants to make sure other pet owners don't have to suffer the same heartbreak as her family.

        "summary": "Boko haram, the islamist extremist group terrorizing nigeria and surrounding countries, is drastically increasing its use of children as suicide bombers, according to a unicef report released tuesday. The los angeles times reports boko haram used four children as suicide bombers in 2014. Last year, they used 44 — 33 of them girls, whose loose dresses make it easier to conceal bombs. These children, some as young as 8, have killed scores of people in populated areas around nigeria, cameroon, and chad. The unicef report, beyond chibok, is named after an incident that happened two years ago in chibok, nigeria, when 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by boko haram, according to the washington post. Most of them are still missing. Since then, 20 % of all boko haram suicide bombers have been children. But unicef spokesperson doune porter says \" suicide bomber \" is a harmful and inaccurate term when it comes to the children used by boko haram. \"they're all very traumatized, \" porter tells the times. \" they have gone through the most awful beatings and rapes. Some of them have been raped by many different people. \" she says the children used as bombers are either forced to do it, brainwashed, or are simply too young to understand the consequences. Girls are captured when boko haram takes over their villages and forced into sexual slavery. Porter says if they refuse to marry their captors, they are forced to become bombers. All told, the war being waged by boko haram has displaced 1.3 million children since 2013. And yet unicef's report finds the world has largely ignored their plight.",

He has built an empire on such moments. It felt too perfect, too scripted, even by the standards of storytelling that white has inspired. The crowd hushed in anticipation of another command performance. White sped down the hill and crested the leading edge of the massive halfpipe and began what was sure to be a monumental run. And that is when it happened — a hard landing here, a gasp-inducing bobble there, the dominance of the world's greatest halfpipe snowboarder slipping away with each diagonal weave downhill. White ended up in fourth, a placing probably higher than he deserved, ceding the olympic throne to someone else for the first time since 2002. \"for me to be remembered in the sport, i don't think tonight makes or breaks my career, \" white said. \"i've been snowboarding for so long, and i love it so much, that i ' m happy to take this for what it is and move on and continue to ride. \" advertisement continue reading the main story it was iouri podladtchikov of switzerland — i-pod to his friends — who won the gold medal by"

Don't abandon us, \" jammo says during one of the calls. He told authorities the boat was taking on water and there were injured children aboard. Italy had a military vessel 20 nautical miles from the sinking ship but didn't send it, instead telling jammo to call malta. Malta told jammo to call italy. The sticking point: the refugee boat was technically in waters overseen by malta but was nearly twice as close to the italian island of lampedusa, the independent reports. And malta didn't have a vessel anywhere near as close as the italian vessel. Italian authorities also appeared hesitant to bring the refugees to italy. Italy eventually did send its vessel — hours after the first call from jammo — but only after a maltese plane confirmed the boat had capsized and there were people in the water. Amnesty international says it's \" reasonable to question \" whether authorities from both countries did everything they could to prevent 268 people from dying.",

With a 6-1 school board vote monday, j.e.b. Stuart elementary of richmond, va., became barack obama elementary school. The name, submitted by students, staff, and community members, made a shortlist as voted by students, 95 % of whom are african-american, reports wtvr. Also monday, two elementary schools in tulsa, okla., were renamed. Columbus elementary, named for famed explorer christopher columbus, became dolores huerta elementary after the famed mexican-american labor leader and civil rights activist. Chouteau elementary, named for fur trader and purported slaveholder jean-pierre chouteau, became wayman tisdale fine arts academy in honor of the local basketball star who became an nba player and jazz musician, reports cnn. Another tulsa school named for robert e. Lee will undergo a name change following a later vote. ( this school already carries obama's name. )",

It's not the first time the eye color-alcohol link has been found: a 2000 study arrived at a similar conclusion, noting that among one sample set of women, dark-eyed females averaged 4.91 drinks in the last month to light-eyed females ' 5.78.

And the crazy part is that the telegram got scooped up by an american soldier as a souvenir — he didn't speak german and apparently didn't recognize its importance — and was nearly lost to history, reports the washington post. In the telegram of april 23, 1945, goering, knowing that hitler is holed up in a bunker and cornered by enemy troops, tells hitler that he will assume command of germany if he doesn't hear back from the fuhrer by that night. Hitler had previously designated goering as his successor if anything happened to him, notes the telegraph. Despite that past agreement, hitler, egged on by others, became convinced that goering was staging a coup. He flew into a rage, accused his aide of treason in a radio message, then settled into an all-consuming depression, says the post account, which cites the autobiography of hitler aide albert speer. Hitler killed himself a week later. The telegram was found in the bunker by us army capt. Benjamin bradin, who brought it home with him to south carolina and stuck it in a safe with other war documents. Years later, his son found it, showed it to his history professor at the citadel, and wrote his senior thesis about it. This week, alexander historical auctions sold it for $ 55,000 to an anonymous north american buyer, reports wire service dw. That's about three times higher than the expected price.

Göring had been in southern germany when he learnt that hitler was in hiding in a bunker in berlin.

According to accounts of those close to hitler, the telegram sent the leader into a rage and contributed to the breakdown of his mental state.

According to accounts of those close to hitler, the telegram sent the leader into a rage and contributed to the breakdown of his mental state. In hitler's testament, written on april 29, 1945, göring was formally dismissed of all authority and was spared death due to his long years of service if he would immediately resign all of his offices. Before dawn on april 25, göring was imprisoned. Hitler and his partner",
            "Hermann goering's april 24, 1945, telegram to adolf hitler, marked \"geheim!, \" or \"secret! \" ( courtesy of alexander historical auctions ) it is one of the most crucial documents from the most pivotal moment in the most terrible war. A treasonous telegram from no. 2 nazi hermann goering to none other than the führer himself. A message that, along with the advancing allied troops, helped drive adolf hitler to swallow cyanide and shoot himself inside his underground berlin bunker. Despite its influence on world war ii, however, the memorandum ended up inside a south carolina safe, nearly forgotten for more than a decade until a college student made it his senior thesis. On tuesday, the itinerant but now infamous telegram sold at auction for $ 55,000. Not bad for a scrap of paper plucked at random in the pitch dark. This is the story of how a nazi note changed the course of history, only to slip through the cracks thanks to an american soldier's ignorance of german. An undated picture shows nazi chancellor adolf hitler followed by commander-in-chief hermann goering, second left, and head of the ss heinrich himmler, third left, marching in berlin next to the hotel excelsior which was hitler's base in the city in the early 1930s.

        "summary": "Police in england are hoping cutting-edge technology can help deter crime in the country's most pastoral regions. The westmorland gazette reports that police in cumbria in england's lake district have kicked off a 12-month pilot program with local farmers and forensic marking company selectadna to help prevent sheep theft. Selectadna's system involves applying a liquid solution with a unique dna code to the sheep. The solution can't be detected by the naked eye, but police can use an ultraviolet light to cross-check it with a database to determine if a sheep has been stolen, modern farmer reports. On each participating farm, up to 100 sheep can be tagged with the selectadna solution. Signs announcing participation in the program will be placed around each farm as an additional deterrent. Officials also hope the solution will help trace and retrieve sheep if they do get stolen. Livestock rustling has become a big problem in england. In 2014, more than 88,000 farm animals were stolen in the uk, at a cost of about $ 8.6 million. The selectadna tracing technology is more than a decade old, but this is the first time it's being tested on livestock. The company claims a similar pilot program marking and tracking property in manchester resulted in a 83 % reduction in burglaries, per modern farmer.",

Sen. Susan collins made the comments on cbs ' face the nation. She called the republican national committee's decision to support moore in the alabama race \" a mistake. \" collins said she thought moore was a poor choice for senate because of his views on muslims and gays even before she learned of the misconduct allegations. She also said she's troubled that moore has been removed from the alabama supreme court twice for failure to \" follow lawful judicial orders, \" the ap reports. Moore is accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago, when he was a county prosecutor in his 30s. He has largely denied the allegations. Moore faces democrat doug jones in a special election on tuesday. The election could have major implications for the balance of power in the senate, where republicans have a slight edge. Alabama's christian conservatives see moore as their champion. He has fought federal judges and castigated liberals, big government, gun control, muslims, homosexuality, and anything else that doesn't fit the evangelical mold. Moore was dumped from his state's supreme court for ignoring a federal court order to remove a ten commandments monument from the state's judicial building and for opposing gay marriage after the us supreme court effectively legalized it.",

We find that job insecurity increases the odds of reporting poor health by about 50 %, high job demands raise the odds of having a physician-diagnosed illness by 35 %, and long work hours increase mortality by almost 20 %. Therefore, policies designed to reduce health costs and improve health outcomes should account for the health effects of the workplace environment.

Neglecting stress levels, however, caused both by work and personal lives, can have just as poor an effect on health as secondhand smoke, not exercising or eating poorly. \" wellness programs are great at doing what they're designed to do, \" joel goh, an assistant professor at harvard business school, told the boston globe. \" but they're targeting [ employee behavior ], not targeting the cause of stress.

That was one of the factors in its decision that the monument's home on bloomfield city property is unconstitutional, the farmington daily times reports. The us court of appeals for the 10th circuit ruled wednesday that the monument — described by the aba journal as a 5-foot-tall, 3,400-pound structure erected in 2011 on the city hall's lawn — \" would give an objective observer the impression of official religious endorsement, \" given that it's right next to the city's main government building. Per the durango herald, the case came out of a 2012 lawsuit brought by the aclu on behalf of two local wiccan followers who said they were offended by the structure. But jonathan scruggs, an attorney with the advocacy group alliance defending freedom, which is working with the city, points out that monuments honoring other \" significant documents in american history \" are also nestled close by — one for the gettysburg address, as well as one for the bill of rights. \" the city is not playing favorites here, \" he says. \" it's allowing anyone to erect a monument on the lawn as long as it's historical. \" the court disagreed, citing the \" impermissible taint of endorsement. \" ( a texas county agreed to remove crosses from cop cars. )",

After hitting the crossbar, rayon's moussa camara can be seen in video footage dashing to one of the goalposts and grabbing an object — one that had been placed there by the goalie as a bit of \" juju \" to help him protect the net. The goalkeeper then chases him before both receive yellow cards, notes fox sports. The even weirder part: after the disruption, camara scored his team's tying goal in the match, which ended 1-1. Under the new rules, players and coaches found to be using witchcraft to try to gain an advantage face fines and penalties, reports the rwanda new times. The washington post notes that \" juju \" has long played a role in african soccer. In fact, the confederation of african football previously banned witchcraft after rwanda's national team was accused of burying a doll behind its net in a 2003 match against uganda. But a soccer official in the country says the traditional practice gives the nation a bad image. Hence, the new penalties. \"since there is no scientific way to prove the use of witchcraft, these measures will be based upon reports from match officials and anything that is deemed to incite witchcraft will be put under consideration, \" he says.

Fliers en route to calgary via the toronto and hamilton airports were asked to scan their boarding passes before they got on the plane, fast company reports. That prompted the appearance of an onscreen santa claus, who knew their name and asked what they wanted for christmas. The 250 passengers were taped by hidden cameras. Once the requests were in, airline employees had roughly four hours to get the items before the planes landed in calgary, reports fox news. Some 175 workers for the canada-based company hurried to stores to get everything from a snowboard to a big-screen tv to ( one guy's possibly regrettable request for ) socks and underwear. Upon arriving, passengers couldn't believe their eyes. The whole thing was captured on a pretty heartwarming video. And even if there's a pr-stunt aspect to it, it's one that keeps on giving. Westjet said that when the video got 200,000 views, it would donate flights to families via ronald mcdonald house charities; it's already been seen more than 7 million times.",

        "summary": "Iraq may be crippled by mismanagement and violence, but it does have one huge bright spot these days — oil. Iraq's crude oil production is up 20 % this year to the tune of 2.5 million barrels a day, reports the new york times. Oil provides 95 % of government revenues in iraq, and is scheduled to climb another 400,000 barrels per day next year. In fact, the iraq government wants it to reach 10 million barrels per day by 2017, although most experts think such a saudi arabia-esque level is unrealistic. \"nobody has yet managed to increase oil production in their country to the extent iraq is planning to, \" says the president of bp iraq. \" it's hugely ambitious, and it will take a lot of things to work correctly. \" iraq's soaring production, combined with increased production in saudi arabia and the recovery of libya's oil production, helped bring oil down to $ 98.43 per barrel last week, the lowest level since january 2011. In fact, with opec now exceeding its 30-million-barrels per day quota by 5 %, iran is calling on the cartel to cut back production, reports business week. But with sanctions on iran growing ever tougher, the world will need iraq's increased production to make up for lower iran sales, which are already down 12 % this year.",

            "Iraq and iran said they will take a common position on opec's production policy when the organization of petroleum exporting countries meets this month. The neighbors agreed \"to coordinate the two countries'stance at opec, \" asim jihad, a spokesman for iraq's oil ministry, said today by telephone from baghdad, without elaborating. Opec ministers plan to meet to assess markets and the group's output ceiling on june 14 in vienna. Iran and iraq will adopt a unified position on opec's production, and they emphasized the need for its 12 members to pump crude in line with their collective target, iran's state- run press tv reported, citing a meeting in baghdad yesterday between iranian oil minister rostam qasemi and iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki. Iran will insist that opec maintain its current ceiling for crude when the ministers gather, press tv said in a separate report yesterday, citing qasemi. Iran and iraq are opec's second- and third-biggest producers, respectively, after saudi arabia, which has boosted supplies as u.s. And european sanctions against iran curb the islamic republic's exports. Opec produced 31.62 million barrels a day in april, 5 percent more than its 30 million barrel-a-day ceiling, according to monthly estimates from the group's secretariat. Iraq holds the organization's presidency this year",
            "Oil has also brought its share of pitfalls for the fledgling democracy, fostering corruption and patronage, and aggravating tensions with the kurdish minority in the north over the division of profits, a festering issue that could end up fracturing the country. The iraqi government says it can add an additional 400,000 barrels a day of production by next year, and it has announced a goal of producing 10 million barrels a day by 2017, which would put it in a league with saudi arabia. Few independent analysts say they believe the larger goal is realistic, but oil company executives have been impressed by iraq's progress and ambition. \"what the government is embarking on and the increase in production they are looking for under all of these contracts is unique in the world, \" said michael townshend, president of bp iraq. But, he cautioned, \"nobody has yet managed to increase oil production in their country to the extent iraq is planning to. It's hugely ambitious, and it will take a lot of things to work correctly. \" the country's improving oil fortunes are well timed to compensate for iran's declining oil output, which according to opec fell by 12 percent in the first three months of the year as india, china and other asian nations have gradually cut purchases under pressure from the united states"

            "Iraq and iran said they will take a common position on opec's production policy when the organization of petroleum exporting countries meets this month. The neighbors agreed \"to coordinate the two countries'stance at opec, \" asim jihad, a spokesman for iraq's oil ministry, said today by telephone from baghdad, without elaborating. Opec ministers plan to meet to assess markets and the group's output ceiling on june 14 in vienna. Iran and iraq will adopt a unified position on opec's production, and they emphasized the need for its 12 members to pump crude in line with their collective target, iran's state- run press tv reported, citing a meeting in baghdad yesterday between iranian oil minister rostam qasemi and iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki. Iran will insist that opec maintain its current ceiling for crude when the ministers gather, press tv said in a separate report yesterday, citing qasemi. Iran and iraq are opec's second- and third-biggest producers, respectively, after saudi arabia, which has boosted supplies as u.s. And european sanctions against iran curb the islamic republic's exports. Opec produced 31.62 million barrels a day in april, 5 percent more than its 30 million barrel-a-day ceiling, according to monthly estimates from the group's secretariat. Iraq holds the organization's presidency this year",
            "Oil has also brought its share of pitfalls for the fledgling democracy, fostering corruption and patronage, and aggravating tensions with the kurdish minority in the north over the division of profits, a festering issue that could end up fracturing the country. The iraqi government says it can add an additional 400,000 barrels a day of production by next year, and it has announced a goal of producing 10 million barrels a day by 2017, which would put it in a league with saudi arabia. Few independent analysts say they believe the larger goal is realistic, but oil company executives have been impressed by iraq's progress and ambition. \"what the government is embarking on and the increase in production they are looking for under all of these contracts is unique in the world, \" said michael townshend, president of bp iraq. But, he cautioned, \"nobody has yet managed to increase oil production in their country to the extent iraq is planning to. It's hugely ambitious, and it will take a lot of things to work correctly. \" the country's improving oil fortunes are well timed to compensate for iran's declining oil output, which according to opec fell by 12 percent in the first three months of the year as india, china and other asian nations have gradually cut purchases under pressure from the united states"

The interim government has just revived two policies emblematic of the widely hated pre-morsi regime: a law that allows soldiers to arrest civilians, and the resurrection of the country's secret police unit, reports the wall street journal. \" it's a return to the mubarak era, \" says an egyptian human rights activist, per the guardian. \" these units committed the most atrocious human rights violations. Incommunicado detentions, killings outside the law.... It's an ugly authority that has never been brought to justice. \" the feared state security service, mabahith amn ad-dawla, was supposedly closed in 2011 and replaced by the national security service. But following a government crackdown on protesters on the weekend which left dozens of pro-morsi supporters dead, the government announced its return, the guardian reports. However, some say these secret police never really went away — the current civil unrest just allows leaders to give their image a makeover. \" the only thing that happened was that they changed the name, \" says an egyptian security researcher. \" [ the interior minister is ] trying to use a situation where the factors on the ground make it easier to re-legitimize these units and police practices. \" meanwhile, deposed president mohamed morsi met in secret with an eu envoy last night.",

            "Egypt's interim government was accused of attempting to return the country to the mubarak era on monday, after the country's interior ministry announced the resurrection of several controversial police units that were nominally shut down following the country's 2011 uprising and the interim prime minister was given the power to place the country in a state of emergency. Egypt's state security investigations service, mabahith amn ad-dawla, a wing of the police force under president mubarak, and a symbol of police oppression, was supposedly closed in march 2011 – along with several units within it that investigated islamist groups and opposition activists. The new national security service ( nss ) was established in its place. But following saturday's massacre of at least 83 islamists, interior minister mohamed ibrahim announced the reinstatement of the units, and referred to the nss by its old name. He added that experienced police officers sidelined in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution would be brought back into the fold. Police brutality also went unchecked under morsi, who regularly failed to condemn police abuses committed during his presidency. But ibrahim's move suggests he is using the ousting of morsi – and a corresponding upsurge in support for egypt's police – as a smokescreen for the re-introduction of pre-2011 practices.

Ayan, who built his own home computer lab as well as his first computer network in that lab, hopes to start his own company and even launch a uk-based it hub modeled after silicon valley that he would call e-valley, reports the bbc. As for the test itself, administrators initially blocked him because of his age, notes the coventry telegraph; they relented after a call to microsoft headquarters. Ayan, now 6, says it was hard but fun: \" there were multiple choice questions, drag and drop questions, hotspot questions, and scenario-based questions, \" he told the bbc asian network. Ayan's father, an it consultant who moved his family to the uk from pakistan in 2009, says he let ayan play with his old computers as a 3-year-old so he could learn about motherboards and hard drives. When his son remembered everything he told him from one day to the next, his father kept teaching him more. \" too much computing at this age can cause a negative effect, but in ayan's case he has cached this opportunity, \" he says. Ayan devotes two hours a day to learning about operating systems and installing programs. Ayan's mother is proud of her son but doesn't want him setting too many world records. \" i want him to do his best whatever he does in his life, \" she says.

The board says that ride the ducks international issued a warning about potential axle failure in 2013, but the 70-year-old amphibious army surplus craft involved in the crash did not have the recommended repair, the ap reports. Witnesses say the vehicle's front-left tire appeared to seize up before it slammed into a tour bus, and an ntsb spokesman says that axle was \" sheared off \" in the crash, the seattle times reports. It isn't clear whether the seattle ride the ducks business, which has kept its remaining vehicles idle since the crash, received the warning about the axle problem, the times notes. The full ntsb investigation, which is the first involving a ducks crash on land, is expected to take a year. Komo news reports that a 20-year-old woman injured in the crash has died, bringing the death toll to five. Like the other victims, she was part of a group of international students from north seattle college who were on the tour bus. Komo reports that the other fatalities have been identified as a 37-year-old japanese woman, a 17-year-old woman from china, an 18-year-old indonesian man, and a 49-year-old woman from austria.",

As the eu moves ahead with the official paperwork to complete the sanctions process, details are emerging about specific goals: more russian organizations, for instance, will be kept from fundraising in the eu, including three state-owned oil companies and three military production companies, and at least five state-controlled banks will have their fundraising allowances curtailed even further, reports the wall street journal. Eu officials say the sanctions could be removed if \" there is evidence moscow is helping forge a genuine political solution. \" although the ceasefire is still technically in place, local officials say one civilian died and four were wounded over the weekend in the coastal city of mariupol, reports reuters; the rebels are claiming several of their own casualties, adds bloomberg.

Instead, tarrant county prosecutor allenna bangs tells the houston chronicle, the 45-year-old will serve a 50-year sentence in a texas state prison, where his gang affiliation will be enough to have him kept in solitary, unable to conduct the white supremacist gang's business in a prison yard. In federal prison, such gang involvement doesn't justify solitary. \" he will be in a box for 23 hours a day, \" bangs tells the chronicle. \" that will be 50 very hard years. \" she says it was tough to secure a conviction against byrd since most witnesses — including a man he stabbed 37 times in the face — were too terrified to testify against him. He was eventually convicted of directing gang activities. Prosecutors say byrd's brutality helped him rise through the gang's ranks in prison and he was just as savage during five months of freedom he had beginning in late 2013, when he worked as a gang enforcer among ex-cons. In an attack that landed him back in prison, prosecutors say byrd stabbed a fellow gang member, soaked a slice of white bread in his blood, and then ate half. The bleeding gang member was then ordered to eat the other half. \" this guy was like an episode of sons of anarchy, \" tarrant county prosecutor joshua ross tells the fort worth star-telegram. \" he was a true believer.

        "summary": "Not surprisingly, richard mourdock and the republican party are experiencing quite a bit of fallout from the indiana senate candidate's comments last night at a debate, in which he said \" god intended \" pregnancies from rape to happen. The latest: the democratic national committee was quick to jump all over mitt romney, who just released a tv ad endorsing mourdock this week. In a new dnc video, that ad is spliced together with mourdock's comments, politico reports. The dnc claims mourdock is the only senate candidate romney has endorsed. A spokesperson for president obama's campaign said today that the president \" felt those comments were outrageous and demeaning to women. \" she also called it \" perplexing \" that romney had not demanded his ad for mourdock be taken off tv, the new york times reports. But senior romney adviser bay buchanan did go on msnbc today to distance the gop nominee from mourdock's comments, politico reports. \" the governor's position on this is long-standing. He's against abortion except in cases of rape or incest, and of course, the life of the mother, \" she said. \" he disagrees entirely with what the senate candidate said. \" sen. John cornyn, head of the national republican senatorial committee, is in mourdock's corner, saying in a statement today that even mourdock's democratic opponent believes \" life is a gift from god, \" and that that was all mourdock was trying to say, politico adds. The nrsc may be standing behind mourdock, but the republican party is split — rep. Mike pence, and sens. Scott brown and kelly ayotte have denounced mourdock's statement. Mourdock walked back his comments almost immediately, but has since issued a longer apology, fox news reports. \" if because of the lack of clarity in my words [ people ] came away with an impression other than those that i stated a moment ago — that life is precious and that i abhor violence and i am confident god abhors violence and rape — if they came away with any impression other than that, i truly regret it and i apologize, \" he said.",

Researchers also found that people who drink heavily in their 50s and 60s tend to suffer strokes earlier in life than light drinkers or non-imbibers. \" our study showed that drinking more than two drinks per day can shorten time to stroke by about five years, \" said lead author pavla kadlecova, a statistician at st.

Covariates were baseline age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, stress reactivity, depression, body mass index, smoking, and exercise.

In fact, sipping beyond a two-drink maximum each day may boost a middle-aged person's stroke risk more than even traditional health dangers like high blood pressure and diabetes, say researchers who base their findings on tracking more than 11,000 swedish twins for roughly half their lives. \" we are seeing more and more people who are having strokes at younger ages and we don't necessarily appreciate how much alcohol use may be contributing to that, \" said dr.

Trump said he plans to make up his mind on a supreme court nominee by noon monday, hours ahead of a televised announcement scheduled for 9pm eastern. He said all four judges on his shortlist to replace retiring justice anthony kennedy were \" excellent. \" \" you can't go wrong, \" trump said. Sources tell the wall street journal that trump's golfing buddies over the weekend included sean hannity, who favors socially conservative contender amy coney barrett, a choice that mitch mcconnell has warned against. Sources tell the new york times that trump appears to have lost interest in one candidate, raymond kethledge, after finding him to be \" likable but comparatively dull. \" another contender is brett kavanaugh, a former kennedy clerk and former staff secretary to george w. Bush, though insiders say trump is put off by the bush connection and by the fact that conservatives fear kavanaugh is too liberal on issues like abortion. That leaves thomas hardiman, who has served with trump's sister, maryanne trump barry, on a federal appeals court. Former sen. Rick santorum tells the washington post that his friend hardiman, who speaks spanish and drove a taxi while putting himself through law school, \" knows how to engage with all kind of people, not just republicans. \" trump tweeted sunday: \" an exceptional person will be chosen! \"",

Archaeologists digging in peru found a piece of cotton fabric dyed with indigo that is 6,200 years old, according to a press release. That's 1,500 years older than the previous oldest discovered use of indigo from egypt. And live science reports the peru textile predates even the oldest known reference to indigo dye in the middle east by 1,200 years. \" some of the world's most significant technological achievements were developed first in the new world, \" professor jeffrey splitstoser says in the press release. \" we may well not have had blue jeans if it weren't for the ancient south americans. \" the indigo-dyed textile is made of what is now known as egyptian cotton. It was found during a 2009 dig at a site in peru called huaca prieta. According to a paper published wednesday in science advances, it was intact thanks to \" unusual circumstances of preservation \" at the site. The fabric was embedded in a concrete-like substance used to build what researchers believe was a temple. Indigo is a notoriously difficult dye to make, as it requires the leaves of various plants to be fermented, then aerated, and then doused with an alkaline substance — usually urine in ancient times.

        "summary": "A michigan farmer had to take a short break from installing a drainage pipe in his wheat fields monday when his backhoe hit the pelvis of a prehistoric mammoth, abc news reports. \" we didn't know what it was, but we knew it was certainly a lot bigger than a cow bone, \" james bristle says in a university of michigan press release. Bristle contacted daniel fisher, the director of the college's museum of paleontology, who realized the bones — including a huge skull and tusks — came from a rare hybrid of a woolly mammoth and columbian mammoth, abc reports. Fisher believes the animal was killed by hunters 11,700 to 15,000 years ago. Abc reports bristle gave fisher and his team one day to dig up the bones; he did have a busy harvest season to get back to after all. They found 20 % of the creature's bones, one of the most complete mammoth skeletons ever found in michigan. Fisher believes hunters likely killed the mammoth then stashed its meat in a pond to retrieve later, according to the press release. If further study proves that's true, it could show humans were in the americas earlier than previously thought. After a long day of digging thursday, bristle finally decided he'd done the right thing trading farming for science for a few hours. \" when my 5-year-old grandson came over and saw the pelvis, he just stood there with his jaw wide open, \" bristle says in the press release. \" he was in awe. \"",

First the us claimed it wasn't sure it had struck the hospital, followed by a statement sunday that the bombing — which killed at least 22, per the ap — was accidental. On monday campbell said it was the afghans who requested the airstrike, while in tuesday's testimony, he said the pilots of the us ac-130 gunship didn't have direct communication with afghan forces, but with us special forces on the ground who called in the strike — an admission that has msf fuming. \" statements from the afghanistan government have claimed that taliban forces were using the hospital to fire on coalition forces, \" msf president joanne liu said tuesday, a claim msf denies. \" these statements imply that afghan and us forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital, which amounts to an admission of a war crime. \" doctors without borders says it wants an impartial probe — i.e., not by the us, afghanistan, or nato, the guardian notes.

Still, merlino's guilty plea was a big step: it was the first time he admitted wrongdoing in court, per the south florida sun sentinel. Arrested in a 2016 crackdown on an east coast syndicate accused of extortion, loan-sharking, illegal gambling, and fraud, merlino first took his case to trial, but jurors were deadlocked. Though the ultimate sentence wasn't the one merlino's attorney wanted — he requested half of any sentence be served on house arrest — it was a lighter one than merlino could've expected if convicted at trial, especially given what prosecutors had to say. \" the experience of standing trial twice for murder did not sufficiently discourage him from engaging in illegal activity, \" they noted, describing a steady unconcern for the law.

        "summary": "Two michigan youngsters are lucky they weren't shot at or killed in a car wreck after the older child, a 13-year-old boy, allegedly led police on a high-speed chase saturday night, the detroit free press reports. The macomb county sheriff's dispatch center started taking in reports of a nissan altima driving in an erratic manner in clinton township, and a sheriff's deputy came across the car stopped at a traffic light. In the pursuing deputy's dashcam video released monday by the macomb county sheriff's office, the police car can be seen trailing the altima for a short time before the deputy pulls the altima over — only for the altima to speed away while the officer is getting ready to approach the vehicle. The deputy, who had no clue how old the driver really was, chases the speeding altima for a time through traffic, until the teen driver loses control, swerves across the road, and comes to a stop in a lane of oncoming traffic on the other side of the parkway. Both the driver and a passenger dash from the car, and the deputy informs the dispatcher, \" they're both getting out and running \" and starts driving behind them in pursuit. That's when he makes a startling discovery. \" it's a little kid, \" he tells the dispatcher. Both children — the driver and his 8-year-old sister — were nabbed, uninjured. \" the deputy that was pursuing them did not expect to see a 13-year-old and an 8-year-old get out of a car and run away from the police, \" the sheriff tells cbs detroit. Investigators determined the kids had waited for their dad to doze off, then took his girlfriend's car for a joyride, the station notes. The 13-year-old was charged with unlawful driving away, fleeing and eluding, and resisting and obstructing police and will appear at a juvenile detention hearing monday, per the free press; his little sister was released to her mom, per cbs. ( the actor who played a young anakin skywalker was once arrested for leading cops on a high-speed chase. )",

Now a startup called my.flow is hoping to help women avoid the embarrassment and cost of over-saturated tampons by introducing a smart one whose 6- to 12-inch string communicates to a wearable device attached to one's waist, reports the guardian. The tampon saturation monitor is expected to cost $ 49 when it hits the market next year, with a month's supply of special tampons setting ladies back $ 13. The idea is that the bluetooth device would send a notification to the wearer when it's time to replace a tampon. The daily dot says it seems \" woefully complicated \" to set up and wonders whether it feeds in to the idea of \" menstruation shaming \" — \" don't talk about your period; don't let anyone know you have it... \" however, the women gizmodo interviewed said that even in spite of the drawbacks, such as a long string and yet another gadget to clip on, the device sounds useful, especially for newly menstruating girls. \" i wouldn't want it now, but this would have been amazing when i was 13, \" one woman said. The guardian, meanwhile, warns that the ultimate goal of being discreet isn't realized: \" you're walking around with a period monitor on your waist trying to make sure nobody knows you have your period. \" ( the device may have helped this woman sort out it was time to remove her tampon. )",

South korea's military is at its highest alert level and seoul has promised a \" stern response \" to any more attacks from the north, the guardian reports. This is the biggest flare-up between the koreas in years, and while events, including dire threats from the north, have so far followed a familiar pattern, seoul is now operating under new rules of engagement that allow a more forceful response to attacks from pyongyang, the wall street journal reports. \" both sides are playing with fire in this crisis, \" a north korea expert at the asan institute for policy studies tells the journal. An analyst at ihs country risk tells cnn that yesterday's events were unusual because they involved artillery instead of the small arms usually involved in cross-dmz confrontations on land. ( earlier this month, reports surfaced that kim jong un executed the country's vice premier because of a disagreement on forestry policy. )",

            "Brookline, n.h. ( ap ) — after waiting 11 years to marry her groom, a flat tire wasn't going to stop a determined new hampshire bride from walking down the aisle on her special day. With her limo rendered inoperable along an infrequently traveled road in brookline, angelique arsenault stuck out her thumb and hitchhiked to the wedding venue in nearby milford on saturday. Arsenault says her bridal party just laughed after receiving word of the flat tire from their driver. With confidence fueled by champagne, arsenault in her white dress was able to flag down a passing motorist who gladly helped get her to the altar — albeit 30 minutes late. Despite the small hiccup, arsenault says the rest of her wedding was \" amazing \" and she now has a story her family will remember forever."

Yahoo news says it learned the fbi is poking around to get info on sputnik, the news agency funded by the russian government, with one of the fbi's lines of inquiry directed toward an ex-white house correspondent for sputnik. As part of the probe, andrew feinberg handed over to fbi agents a thumb drive containing thousands of internal sputnik correspondence, which he says he downloaded before he was canned in may. The overall investigation is meant to suss out whether sputnik has been spreading propaganda on behalf of the kremlin in violation of the foreign agents registration act, or fara — and whether the files on feinberg's thumb drive could help prove sputnik had something to do with russia's \" influence campaign \" in the election. Yahoo, which first learned about the probe from a us intelligence source, then got in touch with feinberg, who said he'd been interviewed by an fbi agent and doj lawyer for more than two hours on sept. 1 at the fbi's dc field office. He says he took his orders as a correspondent from dc supervisors at sputnik, though they'd regularly say, \" moscow wants this or moscow wants that. \" he says the interview focused on the news agency's \" internal structure, editorial processes, and funding. \" it's not clear if the questioning was under the purview of special counsel robert mueller. Meanwhile, mindia gavasheli, sputnik's us editor, said he hadn't heard of an fbi probe and \" any assertion that we are not a news organization is simply false. \" more here.

I think he can now move on as long as another shoe doesn't drop. \" marco rubio: \" we don't know all the facts. I think this is a story that's still developing and we should reserve judgment.

And i wouldn't, you know, delve into the political speculation as well. That would be a mistake. \" rudy giuliani: \" this has happened to many presidents, many governors, many mayors. It's happened to the present president at least three or four times. \" further, in denying knowledge, christie put his rep on the line: \" if it turns out there's some evidence that he knew about it, he's taken a complete risk and his political career is over. \" reince priebus: \" he trusted people that lied to him, and he fired those people. America is a forgiving people but they're forgiving when you take ownership, you make mistakes you take corrective action, and that's what chris christie showed. \" martin o ' malley: asked if christie is \" damaged goods, \" the maryland democrat said, \" i don't know.

Steven pressman is out to change that with a new book called 50 children: one ordinary american couple's extraordinary rescue mission into the heart of nazi germany, reports the christian science monitor. ( pressman also made a documentary that aired on hbo. ) the short version is that the krauses lived in philadelphia in 1939 and grew increasingly alarmed about reports of atrocities against jews emerging from europe. But unlike most, they decided to do something about it. They sailed overseas, entered nazi germany despite the danger to jews like themselves, and managed to secure the release of 50 jewish children whose families wanted desperately for them to make it to the us. They escorted the kids back to america — having to overcome friction in their own country over immigration worries and anti-semitism — and put them up in a summer camp in collegeville, pa., notes a review of the book at the san jose mercury news. All were either placed in american homes or eventually reunited with their own families. The reason the story is so unknown? afterward, the krauses never spoke of what they did, says pressman. He found out only because his wife happens to be their granddaughter, and she obtained eleanor kraus ' journal.

And here's the one word the administration keeps avoiding: coup. Because if it's a coup — specifically, if the military overthrows an elected leader — then the us by law has to cut off its $ 1.5 billion in aid to the country, and it doesn't want to do that. The white house insists the situation is so complicated that it will take some time to sort this out. Mohamed morsi wasn't exactly a paragon of democratic virtue, but one problem with this \" lexicographic trick \" is that it \" makes us policy seem weak, \" writes milbank. \" obama's cute evasion of foreign-aid requirements, following his administration's decision to postpone implementation of a key part of health-care reform, gives the impression that he views the law like a buffet from which he can pick and choose. \" can the white house keep the linguistic limbo in place until new elections are held in six months? possibly, writes milbank, \" but that would be quite a coup. \" click for his full column.

The aid package underscored a continuing regional contest for influence between saudi arabia and qatar, one that has accelerated since the arab uprising upended the status quo and brought islamists to power. Qatar, in alliance with turkey, has given strong financial and diplomatic support to the muslim brotherhood, but also to other islamists operating on the battlefields of syria and, before that, libya.

Maria alekhina tells the ap that pyotr verzilov was being flown to berlin, but she did not give details. Independent news site meduza reported that verzilov's partner, veronika nikulshina, says a doctor from a berlin clinic who is friends with the ill man's father suggested medical care outside russia. Verzilov was hospitalized in moscow on tuesday and had remained in intensive care, pussy riot members said this week. Alekhina tells the ap he regained consciousness friday. She also says she thinks he was poisoned for political reasons. Verzilov, nikulshina, and two other pussy riot members served 15-day jail sentences for running onto the moscow field where soccer's world cup final was being played in july. Their protest of what they described as the excessive powers of russia's police briefly disrupted the match with a very large broadcast audience. Verzilov fell ill as new allegations arose over the march nerve-agent poisoning of a russian former double agent and his daughter in the british city of salisbury. Several kremlin opponents have died from poisoning or suspected poisoning during the past 15 years. Alexander litvinenko, a former member of russia's domestic security service, died in 2006, and journalist anna politkovskaya, a fierce critic of president vladimir putin, became sick after drinking tea on an aeroflot flight in 2004.",

He tied them up, then stole a car from the cabin and fled, the los angeles times reports. ( dorner was initially reported to have tied up a couple. ) one of the maids escaped and called police at 12: 20pm. Less than half an hour later, fish and wildlife officers spotted dorner driving a purple nissan. Recognizing him, they started following. In trying to evade them, dorner crashed the car and left it. He then stopped a local man and took his truck, after allowing him and his dog to exit. Dorner once again drove by fish and wildlife officials, and was once again recognized. That's when he started shooting, hitting the fish and wildlife truck as he passed within two feet of it. The game warden inside, a former marine, shot back as dorner drove off. Once again, he crashed his vehicle and fled into the woods. Dorner ended up in the cabin where the standoff took place, starting with a firefight that killed one sheriff's deputy and injured another. After breaking windows, firing tear gas, and asking dorner to surrender, authorities started ripping down the cabin's walls. When they reached the last wall, they heard one gunshot, and then a fire started spreading. More gunshots were heard, presumably set off by the flames. The incident was a rare one for fish and wildlife wardens, who are typically involved in just one shooting per year, the times notes. An odd detail from cbs: the cabin dorner ended up in was right across from the command post from which the manhunt had been centered.",

Or, more precisely, there seems to be some order in the way one prime number follows another, reports quanta magazine. Start with the basics: except for 2 and 5, all primes — numbers divisible only by one or themselves — end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. Theoretically, there should be an equal chance of one prime being followed by another that ends in one of those four numbers. But robert lemke oliver and kannan soundararajan found that's not the case, reports new scientist. In looking at the first billion primes, they found that a number ending in 1 follows another ending in 1 about 18 % of the time, with different percentages for the rest: 3 ( 30 % ), 7 ( 30 % ), and 9 ( 22 % ). \" it was very weird, \" says soundararajan. \" it's like some painting you are very familiar with, and then suddenly you realize there is a figure in the painting you've never seen before. \" others in the field agree. \" we've been studying primes for a long time, and no one spotted this before, \" says a number theorist at the university of montreal. \" it's crazy. \" the stanford pair guess this anti-sameness bias is related to something called the \" k tuple conjecture, \" which gizmodo calls \" an old idea about how often pairs, triples, and larger sets of primes make an appearance. \" ( dig in at gizmodo or at nature for more on that. ) as for the practical implications of this new discovery, well, the stanford scientists don't know of any just yet. But the nature post calls it \" both strange and fascinating \" for mathematicians, and the university of montreal professor sums up that sentiment: \" you could wonder, what else have we missed about the primes? \" ( behold the biggest prime number yet found. )",
