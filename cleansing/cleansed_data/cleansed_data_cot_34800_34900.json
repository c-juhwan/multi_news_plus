        "summary": "Recreational marijuana is still illegal in canada — but only for another 17 weeks. Prime minister justin trudeau says that marijuana legalization, passed by the country's senate on tuesday, will be in effect as of oct. 17 this year, giving provinces time to set up retail outlets and prepare for the change in the law, the cbc reports. \" it is our hope as of oct. 17 there will be a smooth operation of retail cannabis outlets operated by the provinces with an online mail delivery system operated by the provinces that will ensure that this happens in an orderly fashion, \" he told reporters, adding that the government hopes to \" almost completely replace \" the organized crime market. Trudeau said he had decided to push the date of full legalization back to october to give extra time to provinces and territories \" who told us they needed more time to transition to this new framework, \" ctv reports. To become law, the bill still needs assent from queen elizabeth ii's representative, which is expected early thursday. The country's 10 provinces and three territories will have different systems for pot sales, with all private pot shops in some provinces, only publicly owned stores in some, and a mix in others. \" it's this amazing case study for countries globally to see the amazing benefits that legalizing cannabis can have on things like the economy, eradicating the black market, and getting cannabis out of the hands of minors, \" matt gray of the herb social media platform tells the ap.",

        "summary": "Suddenly, it's the democratic race making headlines for fireworks between the candidates. On wednesday, bernie sanders said hillary clinton isn't \" qualified \" to be president — and ticked off several reasons to make his case, reports cnn. In response, the clinton campaign said he had reached a \" new low. \" in a speech at temple university, sanders said his string of primary wins was apparently making clinton nervous. \" she has been saying lately that she thinks i am quote-unquote not qualified to be president, \" he said. \" let me just say in response to secretary clinton, i don't believe that she is qualified if she is through her super pac taking tens of millions of dollars in special-interest money. I don't think you are qualified if you get $ 15 million through wall street for your super pac. \" and he didn't stop there: \" i don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in iraq. I don't think you are qualified if you have supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement which has cost us millions of decent paying jobs. \" clinton herself didn't respond to the attack, but campaign spokesman brian fallon did in a tweet: \" hillary clinton did not say bernie sanders was ' not qualified. ' but he has now - absurdly - said it about her. This is a new low. \" sanders'remarks came after clinton criticized sanders for providing what she deemed to be shallow answers to questions about breaking up big banks and other policy issues. \" he'd been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn't really studied or understood, and that raises a lot of questions, \" she said. Clinton also reiterated that she thinks sanders is big on \" arm-waving and hot rhetoric \" instead of practical reform. But as politico notes, she didn't quite call sanders unqualified to be president, though she avoided a question about whether he was qualified three times. Instead, she said she would \" leave it to the voters to decide. \" all of it is leading up to what the washington post calls new york's \" make-or-break \" primary on april 19.",

The archdiocese's 113 schools now plan to redirect their money to a medical organization that uses only adult stem cells in its research, the ap reports. \" it's a well established moral principle that a good end is not enough, \" says an archdiocese spokesman. \" the means to that ends must be morally licit. \" embryonic stem-cell research uses cells from embryos that are four or five days old, salon notes, whereas adult stem-cell research takes cells from throughout the body. And as the washington post reports, a vatican directive in 2008 argued against stem-cell research, saying that it \" presents serious problems from the standpoint of cooperation in evil and scandal. \" the american life league, an anti-abortion group, compares embryonic stem-cell research to abortion and urges its members not to support the als association.

Family attorney justin bamberg tells the charlotte observer that the family has \" more questions than answers \" after seeing the videos, which he says shows the 43-year-old calmly walking backward with his hands at his sides. Police chief kerr putney admits that the videos do not provide \" definitive \" evidence that scott had a gun, but he says that they're part of a \" totality \" of evidence that suggests scott was a threat and the shooting was justified. The latest developments: bamberg says the videos show scott remaining calm when police order him out of his vehicle. \" while police did give him several commands, \" he said, \" he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time, \" he says. The attorney says the scott family wants the videos to be released to the public. Demonstrators chanted \" release the tape \" during a third night of protests in charlotte, the ap reports. There was no repeat of the violence seen tuesday and wednesday nights in the city, which is under a state of emergency. National guard members protected buildings thursday night and police enforced a newly imposed midnight-to-6am curfew. Charlotte mayor jennifer roberts has also seen the police videos and like both police and family members, she says it's impossible to tell what scott has in his hands. \" it is not a very clear picture, and the gun in question is a small gun and it was not easy to see with the way the motion was happening, \" she told cnn. His family says he was carrying a book and didn't own a gun. Reuters reports that a protester shot in the head by a civilian on wednesday died on thursday.

The ap reports that donald trump called for an end to the unrest in a speech in suburban philadelphia thursday night. \" the rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and ended now, \" he said. \" the main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding african-americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in safety and peace. \" the unrest \" literally smashed the facade of some of the city's defining civic institutions, \" notes the wall street journal, which looks at how charlotte's businesslike civic identity has been shaken by the disturbances.",

A limited-edition timepiece, the devon star wars watch is a mash-up of many of the empire's design details, including echoes of darth vader's helmet and a stand that makes it look exactly like a tie fighter. It also comes emblazoned with the imperial crest, and even the watch strap is modeled after lord vader's sith gloves. The face of the watch, meanwhile, looks designed after a death star control panel, including lots of funky analog dials, all of which seem to be ticking down to alderaan's destruction.

            "Not a long time ago, in a galaxy you're already in, some absurdly wealthy venture capitalist was likely watching his stolen copy of the still-unreleased 4k resolution original star wars trilogy, and suddenly realized he was late for his weekly outing to throw rocks at poor people. Stealing his attention away from a lightsaber duel to glance at his diamond-encrusted rolex, he sighed. \"this timepiece is so un-star wars-y, \" he said, employing the clever linguistic wordplay that he felt signaled his john galt-like superiority to the lower tier of 1 percenters. \"if only there were a way i could still be enjoying star wars every time i looked at my watch, but could simultaneously be reassured that i ' m wealthy enough to be able to wipe my ass with fabergé eggs if i so choose. \" suddenly, he felt a great disturbance in the force of his mind, as if millions of brain cells suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced by much stupider brain cells. A germ of an idea was beginning to take shape and roll around in his soylent-soaked brain, like a bb in a tin can. He placed a quick phone call to his equally wealthy friends — and suddenly the evil empire's presence on earth became slightly more noticeable. Such is the presumable origin story of the star wars watch",

        "summary": "In a 2014 ruling, an appeals court decided that the environmental protection agency \" properly [ put ] the horse before the cart \" in coming up with mandates to limit power-plant emissions of mercury and other pollutants. The supreme court today overturned that ruling, blocking a key white house environmental initiative because it said the agency didn't do due diligence in figuring out how much it would cost the industry, the new york times reports. Any regulations arising out of the clean air act are required to be \" appropriate and necessary, \" and industry groups, in addition to 20-plus states, had argued that the epa didn't carry out the proper cost-benefit analysis that would show the impact of such regulations. Justice antonin scalia wrote for the majority in the 5-4 ruling, with justices elena kagan, ruth bader ginsburg, stephen breyer, and sonia sotomayor dissenting, reports the washington post. The regulations, which the ap notes started to take effect in april, required coal- and oil-fired power plants to put in special \" scrubbers \" to get rid of pollutants, especially mercury emissions, which can be particularly toxic to kids and unborn children, the wall street journal notes. The epa says it did carry out the cost-benefit analysis its critics mention, even though it notes it wasn't obligated to, since public-health concerns should hold sway over financial ones. Both sides agree the regs will cost the industry about $ 9.6 billion — but the epa says doing so will result in \" between $ 37 billion and $ 90 billion in benefits and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually, \" per the hill, while industry groups came up with their own benefits estimate of $ 6 million, the times reports. Some good news: to comply with the epa, most power plants have already closed shop, made changes, or put in place plans to do so, the hill reports.",

But if you're wondering how we came to this bitter moment of partisan divide over president trump's pick for the job for life, the ap takes a long look back and finds that we came by it honestly — the first supreme court nominee voted down by the senate was the pick of none other than george washington, who tapped john rutledge 222 years ago to succeed john jay as chief justice. \" there were more rejected nominees in the first half of the nation's history than in the second half, \" says an expert. A look around the landscape as gorsuch heads for a vote: democrats joe manchin and heidi heitkamp announced late last week that they would break party lines to vote for gorsuch's confirmation, cnn reports. That means republicans need six more democrats to defect in order to end their expected filibuster and avoid invoking the nuclear option. Cnn takes a look at the 10 democrats currently sitting on the fence; six are up for re-election. Liberals are licking their chops at the thought of a successful filibuster, reports politico. \" if republicans decide to go nuclear, that will further energize the resistance movement, \" a moveon.org activist says. \" the only bad path here is for democrats to flee the fight. \" writing at al.com, alabama ag steven marshall opines that gorsuch could be the deciding vote on the fate of the death penalty — and it's not entirely clear where he would land.",

Beneath threadneedle street in the city's financial quarter is a 300,000-square-foot \" maze \" of bank of england vaults that hold $ 200 billion in gold owned by the uk, 30 other countries, and some 25 banks, the bbc reports. In all, about 6,000 tons of gold are held in london vaults — about 20 % of all the gold held by the world's governments — with the vast majority of it sitting on numbered shelves in the subterranean bank of england vaults. The appearance of the gold bars in the vaults differs based on where they were minted, but each one weighs in at 400 troy ounces and is worth, at the moment, about $ 500,000. Gold is seen as a safe investment, per the independent, and investors often move toward the precious metal when other investments are volatile. \" not quite like storing cash under the mattress, \" the bbc says, \" but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets. \" one historical nugget of note: during wwii, the vaults served as bomb shelters. By that time, though, the gold they held had been secretly shipped to canada, in case the nazis overran london. \" it's all very james bond, \" says the sun of the relatively old-school security still in effect — access involves 3-foot-long keys. \" you can't visit the gold, of course, \" observes a post at atlas obscura. \" but if you want to get close, stand in front of the bank of england on threadneedle street in downtown london, look down, and imagine. \" ( apple's recycling program has netted $ 43 million in gold. )",

The new york times revisits the situation in thurston county, which in early august made headlines over the deaths of six cats, killed in 2018 in a manner that animal services officer erika johnson described as \" extremely horrific \": the animals were sliced from their stern to their genitals, and their spines had been taken from them. The situation has only worsened: the toll now stands at 12, with a mutilated cat most recently found on tuesday. The spines weren't removed in all cases, per the times; in some, the organs were placed beside the body. The continued deaths have spurred the county to assemble a 10-person task force, which includes a former cop who focused on animal cases and a homicide detective. King5 quotes johnson as saying the killings seem to take place between 11pm and 6am, leading officials to caution homeowners to keep their pets indoors overnight. The olympian quotes a press release from the thurston county sheriff's office as saying it \" is extremely concerned that such a predator is lurking and committing such vile crimes in our community. \" the times quotes a detective with that office as extrapolating that fear: \" there have been past cases where perpetrators were caught that turned out to be serial killers. Is that the case in this? we don't know, but we're not taking any chances. \" ( this man was shot dead trying to save an abused puppy. )",

        "summary": "A bearded christian monk lies dead in a pool of blood. A younger monk who clashed with him is defrocked. Another tries to kill himself. Now coptic christians in egypt are grappling with this murder-at-the-monastery scandal as authorities suggest possible motives, the new york times reports. Bishop epiphanius, abbot at the monastery of st. Macarius north-west of cairo, was found murdered outside his cell july 29, apparently beaten with a blunt object. Days later, coptic officials defrocked another monk, isaiah al-makari, who had argued with 64-year-old epiphanius for weeks before the killing. Then a third monk, faltaeous al-makary, 33, slashed his wrists and tried throwing himself off a monastery roof — but lived. All very murky, until prosecutors said al-makari confessed to the killing. \" the devil controlled the monk, \" says al-makari's lawyer, per the guardian; he later alluded to \" conflicts between the bishop and the other monks. \" coptic monks, officials, and experts have floated other earth-bound theories like financial wrongdoing and a possible close relationship between the two monks. There's also the decades-long, coptic orthodox theological dispute that pits conservatives against reformers like epiphanius, notes the tablet. Now the copts — who comprise about 10 % of egypt's population and often face persecution — are enduring their first major scandal since a former cleric was caught having sex with a woman on a church altar in 2001. \" we have problems, \" says a monk at the fourth-century saint macarius monastery. \" but we do not want to speak about it. \"",

The body of bishop epiphanius was found on 29 july at the entrance to his monastic cell in the saint macarius monastery, which lies on a desert road north-west of cairo. The head of the monastery was found in a pool of blood and had received blows to the back of his skull. The accused monk, isaiah al-makari, was defrocked by the church days later, prompting a statement that did not mention the murder but which declared that al-makari had been under investigation since the beginning of the year. A group of monks had previously requested that al-makari remain in the church by signing a petition, which was delivered to bishop epiphanius and pope tawadros ii, the head of the coptic church, prior to the murder. The mystery of epiphanius'death deepened after a second monk, faltaous al-makary, attempted to kill himself by cutting his arteries and throwing himself from the roof a monastery building, before isaiah al-makari confessed to killing the bishop. Bishop epiphanius'death prompted 12 new decrees regulating monks ' behaviour from pope tawadros ii, including a temporary freeze in new recruits, a ban on monks leaving monastery grounds without permission, as well as restrictions on monks ' use of social networks",

        "summary": "Chimps chat, just like we do — and like many of us, they spend a lot of time gabbing about what they want to eat and where they're going to get their next meal, discovery reports. For a study published in animal behaviour, scientists camped out in the ivory coast's tai forest for more than 750 hours to observe these great apes and found that they make a particular sound when they're foraging for snacks, but that their voices change even more so when they're on a quest for a certain fruit — and find trees of a certain size that have it. \" chimpanzees definitely have a very complex communication system that includes a variety of vocalizations, but also facial expressions and gestures, \" project leader ammie kalan tells discovery. The vocalization that stood out quite prominently during the study: high-pitched calls when they found fruit from nauclea trees. Kalan explains this fruit boasts a high energy content, is \" big and easy to ingest, \" and smells \" very good in the forest. \" the nine adult chimps that were under observation exhibited \" food calls of a higher dominant and peak frequency \" when they stumbled across the much-coveted nauclea treats, bioscholar reports. The chimps altered their pitch even further depending on tree size: smaller trees got a high-pitched call, but larger trees with more bounty elicited lower-pitched calls, attracting more chimps, according to the study's highlights listed on sciencedirect. The researchers do note, however, that more study is needed to see if the food calls were specific to this group of chimps, as well as whether similar vocalizations are used for other types of food, per bioscholar.

            "Peer reviewed chimpanzees modify their food calls with respect to tree size for a high valued fruit species. The vocalization capabilities of our closest living relatives, the great apes, often pale in comparison to their flexible gestural repertoire. However, the vast majority of literature on great ape communication, gestural and vocal, comes from studies conducted in captivity where the surrounding environment is vastly different from the socio-ecological context in which wild apes naturally communicate. Researchers of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, have now investigated a specific call type, the chimpanzee food call, which has already been shown to be produced solely during a foraging context, and a study in captivity has also provided evidence for the call being functionally referential to conspecifics. \"we recorded wild chimpanzee food calls from nine adult chimpanzees, male and female, along with detailed feeding data including the species, tree size, and quantity of fruits present upon arriving to a food source \" says lead author ammie kalan. The data were collected using all day focal follows of individual chimpanzees from the habituated south group of the long-term taï chimpanzee project in côte d ' ivoire. \"using robust statistical analyses, our results show that chimpanzees produced food calls of a higher dominant and peak frequency for a particular food species, nauclea diderichi, compared to four other species that",
            "Researchers eavesdropping on wild chimpanzees determined that the primates communicate about at least two things: their favorite yummy fruits, and the trees where these fruits can be found.

            "Peer reviewed chimpanzees modify their food calls with respect to tree size for a high valued fruit species. The vocalization capabilities of our closest living relatives, the great apes, often pale in comparison to their flexible gestural repertoire. However, the vast majority of literature on great ape communication, gestural and vocal, comes from studies conducted in captivity where the surrounding environment is vastly different from the socio-ecological context in which wild apes naturally communicate. Researchers of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, have now investigated a specific call type, the chimpanzee food call, which has already been shown to be produced solely during a foraging context, and a study in captivity has also provided evidence for the call being functionally referential to conspecifics. \"we recorded wild chimpanzee food calls from nine adult chimpanzees, male and female, along with detailed feeding data including the species, tree size, and quantity of fruits present upon arriving to a food source \" says lead author ammie kalan. The data were collected using all day focal follows of individual chimpanzees from the habituated south group of the long-term taï chimpanzee project in côte d ' ivoire. \"using robust statistical analyses, our results show that chimpanzees produced food calls of a higher dominant and peak frequency for a particular food species, nauclea diderichi, compared to four other species that",

The white house has not made any official announcement. In a tweet wednesday, trump himself says the final decision is yet to come: \" i will be announcing my decision on the paris accord over the next few days. \" trump had promised to decide this week whether the us would abide by the 195-nation deal signed by former president obama, and a letter signed by 22 gop senators urging him to reject the pact reportedly swayed him. Withdrawing would unwind one of obama's biggest initiatives on the environment, and trump's own epa chief, scott pruitt, has been advising him to scrap the deal. Steve bannon is another fierce opponent, arguing that the deal's pollution-reduction targets would hurt the us. At the same time, business executives such as exxon mobil chief darren woods have been advising trump to stick with the pact, notes the new york times.

        "summary": "A university of cambridge archaeologist has discovered the sad end to a tale of resistance on the only british territory to be occupied by the nazis during world war ii — the channel islands. Sidney ashcroft was 20 years old and living on the island of guernsey in 1942 when, as family members recall, he punched a german officer who had pushed his mother; he may have also stolen food. ( the guardian notes that there was one german soldier for every three channel islanders, making it \" more heavily guarded than other occupied territories. \" ) he was arrested and sent from guernsey, which sits off normandy in the english channel, to a nazi prison in mainland europe the day before his 21st birthday, never to return home. His mother, who died in 1981, tried to learn his fate and always believed he would someday surface. But during a bbc investigation, dr. Gilly carr discovered that he had survived the war only to die of tuberculosis in the straubing prison hospital in germany just a week after the country surrendered. Carr — who says she had an \" overwhelming desire... To seek justice \" for ashcroft after seeing a haunting photograph of the young man — used red cross records to find the unmarked mass grave where he was buried. She traveled there with his second cousin, chris roberts, who left a memorial stone at the site describing ashcroft as a political prisoner. \" it's an appalling thought that sidney just disappeared into the maw of europe, \" roberts tells the bbc. Ashcroft's name is also on a memorial to nazi victims unveiled on guernsey earlier this year, the reporter notes. ( the forest outside a nazi death camp has yielded a disturbing find. )",

Marquise byrd was riding in the front seat as a passenger tuesday night when the sandbag hit the car heading south on interstate 75. The driver of the car wasn't hurt, but byrd suffered a serious head injury and was treated at the scene by emergency responders before being taken to an area hospital. Police told a local prosecutor that byrd may die from his injuries, reports the toledo blade. As for the youths accused of tossing the sandbag, one is a 13-year-old and three are 14. All four were charged with felonious assault and booked into the lucas county juvenile detention center. People notes they're not being charged as adults and so won't name them, though the blade does; two of them reportedly have previous criminal infractions. Authorities say other cars were hit with other objects, meaning more charges may emerge, including vandalism or homicide if byrd dies from his injuries. The bridge the sandbag was thrown from is being renovated, and so sections of fence that normally would prevent anyone from being able to drop anything over the side are missing. The sandbag may have been left by contractors overnight to weigh down items like signage. An ohio dot rep warns, however, that even something much lighter than a sandbag could cause serious damage when thrown onto fast-moving vehicles from above.

Trudeau's defenders, however, complained that the short excerpt from the meeting was taken out of context and that full video of the exchange shows the prime minister was being lighthearted, the washington post reports. \" he was lightly ribbing a woman who was rambling about the power of women, ' god the mother, ' and how the world needs womanly love, \" tweeted daniel dale from the toronto star, describing the \" right-wing pile-on \" as \" misleading. \" ( canada now has a gender-neutral version of its national anthem. )",

That owner, new york city hedge fund alden global capital ( which owns digital first media, which owns the post and others ) has called for 30 positions to be eliminated by july, exacerbating its already \" shriveled \" ranks, which once numbered in excess of 250 and now is below the 100-mark. The washington post reports the order to further cut staff came in mid-march, though digital first media was said to have described itself as \" solidly profitable \" last year. The paper's editor-in-chief, lee ann colacioppo, tells the washington post the explanation she was given for the cuts in the face of profitability is that the paper wasn't on budget. \" we get it that things change, \" reads the editorial. \" we get it that our feelings are raw and no doubt color our judgment. But we've been quiet too long.... If alden isn't willing to do good journalism here, it should sell the post to owners who will. \" the editorial was accompanied by a slate of columns, with the whole package conceived by editorial page editor chuck plunkett, who tells the new york times he informed neither digital first media execs nor colacioppo of the articles, which were posted online friday and then ran in sunday's edition.",

            "The denver post is in open revolt against its owner. Angry and frustrated journalists at the 125-year-old newspaper took the extraordinary step this weekend of publicly blasting its new york-based hedge-fund owner and making the case for its own survival in several articles that went online friday and are scheduled to run in the post's sunday opinion section. \"news matters, \" the main headline reads. \"colo. Should demand the newspaper it deserves. \" the bold tactic was born out of a dissatisfaction not uncommon in newsrooms across the country as newspapers grapple with the loss of revenue that has followed the decline of print. The move at the post followed a prolonged, slow-burning rebellion at the los angeles times, where journalists agitated against the paper's owner, the media company tronc. Newsroom complaints about tronc's leadership helped lead to the sale of the newspaper to a billionaire medical entrepreneur, dr. Patrick soon-shiong, who had been a major shareholder in tronc. For many publications that do not attract a patron-like owner, however, the difficult times are likely to continue, and midsize newspapers have been hit especially hard. Hoping to avoid the slow trudge to irrelevance or bankruptcy, the denver paper took the stuff of newsroom conversation and made it public in dramatic fashion.",

On monday, at least two dozen more journalists will be leaving the post because of layoffs. At the denver post on monday, more than two dozen reporters, editors, photographers, videographers, page designers, digital producers and opinion staff will walk out the door. Our marching orders are to cut a full 30 by the start of july. These heartbreaking instructions raise the question: does this cut, which follows so many in recent years that our ranks have shriveled from more than 250 to fewer than 100 today, represent the beginning of the end for the voice of the rocky mountain empire? the cuts, backed by our owner, the new york city hedge fund alden global capital, also are a mystery, if you look at them from the point of view of those of us intent on running a serious news operation befitting the city that bears our name. Media experts locally and nationally question why our future looks so bleak, as many newspapers still enjoy double-digit profits and our management reported solid profits as recently as last year.

Angry and frustrated journalists at the 125-year-old newspaper took the extraordinary step this weekend of publicly blasting its new york-based hedge-fund owner and making the case for its own survival in several articles that went online friday and are scheduled to run in the post's sunday opinion section. \"news matters, \" the main headline reads. \"colo. Should demand the newspaper it deserves. \" the bold tactic was born out of a dissatisfaction not uncommon in newsrooms across the country as newspapers grapple with the loss of revenue that has followed the decline of print. The move at the post followed a prolonged, slow-burning rebellion at the los angeles times, where journalists agitated against the paper's owner, the media company tronc. Newsroom complaints about tronc's leadership helped lead to the sale of the newspaper to a billionaire medical entrepreneur, dr. Patrick soon-shiong, who had been a major shareholder in tronc. For many publications that do not attract a patron-like owner, however, the difficult times are likely to continue, and midsize newspapers have been hit especially hard. Hoping to avoid the slow trudge to irrelevance or bankruptcy, the denver paper took the stuff of newsroom conversation and made it public in dramatic fashion.",
            "The photo on the left shows 142 members of the denver post's newsroom staff in the newspaper's lobby as it existed on may 15, 2013. The photo illustration on the right shows the toll that layoffs and constant turnover have taken on the staff in the five years since. On monday, at least two dozen more journalists will be leaving the post because of layoffs. At the denver post on monday, more than two dozen reporters, editors, photographers, videographers, page designers, digital producers and opinion staff will walk out the door. Our marching orders are to cut a full 30 by the start of july. These heartbreaking instructions raise the question: does this cut, which follows so many in recent years that our ranks have shriveled from more than 250 to fewer than 100 today, represent the beginning of the end for the voice of the rocky mountain empire? the cuts, backed by our owner, the new york city hedge fund alden global capital, also are a mystery, if you look at them from the point of view of those of us intent on running a serious news operation befitting the city that bears our name. Media experts locally and nationally question why our future looks so bleak, as many newspapers still enjoy double-digit profits and our management reported solid profits as recently as last year. We call for action. Consider this editorial and this sunday"

        "summary": "After oking airstrikes in iraq and spy flights over syria in an attempt to rein in isis, president obama has started rallying international allies to expand efforts against the militant sunni group — efforts that may include even more airstrikes in iraq and possible military action in syria, reports the new york times. One thing he won't be doing: partnering with syrian president bashar al-assad, who also has a vested interest in purging his country of the insurgents. \" we're not going to ask for permission from the syrian regime, \" a state department spokeswoman tells the washington post. Although syria warned monday that it would consider any us strikes against isis in its country \" an act of aggression \" if not coordinated with its government, it indicated that it's \" ready to cooperate and coordinate on the regional and international level in the war on terror, \" notes the post. This may be part of the reason why the obama administration is working behind the scenes to bolster its international support: in addition to getting longtime allies britain and australia on board for potential air campaigns, unnamed administration officials say they're asking turkey for the use of its military bases, trying to gather intelligence from jordan, and requesting financial assistance from saudi arabia, which supports syrian opposition forces, notes the times. \" rooting out a cancer like [ isis ] won't be easy, and it won't be quick, \" obama said in a speech yesterday, adding \" that the militants would be ' no match ' for a united international community. \"",

        "summary": "A jailhouse that costs taxpayers $ 1.2 million a month is a hard-enough sell. But the city of detroit is in an even stickier predicament: it has to justify that cost for an unfinished prison that was abandoned two years ago and will probably never be completed, fox news reports. Monthly costs for the wayne county jail, which racked up $ 150 million in construction costs before the plan was shelved in 2013, include $ 4,000 for electricity, almost $ 11,000 for security, and nearly $ 13,000 for maintenance of sump pumps, the detroit free press reports. Then there are the fees to store the prefab jail cells ( $ 15,000 ), insurance ( almost $ 5,000 ), and the largest cost: $ 1,184,000 and change for debt repayment. It's just the latest financial pile-on for the city, which has been mired in debt for years. The jailhouse was originally intended to be a 2,000-bed, $ 300 million project that would absorb the county's three other prisons, per fox. But an investigation in 2013 into excess spending on the prison's construction led to the arrest of wayne county's cfo, as well as the manager of the construction site, and brought all work to a halt. The city is reluctant to make a decision on whether to resume building the site or revamp the county's other prisons until it's made headway on its massive deficit — and although there's been interest from at least five buyers who want the site, the city hasn't bit on any offers. \" the wayne county jail was a mess since it was created, \" the head of the wayne county taxpayers association tells fox. \" we should … cut our losses. If someone is willing to purchase it, we should sell it. \" ( meanwhile, the city went after the wrong church to collect on a $ 170,000 electric bill. )",

Reporters who wish to cover obama attending the republic day parade will have to give up all electronics, wireless access, and even bathroom breaks for upward of eight hours. If any news were to occur during the parade - an all-day spectacle of marching bands and floats, dancing children and rolling tanks - there would be something like a six-hour delay for the traveling pool to notify the rest of the american press. According to white house officials, the parade is the only event other than the president's inaugural parades for which obama has been out so long at an event in public. \"we want to make sure that you and your colleagues have the opportunity to get some access to the president and get a good sense about what the president's doing when he is representing the united states of america on foreign soil, \" white house spokesperson josh earnest told reporters on friday, according to the hindu. \"sometimes these can be very challenging negotiations, particularly when we're going to countries that don't have the same kind of respect for or don't value an independent news media",

Dawn sturgess, one of two people exposed to the same nerve agent that nearly killed russian citizens sergei skripal and yulia skripal earlier this year, died late sunday at the hospital in salisbury where she had been treated since falling ill june 30, the guardian reports. Britain's prime minister theresa may said she was \" appalled and shocked \" by the death of the 44-year-old. Neil basu, chief of the uk's counter-terror police, said sunday night that the death \" has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what i can only describe as an outrageous, reckless, and barbaric act. \" basu said sturgess leaves behind her family, including three children, and charlie rowley, the \" 45-year-old man who fell ill with dawn, remains critically ill in hospital. \" sturgess and rowley lived 10 miles from salisbury and fell ill after spending time in the city. Bbc correspondent frank gardner reports that police believe they were exposed to the poison when they encountered a container left over from the attack on the skripals, which the uk has blamed on russia. The death of sturgess, a british citizen, \" now changes the investigation to a murder inquiry, with all the diplomatic and security ramifications that carries, \" he writes. Russia has rejected the accusations, claiming that the uk is blaming moscow for the nerve agent to undermine the success of the world cup that russia is hosting.",

The washington post reports that researchers at the university of auckland looked at 13,406 pairs of swedish sisters and found the older sibling was 29 % more likely to be overweight and 40 % more likely to be obese. First-born sisters also had a bmi 2.4 % higher than their sisters in the study, which looked at the women during their own pregnancies, according to cbs news. Interestingly, the post points out first-born women tended to be lighter at birth than their younger sisters. This was the largest study ever on the effects of birth order and also the first study to look at pairs of siblings to account for genetic and home-life factors. The results from the study fit with those from earlier studies that showed first-born men have a higher bmi at middle age and are more likely to suffer from diabetes and high blood pressure. Study author wayne cutfield tells cbs first-borns may be fatter because they received less nutrients through the placenta than their siblings, preprogramming their body to store more fat after they're born. In subsequent births, babies get more nutrients because mom's blood vessels are wider. Another researcher has a simpler explanation: first-borns tend to get overfed. The study, published in the journal of epidemiology &amp; community health, also claims this may be why worldwide average bmis are on the rise; increasingly smaller family sizes mean more first-borns skewing the average.

Now the internet may have saved the chateau de la mothe-chandeniers. According to the bbc, which has breathtaking drone video of the castle, thousands of people have donated at least $ 61 each to buy a future for it. The chateau has changed hands many times over the centuries. Most recently a math teacher tried — and failed — to restore it after purchasing it in 1981. As nature reclaimed the chateau and plants sprouted from its windows — giving it what architectural digest calls \" a beautiful if not eerie aesthetic \" — the math teacher mused about having it demolished. Instead, more than 9,000 people from around the world have donated more than $ 885,000 toward saving the chateau de la mothe-chandeniers, according to a fundraising site. While the castle's new co-owners won't get to live in it, they will have some say in the plans to restore it and the chance to be the first to visit it when it opens to the public. Donors can also buy stock in the company being set up to run the chateau. \" the idea is not just about raising the money, but getting as many people as possible to participate in saving this magical, fairytale place, \" the founder of the company behind the fundraiser tells the guardian.

Now scientists may have detected a new, unknown particle. Working from june to mid-november, two teams from the european organization for nuclear research, aka cern, spotted excess pairs of gamma rays carrying 750 billion electron volts in the debris of proton-proton collisions, which could be a sign of the radioactive decay of a particle, per the new york times. Team atlas found 40 extra pairs of photons, while team cms found 10 after some 400 trillion proton-proton collisions, per nature, which reports the teams wouldn't have shared the results if both hadn't seen the same thing. \" but it can happen by coincidence, \" says an atlas rep. Atlas'data has \" a 1-in-93 chance of being a fluke — far stronger than the 1-in-3.5-million odds of mere chance, \" per the times. If verified, the particle could be similar to the higgs boson, but about 12 times heavier, per sciencealert. It could also be a graviton, the proposed quantum carrier of gravity. Should a graviton be found, the consequences could be colossal, since it would suggest the existence of extra dimensions of space-time, per the times. \" i don't think there is anyone around who thinks this is conclusive, \" a cern physicist says. \" but it would be huge if true. \" one theorist says the discovery of a new particle would be \" a total game changer. \" if they have found a new particle, scientists expect to be able to confirm the discovery next year, when they will have 10 times as much data.",

            "Cms/cern the two experiments that discovered the higgs boson in 2012 have sensed an intriguing — if very preliminary — whiff of a possible new elementary particle. Both collaborations announced their observations on 15 december, as they released their first significant results since a major upgrade of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) outside geneva, switzerland, was completed earlier this year. The results largely match a rumour that has been circulating on social media and blogs for several days: that both the cms and atlas detectors at the lhc have seen an unexpected excess of pairs of photons, together carrying around 750 gigaelectronvolts ( gev ) of energy, in the debris of their proton – proton collisions. This could be a tell-tale sign of a new particle — also a boson, but not necessarily similar to the higgs — decaying into two photons of equivalent energy. If so, the particle would be about four times more massive than the next heaviest particle discovered so far, the top quark, and six times more massive than the higgs.

            "Cms/cern the two experiments that discovered the higgs boson in 2012 have sensed an intriguing — if very preliminary — whiff of a possible new elementary particle. Both collaborations announced their observations on 15 december, as they released their first significant results since a major upgrade of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) outside geneva, switzerland, was completed earlier this year. The results largely match a rumour that has been circulating on social media and blogs for several days: that both the cms and atlas detectors at the lhc have seen an unexpected excess of pairs of photons, together carrying around 750 gigaelectronvolts ( gev ) of energy, in the debris of their proton – proton collisions. This could be a tell-tale sign of a new particle — also a boson, but not necessarily similar to the higgs — decaying into two photons of equivalent energy. If so, the particle would be about four times more massive than the next heaviest particle discovered so far, the top quark, and six times more massive than the higgs. In their talks at cern — the laboratory that hosts the lhc — the speakers for the two experiments took turns in surveying the results of the higher-energy, ' run 2 ' of experiments, which began in june and was suspended in early november. Both speakers left the results on photon pairs for the end",
            "At one point, rolf heuer, the departing director-general of cern, tried to get people to move off the steps, declaring they were a fire hazard. When they did not move, he joked that he now knew he was a lame duck. When physicists announced in 2012 that they had indeed discovered the higgs boson, it was not the end of physics. It was not even, to paraphrase winston churchill, the beginning of the end. It might, they hoped, be the end of the beginning. The higgs boson was the last missing piece of the standard model, which explains all we know about subatomic particles and forces. But there are questions this model does not answer, such as what happens at the bottom of a black hole, the identity of the dark matter and dark energy that rule the cosmos, or why the universe is matter and not antimatter. The large hadron collider was built at a cost of some $ 10 billion, to speed protons around an 18-mile underground track at more than 99 percent of the speed of light and smash them together in search of new particles and forces of nature. By virtue of einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, the more energy poured into these collisions, the more massive particles can come out of them. And by the logic"

Alongside reese witherspoon, owen wilson, martin short, and josh brolin, joaquin phoenix stars as a stoner helping out his ex-girlfriend in 1970s california. Here's what critics are saying: director paul thomas anderson \" gets so much contextually right here, \" writes ella taylor at npr. But \" that may be the problem. I love anderson's ambition, but it is awfully hard to make a movie about a culture adrift that doesn't make its audience feel the same. \" she adds the film \" runs a punishing 148 minutes, not enough of which are funny or sad enough to hold us. \" claudia puig at usa today finds inherent vice \" well-acted, intermittently compelling, often incoherent but always offbeat. \" phoenix is especially strong \" as an ultra-convincing doper, sporting some impressive mutton chops, \" though the movie is \" too long. \" still, \" think of it as a film that's meant to be experienced, more than fully understood. \" the flick is packed with \" hilarity, soulful reveries, stylistic ingenuity, and smashing performances that keep playing back in your head, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. \" it's the work of a major talent, \" yet \" something's a little off. \" perhaps it's anderson's \" excessive loyalty to pynchon, \" travers says. \" it's anderson's first constricted film, the one that never completely breaks free. \" betsy sharkey at the los angeles times disagrees. \" inherent vice is pynchon and anderson at their funniest, loosest, and most accessible, \" she writes. \" anderson has done a remarkable job of replicating the crazy kaleidoscope of crime, dope, and raunch the novelist conjured. \" all the elements \" create such a good buzz you can almost get a contact high from watching. \"",

        "summary": "A wild tale of love and technology worthy of dateline unspooled recently in a british courtroom. Here's what happened: according to court documents, a teen's family pressured her to travel from their home in leeds to bangladesh for what was supposed to be a holiday. But shortly after the teen's arrival on july 3, 2016, per the bbc, she was told by her father that he had selected a husband for her — her cousin. The plan was for the teen and her cousin to have a child, which would have enabled him to get a british visa, reports the telegraph. But the teen, then 18, had a plan of her own. She alerted a boyfriend her parents were unaware she had back in the uk to her situation using whatsapp. The boyfriend went to the west yorkshire police, and the girl and her sister also reached out to the british high commission and communicated her location using screenshots of the phone's location settings, per a police press release. British officials in bangladesh worked with local authorities to rescue her and bring her back to the uk. The court heard testimony that the father had threatened to slit the teen's throat and \" chop her up \" if she refused the marriage, per the telegraph. Though the bbc reports authorities intervened days before the wedding was to occur, her parents were arrested and after a three-week trial found guilty of forced marriage and one count of using violence or coercion to force a marriage. They will be sentenced june 18 and could face considerable time in prison. The boyfriend, meanwhile, is being hailed as a hero and a bit of a prince charming to boot. \" you will be ok princess, \" he wrote to her during the ordeal. \" you will be home safe and in my arms and i am never going to let you go again. \"",

A march news conference seemed to lend credence to the claim, with then-antiquities minister mamdouh el-damaty announcing that analysis of radar scans of tut's burial chamber carried out in november revealed two hidden rooms and indicated the presence of metal and organic materials; a scan planned for the end of march was to reveal the dimensions of the rooms and the thickness of the walls. But weeks later, there is contention rather than answers. A three-day tutankhamun grand egyptian museum conference ended sunday with a forum that grappled over the scans. Reeves continued to defend his stance: \" i was looking for the evidence that would tell me that my initial reading was wrong, but i didn't find any evidence to suggest that. I just found more and more indicators. \" another former antiquities minister, zahi hawass, took an opposite position, saying \" the project wasn't done scientifically at all. \" further, he argued that he is unaware of any previous discovery that was actually made in egypt via radar scans, reports ahram online, which says \" most \" in attendance sided with hawass. He's calling for the hiring of an autonomous committee to take over the investigation, per afp. Khaled el-anani, who became antiquities minister a week after that march announcement, says that until he is \" 100 % sure there is a cavity behind the wall, \" he will not allow drilling at the site.

            "Charles krupa / ap republican sen. Scott brown of shakes hands with supporters during his re-election campaign kick-off event in worcester, massachusetts, jan. 19, 2012. From its start, the race for ted kennedy's old senate seat seemed destined to be one of most expensive political battles in massachusetts history. Challenger elizabeth warren, bank-scolding darling of the left, and scott brown, the tea party pinup who swept into office in early 2010 to strip president obama of his congressional supermajority, are both candidates of national stature. It's a rare and precious red seat in a blue state. Nothing less than control of the senate may hang in the balance. And so the money has poured in. Last week, warren raised more than $ 1 million in 24 hours, a feat brown pulled off three days running during his first bid; each raised huge amounts, $ 5.7 million and $ 3.2 million respectively, in the final quarter of 2011. The bay overfloweth, and that's before you start counting the money being spent by third-party groups. The league of conservation voters and the league of women voters have combined to spend some $ 3 million on issue ads that are critical of brown.

        "summary": "How does a city jump from being america's seventh-largest to its fifth? in the case of san antonio, by grabbing the land around it. The texas city is considering annexing as many as 66 square miles of land around it, a move that would boost its population by 200,000, to 1.6 million residents, and allow it to hopscotch above philadelphia and phoenix in the population rankings. The move is designed with a different figure in mind: tax revenue. Estimates from the city's planning agency suggest that within two decades, the added areas ( currently part of unincorporated bexar county, as per my san antonio ) would produce an extra $ 77 million in revenue, even after the additional expense of providing services to those residents is considered. A dec. 4 vote by the san antonio city council gave the green light to a fiscal analysis of the move. It certainly wouldn't be the first time san antonio has tacked on some land, reports the wall street journal: in 1980 it measured 262 square miles, compared to today's 486. Annexing three of the proposed five areas under consideration would take four years: those three will be studied through next december, when a city council vote is penciled in; if it votes in favor of the annexation ( which the journal sees as likely ), full annexation would take three more years, during which residents of the affected areas would not yet pay city taxes, reports the san antonio business journal. As one resident of an area being eyed tells the journal, \" no one ever wants to pay more taxes. One of the selling points of this community is that you live close to city amenities, but you get to pay reduced taxes. \" bexar county only levies a property tax. ( an even more unusual annexation flop had canadians eyeing this island. )",

Now officials are investigating the cause of the accident, which occurred about 20 miles northwest of charlotte, usa today reports. According to the sheriff, the boy's father had been using a backhoe to dig near where the children were playing; he reportedly placed the first 911 call. \" there were several thousand pounds of dirt on top of them, \" the sheriff told the observer.

The 52-year-old mountain climber and engineer from butler, pa., had been repeating his 2007 ascent of the 14,692-foot mountain in the swiss alps in order to recreate a collage of pictures when he fell to his death on monday, family members tell usa today. Police say harper had been descending alone on a steep, icy trail covered in snow drifts when he fell almost 500 feet. Harper — one of more than 500 people who've died on the mountain since 1865, per climbing magazine — \" had made it to the top and was coming down, \" his mother says. \" they told me it was icy, and the wind came up. \" a helicopter was needed to retrieve harper's body, which will be cremated in switzerland. Harper's wife, beth, who was vacationing with her husband, will then take his ashes home to america, but the hope is that they ' ll one day return. \" it has been in both their wills. When beth passes away, their ashes will be put together and spread on the matterhorn, \" harper's mother says. ( lost remains of matterhorn climbers were recently found. )",

            "July 14, 2015 - to celebrate today's 150th anniversary of the matterhorn's first ascent, we present 10 fun facts about europe's most famous summit. 1. At 4,478 meters ( 14,692 feet ), the matterhorn is only western europe's 12th-highest peak, but it is taller than mt. Whitney, the highest summit in the lower 48 of the u.s., by about 187 feet. 2. The matterhorn straddles two countries, switzerland and italy, and has three common names. The german name matterhorn derives from the words for \" meadow \" and \" peak. \" the italian name ( cervino ) and french ( cervin ) likely originated with the latin word for forest, silva, though some believe it comes from the italian and french words for \"deer. \" 3. The first ascent on july 14, 1865, from the swiss side of the mountain, ended a race that lasted nearly a decade and came down to the wire, with rivals on the italian side poised only 1,250 feet below the top when edward whymper and michel croz first reached the summit. In order to ensure his rivals knew they were beaten, whymper rather unsportingly shouted at the italian team from the top and hurled rocks to make a clatter. \"the italians turned and fled, \" whymper wrote in his famed book scrambles amongst",

It bears more than 17,000 signatures as of this writing, ostensibly from those who agree with the petition's goal: \" we need to drink the red liquid from the cursed dark sarcophagus in the form of some sort of carbonated energy drink so we can assume its powers and finally die. \" the head of egypt's supreme council for antiquities was actually explicit in stating no curse befell the team that opened the sarcophagus, which was found to have a crack that resulted in the liquid sewage within. Cnet reports the comments, \" aka the reason why people signed the petition, are definitely worth the price of entry. \" \" innes mck \" started the petition and wrote the following when it hit 10,000 signatures: \" thank you so much for all ur deep and personal reasons for wanting to drink the cursed mummy milkshake, i swear i will keep fighting to allow you to sup. \" among the reasons given for signing: \" thirsty, \" writes one person. Live science actually asked a microbiologist what would happen if someone consumed the red liquid and, shocker, rolf halden said it's not a good idea. That's because the liquid is likely a stew of viruses and bacteria, and some bacteria could have formed \" endospores, \" which have the ability to survive for millennia. If anyone is crazy enough to actually do it, sterilizing the liquid first is a must, he says. ( this egyptian coffin was dowdy, but the inside was astonishing. )",

        "summary": "Earlier this month, the supreme court ruled in favor of the trump administration on one facet of the president's travel ban — but that may all be moot now, with reports filtering in that the ban on travelers from six muslim-majority countries may now be supplanted by country-specific restrictions. Sources tell the new york times the restrictions, which could take effect sunday, came after a 90-day review by the dhs, and that constraints for affected nations could include everything from tighter visa controls to an outright travel ban. Sources tell the wall street journal these restrictions are based on each country's security threat, as well as adherence to other criteria. \" the trump administration will ensure that the people who travel to the united states are properly vetted and those that don't belong here aren't allowed to enter, \" a department rep says. It's not clear how many, or which, countries made the list. The journal reports 17 nations were originally under dhs review for not meeting us standards, but about half of those have reportedly since complied. Nations with restrictions would need to make changes acceptable to the us before restrictions are eased. For example, they might have to tell the us about all people known or believed to be terrorists. The seven countries in trump's original travel ban included iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria, and yemen; iraq was removed from the list after it enhanced its travel screening. Trump — who tweeted after london's recent terror attack that the us needs a \" far larger, tougher, and more specific \" travel ban — still apparently needs to give the ok to the new plan.",

His mom attributed his issues to strong meds he was taking to ease severe shoulder pain. Even though he was so young to be at such an advanced stage of the disease, mckee notes sash played football for 16 years. \" we're finding over and over that it's the duration of exposure to football that gives you a high risk for cte, \" she tells the times. \" certainly, 16 years is a high exposure. \" as deadspin puts it, sash's brain \" was just as injured as his shoulders. \" ( a 25-year-old football player had the \" worst cte \" a doctor had ever seen in someone so young. )",
