They're called machias seal and north rock, and the islands themselves aren't of much use to any creatures other than puffins, explains maclean's. The problem is that the water around them, called the \" gray zone, \" is flush with lobsters, and tensions are rising between lobstermen from the two countries. It's been especially bad lately because lobster prices are rising. \"somebody is going to get killed, \" says the chair of the maine lobster zone council. \" we've had bad years in the past and got lucky, but this is the worst year i've ever seen. \" both maclean's and the cbc explain that locals on both sides of the border have mostly kept things under control for years. ( in one high-profile exception, an american lost his thumb in equipment eight years ago while \" jostling \" with a canadian over territory, notes maclean's. ) this year, however, outsiders from nova scotia have moved in to fish the waters, too, and they're reportedly ignoring long-held rules about who gets to work when. \" when you've got canadian guys feuding with other canadian guys, on top of us — that's a flare-up, too, \" a maine lobsterman tells the cbc.

The new york times reports that efforts are \" quietly \" underway to get something done on background checks and illegal trafficking. Joe manchin and pat toomey, the co-sponsors of the background-check bill that got yanked last week, say they have been talking to colleagues to get rid of some objectionable loopholes. One potential compromise would allow a person who lives in a rural area to sell a weapon to someone without having to find a sporting goods store to facilitate. A separate initiative to crack down on illegal trafficking, which includes buying a weapon for someone who can't legally own one, is being spearheaded by democrat kirsten gillibrand and republicans kelly ayotte and chuck grassley. The latter two voted against last week's measure, and ayotte in particular has been taking criticism back home in new hampshire. That might get worse: gun-control supporters are working on a national campaign to put pressure on those in the \" no \" camp. Meanwhile, a new quinnipiac poll in pennsylvania gives republican toomey the highest approval ratings he's ever had: 48 %, reports slate.",

According to critics, the film itself is a treasure. Here's what they're saying: with \" grand sweep and dreamy energy, \" it's \" the kind of grand adventure epic few people know how to make anymore, \" writes stephanie zacharek at time. She applauds not only gray and cinematographer darius khondji, but also the actors.

Hunnam is an \" implosive force \" but \" everyone brings their a-game to gray's haunting and visionary film, a potent provocation that gets under your skin, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. The film \" thrums with exotic adventure \" — and though gray's \" tread is softer, more classical \" than that of francis coppola in apocalypse now, \" the impact is every bit as powerful. \" there's an \" old-world meticulousness \" to the scenes shot in england. But as fawcett enters the amazon, gray's filmmaking becomes \" more abstract, a drifting impermanence, as if the director were trying to capture … the wide, beautiful unknowability of existence, \" bilge ebiri writes at village voice.

Except, that is, for a little squiggle in new york and pennsylvania. So what on earth could make a mountain chain bend like that? geologists think they've figured out the answer, and it's not so much \" on earth \" as \" in earth \" — namely, an underground volcanic rock about 60 miles by 280 miles in dimension.

In a new study in the journal earth and planetary science letters, she and the other researchers make their case: when the chain was forming 300 million years ago thanks to the collision of tectonic plates, that massive rock wouldn't budge, and the mountain sprang up around it.

Researchers from the college of new jersey and the university of rochester now know what caused that bend — a dense, underground block of rigid, volcanic rock forced the chain to shift eastward as it was forming millions of years ago. According to cindy ebinger, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the university of rochester, scientists had previously known about the volcanic rock structure under the appalachian mountain chain. \"what we didn't understand was the size of the structure or its implications for mountain-building processes, \" she said. The findings have been published in the journal earth and planetary science letters. When the north american and african continental plates collided more than 300 million years ago, the north american plate began folding and thrusting upwards as it was pushed westward into the dense underground rock structure — in what is now the northeastern united states. The dense rock created a barricade, forcing the appalachian mountain range to spring up with its characteristic bend.

            "Better understanding of marcellus shale could inform decisions on hydrofracking in appalachian mountain chain the 1500 mile appalachian mountain chain runs along a nearly straight line from alabama to newfoundland — except for a curious bend in pennsylvania and new york state. Researchers from the college of new jersey and the university of rochester now know what caused that bend — a dense, underground block of rigid, volcanic rock forced the chain to shift eastward as it was forming millions of years ago. According to cindy ebinger, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the university of rochester, scientists had previously known about the volcanic rock structure under the appalachian mountain chain. \"what we didn't understand was the size of the structure or its implications for mountain-building processes, \" she said. The findings have been published in the journal earth and planetary science letters. When the north american and african continental plates collided more than 300 million years ago, the north american plate began folding and thrusting upwards as it was pushed westward into the dense underground rock structure — in what is now the northeastern united states. The dense rock created a barricade, forcing the appalachian mountain range to spring up with its characteristic bend. The research team — which also included margaret benoit, an associate professor of physics at the college of new jersey, and graduate student melanie crampton",

        "summary": "How is it possible for a man to end up in the belly of a snake? that's the question many were asking after the body of 25-year-old akbar salubiro was found intact inside a 23-foot reticulated python sunday in indonesia. ( a highly graphic video shows the body's recovery. ) here's a look at the science: first comes death. Though python attacks on humans are extremely rare, it's not difficult for a reticulated python, the world's longest snake, to kill a man. Pythons wrap themselves around their victims, crushing them. Constricting snakes like pythons don't actually suffocate their victims but kill by cutting off blood flow, which is a quicker death, reports national geographic. \" the heart literally doesn't have enough strength to push against the pressure, \" vertebrate ecologist scott boback tells the magazine. But the bbc explains experts previously thought doing anything more than killing a man might be too difficult. Rather than chew, the snakes ' flexible jaw ligaments allow them to swallow prey whole. But when it comes to humans, \" the restricting factor is... Shoulder blades because they are not collapsible, \" says one expert. Indeed, the bbc points out size was a problem in a slightly different case, in 2005, when a burmese python tried to ingest an alligator; the snake burst. The bbc notes stories of man-eating pythons aren't new, but the tales typically come from remote areas short on a witness as trustworthy as the one present in this case — a cell phone. A local agricultural lecturer shares his theory with the jakarta post: that the attack was likely a result of deforestation due to palm-oil harvesting, which imperils the snakes ' \" natural food sources. \" read more on the attack here.",

But it's a supercomputer of all supercomputers obama is eyeing most enthusiastically, an \" exascale \" unit with the power to run 30 times faster than the existing fastest supercomputer.

Future uses could include creating personalized drugs and gaining access to \" the secrets of the human brain, \" reports wired. The president wants this uber-computer to operate at more than 1,000 petaflops; a computer running at 1 petaflop has the ability to perform 1 quadrillion arithmetic operations per second, per the executive order.

The ap reports more than 130 players sat, knelt, or raised fists for the national anthem during sunday's day games; last week it was six players. Players on numerous teams — including the dolphins, browns, patriots, broncos, saints, eagles, giants, chargers, and jaguars — knelt, according to deadspin. Protests came from stars like travis kelce, von miller, and lesean mccoy ( who called trump an \" asshole \" a day earlier ). \" there ain't no dividing us, \" the baltimore ravens'terrell suggs said. \" i guess we're all son-of-a-bitches. \" protesting players were met with a mix of boos and applause from fans. Three teams — the seahawks, titans, and steelers ( with the exception of us army veteran alejandro villanueva ) — stayed in the locker room or tunnel for the anthem. \" as a team, we have decided we will not participate in the national anthem, \" the new york times quotes the seahawks as saying in a statement. \" we will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country. \" an nfl executive says the teams will not be fined despite violating a league rule requiring they be on the sideline for the anthem. Singers of the national anthem in detroit and tennessee took a knee, and some miami dolphins players wore shirts reading #imwithkap during warm-ups. For his part, colin kaepernick tweeted a reminder that his protests were never about trump but about racial injustice in the us.",

He had been commissioned by the medicis, the most powerful family in florence, to build the chapels — a mausoleum for members of the family — but had to hide out after backing a popular revolt against their rule. \" i hid in a tiny cell, entombed like the dead medici above, \" he recalled after he was eventually pardoned by the medicis and completed the chapels. The room went undiscovered until 1975 — and now, for the first time, the public could be able to view it, the telegraph reports. Some of the sketches he left on the walls resemble the renaissance master's famous works, including parts of the sistine chapel, the local reports. Other doodles may have been left behind by workers on the medici chapels project. When custodians in 1975 happened upon a trap door underneath a wardrobe, which led to a narrow flight of stone stairs into the secret room, they found walls covered in mold and grime. But even then, the outlines of michelangelo's charcoal and chalk sketches of human figures could be seen. The walls were cleaned, but the room was closed to protect the art. Now, the director of the bargello museum, which manages the medici chapels says officials are \" working on making the secret room of michelangelo accessible. There's a plan underway to make the space safe for visitors. \" due to the narrow, steep stairs, only a small number of visitors will likely be allowed at a time. The director hopes to open the room to the public within three years. For now, those interested can take a virtual tour of the 23-foot-by-6.5-foot room online.

            "Anyone engaging in sex outside of marriage in the world's third-largest democracy could soon face up to five years in prison. Indonesia's highest court is deliberating whether to broaden existing law to make all casual sex illegal in the latest bid by conservative islamists in the country to revise a relatively secular legal code. A decision by the constitutional court is expected in december or early next year, with indications that the court is leaning toward enacting the tougher legislation. While adultery is currently punishable by up to nine months in prison, if the new law goes through it would make gay sexual relations illegal in indonesia for the first time. It has already received backlash from human rights organizations. \"this [ petition ] consists of discrimination towards all indonesians, \" bahrain, who like many indonesians goes by one name, told the court at a hearing in early october, reports the washington post. The director of advocacy at the legal aid center continued: \"women as well as men, and those of diverse sexual orientations. The center is one of several progressive advocacy organizations arguing against revising the constitution to ban sex outside of marriage. \" while it is the most populous muslim-majority country in the world, indonesia's legal code remains heavily based on dutch law as a result of nearly 350-years of dutch colonization.

For the first feat, he walked at a record-breaking 19-degree uphill angle on a wire hundreds of feet above the ground, crossing the chicago river from one skyscraper to another, the ap reports. For an encore, he completed a 94-foot walk between two skyscrapers blindfolded, making it across in just over a minute. At 543 feet from the ground, it was a record height for a blindfolded walk. Wallenda performed the stunts without safety equipment after city officials decided that the relevant safety laws didn't apply to \" elite \" performers, the chicago sun-times reports. Afterward, he called the steeper-than-expected 19-degree incline on the first walk \" doggone intimidating \" and said strong winds caused him to abandon plans to pause and take a selfie halfway across, reports the chicago tribune. The walks were aired live on the discovery channel, with a 10-second delay in case of a mishap. For his next stunt, wallenda says he wants to re-create his late great-grandfather's 1,200-foot walk across georgia's tallulah gorge — complete with headstands.",

Amidst the proliferation of smart devices, traffic lights have largely remained conventional, their colors changing based on preprogrammed timing that can go years without being adjusted. But there's a noteworthy exception, and it's located in pittsburgh. There, carnegie mellon university professor of robotics stephen smith's startup is being put to the test, and the results garnered since its 2012 implementation are encouraging. The surtrac system uses artificial intelligence ( ai ) to coordinate with other traffic lights via radar sensors and cameras at each light, reports ieee spectrum. It's estimated to have cut emissions by a fifth and idling time by more than 40 %; driving time is down 25 %. Unlike other smart systems being tested elsewhere, surtrac's is decentralized, and its website explains the approach like so: \" each intersection allocates its green time independently based on actual incoming vehicle flows, and then projected outflows are communicated to neighboring intersections to increase their visibility of future incoming traffic. \" popular mechanics reports the lights were first installed at nine intersections; they're now at 50, and will be going city-wide. There's not yet a timeline for exporting these ai traffic lights to other cities. But as cars themselves get smarter, they ' ll likely be talking to the traffic lights as well, and could be alerted to, say, a soon-to-change light.

Instead, he ended up dead, after falling 18 stories from his hotel balcony. Police last week released a report on the incident, which remains somewhat murky, in part because ochoa's wife told them three distinct stories. What they do know is that when they arrived around 2am, she was crying, scratched, and missing a fingernail; video of the second couple exiting the hilton palacio del rio indicated they weren't obviously injured, the san antonio express-news reports. What went down, version one: ochoa's unnamed wife agreed to the four-way sex, then changed her mind when the other couple showed up; they left, ochoa started assaulting her; then he walked outside and vanished. In version two, ochoa got in a fight with a member of the other couple; both that person and ochoa punched ochoa's wife when she tried to break it up. Again, the other couple left, ochoa went outside, and she never saw him again. Version three is essentially version one, except with ochoa's wife saying her husband went to the balcony in order to flee security, who knocked on their door. Those guards were the ones who spotted ochoa, who ksat describes as an area real estate agent, in the river below; police say his wife didn't realize he fell or died, and they documented no signs of struggle on the balcony.

Actor jonathan goldsmith appeared as the sophisticated, eccentric, and worldly pitchman for dos equis beer for nearly a decade. He's now promoting astral tequila, reports the ap. In a new ad ( watch it here ), the 78-year-old goldsmith nods at his dos equis days by raising a glass of tequila and saying, \" i told you i don't always drink beer \" ( a reference to his famed dos equis line: \" i don't always drink beer, but when i do, i prefer dos equis \" ). Adage digs in to the legality of the dos equis-referencing spot, with one lawyer saying astral is on a \" slippery slope \" but not likely to find itself in court over any sort of infringement. Adage also offers up this nugget: tequila is not goldsmith's professed drink of choice, or at least it wasn't in 2012 when he told the magazine he favored martinis and scotch when not consuming beer.

Curtis reeves has been charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of chad oulson, 43. He was denied bail at a hearing yesterday. \" elderly people are a little bit more vulnerable than adults, so what may give a younger person a black eye could mean a cracked skull for a septuagenarian — that's certainly a factor that may be figured in, \" says a retired florida prosecutor. Reeves has told police he was in fear of being attacked. Reeves'status as a former police officer and swat team chief could help or, just as easily, hurt his case, legal experts tell tampa bay times. His defense could argue that he has expert judgment on when to use deadly force, but prosecutors could counter that his decades of experience should have taught him how to de-escalate the situation. This isn't the first time reeves has clashed with a moviegoer over texting, reports the new york daily news. A woman has told prosecutors that she was at the same theater just a couple of weeks ago when a man she believes was reeves confronted her about using her phone and fetched the manager. She complied and put the phone away, but says she spotted reeves glaring at her after the movie. Friends and family members, meanwhile, remember oulson as a generous, funny man who was a devoted father and husband, cnn finds. The 7-year navy veteran, who was texting his toddler daughter when reeves confronted him, was on a date with his wife, who was shot through the hand by the bullet that killed husband. \" she's a wreck, \" a family friend says. \" i mean she just lost her husband, the father of her little girl over something that should have never happened. \"",

        "summary": "India is seeking damages from nestle after reports of excess lead in its popular maggi instant noodles sparked a nationwide recall, reuters reports. The claim, filed by a government commission that represents consumers, marks the first time india has pursued damages from a multinational corporation. Since early may, several state regulators have reported too much lead and msg in the noodles, and the country's main food safety regulator called all varieties of maggi noodles \" unsafe and hazardous \" for consumption, per the times of india. Nestle pulled them off the shelves friday but says the noodles are still safe. State regulators, who have semi-judicial powers, are expected to deliver a verdict by next week. It began last year when an officer with the food safety and drug administration in uttar pradesh, india's biggest state, had his team test maggi noodles, bloomberg reports. Their finding of msg and lead ( which nestle disputed ) has now created a crisis for the nation's food-regulation office, which is only seven years old. The scare has also spread to nepal and singapore, where authorities are testing pasta and noodles made by seven companies, including nestle. Maggi has suffered \" a serious hit, \" a brand expert says, adding that nestle \" was slow to react and uncommunicative in initial days. \" however, maggi has a large consumer base and \" people want this brand in their lives. \" nestle's global ceo paul bulcke says that \" we will do everything it takes, and are fully engaged with the authorities to clarify the situation. \"",

And that has left people wondering why prominent, longtime collaborators never spoke up. On monday, none other than meryl streep addressed that very question. \" not everybody knew, \" she writes in a statement to huffpo about the \" inexcusable \" behavior. She counts herself as among those who were in the dark. \" i did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts, \" she writes, adding that the women who have come forward are \" heroes. \" one of them, rose mcgowan, earlier declared, \" ladies of hollywood, your silence is deafening, \" per us weekly. Other developments: back and forth, and back: after jim rutenberg in the new york times wrote a column about weinstein's \" media enablers, \" sharon waxman of the wrap accused the times of being one of those enablers. She writes that the newspaper \" gutted \" a story she wrote about weinstein as a times reporter back in 2004, and she provides all the details.

When asked about the decision afterward, lorne michaels replied that it was a \" new york thing, \" opening himself up to critics who think the story is being buried by entertainment bigwigs.

One reporter recalls him shoving a colleague down steps when weinstein didn't like a question. Few allies: that temper and brutish behavior might be why seemingly nobody has his back amid the scandal, reports the los angeles times. The newspaper says the ill will goes back to weinstein's first oscar win for shakespeare in love, which his critics say \" was as much a credit to weinstein's costly and bitterly fought oscar campaign as to the film's merits. \" ( it beat saving private ryan. )",

All democrats and 13 republicans voted against the bill, giving it a 227-205 win. \" passing this bill is the single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, restore opportunity, and help these middle income families that are struggling, \" house speaker paul ryan says. The vote took place after trump met with house republicans, telling them, \" i love you. Go vote. \" the washington post explains the contents of the bill, which includes more than $ 1.4 trillion in tax cuts, reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 20 %, reduces taxes for the rich, and ultimately raises taxes on middle-income earners. The bill also reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four and gets rid of popular tax deductions, the new york times reports. The vote was held two weeks after the bill was introduced with little analysis or debate. Now senate republicans have to pass their own tax bill and work out the differences with the house bill. That will be easier said than done. Support for the senate bill is wavering, especially after a nonpartisan committee found that it would end up increasing taxes for low-income americans in 2021 and for everyone earning less than $ 75,000 a year in 2027. Not to mention it repeals part of obamacare. If the senate manages to pass its bill and rectify it with the house version, it would give trump the first major legislative achievement of his presidency.

The french revolution put an end to the brewing in the 1790s, but the reestablishment of the abbey in 1929 was followed, 23 years later, by its restart, though no longer at the abbey: consumerist reports the recipe was entrusted to a local brewer, who shared the royalties with the abbey. Now, it's made en masse... In an anheuser busch inbev factory that also churns out stella artois. And so in a move that's become somewhat typical of late, an american is suing. Henry vazquez is, appropriately enough, an optometrist bothered by what he sees on the label: the beer is branded as an \" abbey ale, \" and shows an image of the abbey bell tower. Vazquez's suit states that because the beer is represented as being abbey-brewed, the drink assumes it is \" thereby brewed in smaller quantities under the supervision of monks. \" not quite: the aforementioned belgian plant that now makes the beer has an annual capacity of 238 million gallons, and the suit alleges ab inbev has gone to \" great lengths to conceal \" the beer's mass-produced nature. Vazquez wants compensatory and punitive damages, and wants the company to set the record straight by admitting that neither monks nor an abbey play a role in leffe's current creation. Reuters points out his proposed class action lawsuit was filed friday in the same miami federal court where the company ended up agreeing to pay in excess of $ 20 million to beck's drinkers who were drinking beer not made in germany, but in st. Louis. ( this suit alleges coors light is not the taste of the rockies. )",

The bank informed the vikings if they didn't ok this change, it would simply flood the roofs of its towers, including its signage, with light to increase their visibility. It's also likely that wells fargo is desperate to make sure us bank isn't the only one being seen: the latter bank has what's believed to be a $ 220 million agreement with the stadium for the next 20 years to place its name on the stadium and splash its logo across the arena's roof, a prime positioning visible from airplanes.

The tens of thousands of emails pertain to 13 senior trump transition officials, including former national security adviser michael flynn, reports the ap; many include national security discussions about possible trump international aims as well as candid assessments of candidates for top posts. Langhofer said that a gsa official appointed by trump in may had assured the transition in june that any request for records from mueller's office would be referred to the transition's attorneys.

Transition officials signed agreements that warn them that materials kept on government servers are subject to monitoring, and there's no expectation of privacy.

A new study of 12 hospitals found they made an average of $ 30,500 more when a patient had preventable surgical complications, because insurers pay for the longer stays and extra care that ensue, the new york times reports. The researchers emphasize that they don't believe hospitals are deliberately screwing up to make money, but a system with an economic disincentive to make improvements is problematic. \" we said, ' whoa, we're working our tails off trying to lower complications, and the prize we're going to get is a reduction in profits, ' \" says one author of the study, published yesterday in the journal of the american medical association. The study analyzed 34,256 people who had surgery at the hospitals in 2010. Of those, about 5 % had preventable complications like blood clots and infections, and their median length of stay ( two weeks ) was four times longer than those without complications. The authors say insurers need to stop paying for preventable mistakes and offer bonuses for above-average care. Reforms are already under way, but \" 90 % of the country is still functioning in the world we describe in the paper, \" another study author tells npr. \" it's just more evidence that payment reform is key to health care reform. \"",

There were no significant amounts of drugs found in the 36-year-old actor's system, reports the los angeles times.

Stallone had a small amount of the pain killer hydrocodone in his system, but it did not contribute to his death, officials said. Sage's grandmother remained skeptical, saying that her grandson told her he was depressed and intended to overdose on drugs shortly before he was found dead last month in his california home. \" how do you suddenly have a heart attack at 36? i don't believe it, \" jackie stallone told the news. \" he was very depressed. \" jackie's daughter toni ann filiti, 48 — sylvester stallone's half sister — died over the weekend from lung cancer.",

Guy rubin tells wpbf that the photos show the boat's battery switch and ignition key in the off position, signaling that it was \" disabled intentionally, \" not by a storm. Rubin, who represents perry cohen's mother, says he doesn't want to be \" alarmist, \" but \" maybe they were abducted. Or maybe there was foul play because they had thousands of dollars ' worth of reels. \" perry and his friend austin stephanos, both 14, vanished after setting off from jupiter, fla., for a fishing trip last july and were never heard from again. \" why would they turn the engine and battery off? were they broken down? maybe there was a third person aboard, \" rubin says. Local boating experts, however, tell the palm beach post that it could easily be the case that the boys had simply turned the engine off to stop and fish, or turned the battery off to conserve power. The cohen and stephanos families have been at odds since the boys disappeared, people reports. The cohens filed a lawsuit earlier this week to block the release of austin's iphone to his family, arguing it could hold clues and that authorities should keep it until an impartial expert conducted a full examination. The phone has now been released to the stephanos family, which has promised to share any recovered information with the cohens. ( the norwegian ship captain who spotted the boys ' boat says it was an amazing stroke of luck. )",

Now the daily beast looks at an anti-lgbt legal group called liberty counsel that supported davis and spun the story in her favor — but the profile is none too flattering. \" at the end of the day, the liberty counsel is after political expediency, \" writes brandon ambrosino under the headline \" the shady group that played pope francis. \" attorneys mathew and anita staver, a husband-and-wife team, started the nonprofit in 1989 to give pro bono legal help to anyone \" dedicated to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family, \" says the liberty counsel website. That included davis, the county clerk who famously refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. After davis met the pope, mat staver told cbs that francis \" has been following the story of kim davis, \" but told time he only assumed francis knew her because \" her story has been published worldwide. \" liberty counsel has made other flubs, like claiming that a massive rally in peru was held in support of kim davis, when it was really a prayer rally from 2014. It has also supported gay conversion therapy discredited by science, and been labeled a hate group by the southern poverty law center. But mat staver refutes that, telling the orlando sentinel that critics will \" smear anyone who doesn't condone homosexuality. \" meanwhile, the once-small nonprofit has grown into a major organization that has 10 lawyers and raked in over $ 4 million in 2013.

The sugary drinks were linked to 133,000 deaths from type 2 diabetes, 45,000 from cardiovascular disease, and 6,450 from cancer in 2010.

The only country that fared worse was mexico, which reported 405 deaths per million adults. In fact, sugary drinks were blamed for 30 % of deaths in mexicans younger than 45. The study — based on national consumption trends, death rates, and sugar availability — finds sugary drinks lead to as many deaths per year as the flu, and study author dariush mozaffarian says cutting back should be a \" global priority, \" per livescience.

But rather than occupying a dark place in american history, the victims of the nation's single largest native american massacre — shoshone indians slaughtered in a daytime raid by united states cavalry — have largely been forgotten. Few know the story of the bear river massacre, reports the herald journal, and no one knows precisely where it took place, leading the idaho state historical society to commission the first survey of the area just north of preston in hopes of learning more. Since august of last year, archaeologists have employed three historic maps as well as geophysical and excavation techniques to pinpoint the exact site and the shoshone village, and they hope to erect plaques to commemorate the battlefield when they do. \" nobody knows about these events. They've been lost, and yet they're incredibly important, \" one of the lead archaeologists tells western digs. \" the shoshone probably ran out of ammunition, and they were overwhelmed by the california volunteers. \" the four-hour battle also claimed the lives of 23 soldiers. Witnesses described watching shoshone flee into the frozen bear river, where some drowned and others froze, while a baby was reportedly found the next day alive, perched high in a tree, in what looked to be a bid to protect it. So far a magnetic gradiometer has found a large, black square, \" suggestive of what a house floor might look like, \" one archaeologist says. That site will be excavated next month, in concert with the shoshone people; the results will be made public in november or december.

        "summary": "The gunman behind sunday's deadly rampage in houston has been identified as afghanistan veteran dionisio garza iii by abc13, which found a bag containing bullets and his personal papers at the scene. The bag, which held the 25-year-old's birth certificate and military discharge record, was turned over to police. According to the military record, garza was a sergeant who received several awards for his service in afghanistan. Garza's father tells kprc that while there has been no official confirmation yet that his son was the man killed in a shootout with police, his son had exhibited some troubling behavior recently and he believes \" it is a ptsd thing. \" more: garza's father says his son believed the us was on the brink of collapsing and had recently moved from california to texas to meet people who shared his anti-government beliefs. \" he was trying to get us all to go over there and, you know, go live in a compound, \" the father says. Wfaa reports that byron wilson, a man injured in the attack who was initially believed to be a suspect, was actually an armed good samaritan who tried to stop garza. Wilson was shot and critically injured but is expected to survive. Eugene linscomb, 56, was killed in the shooting rampage, which lasted around an hour and caused widespread panic and confusion. In addition to wilson, three bystanders and two police officers were injured. Paris nichols tells the houston chronicle that when garza shot linscomb in the head at the car wash he owns, he thought he would be next, and that his wife — who had been talking to linscomb — fell to the ground reciting the lord's prayer. He says garza said linscomb was the devil and told him, \" i ' m not going to kill y ' all, y ' all are christians. \" nichols says garza then went to his car to grab an ar-15 assault rifle, declaring that the world was coming to an end and shouting about jews, gays, and walmart. Nicolas latiolais, a 17-year-old boy scout, is being hailed as a hero who may have saved one shooting victim's life, abc13 reports. After seeing the wounded man in the street, latiolais used the man's vest as a tourniquet, got somebody to call 911, and stayed with him for 20 minutes until an ambulance arrived. Garza's father says he last spoke to him on saturday, the day before the shooting. \" he was rambling off about the economy collapsing, you know, \" he says. \" and that something was going to happen by monday",

We still don't know why, but the leading theories are that she tried to hire a managing editor without permission and that she complained about her pay. Does either justify the treatment she got? \" it's very hard for me not to suspect an element of masculine umbrage to this, a determination that abramson should not merely be let go, but also put in her place, \" writes mcardle. That is, it's hard not to blame this one on sexism. At the guardian, emily bell writes that women are angry over abramson's firing because it confirms a sad truth: \" that excellent performances are not enough. \" in this case, it apparently wasn't enough that abramson improved both the newspaper's journalism and its revenue, writes bell. Her problem was that \" she never became that mythical female boss who is assertive but not aggressive, nurturing but not mothering, not so strong that it bothers the men, but never weak like a woman. \" on the latter note, abramson's daughter posted an instragram photo of her mom practicing her \" badass new hobby \" — boxing.",

Today.com rounds up the head-scratchers that had people talking: worst management decision: the layout. Some of the winners appeared to be seated in siberia. It took ages for them to make their way to the stage, and it didn't help that the tables were so close together they often had to take a winding path. Robin wright actually broke out into a run to accept her award. Weirdest trend: the speeches. No one seemed prepared, least of all jacqueline bisset, whose rambling acceptance speech was the craziest of the night. She later explained that she was caught off-guard, having expected her category to be announced later. Also: there was quite a bit of swearing, including a \" yeah b ----! \" from aaron paul that the censors didn't feel the need to bleep. Strangest moment: diane keaton's song. She sang a kids'song — \" make new friends, but keep the old \" — during the tribute to woody allen, and it was especially strange since she launched into it directly after a hefty portion of her speech had gotten bleeped out. The 3 biggest digs: 2 onstage, 1 offstage. Tina fey mocked taylor swift. Presenter jim carrey tweaked shia labeouf's plagiarism scandal by quoting an 18th century actor and then joking, \" i believe it was shia labeouf who said that. \" and on twitter, mia farrow's son ronan slammed his ( supposed ) father: \" missed the woody allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after annie hall? \" most offensive media comment: a parkinson's \" fun fact. \" during e!'s online red carpet live stream, they used a headline graphic reading \" fun fact, \" fox news reports.

Brooks, who is running in the republican primary for the alabama senate seat vacated by jeff sessions, opens his ad with the sound of gunfire and the words \" june 14: a bernie sanders supporter fires on republican congressmen. \" the ad then shows a member of the \" liberal media \" asking brooks if the shooting changed his view on the \" gun situation in america. \" brooks says it hasn't and won't. The 30-second spot, titled \" second amendment, \" was released on monday and was immediately criticized by members of scalise's staff, the washington post reports. The congressman's chief of staff, brett horton, tweeted that the ad made his \" stomach turn. \" and in an email, scalise spokesman chris bond wrote, \" i guess some people have their own ideas about what's appropriate, don't they? \" scalise was left in critical condition following the shooting, but on monday he videoconferenced with congressional colleagues for the first time, new york magazine reports.",

The tech company is investigating the apparent incident, peta says on a blog. Peta wants google to match its own donation of $ 1,000 to a spaying-and-neutering group in chile. As news.com.au reports, you can actually see the photo sequence yourself by viewing the street view images of meza bell in santiago ( the new york post has the potentially-disturbing link ). In the images taken by the car, the dog does seem to move after being hit, but \" it's hard to tell whether this is a last struggle of life or whether he is just laying in the sun and having a stretch, \" writes james billington.

On top of that, tillerson will travel to russia later in the month. \" no matter how you spin it, this is unfortunate symbolism, \" a veteran european diplomat tells reuters, referring to the perception that the trump white house is anti-nato and pro-russia. The state department didn't provide an official reason for tillerson's decision to skip the april 5-6 meeting in brussels, notes cnn, but it appears he's opting instead to be in florida for trump's meeting with chinese leader xi jinping on april 6-7. Tillerson will, however, see foreign ministers from nato in washington on wednesday in a meeting about the islamic state, notes politico. The semiannual planning session in brussels will be more focused on nato itself, and tillerson will be represented there by under secretary of state for political affairs tom shannon, who served under president obama. After the china meeting in florida, tillerson will attend a g7 summit in italy on april 10-11, and the state department says he ' ll visit moscow after that. Democrats were quick to pounce on the decision — \" a grave error, \" says one house lawmaker — and abc news rounds up their criticisms.

        "summary": "About 50,000 years ago, giant megafauna — such as a \" 1,000-pound kangaroo \" and \" volkswagen-sized tortoise \" — roamed australia, phys.org reports. Those animals started disappearing around the same time the first humans set foot in the area, likely after arriving aboard boats from indonesia. Now, for the first time, researchers believe they've found evidence that humans — not climate change — were a major cause of those extinctions. That evidence comes in the form of partially burned eggshells belonging to the genyornis newtoni, a 500-pound, 7-foot-tall, flightless bird. \" we consider this the first and only secure evidence that humans were directly preying on now-extinct australian megafauna, \" lead researcher gifford miller says in a statement. Miller published his findings friday in nature communications. Phys.org reports there was significant evidence the fragments from the cantaloupe-sized eggs found at more than 200 sites around australia were cooked by humans for consumption and not burned by wildfires. They appeared to have been burned on just one side, and shell fragments showed drastic differences in how much they'd been heated, according to the washington post. \" the conditions are consistent with early humans harvesting genyornis eggs, cooking them over fires, and then randomly discarding the eggshell fragments in and around their cooking fires, \" miller says, per phys.org. If humans were in fact eating the eggs, that would significantly hamper the bird's reproduction, the study finds. ( scientists also recently figured out what killed the real king kong. )",

One resident tells wkbn he was outside with his dogs last week when one such \" zombie \" followed him to his door. The raccoon \" would stand up on his hind legs, \" show its teeth, then \" fall over backward and go into almost a comatose condition, \" the man says. \" he'd come out of it, walk around, and then he'd do the same thing again. \" though rabies can cause similar, uncharacteristic behavior, experts suspect the raccoons are suffering from distemper, a viral disease that affects canines and other animals such as foxes and skunks, per live science. Ohio's department of natural resources has been euthanizing raccoons believed to be infected with the disease, which causes convulsions and paralysis, erases a raccoon's fear of humans, and often sees the nocturnal animals venture out in daylight. A rep says distemper \" can be devastating to the population \" but less susceptible raccoons will help the population balloon again. The problem isn't isolated to youngstown, though: autopsies performed this year on raccoons in cook county, ill., showed 43 % had distemper, nbc chicago reports.

Those friendly kiosks and stores have fallen off by a stunning 94 % since 1998, the worst decline of all business categories in the us census. \" the photo business is dead, \" says dae kim, whose happy photo in queens, ny, still offers one-hour processing. But things looked rosy back in 1968, when color photography became popular and us entrepreneur preston fleet started fotomat, bloomberg reports. Americans loved dropping off photos at those kiosks before going shopping, so much so that 1,800 locations popped up within two years and fotomat eventually got listed on the new york stock exchange. But in the 1980s, minilabs appeared with on-site processing ( fotomat shipped its film out ), and big retailers like supermarkets and pharmacies muscled in with photo-processing as a loss leader to draw in customers. Then digital cameras and smartphones came along and killed the party for all concerned. But die-hard photo-processors still argue that digital photos are more liable to vanish over time than hard copies. And some photographers have returned to film photography for various reasons — like wanting to be different or get that grainy look, the bbc reports. \" the most reassuring scenario i've noticed recently is the emergence of older men and women wanting to use film again, \" says charlie abbiss, co-founder of film's not dead. \" they want the negatives, the envelope, the little prints, and something to hold onto for years to come. \"",

The 29-year-old's body was found last monday, in a crime that the times of london reports has raised the fears of female runners in the country. Daval went missing on a saturday morning run on oct. 28. When she didn't return, her husband alerted the police, and the local reports her body was found badly burned in a wooded area near the town in the east of france. The bbc describes her remains as \" covered in foliage. \" it's been determined that daval was strangled, and a source says there is no sign of sexual assault. Daval's mother spoke to the crowd on sunday, saying, \" you are making alexia into a strong symbol, one of the freedom for all women to enjoy running and to live. \" the times reports that in the past decade, seven women have been murdered while on runs in various parts of france; none of the women had any connection with her male attacker, six of whom have been convicted. Says the deputy mayor of daval's town, \" it gives us the shivers to know that there is a killer in the wild. \" ( french police may have a break in a notorious cold case. )",
