He vowed to take action against the illinois-based small arms company for its ar-50a1 rifle ad, which reads \" a work of art \" along the top. A gallery director in florence noted that the law forbids distorting a work of art's aesthetic value: \" in this case, not only is the choice in bad taste but also completely illegal. \" \" it is an act of violence towards the sculpture; like taking a hammer to it and perhaps, actually, even worse, \" said a city councilor in florence, reports the guardian. But italian art critic philippe daverio pooh-poohed the uproar, comparing armalite's ad to cheeky images of a mustached mona lisa: \" certain cultural icons belong to everyone and no one; to humanity in general, \" he said. If true, that's good news for armalite, which has another ad showing its ar-301a on a museum wall between american gothic and the mona lisa — pointed at mona lisa's head, the wire reports.",

The phrase \" once in a blue moon \" refers to something that is rare, and it was once used this way in the maine farmers ' almanac when describing the third full moon in the rare season that has four ( typically, there is only one full moon a month, thus a three-month season will have three full moons ). But in 1946, sky &amp; telescope magazine published an article that misunderstood this definition, instead calling the second full moon in a calendar month a blue moon. And it is indeed fairly rare: it happens once every 2.7 years or so. This has become the modern definition and is used to describe friday's full moon, which is the second this month ( the first was on july 2 ); it ' ll be the last of its kind until january 2018. Interestingly, while the most recent blue moon according to this modern definition occurred at the end of august of 2012, the most recent blue moon according to the original definition occurred more recently, in august of 2013, when the full moon was the third of four that summer. As for the blue moon on july 31, while it may seem to last all night, it's technically an \" instantaneous event \" that occurs at 6: 43am edt on the nose, reports space.com.

That's the message the california department of health is sending to consumers, after identifying at least 60 cases over the past four years of state residents getting mercury poisoning from such creams, the san francisco chronicle reports. In a public health advisory yesterday, it revealed that analysts had found creams from mexico designed to lighten skin, fade blemishes, and treat acne contained as much as 200,000 times the legal limit of mercury. The problem isn't a new one. The fda and various state health departments have in recent years issued similar warnings, sounding the alarm about creams not just from mexico, but from many countries. It warned customers to look for ingredients like \" mercurous chloride, \" \" calomel, \" \" mercuric, \" \" mercurio, \" or plain old \" mercury. \" the products use mercury, health canal explains, because it suppresses the production of melanin in skin, lightening it. But it takes a long time for absorbed inorganic mercury to leave the body, so repeated use can raise the risk of harmful effects. Indeed, the chronicle notes that a 16-year-old who used one such cream to treat his acne ended up in intensive care for nearly a month due to poisoning.",

Fandango users got hit with a \" site maintenance \" message, while movie tickets customers received an error warning. Imax, meanwhile, waited patiently until after the halftime show to start its selling spree, but also had problems and had to funnel people to the other two sites. Meanwhile, buzz about the movie was one for the cosmos, making it hard to find a non-star wars-related tweet for a couple of hours after the trailer aired. The clip — which business insider called \" glorious \" and the san jose mercury news deemed \" spectacular with surprises \" — blasted plenty of computer-generated special effects off the screen, as well as close-ups of newbies john boyega as finn, the franchise's new hero, and daisy ridley as female scavenger rey ( ridley got emotional herself watching the trailer ). And, to everyone's great pleasure, there was a han solo-chewie appearance, as well as a rumor-busting interaction between solo and princess leia, the mercury news notes. See the full trailer below.

These \" cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock, and dust roughly the size of a small town \" ( as described by nasa ) literally stink to high heaven, according to scientists at switzerland's university of bern. One comet does, anyway: researchers analyzed the \" perfume \" of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko and said that its bo is apparently a combo of \" rotten eggs, horse urine, formaldehyde, bitter almonds, alcohol, vinegar, and a hint of sweet ether, \" the ap reports. \" if you could smell the comet, you would probably wish that you hadn't, \" reads a blog post on the european space agency site. The scientists were able to surmise what the comet would smell like by examining the gas emitted by the \" coma, \" the comet's head, phys.org reports. Luckily, instead of a squeamish human, a mass spectrometer aboard the space probe rosetta was assigned the task of parsing out the perfumed molecules of 67p, including ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, and \" the pungent, suffocating ( odor ) of formaldehyde, \" notes the esa post. The probe caught up to the comet in august after chasing it nearly 4 billion miles; it will be sending its philae robot lander onto the comet proper on nov. 12, nasa reports. And it appears the comet's odoriferous odyssey is just beginning: the lead scientist on the project says that as 67p gets closer to the sun, it will start stinking up the cosmos even more.

        "summary": "The drawn-out saga involving the lawsuits against trump university gained a new wrinkle with a new york times probe that reveals students who took his real estate classes were coerced into giving their instructors positive reviews — with those reviews perhaps serving as \" a central component of a business model … that deceived consumers into handing over thousands of dollars with tantalizing promises of riches, \" as the paper puts it. A review of hundreds of legal files, plus interviews with ex-students and instructors, suggests pressure to make those reviews sing, in addition to what the paper calls \" unusual practices, \" such as not clearly offering anonymity on the forms and requesting the surveys in exchange for graduation certificates. Why this revelation could be critical: the glowing reviews have, as of late, served as trump's main ammunition against the claims of fraud. He has referred to the surveys as \" beautiful statements \" that show a 98 % level of satisfaction. There's even a website with thousands of positive evaluations to back him up. But ex-students say their praise came only under duress. \" i finally gave in, \" says one former student who initially gave his teacher a bad score but changed it after a trump u employee kept badgering him with phone calls. Another says an assigned \" mentor \" stood over him as he filled out his form, while a third says he was guilted into rating his teacher highly because the teacher basically begged him to. \" it's absolutely a con, \" that ex-student, 76, says. A trump lawyer says it's \" completely implausible to suggest that the 10,000 reviews from the students and their guests were the result of pressure or coercion. \" the last rating by the bbb in 2010, meanwhile, gave trump u a d-minus, per the hill.",

She's the third central illinois victim; the fourth was from chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin k administered via iv to stabilize the blood's clotting ability. The treatment is effective if initiated before excessive bleeding occurs, per the american council on science and health.

Instead of heading to muldoon, the driver said he had to get something from another car and drove to the area of 36th avenue and turnagain street, where they were stopped by road construction. A construction worker in the area later remembered schneider, the victim and the suv when police asked about them. Schneider then stopped the suv on 36th east of wisconsin street, and asked the victim to get out while he loaded items into the vehicle. Once she approached the rear of the vehicle, sarber wrote, schneider \"full on tackled \" her, shoving her to the ground.

        "summary": "The question of who owns a particular chunk of a famed meteorite is heading to federal court with the filing of a lawsuit and countersuit, sf gate reports. It all started billions of years ago with the fukang meteorite slammed into china's gobi desert. Fast-forward to the year 2000: when the meteorite was discovered and collectors began acquiring slices of it. Among them was stephan settgast, currently of california, who says he bought his 220-pound piece in 2004. In 2014, according to court documents, settgast agreed to sell it to lawrence stifler and mary mcfadden of massachusetts for $ 425,000. And then it all went bad. Settgast says the couple violated the conditions of the sale by planning to show it in their rock museum. They say not showing the meteorite was never a condition of the sale and suggest that settgast got \" seller's remorse \" after learning he might have undervalued it. And, they allege, that remorse manifested in what they call the \" outrageous act \" of settgast stealing back the rock from the studio of a pair of kansas rock polishers who spent two years preparing the stone for the buyers, per nbc news. After all, the rock polishers did tell settgast the meteorite could fetch up to $ 1 million ( which, documents point out, would bump up their 5 % fee to $ 50,000 ). How the alleged theft of the gold-flecked meteorite actually went down is unclear. Settgast filed a suit in february alleging breach of contract. Stifler, mcfadden, and darryl pitt, the meteorite expert who brokered the deal, countersued last month. Local authorities in kansas say they are going to hang back on pursuing settgast for theft until a federal judge determines who owns the meteorite. \" this isn't a typical theft, \" miami county undersheriff tells nbc. ( no one noticed this meteor the size of a large living room plowing into the earth. )",

In one peculiar moment, kellyanne conway knelt on the couch to take a candid picture, her heels touching the cushions. Given the internet's voracious appetite for memes related to conway and the trump administration at large, the cringe-worthy moment was instantly spotlighted. Let's break this one down a little bit. It's really weird that conway would choose to so casually sit like this during such a seemingly ceremonious meeting.

            "On feb. 27, president donald trump met with several leaders of historically black universities and colleges at the oval office. In one peculiar moment, kellyanne conway knelt on the couch to take a candid picture, her heels touching the cushions. Given the internet's voracious appetite for memes related to conway and the trump administration at large, the cringe-worthy moment was instantly spotlighted. Let's break this one down a little bit. It's really weird that conway would choose to so casually sit like this during such a seemingly ceremonious meeting.

He also revived his birther criticism of rival ted cruz, which he has previously used to suggest the texas senator is ineligible to run for president. \" rafael! straight out of the hills of canada! \" he declared, referring to cruz by his given name and the country of his birth. The republican front-runner and most of his rivals in both parties were out campaigning saturday across the northeastern states holding primaries on tuesday: pennsylvania, delaware, maryland, rhode island, and connecticut.",

        "summary": "The ship bound for rome sunk in 1bc and was first discovered off the coast of greece in 1900. And yet the antikythera shipwreck is still providing new discoveries. The guardian reports an expedition to the site last month turned up a silver tankard, a human bone, and much more. Perhaps most exciting: the arm of a bronze statue and evidence that the remains of at least seven bronze statues are still buried there. Previous bronze statues found at the antikythera shipwreck were dated to the 4th century bc. Bronze statues from that time period are extremely rare, with only about 50 known in the world, according to gizmodo. National geographic reports that based on the positioning of the fingers, the newly discovered arm may belong to a statue modeled on a philosopher. Recovering the rest of the statue — and the others at the site — won't be easy. The antikythera shipwreck is 180 feet underwater on a slope and has been buried by boulders from a succession of earthquakes starting in the 4th century ad. It will take a lot of time and money to move the boulders, recover the statues, and reconstruct them. Also discovered in last month's expedition was a mysterious bronze disc that the dive team originally thought could be a missing component of the famous antikythera mechanism. The mechanism, often called an \" ancient computer, \" could predict eclipses and the movements of various heavenly bodies and was discovered at the site. However, x-rays of the disc show it's engraved with a bull and was likely a piece of decoration for a statue or the ship itself. The next expedition to the antikythera shipwreck is scheduled for spring 2018. ( an odd item was found at the site in 2016. )",

The film by luca guadagnino, adapted from the novel by andre aciman, has a 96 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes.

The \" timeless \" coming-of-age tale \" acknowledges the purity and sculptural beauty of youth \" but adds plenty of erotic tension.

The rabbs ' fringe-limbed tree frog wasn't even discovered until 2005 when scientists were attempting to rescue specimens of any amphibian they could before a deadly chytrid fungal infection hit panama. According to national geographic, toughie made it out of panama, but it's estimated that the chytrid fungus killed up to 85 % of all amphibians left behind in his natural habitat. He had lived in isolation at the garden since 2008. A cause of death is unknown, but toughie was believed to be at least 12 years old. In his final years, toughie became a \" symbol of the extinction crisis. \" his photo was projected onto st. Peter's basilica, and he was visited by film directors and race car drivers. \" a lot of people were moved to tears when they saw him, \" a photographer who worked with toughie says. \" when you have the very last of something it's a special deal. \" while some scientists are holding out hope for the rabbs'tree frog, it's likely toughie was the last, scientific american reports.

        "summary": "Sign of the times? several hundred pacific walruses began amassing on an island off alaska's northwest coast in the first week of august in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \" haulout. \" the culprit appears to be shrinking arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the chukchi sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \" when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that, \" fish and wildlife rep andrea medeiros tells alaska public media. For the past several years, a barrier island near point lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on aug. 3 — a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports alaska dispatch news. Medeiros tells the ap that last week some 2,000 walruses were observed on the island, where they're expected to stay until the fall. Hoping to head north to observe the animals? officials would rather you not. Not only is it illegal to disturb them, the walruses are known to stampede to the water in response to plane and boat activity in the area, which spells bad news for juvenile walruses.",

        "summary": "Hurricane harvey has devastated texas, and it's also bringing bad news for drivers across the nation. Harvey's impact on the gulf coast caused several major refineries and a key gasoline pipeline to shut down, the ap reports. What that means: prices are on the rise: per gasbuddy, the average price of a gallon of gas in the us was $ 2.469 thursday afternoon. That's up 2.3 cents from wednesday, 11.7 cents from last week, 15.1 cents from last month, and 24.3 cents from last year. They're even higher in some areas: reuters, citing aaa data, says fuel prices in georgia and north carolina are up 17 cents a gallon from a week ago; in south carolina, almost 20 cents. And they're likely to go higher: per business insider, gas futures for both september and october are up. In fact, thursday was their eighth straight day of gains, their longest rising streak in four years. There's also the problem of gas availability: the ap reports that quiktrip, one of the biggest convenience store chains in the country, is going to stop selling gas entirely at about half of its stores in the dallas-fort worth metro area in anticipation of shortages. Even locations that have gas may run out: the star-telegram reports that convenience store operators and gasoline retailers are warning there's a major chance some texas locations will run out of gas this weekend due to supply chain disruptions. Specifics on those disruptions: colonial, the largest pipeline operator in the country, has shut down key fuel lines ( al.com ) and motiva enterprises ' port arthur, texas refinery, the biggest in the country, may be closed for as long as two weeks ( cnbc ). Some of the other refineries and pipelines affected are starting back up, cnbc reports. A dire quote: \" hurricane harvey has potentially cut us fuel-making capacity to the lowest level since 2008, \" per bloomberg. And another: \" this is going to be the worst thing the us has seen in decades from an energy standpoint, \" a market analyst tells reuters. What's being done to help: per bloomberg, the epa is exempting many southeastern states from requirements that they use fuel meeting clean-air standards. And cnnmoney reports the trump administration is tapping the emergency us oil reserve; the energy department will send 500,000 barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to the phillips 66 refinery in louisiana.

        "summary": "Chris kluwe made a name for himself not only as an nfl punter but as a ( very ) outspoken advocate for gay marriage. Now kluwe has taken to deadspin to allege that he got cut from the minnesota vikings after eight years by special teams coach mike priefer, \" a bigot who didn't agree with the cause i was working for, \" because of his views. He also calls out \" two cowards, \" ( recently fired ) head coach leslie frazier and team gm rick spielman for not standing up to priefer. In the lengthy account, kluwe recounts his controversial 2012 season and subsequent firing. \" if there's one thing i hope to achieve from sharing this story, it's to make sure that mike priefer never holds a coaching position again in the nfl, and ideally never coaches at any level, \" writes kluwe, who quotes the coach at one point as suggesting that all gay people be rounded up on an island and nuked. \" it's inexcusable that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance, and i hope he never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone else. \" the team responded this afternoon by saying it would \" thoroughly review this matter, \" reports the minneapolis star tribune, but it insisted that kluwe got fired for football performance, not his views on marriage equality.

At the time, quite a few people asked me if i thought it was because of my recent activism for same-sex marriage rights, and i was very careful in how i answered the question. My answer, verbatim, was always, \" i honestly don't know, because i ' m not in those meetings with the coaches and administrative people. \" this is a true answer. I honestly don't know if my activism was the reason i got fired. However, i ' m pretty confident it was. Allow myself to tell you a story about... Myself.

I tried to keep things as objective as possible, and anything you see in quotes are words that i directly recall being said to me.

During the summer of 2012, i was approached by a group called minnesotans for marriage equality, which asked if i would be interested in helping defeat what was known as the minnesota gay marriage amendment. The proposed amendment would have defined marriage as \" only a union of one man and one woman. \" ( it was voted down, and same-sex marriage is now legal in minnesota. ) i said yes, but that i would have to clear it with the team first. After talking to the vikings legal department, i was given the go-ahead to speak on the issue as long as i made it clear i was acting as a private citizen, not as a spokesman for the vikings, which i felt was fair and complied with.

That's according to a new study in primates. \" this episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts, \" researcher bas lukkenaar says in a press release. The christian science monitor reports a dutch tv crew was using the drone to film a documentary on the chimps at the royal burgers ' zoo in april. After a test-run with the drone, the chimps started collecting sticks and climbing scaffolding. When the drone returned, a chimp named tushi was ready, swiping it out of the air with a 6-foot branch. While studying footage from the busted drone, researchers focused on tushi's facial expression during the attack, nbc news reports. They found the grimace she makes before and during the incident is similar to what humans do while carrying out a predetermined use of force. According to the press release, the lack of fear in tushi's expression means she wasn't simply attacking out of reflex. The monitor explains it's the difference between a calculated plan and swatting at a mosquito. This isn't unusual behavior for the chimps at burgers ' zoo; they've taught themselves to use 13 different types of tools, the press release states.

Kenndric roberts, 33, faces charges of false imprisonment and trafficking a person for labor. He was in jail with an initial court appearance scheduled for thursday.

Bill haslam refused to sign — but also refused to veto — a resolution passed resoundingly by the tennessee legislature earlier this year. That lack of action allows the rest of the state government to move forward with a lawsuit against the federal government. The resolution calls on the state attorney general to sue the federal government. If the attorney general decides not to, the resolution says the legislature will hire its own lawyers to do so. Supporters of the resolution say they ' ll use a law firm that has previously challenged \"abortionists, pornographers, those against school prayer, those against the ten commandments, those against god. \" haslam has expressed a number of concerns about the resolution in the past, including whether or not the legislature has the authority to hire outside counsel to represent the state and letting a branch of the government tell the attorney general what to do, the ap reports. The attorney general's office hasn't said whether it will follow through on the lawsuit. But attorney general herbert slatery has in the past said the state legally can't refuse to accept refugees mandated by the federal government, according to wkrn. Opponents of the resolution say it will make life harder for refugees already living in tennessee. \"attempting to block refugee resettlement blames refugees for the very terror they are fleeing, \" the tennessean quotes an aclu executive director as saying. The resolution was supported through an online petition titled \" don't let potential terrorists come to tennessee. \"",

That has prompted residents of mali, which imports all its fuel, to rush to gas stations to collect fuel. The country's electricity grid may also be headed for failure. Unesco is citing a threat to timbuktu, a world heritage site full of \" architectural wonders, \" notes the bbc. Mosques there are \" essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of mali, \" says the group. Yet \" nothing seems to be able to stop \" the tuareg coup, le monde reports. West african leaders need to help mali's military fight back before the instability spreads beyond the country's borders.",

This would probably remain of note only in tree-ring-studying circles if not for one other thing: those dates happen to coincide with the rise of none other than genghis khan, reports the bbc. And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped khan build his empire. Think rain — specifically the lush grasslands it created to fuel to khan's horse-driven army, along with the livestock his soldiers needed to survive. \" it wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army, and concentrate power, \" west virginia university researcher amy hessl tells national geographic. \" where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower — literally.

There were 26 people arrested. Overnight, protests were popping up almost spontaneously in other cities around the country. Columbus, ohio; minneapolis; madison, wis.; and milwaukee joined in protests that had begun wednesday in new york, los angeles, chicago, seattle, philadelphia, boston and other larger cities.

        "summary": "Jefferson parish sheriff's office sgt. Troy smith is dead. The question is whether it was by his own hand or his wife's. A judge on tuesday determined there was sufficient probable cause to hold smith's wife, shantel parria wagner, in connection with his june 24 death. The timeline in the case begins one week prior, on father's day, when wagner called 911 saying her husband had shot himself in the head. Wagner is at times crying and near-hysterical in audio of the call posted by fox 8. The times-picayune reports smith was hospitalized until his death the following week. Wagner's lawyer says smith, 44, suffered from depression and ptsd, was dealing with financial strain, and texted a suicide threat the day before he was shot. But investigators say the evidence suggests the fatal gunshot wound smith suffered wasn't self-inflicted. The autopsy report hasn't been finished, however, so the pathologist who handled the autopsy wouldn't deem it a homicide or suicide on the stand, though the advocate reports she did say smith exhibited no gunpowder burns or abrasions. The head of the sheriff's office crime lab testified the \" totality of evidence, \" as the times-picayune puts it, isn't in line with a suicide — though he also acknowledged wagner's dna was not present on the gun found at the scene. But the judge said inconsistencies in wagner's story — wdsu reports prosecutors say she altered her story 16 times — and a witness who alleges wagner copped to the murder amounted to probable cause. Her bond has been set at $ 300,000.",

Per the centers for disease control and prevention, the birth rate is down in nearly every age group tracked. The 3,853,472 births in the us last year represent a 3 % drop from 2016, the largest single-year decline since 2010 and the fewest babies born in one year since 1978. A country's fertility rate is an important measure of its sustainability, reports the new york times. Too many births put a strain on education and housing. Too few births, and over time the labor pool declines, which in turn tightens resources. In the us, the decline has not yet led to a drop in overall population, because it has been offset to some degree by immigrants. The decline is a bit surprising because in 2017 there were about 7 % more women in their prime childbearing years of 20 to 39. One group that ran against the trend was older women. The birth rate among women age 40 to 44 was up 2 % over the previous year. In fact, almost one in five births were to women 35 or older. Although it's difficult to say for certain what's causing the decline, several factors may be at work, including economic uncertainty stemming from the economic downturn in 2007, reports livescience. In addition, women have been waiting longer to have children, and millennial women appear to be waiting even longer than previous generations as they build their careers. One happy finding: births in the 15 to 19 age group were down 7 %, down 55 % since 2007, and down 70 % from a high in 1991, a trend one statistician called \" phenomenal. \"",

A recent study shows that the marital pay gap that springs up after a first child is born typically does not close if the birth happens between age 25 and 35. Shannon hettinger, a 32-year-old from washington, d.c., said she definitely wanted children. She grew up in a large family in a small town in pennsylvania and almost all her high school friends are married with children. But she moved to washington, and spent her 20s deciding on a career. Now that she has one she loves — she works in residential real estate sales — she is not going to stop until she gets established. That means not having children for a while. \"i just want to build my book of business and see where i can go from here, \" she said. \"my whole focus is career growth. That's my no. 1 priority. \" \"once i achieve a certain level of success, \" she added, \"then i ' ll start thinking about a family. \" ivy gray-klein, 26, who lives in philadelphia and works at the university of pennsylvania school of design, said she was open to having children but",

That's my no. 1 priority. \" \"once i achieve a certain level of success, \" she added, \"then i ' ll start thinking about a family. \" ivy gray-klein, 26, who lives in philadelphia and works at the university of pennsylvania school of design, said she was open to having children but",

Francois county prosecutor jarrod mahurin said monday after filing murder charges. \"it may have been a marital issue, \" he told a reporter. He said frank ancona, 51, was shot in the head between 2 and 3 a.m. On thursday. Malissa ann ancona, 44, of leadwood, mo., and her son, paul edward jinkerson jr., 24, of belgrade, mo., were charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse.

Ancona's body was taken in jinkerson's vehicle to an area outside belgrade, where it was dumped near the big river, wampler wrote. Ancona called himself an imperial wizard with the traditionalist american knights of the ku klux klan.

        "summary": "A lawsuit representing the families and estates of about 800 victims of 9/11 has been filed in manhattan federal court, with the saudi arabian government in its sights, wpix and nbc news report. Of the 19 plane hijackers that day, 15 were saudi nationals, and three of those reportedly had employment history with the government there. Accusations in the newest consolidated complaint, compiled in large part via an fbi investigation, include embassy officials being instrumental in assimilating some of the 9/11 attackers into the us via english instruction, funding assistance, and help in finding a place to live. Saudi authorities also allegedly offered special passport codes to a handful of the terrorists that smoothed their way into the us. The suit also says saudi royals turned a blind eye regarding money they donated to certain \" charities, \" which was really being shifted to al-qaeda. \" the saudis were so duplicitous, \" aviation attorney jim kreindler tells wpix, noting while saudi arabia was putting up a good front as a us ally, it was secretly enabling terrorism. ( usa today notes kreindler's law firm is handling the new suit, which is seeking unspecified monetary damages. ) per nbc, more than a half-dozen lawsuits against the saudi government have filtered into federal court since september, when congress rejected then-president obama's veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, which gave families of 9/11 victims a way to circumvent sovereign immunity to sue the saudis. Obama was against jasta, saying the tables could be turned so other nations can file suit against the us. Attorneys for families and the saudis are to appear in court thursday to hammer out the multi-case logistics. ( the saudis obviously don't like jasta. )",

The assault took place at the regional governor's compound. \" when the high-ranking participants were heading to helicopters, an enemy infiltrator opened fire on them, \" says an afghan government official.

In its official announcement, abc got in a couple little digs at fox: \" american idol is a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon, \" says abc entertainment president channing dungey. \" abc is the right home to reignite the fan base. \" \" idol is an entertainment icon, and now it will air where it belongs, in abc's lineup of addictive fan favorites, \" adds disney co-chairman ben sherwood ( disney owns abc ). \" america, get ready for the return of a bigger, bolder, and better-than-ever idol. \" the network does not yet have a host or judges lined up, though tmz reports ryan seacrest might be interested in returning as host. The speculation is that abc will launch a shortened season, starting next spring, on sunday nights, usa today reports. How excited is the general public? well, not very. \" american idol is back by popular demand!.. Oh wait there was no demand? oh okay. American idol is just back then, \" reads one tweet. Another: \" not real sure why anyone thinks bringing american idol back is a good idea.

The fault lies in mitochondrial dna, which is inherited from mothers and is responsible for powering every cell in the body, per quartz. Now a 5-month-old baby in michigan has been diagnosed with mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 13, which claimed the life of gard last week. His parents will attempt experimental treatment in boston, they tell newschannel3. With only a 50 % chance of reaching his second birthday, they say at least their baby might \" help other children with this condition. \" russell cruzan iii, or \" bubs, \" first worried his parents in early june, when they wondered why he wasn't eating or thriving and was lethargic. After several hospital visits, respiratory problems, and eventually pneumonia, they got the grim diagnosis: his body lacked the energy to power his major organs. The couple doesn't have help from their insurance provider, per wood tv, so they've set up a youcaring page to help with the initial test. This is the type of disease that geneticists hope to be able to stop in its tracks using so-called three-parent ivf, where a donor egg supplies a healthy set of mitochondrial dna ( 37 genes ) and the biological mother supplies her egg's nucleus ( thousands of genes ) without passing on mitochondrial diseases.

Most of the hikers were seen in the emergency room at appalachian regional hospital in whitesburg, with one woman admitted and listed in good condition, spokeswoman dena sparkman said friday. The few who declined to be seen at the hospital \" were like, ` feed me and we're good, ' \" sparkman said. \" i think the best medicine we gave them was chicken soup, \" sparkman said. The group was made up of 37 students and three staff members from la salle university on an annual mission trip called project appalachia, said john caroulis, spokesman for the philadelphia school. Caroulis said the group was helping build houses in harlan, about a half-hour from whitesburg, and had gone on a hiking trip that was made every year on the trip. Rescuers said the group got disoriented when it got dark while they were hiking near bad branch falls, an area on the bad branch nature preserve. A search began about 7 p.m. Est thursday, and it took until 3:",
            "One hiker remained hospitalized friday morning after 37 pennsylvania college students and three staff members were rescued thursday night from pine mountain in letcher county, police said. The hikers from la salle university in philadelphia called for help about 7 p.m. Thursday and were found by 11 p.m., kentucky state police trooper tony watts said. The group, which was hiking near bad branch falls at a place called high rock, stayed together near a campfire and stayed in contact with police and rescue workers by cellphone after that first call, watts said. The hikers had to leave the mountain by foot, and that took until 3: 45 a.m. Friday, letcher county fire and rescue ambulance service director gary rogers said. All 40 of the hikers were taken to whitesburg appalachian regional hospital, where one remained friday, hospital spokeswoman hollie phillips said. The remaining hiker is in stable condition and is expected to be released saturday, said dena sparkman, community ceo for whitesburg arh. The students were treated for possible hypothermia, dehydration and exhaustion, sparkman said. One hiker had strained knees, she said. In addition to medical treatment, she said, hospital staff provided the cold, wet students with chicken noodle soup, dry hospital scrubs and pajama pants. \" the other thing was loaning them cellphones so that they could call their parents."

Using crossfit and tan republic records, police verified neatherlin visited those establishments during \" nap time \" hours. Four of the charges relate to prior incidents, in which neatherlin was said to have burned a baby with scalding milk; on another occasion, an 11-month-old was taken to a hospital with head injuries.

        "summary": "Sean penn's 2015 mexican sitdown with drug lord joaquin guzman ( aka \" el chapo \" ), which he documented in an early 2016 rolling stone article, caused its fair share of controversy. And the ruckus isn't over yet, as the actor is now going after netflix for a documentary on guzman, set to start airing friday, that penn's spokesman says in an email to the new york times is a \" profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative \" that could put penn's life in danger. The actor's main bone of contention with the day i met el chapo: the kate del castillo story: that he thinks the three-episode film hints he assisted the doj in helping to capture el chapo, who was busted right around the time penn's rolling stone article went public. Del castillo, a mexican actress, was with penn when he met with guzman, and the film is said to take place from her pov. Producer david broome denies there's anything in the film that says penn \" is in cahoots \" with the justice department and that both he and netflix tried to see if penn wanted to take part ( penn reportedly never answered ); netflix backs that up, saying in a statement \" penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate. \" broome says when penn saw an advance copy of the film, he demanded changes. Deadline notes that penn's lawyers contacted netflix shortly after and said penn was afraid guzman's associates might go after him if the film wasn't altered. A letter from penn's lawyer to netflix notes that \" blood will be on [ netflix's ] hands if this film causes bodily harm \" to penn. ( in the end, penn thought his rolling stone article on el chapo was a failure. )",

But critics of the site are claiming that sellers are increasingly taking to mass production or even reselling cheap items from overseas — a move that many see as undermining the crafts giant's authenticity and credibility, the new york times reports. And although execs from the online marketplace didn't grant interviews with the times ahead of its potential ipo, etsy ceo chad dickerson notes in the ipo prospectus that there have been complaints about sellers working with outside manufacturers and \" diluting our handmade ethos, \" he notes. \" after all, etsy has always served as an antidote to mass manufacturing. We still do. \" etsy used to ban sellers from outsourcing manufacturing or hiring employees to keep up with demand, the times notes — until dickerson relaxed the rules in 2013, as long as certain criteria were met. Alicia shaffer's etsy shop has been featured on yahoo and in fast company as one of etsy's biggest success stories; she tells the times that while she understands why people are skeptical about her high-volume output, she follows all of etsy's guidelines, hiring a couple dozen local seamstresses to help her out. But grace dobush, an ex-etsy seller, tells the times that \" as etsy has gotten bigger, it's gotten more like ebay. \" in an essay last month for wired, dobush notes the \" pages of crap \" shoppers have to filter through and a seeming disinterest on etsy's part to purge resellers. \" at its outset … we were a bunch of davids, fighting back against the big-box goliaths with artisanal slingshots. … in the past few years it's become apparent that etsy is the goliath. \" ( click to read about etsy's \" haunted doll \" market. )",

Now mark karpelès is telling his full story for the first time. \" i think this really is the worst experience for anyone to have in life, \" he tells fortune. \" but based on the information i had at the time... I still think that i've done the best i could. \" to recap: karpelès was ceo of mt. Gox, the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, when an apparent $ 473 million hack forced it to declare bankruptcy in 2014. Karpelès says he then found 200,000 missing bitcoins in an archived file, but critics said he was just dangling his secret stash to appease creditors. Perhaps worse, leaked records indicate that mt. Gox had fraudulently inflated its numbers to stay afloat. For that, the frenchman was arrested by japanese police in 2015. He denied everything during months of interrogations, he says, and lost 70 pounds in his cell. Now free while on trial for embezzlement and other charges, he was partly vindicated when russian citizen alexander vinnik was arrested for allegedly laundering most of the hacked mt. Gox bitcoins. But they remain lost, and the sharp rise in bitcoin value only complicates matters because japanese bankruptcy law would give most of it to karpelès — who wrote on reddit that he'd pass on what could be worth over a billion dollars, business insider reported. \" the only thing i ' m touching related to cryptocurrency is how to solve this bankruptcy, \" he tells fortune. \" bitcoin right now is, i believe, doomed. \" ( a suspected bitcoin thief broke out of a low-security prison and flew home to sweden. )",

Per sentencing documents, a woman at a party the same night turner attacked his victim alleges he became sexually aggressive toward her, grabbing her and kissing her, without encouragement. And in june 2015, investigators got wind about two other women who ran into turner at a frat party the weekend before the january assault. One said he was \" flirtatious \" while dancing, and that when she began to feel \" creeped out \" and tried to turn away, he became \" touchy. \" meanwhile, a turner supporter facing backlash for calling out the victim's drinking issued a \" defensive apology \" to the guardian wednesday. In her statement, leslie rasmussen says people \" misconstrued \" her defense of turner into meaning she didn't feel for the victim, a \" distortion \" she blames on the \" overzealous nature of social media \" and, per the new york times, the fact that she mistakenly thought her court letter would be kept private. \" i apologize for anything my statement has done to suggest that i don't feel enormous sympathy for the victim and her suffering, \" she said. The guardian notes that after its own article was posted with her apology, she wrote a follow-up on facebook. \" i was not there that night. I had no right to make any assumptions about the situation, \" she wrote wednesday evening. \" most importantly, i did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of brock's crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgement, i am deeply sorry. \" she adds that, at the age of 20, \" it has never been more clear to me that i still have much to learn. \" ( new york explains why turner isn't \" technically \" a convicted rapist. )",
