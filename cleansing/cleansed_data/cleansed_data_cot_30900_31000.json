        "summary": "The community store on the tiny island of canna, located in the inner scottish hebrides, goes by the honor system on weekends, leaving its doors open all night so fishermen can tap the wifi and make purchases; they simply log what they've taken in a ledger and leave money in an \" honesty box, \" per the guardian. But now the shop's manager says the honesty-box tradition may need to end and the store will be locked at night after it was burglarized over the weekend — what many believe to be the first theft in nearly half a century. Stolen were candy, chocolate bars, coffee, batteries, toiletries, and tea-time biscuits, per the store's facebook page, as well as six hand-knit wool caps made by manager julie mccabe. \" we are all pretty gutted, \" she tells the aberdeen press and journal. \" i am absolutely floored that someone has been in and did that to our community. \" and what the mirror is calling the island's \" crime wave \" doesn't stop there: someone also ripped off the island's beauty shop, apparently on the same night, lifting body butter, bath oils, and shower gels, and money from that store's honesty box. The island, which boasts a population of less than 30, by various counts, prides itself on its nonexistent crime rate and doesn't even have a police station, the guardian notes. The last reported incident was a 2008 sex-assault case, and before that, the theft of a wooden plate from one of the local churches in the 1960s. \" we are thinking about putting cctv in, but we don't want to do that because it goes against the whole honesty idea, \" mccabe tells the paper.",

The confusion over snowden's next move comes as ars technica unearthed a series of chat logs from 2009 in which he expressed contempt for anyone who leaked classified information.

Never put off to tomorrow what you can do to-day. 2. Never trouble another with what you can do yourself 3. Never spend your money before you have it 4. Never buy a thing you do not want, because it is cheap, it will be dear to you. 5. Take care of your cents: dollars will take care of themselves! 6. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst"

        "summary": "A&e kicked off what rolling stone calls \" television's most anticipated true-crime event of the season \" with its documentary re-examining jonbenet ramsey's murder as the 20th anniversary of her death approaches. One new bit was a never-before-seen police interview with brother burke from 1998, two years after the killing. Burke — 9 at the time of the murder — told police he recalled his mother entering his room in a panic, turning on the light, looking around, and rushing back out again. He remained in his room amid the chaos because he was \" just so scared. \" \" i just heard my mom going psycho, \" he said, per people. He said he learned his sister was dead only after going with his parents to the home of a family friend later, expecting to see her there. \" i thought they found her, \" he said. \" i came in excited... Almost relieved... Then my dad told me that jonbenet was in heaven. \" the killing of jonbenet: the truth uncovered revisited some familiar terrain: investigator lou smit, who died in 2010, was able to squeeze into the ramsey's home in boulder, colo., through a cellar window, meaning an intruder might have done the same. Smit said a smudge on a wall and a footprint below the window backed up the theory. He also suspected marks on jonbenet's face and back came from a stun gun. \" i think that the unescapable conclusion is that an unidentified male committed this crime, \" said a forensic scientist, per us weekly, based on dna results from blood in jonbenet's underwear. Parents john and patsy ramsey were exonerated, though author paula woodward blames false leaks to the press for keeping suspicions about them in play. \" not a single leak was true: there was no snow around the house. No handwriting expert has ever concluded that patsy wrote the [ ransom ] notes. John didn't leave the home that evening, nor was any porn found. \" ( an old suspect was recently charged with child porn. )",

Cnn tech reports that four employees there are testing out an exoskeleton prototype that aids workers with heavy lifting. The technology looks much like a harness, with carbon-fiber rods that run along the wearer's back and thighs. As the worker bends to lift objects, the shafts collect potential energy, which springs back and releases upon standing. The idea stemmed from lowe's innovation labs, which partners with sci-fi writers to create futuristic narratives for potential technology. In this example, the imagined technology grants employees super human powers to maximize performance, lowe's says. From there, the suit was designed in collaboration with virginia tech engineering professor dr. Alan asbeck. About a month into a 3-month pilot program, lab director kyle nel tells the verge that testing has been positive, and that the employees wear the suits all day. \"it's very comfortable and it makes their job easier, \" he says. \" it's very smooth, and it feels like this heavy thing [ they're lifting ] is much less heavy. \" for lowe's workers, some of whom spend 90 % of their day moving and lifting hefty merchandise like cement bags, the exosuit can be a game-changer. ( see it in action in this video. ) but the company is also hoping that if expanded beyond the virginia store, the exosuit program will serve as a recruiting tool. \" who wouldn't want to work in a place where you get to wear an exosuit? \" nel says.",

The son of the ship's dentist tells cnn that he regards the indianapolis as his father's grave, and that \" i don't think i have cried this hard in my adult life. \" he adds that, \" my mother would be torn to pieces if she were still living. She did not want them to ever find the ship. But i am glad she does not have to cry today. \" adds the nephew of another sailor lost aboard the indianapolis, \" i am filled with so much emotion.

        "summary": "Per the currently accepted narrative, the first bullet to hit john f. Kennedy on nov. 22, 1963, wasn't the one that fatally injured him. It was lee harvey oswald's second shot to the head that ended the president's life, and some are now saying a medical problem kennedy suffered from may have contributed to his own death: his chronic, debilitating back pain, cnn reports. Spinal neurosurgeon dr. Thomas pait assembled research on jfk's lumbar woes — which stretch back to his football-playing days at harvard and led him to undergo four \" largely unsuccessful surgeries \" — into a paper recently published in the journal of neurosurgery. In it, he ties jfk's death to a possible inability to duck down after oswald's first bullet, all because he was wearing a stiff, \" tightly laced \" back brace with a figure-eight ace bandage wrapped around it that kept him locked in an upright position. \" if you have that brace all the way up your chest, above your nipples, and real tight, are you going to be able to bend forward? \" pait notes. Cnn and other outlets have covered how important it was for jfk to keep up his illusion of vitality, even though pait writes he was \" patently unhealthy. \" jfk started using the brace to help support his spine and alleviate pain, but by the early ' 60s, dr. Hans kraus wanted to wean him off it, fearing his overreliance was causing his muscles to atrophy. \" when i come back from dallas, i ' ll get out of the brace, but i gotta wear it for this trip. I gotta look good, \" pait says kennedy told kraus before his ill-fated trip. \" it is certainly well within the realm of possibility that kennedy's augmented canvas corset... Played a role in setting up oswald's final shot, \" the jama paper notes. Cnn's take here, including the pain relief jfk sought from \" dr. Feelgood. \" ( an ex-secret service agent shared his recollection of jackie kennedy trying to save a piece of her husband's skull. )",

Physicians in the 1930s and 1940s did not realize what is common medical knowledge today — namely, that corticosteroids are effective in treating acute colitis but have deleterious long-term effects, including osteoporosis of lower-back bones and increased incidence of serious infection ( owing to suppression of the body's immune system ). Kennedy would suffer from all these problems, including outright degeneration of his lumbar spine. In addition, the long-term use of cortico-steroids suppresses normal adrenal function; it may have been the cause of kennedy's addison's disease. ( jack's sister eunice also had addison's, however, indicating that his disease may have had an inherited component. ) from september of 1934 to june of 1935, jack's senior year of prep school, the school infirmary had kept a close watch on his blood count; joe kennedy passed these records on to the mayo doctors. At that time there was still concern that jack might be suffering from leukemia. In retrospect, any changes in his blood count may have been a reaction to the drugs he was taking. When he fell ill the following autumn, a doctor advised that jack had agranulocytosis, a decrease in granular white blood cells, which made him more susceptible to infections.

Jubilant rescuers pulled an 18-year-old man from the remains of a kathmandu building today, five days after it collapsed around him, the ap reports. While digging through rubble, american and nepalese rescuers heard a shout, then worked for hours to free the teen, identified variously as pemba tamang and pemba lama, who was sandwiched between concrete slabs that once held up two floors; twisted steel alone kept them from crushing him. \" he thanked me when i first approached him, \" says a worker, who crawled through a hole before tamang could be freed. Tamang also began singing, \" you are a god who has come to me to try to save me, \" the worker says, per the los angeles times. \" i gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him. \" the concrete was eventually lifted with jacks, and crowds cheered as tamang was removed on a stretcher, put in a neck brace, and given an iv drip. \" there were times when i thought i was dead, and then i would wake up again to find myself beneath the rubble, \" he says. \" i survived on ghee that i found in a bottle there, scraping until the last dollop to feed myself. \" a doctor says it \" is nothing short of a miracle \" that tamang suffered no major injuries. Rescuers are still searching for two children, about 6 and 12, whom tamang says he spoke to while trapped. Shortly before he was freed, the head of the us team said his rescue was risky, but \" to save a human life, we ' ll risk almost anything. \" a day earlier, french workers pulled a man from the rubble of a hotel 80 hours after the quake.",

Researchers investigating swarms of small earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 in western antarctica believe they have spotted an active volcano rumbling under almost a mile of ice, nbc news reports. It's unlikely an eruption would have the power to punch through the ice, but scientists fear such an event could melt enough ice to accelerate the flow of antarctica's ice sheet into the sea, further raising sea levels worldwide. When the team investigated a group of mountains near the quakes, \" we realized they are actually a chain of volcanoes that date younger as they go south and the earthquakes were south of the volcanoes, \" says the lead researcher, who also found a layer of ash from an eruption 8,000 years ago in the ice near the recent tremors. There's no way to know when the unnamed volcano will erupt again, but \" it can suddenly pop, and that would have a huge effect, \" a british antarctic survey expert tells the new scientist; heat from its magma may already be loosening the ice.

Alhadeff also said discipline systems at the district need to be \" revamped \" because they have \" gone from the complete extremes — from over-disciplining kids to not disciplining kids, which we have now. \" \" there is no better way to ensure that the change this school system desperately needs is achieved than to have a seat at the table, \" she said. \" i want to do everything possible to make this school system a model that other districts will look and try to replicate. \" in addition to running for the school board, she and petty said they would also continue to advocate for gun control, the miami herald reports.",

According to the washington post, 48-year-old marcellus williams was convicted in 2001 of the 1998 murder of felicia gayle, who was stabbed 43 times in her home. But attorneys for williams say new evidence — namely dna found on the murder weapon — provides \"conclusive scientific evidence that another man committed this crime. \" on tuesday, gov. Eric greitens issued a stay of execution and formed a five-person board of inquiry to look into the matter. \" a sentence of death is the ultimate, permanent punishment, \" greitens says. \" to carry out the death penalty, the people of missouri must have confidence in the judgment of guilt. \" the decision was celebrated by a group of protesters at the missouri capitol, the ap reports. And a lawyer for the innocence project says they are \" relieved and grateful. \" attorneys for williams say dna on the murder weapon doesn't match williams but belongs to an unidentified person. Regardless, the missouri attorney general's office had been pushing for the execution to go ahead as planned, stating the dna evidence isn't enough to prove williams ' innocence in the face of other evidence, including testimonies from williams ' girlfriend and a man he was imprisoned with. St. Louis county prosecutor bob mcculloch says there is \" zero possibility \" that williams is not responsible for gayle's murder.",

The raw story reports that trump supporters were lashing out at drudge on twitter, with many claiming the media would have only itself to blame if trump's idea comes to fruition.

According to a review of his case finished in june, \" much of what was presented to lee's jury as science is now conceded to be little more than superstition. \" but lee, who was initially sentenced to life without parole, the morning call notes, is not entirely out of the woods: prosecutors say that there's more evidence against him, and they're likely to appeal. Prosecutors have 120 days to make their decision. For his part, lee holds that a fire in the pocono mountains which resulted in his daughter's death was an accident, the ap notes. But investigators decades ago believed the fire was arson due to its intensity, which was once thought to indicate that an accelerant was used. Other features left in wood and windows after the fire were also seen as evidence of arson, but this is no longer considered accurate. The case is one of many facing renewed attention due to changes in the way arson is identified.",

        "summary": "Headlines about avocado toast are everywhere, but this time it's more about economics than food trends. It began when an australian property mogul went on australia's 60 minutes and scolded millennials. \" when i was trying to buy my first home, i wasn't buying smashed avocado for $ 19 and four coffees at $ 4 each, \" tim gurner harrumphed, per cnn money. Let the reaction begin: the new york times'dealbook does some fact-checking, and it doesn't come out well for gurner. Millennials are no more likely to spend on travel and dining than other generations, and it would take a serious amount of avocado toast to put a dent in a down payment these days. Besides, homeownership isn't necessarily a slam-dunk as a wise financial move. Time is out with an avocado toast calculator. You plug in your city, and it crunches data to figure out how many servings of avocado toast ( at $ 8 a pop ) you'd have to skip to afford a down payment in your area. The backlash has been furious, and gurner tells news.com.au that he didn't expect it. He says his \" comments were part of a much bigger discussion on how people can get into the market and the necessary planning and policy regulations that i believe are required in order to generate any real change. \" and he acknowledged that it's \" incredibly hard \" for people to enter the housing market. Still, casting luxury-ish food items as part of the problem isn't particularly original, writes maura judkis at the washington post, who notes that starbucks lattes were the old culprit. The problem is that the economic theory is \" garbage, \" she adds, citing this older takedown of latte economics in slate. The real reason millennials can't afford homes? rising house prices and student debt, plus stagnant wages, writes jessica roy in the los angeles times. Gurner, who is 35, isn't even the first prominent australian to make the avocado toast analogy. Buzzfeed took note of this column last year. A millennial responds, via mashable: \" i'd much prefer to eat avocado on toast while sharing an apartment with 10 mates, if having money and five houses turns me into a smarmy rich dude that lectures my own generation on how to be a smarmy rich dude. Cough, gurner, cough. \" whether or not gurner is right, one thing seems like a safe bet: the price of avocados is probably going nowhere but up, thanks to demand in china, reports the independent. And whatever",

Though floodwaters are receding in some areas, residents in the southern part of the state face danger as water moves downstream toward the gulf, reports nbc news. Some coverage: \" the disaster unfolding here this week fits into a recent and staggering pattern in more than half-dozen states, where floods have rolled out at such a scale that scientists say they might be a once-every-500-or-1,000-year occurrence. \" the new york times explores. The latest numbers: 11 dead, with the search for bodies continuing; 40,000 homes affected; 30,000 people rescued; 8,000 in shelters; and 60,000 have applied for fema aid, reports the ap. Authorities say it will be a while before they get a true handle on missing people. Another number: between aug. 8 and aug. 14, enough rain fell to fill 10.4 million olympic-size pools, nearly 7 trillion gallons. ( some areas got 31 inches of rain. ) cnn looks at the numbers. \" in livingston parish, just east of baton rouge, officials estimated that as many as 75 % of the area's 52,000 homes had been damaged by floodwaters. Southeast, in ascension parish, water had seeped into one of every three homes. \" the los angeles times reports. See more photos at the new orleans times-picayune. \" we wince. We empathize. We say we ' ll pray. Yet there's an uneasy detachment that comes with watching it all from afar, from somewhere other than the too many ground zeros of this 1,000-year rain, from somewhere other than the path of destruction stretching across much of south louisiana. \" a times-picayune columnist reflects here.

But per the week and the hill, that mcdonald's run may have been a myth from the start, and christie apparently doesn't blame trump at all for dumping him for pence — because he thinks it was jared kushner's doing. Those reports both emerge from a politico interview with the outgoing new jersey governor, who spent nearly three hours dishing with josh dawsey on the 2016 election, his state's bridgegate, and everything in between. Christie says as he was being fired just days after the election, he had a heated conversation about the matter with then-aide steve bannon, and christie tried to twist his arm to admit kushner had been the force behind christie's firing ( christie had prosecuted kushner's father in 2005 and helped send him to prison ). \" i asked, \" christie tells dawsey. \" [ bannon ] didn't answer.

        "summary": "The trump administration went back to the supreme court monday, asking the justices to continue to allow strict enforcement of a temporary ban on refugees from around the world. The justice department's high court filing monday followed an appeals court ruling last week that would allow up to 24,000 refugees to enter the united states if a resettlement agency in the us had agreed to take them in. The appeals court had also ruled that grandparents and cousins of people already in the us can't be excluded from the country under the travel ban. On monday afternoon, however, in a one-page ruling signed by justice anthony kennedy, the supreme court issued a temporary decision to let the trump administration keep the refugee restrictions in place, at least for the time being, the ap and the hill report. Kennedy told challengers to the trump travel ban they have until noon on tuesday to submit written arguments in support of the 9th circuit court of appeals ' ruling from last week. The appellate ruling would have taken effect tuesday without the high court's intervention. The administration hadn't challenged the part of the ruling that applies to a temporary ban on visitors from six mostly muslim countries. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments about the legality of the travel and refugee bans on oct. 10, per bloomberg. By that point, the original 90-day travel ban will have lapsed and the 120-day refugee ban will have just a few weeks to run. The administration has yet to say whether it plans to renew the exclusions, expand them, or make them permanent.",

Ali mohammed al-nimr was arrested on 14 february 2012 when he was just 17, during a crackdown on anti-government protests in the shiite province of qatif. He was accused by the authorities of participation in illegal protests and of firearms offences, despite there being no evidence to justify the latter charge. Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders facility, where he was denied access to lawyers. Evidence indicates that he was tortured and forced to sign a document which was tantamount to a confession. The signed document formed the basis of the case against him and he was convicted of the alleged offences by the specialised criminal court ( scc ). However, the trials failed to meet international standards. Ali and his family have strongly denied the charges against him, but, after the final appeal - which was held in secret and without ali's knowledge - was dismissed, there are few legal options remaining to oppose the sentence originally handed down on 27 may 2014. It is feared that ali could be executed in a matter of days. The case against ali appears to be based on his familial connection to sheikh nimr al-nimr, a 53-year old critic of the saudi regime and a prominent religious leader in the kingdom, who is his uncle."

Maya foa, director of the death penalty team at legal charity reprieve, said: \"no one should have to go through the ordeal ali has suffered – torture, forced 'confession ', and an unfair, secret trial process, resulting in a sentence of death by 'crucifixion '. \" \"but worse still, ali was a vulnerable child when he was arrested and this ordeal began. His execution – based apparently on the authorities'dislike for his uncle, and his involvement in anti-government protests – would violate international law and the most basic standards of decency. It must be stopped. \" a number of people, including minors, have been sentenced to death following their involvement in demonstrations that swept the mena region during the arab spring.",
            "A prisoner in saudi arabia, who was sentenced to death as a child, faces \" death by crucifixion \" after a final appeal has been dismissed. Ali mohammed al-nimr was arrested on 14 february 2012 when he was just 17, during a crackdown on anti-government protests in the shiite province of qatif. He was accused by the authorities of participation in illegal protests and of firearms offences, despite there being no evidence to justify the latter charge. Ali was initially held at a juvenile offenders facility, where he was denied access to lawyers. Evidence indicates that he was tortured and forced to sign a document which was tantamount to a confession. The signed document formed the basis of the case against him and he was convicted of the alleged offences by the specialised criminal court ( scc ). However, the trials failed to meet international standards. Ali and his family have strongly denied the charges against him, but, after the final appeal - which was held in secret and without ali's knowledge - was dismissed, there are few legal options remaining to oppose the sentence originally handed down on 27 may 2014. It is feared that ali could be executed in a matter of days. The case against ali appears to be based on his familial connection to sheikh nimr al-nimr, a 53-year old critic of the saudi regime and a prominent religious leader in the kingdom, who is his uncle."

Officials say receptionist ruth berg, 47, and janitor john carlson, 82, were killed in the natural gas explosion at the upper campus of minnehaha academy, the star tribune reports. Nine other people were injured, one critically, authorities say, though the blast would have been far more catastrophic, with hundreds potentially killed or injured, if fall classes had been in session. Girls taking part in a summer cross-country run practice left the building just 30 seconds before the blast. Fire officials say the explosion happened in a boiler room, though it's not clear what triggered it. Carlson's wife tells minnesota public radio that he graduated from the academy in 1953, sent his own children there, and returned to work there part-time after retiring 14 years ago. She says he wasn't scheduled to have been there at the time of the blast, but he went to work early because he had a doctor's appointment later wednesday. Berg had worked at the academy for 17 years. \" as our receptionist, she welcomed everyone with a smile and was always willing to go the extra mile to help our students, families, and staff, \" the school said in a statement. \" she will be greatly missed. \" the staff members were mourned at a prayer service wednesday evening.",

In the latest case, residents called 911 when a duplex's floor buckled, its walls cracking, the tampa bay times reports.

        "summary": "Unforgettable. Imaginative. Beautiful. These are just a few words being used to describe arrival, denis villeneuve's film about a linguistics professor turned alien translator. Giving it a 95 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes, critics can't seem to say enough good things. A sampling: \" where gravity and the martian proved there was still such a thing as thinking man's sci-fi, arrival perfects it, \" writes brian truitt at usa today. It's \" such a beautiful and thought-provoking film that it almost single-handedly makes up for every bad aliens-coming-to-earth film you've ever seen. \" just a few things to enjoy: a \" heartbreaking gem \" of a script, a \" mind-blowing \" third act, and the acting chops of amy adams, who cements herself as \" a definite contender in the best actress oscar race. \" it's \" an imaginative, escapist what-if scenario overlaid with semi-profound questions about fate, loss and the meaning of love, \" enhanced by \" a superb, quietly interior performance by adams, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post. The highlight is \" a tricky series of fakes and feints that keep viewers unsure. \" a warning: you may shed tears, but only \" the good kind, \" hornaday says. For adam graham, arrival is \" unforgettable … because it does virtually nothing that you've come to expect from an alien invasion movie, \" he writes at detroit news. \" it aims higher, and in the end, it cuts deeper \" with thrills that are \" cerebral rather than physical. \" graham particularly praises johann johannsson for a \" stirring score \" and villeneuve for his ability to \" balance high art with commercial necessities. \" the film \" draws viewers in slowly and inexorably \" and \" patience pays off in a curve-throwing ending that fills you with a sense a wonder, not to mention shock and awe, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. Adams, meanwhile, is \" a miracle worker, \" he writes. \" with her, the film gets inside your head and emerges as something intimate and epic, a linguistics odyssey through space and time. It's the stuff that dreams are made of. \"",

Off the other side of the continent, the sharks ' population seems to be growing, too: in the eastern north pacific, they're \" returning to levels of abundance, \" says a researcher, per reuters. Experts say federal protections for sharks and their prey have helped the population climb. Since they're top predators, if they're doing well, it suggests the rest of the ocean is too, one expert notes. There is some disagreement among researchers, however: a 2011 study found low numbers of the animals, and the researchers who conducted it \" stand firmly behind \" their findings.

By late wednesday, dozens of anxious gop lawmakers were ready to give president obama almost exactly what he requested months ago: a bill to fund the government and increase the treasury department's borrowing power with no strings attached. \"we've been locked in a fight over here, trying to bring government down to size, trying to do our best to stop obamacare, \" house speaker john a. Boehner ( r-ohio ) told a cincinnati radio station. \"we fought the good fight. We just didn't win. \" the senate overwhelmingly ratified the deal wednesday evening, 81 to 18, with more than half of senate republicans voting yes. A few hours later, the house followed suit, approving the measure 285 to 144. Eighty-seven republicans joined a united democratic caucus in approving the measure, allowing congress to meet a critical treasury department deadline with one day to spare. Obama signed the measure into law shortly after midnight,, reopening parks and monuments across the nation, restoring government services and putting furloughed federal employees back on the job, many of them in the washington region. \"employees should expect to return to work in the morning, \" sylvia mathews burwell, the white house budget director, said in a statement.

Advertisement the draft of the senate agreement would raise the debt ceiling until feb. 7, reopen the government until jan. 15 and form a budget conference to resolve the automatic spending cuts under sequestration. \" the speaker will bring that bill to the house floor, \" rep. Kevin brady ( r-texas ) told bloomberg television wednesday morning. It's unclear whether the house or senate will vote first on the agreement. Starting in the house could speed passage in the senate, but a senior house gop leadership aide said the order of votes remains up in the air. \"no decision has been made about how or when a potential senate agreement could be voted on in the house, \" said michael steel, a spokesman for boehner. Lawmakers are racing against the clock to meet thursday's debt-ceiling deadline, when the treasury department says the nation's borrowing authority will be exhausted.

Their lawyer, eric bland, says the unarmed 19-year-old was driving in a hardee's parking lot with his date, tori morton, when he was confronted by two officers who'd set up a drug buy with morton, reports the los angeles times and washington post. Bland says as hammond slowed his car and reached downward, toward the car's gear shift, someone shouted that he had a gun. The two gunshots that killed hammond, striking him in the shoulder and torso, were mysteriously left out of the police report, which said officers arrested morton for possessing 10 grams of pot. Police now say the officer who shot hammond was a victim of \" attempted murder \" as hammond \" accelerated and came toward the officer, \" reports fox carolina. The results of a private autopsy requested by hammond's family, however, state he was shot in the \" left rear shoulder, and through the back of his chest, \" bland says, meaning the bullets came from behind or \" through an open driver's side window. \" hammond's death is now considered a homicide, but bland says it isn't getting nearly as much attention as similar cases, like that of sam dubose.

        "summary": "Apple got the oohs and aahs it was looking for at its product unveiling event today. Here's the skinny on its latest gadgets, with some help from the liveblogs at cnbc and bloomberg: first up was the mac line refresh, starting with a 13-inch iteration of the macbook pro with retina display. It's 20 % thinner than the previous generation, and almost a pound lighter. It's $ 1,699, or $ 500 cheaper than the 15-inch macbook pro. There was also an update of the mac mini, as expected, updating the internal hardware of the tiny desktop. There's also a new version specifically set up to be used as a server. The crowd let out an audible gasp at the sight of the new imac. The new design is frankly stunning, with an edge that's just 5mm thin. It also includes a snazzy new feature that apple is calling the \" fusion drive, \" a combination of a flash drive and a hard drive that apple promises is nearly as fast as a flash drive, while boasting up to three terabytes of storage. They ' ll start at $ 1,299. Then came the headliners: the ipad line. First up was the fourth generation of the main ipad, which looks much the same as previous editions, but it includes an a6x processor that apple says will give it double the cpu and graphic performance. It will also have apple's new lightning connector, lte support, and an upgraded camera. They ' ll cost the same as the current ipads ( $ 499 ). But the star of the show, of course, was the ipad mini — yes, that's the actual name. \" it is every inch an ipad, \" phil schiller promised. As expected it has a 7.9-inch screen, but it isn't retina display — it has the same resolution as the original ipad. It weighs just 0.68 lb, and is 7.2mm thick. Ipad apps will run on the machine right out of the box, without developers having to adapt them — which schiller touted as a big advantage over android 7-inch tablets running \" stretched out phone apps. \" that wasn't the only smack schiller talked either. \" others have tried to make tablets smaller than the ipad. They have failed miserably, \" he said, pointing out that the mini's screen is a third larger than the nexus, yet it's lighter, and in apple's opinion easier to hold thanks to the thinner side bezel. The mini will start at $ 329, again as expected.",

Per marketwatch, the conservative pundit was incensed when delta staff moved her saturday from what she says was her prebooked \" extra room \" seat on a flight out of new york's laguardia airport to florida. Coulter responded to her seat reassignment with a two-day tweetstorm that included about two dozen tweets and retweets about the situation, including insults against the woman who had been given her seat so she could sit with her family. \" the worst airline in america is still: @delta, \" coulter wrote in one tweet saturday, followed by a rant against the \" dachshund-legged woman \" who \" should have booked the seat in advance. Like i did. \" she also tweeted a picture of the unhappy-looking new seat-occupier. The new york post notes the seat that the 6-foot-tall coulter paid for comes with 3 inches of extra legroom ( the delta website notes up to 4 inches of extra space ) and cost coulter $ 30 extra. However, a delta rep tells the washington post coulter was simply moved \" a few seats over, \" from an aisle seat to a window, and had the same amount of legroom. Delta also took on coulter on twitter, informing her it would refund her $ 30 and offering an apology, but also calling her out: \" additionally, your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary. \" coulter rebutted it cost her $ 10,000 in time and effort to do all the legwork to ensure she had legroom. The washington post notes this isn't the first time coulter has publicly aired her issues with delta, including a complaint a few years ago in which she noted she was seated near a person \" who smells like a nyc cabdriver. \"",

            "Online cover to determine how north africa's climate has evolved over the past millions of years, experts have studied dust flux records from marine sediments. These long-term records are based largely on fluxes calculated using age model-based mass accumulation rates ( mars ). However, this method suffers from many potential biases, including limited resolution. The paleoclimate community has recently diverted from the mar approach and has started to use constant flux proxies, such as excess 230th from seawater that can be used to determine sediment accumulation rates. Relying on 230th from marine sediment cores to more reliably calculate fluxes, skonieczny et al. Present the first saharan dust record than spans many glacial cycles. They discovered that in the sahara desert, dust emissions over the last 240,000 years have varied in accordance with northern hemisphere summer monsoons rather than glacial-interglacial changes as had been previously assumed. These results question the use of existing pleistocene dust records to examine the connections between climate and hominid evolution. Credit: gideon mendel/corbis via getty images",

The new york times was the first to report on the investigation, with sources saying the doj started poking around about five months ago to see if the companies were in cahoots over a technology called esim, which allows consumers to switch carriers without having to swap out the tiny sim card inside their phones.

The probe was opened after at least one other wireless carrier and one device maker registered complaints. One source tells the times the device maker was apple, which has adopted the esim technology, along with microsoft, google, and both us and global wireless carriers.

It's a standardized sim chip open to multiple mobile operators globally. Meaning, if you have an esim you don't have to replace one sim card with another when switching carrier. Since the esim can be programmed remotely, it allows you to choose another carrier by just messaging the old and new provider. One of the main promoters for it is the gsma. Gsma is an association representing the interests of mobile operators worldwide. They are working on specifications for the esims so that it will truly work globally, on any device, with any operator. The future of esim the future of esim is still unclear at might have significant implications. Deploying an esim-based device could be costly, complex and will probably include some initial growing pains. In the long run, however, it should optimize cost and also extend the life and usage of a device. Since you don't have to worry about compatibility, there is no need to switch a device just because you want to change operator. Esims are currently more common in iot devices, tablets and cars but whether or not it will find acceptance in smartphones, is still unknown"

Trey gowdy, a trump ally and chairman of the house oversight committee, appeared on the network to poke holes in trump's claim that the fbi planted a spy in his 2016 campaign.

Gowdy added that a justice department briefing last week convinced him the move had \" nothing to do \" with trump. What politico calls gowdy's \" significant pushback against the president \" then received backing from another trump supporter, fox news commentator andrew napolitano. \" there is no evidence \" to support trump's claims that a spy infiltrated his campaign in order to pass information to the obama administration and his democratic rival hillary clinton, and \" i'd want to see evidence before i made an allegation that outrageous, \" he said, before describing halper's actions as \" standard operating procedure in intelligence gathering and in criminal investigations. \" despite anchor shepard smith later saying much the same, trump stuck to his \" spygate \" theory at a tuesday rally in nashville, asking the crowd, \" how do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign? \" per the post.",

Georgia's national chess champion, gaioz nigalidze, visited the same bathroom stall enough during the dubai open on saturday that his opponent, armenian tigran petrosian, became suspicious. \" nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet, \" he tells the telegraph. Officials investigated and the bbc reports they found a phone covered in toilet paper in a trash bin. \" he denied it was his, but it was logged into his facebook page and there was a chess program running on it, showing his positions, \" the tournament director says. Nigalidze, ranked 400th in the world, was booted from the competition and is the first grandmaster to be referred to the world chess federation's ( fide ) anti-cheating commission, set up last year. At stake in the tournament is a $ 12,000 prize. The georgian chess federation says the incident was \" very bad, \" but it plans to hear from the 26-year-old before discussing retribution. Cheating with electronic devices \" has increased in the past three or four years, so we've made special efforts to combat it, \" the secretary of the anti-cheating commission says. Fide officials are able to search tournament participants, while metal detectors and blocking devices are also used. After an investigation, the commission will pass the case to an ethics committee, which will decide nigalidze's fate. The tournament's chief arbiter tells cnn that guilty parties are handed a three-year ban from sanctioned tournaments, while repeat offenders face a 15-year ban. On twitter, former world title contender nigel short suggested nigalidze should face criminal charges for fraud. ( meet the youngest us grandmaster ever. )",
