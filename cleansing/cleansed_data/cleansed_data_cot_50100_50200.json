At least two people died from heart problems while shoveling snow this week in buffalo and about 100 americans meet the same fate each year, the bbc reports, as a boosted heart rate and artery-constricting cold air make \" a perfect storm for a heart attack, \" a doctor explains. If you're over 55 or \" habitually sedentary, \" he says you shouldn't pick up a shovel at all. Shoveling snow is also risky for smokers and people with coronary disease. But if you have to shovel, remember to breathe during the exercise. Push the snow, don't lift it, and avoid the 6am to 10am window if possible as hormone levels make people particularly prone to heart attacks at that time. Dress warmly and take regular breaks inside, the doctor advises. The american heart association chimes in with a few additional tips: skip big meals right before or after shoveling, as a heavy meal can tax the heart. And in terms of your shovel, use a smaller one; the less snow you move at once, the safer you ' ll be. And if you're looking to warm up, avoid alcohol, a doctor tells abc news. \" it puts the heart at more risk. \" the advice, which also applies to those who use snow blowers, will come in handy if you're planning to help out the buffalo bills.

Why? a study looking at data from 1990 to 2006 by researchers at the us nationwide children's hospital recorded 1,647 fatalities from cardiac-related injuries associated with shovelling snow. In canada, these deaths make the news every winter.

The guardian reports on the plight of nyan htoo, who recently underwent emergency surgery to remove 7 pounds of tissue from a tongue so large he couldn't keep it in his mouth. Instead, nyan htoo dragged it on the floor, and the bbc reports the weight of the tongue fatigued him so much that he often had to rest his head against the side of his cage. \" i've worked with bears for over 10 years and i've never seen anything like it, \" says heather bacon, a university of edinburgh veterinarian who was part of the team that operated on nyan htoo, whose name means \" bright. \" she adds his malady was \" pretty astonishing. \" nyan htoo — who'd ended up at the monastery with his brother after they were abducted by burmese traffickers, then rescued by monks — also couldn't close his mouth. Bacon and others heard about his condition, which they speculate was either a genetic issue or a form of elephantiasis, swelling brought about by a mosquito-carried parasite that causes infection. The telegraph notes that vets had taken excess tissue from nyan htoo's tongue last year, but before long the swelling came back in full force. The surgery this time around took about four hours. Per stuff.co.nz, nyan htoo is now playing with his brother again, though he ' ll have a learning curve in adapting to day-to-day tasks without his giant tongue. \" we have been able to make a tangible improvement in the quality of nyan htoo's life, \" bacon says. ( this bear made 200 sheep leap to their deaths. )",

        "summary": "Arkansas razorbacks football coach bobby petrino has been canned after the married dad of four confessed to having a volleyball-playing lover half his age whom he put on the college payroll. Petrino's secret life came to light following a motorcycle accident earlier this month while he was riding with lover jessica dorrell, 25. Petrino, 51, suffered broken ribs, abrasions, and a cracked vertebrae in his neck. He didn't tell his bosses that dorrell was with him at the time, but they quickly found out — and connected him to her hiring and a $ 20,000 payment to her. Athletic director jeff long slammed the coach, hired four years ago, for misleading his superiors and the public, and damaging the reputation of the football program. \" coach petrino abused his authority when he made a staff hire that benefited himself and jeopardized the integrity of the football program, \" said long. Petrino, a former coach of the atlanta falcons, hired dorrell, who used to play volleyball for the razorbacks, as a student-athlete development coordinator last year, reports the new york daily news. He apologized after his firing, and said he is now trying to \" heal \" his family, according to ap. \" all i have been able to think about is the number of people i've let down by making selfish decisions, \" he said. \" i chose to engage in an improper relationship. I also made several poor decisions following the end of that relationship and in the aftermath of the accident. \"",

People fishing in henry hagg lake, located in a washington county park that, police say, draws up to 10,000 people per day, first noticed an unconscious 3-year-old boy near the shore monday. Despite their efforts to perform cpr and the arrival of fire crews, jeremy scholl died, the oregonian reports. But he didn't appear to have been alone: officials found four pairs of shoes at the edge of the lake and a dog wandering nearby, no owners in sight. Other abandoned items including a towel, a cooler, and a phone also hinted there were other people to be found. An initial search revealed no one in the woods or water. But a call to the boy's aunt revealed that relatives had gone to the lake and hadn't been heard from since, and the following day, divers recovered three more bodies: those of the boy's mother, gabriela garcia-ixtacua, 25; his uncle, michael garcia-ixtacua, 13; and his grandmother, jova ixtacua-castano, 42. Authorities saw no indication of foul play. \" this appears to be a tragic incident where someone likely got into trouble in the water and others attempted to help them, \" an officer says, per kgw. \" detectives are still searching for any answers. \" ( in a happier turn of events this year, another child was underwater in a utah river for 20 minutes — and survived. )",

There had been a sense, even before the competition, that the british men had fulfilled their ambitions simply by reaching the final and all the gymnasts reiterated that their aim for the final was simply to enjoy it. That relaxed attitude showed as they made their way around the apparatus. They had begun on their strongest suit, the pommel horse, where louis smith lowered his difficulty level to ensure a routine of care and precision and with fine contributions from daniel purvis and max whitlock their apparatus total of 45.932 was a fantastic start to competition. By the halfway point, they were in third place and within 0.8 of a point of second-placed japan and smith was wearing an extremely"

        "summary": "It's long been thought that napping is an important part of a baby's growth — both physically and mentally. Now new research in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests that naps help babies form new memories, and that when a nap directly follows a new activity the baby is far likelier to recall it the next day than if that child doesn't nap until four hours after the activity, reports the los angeles times. \" in both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information, \" the study's lead author tells healthday news. To test a baby's recall, researchers studied 216 babies ages 6 months and 12 months. They demonstrated how to remove mittens from animal puppets, and found that those who then took naps at least 30 minutes long ( and typically more like 80 ) were better able to recall how to remove the mittens 24 hours later than those who didn't nap until four hours later. Whether a baby napped just before the experiment made no difference. The authors also hypothesize that because the hippocampal region — key to memory formation — is so small in babies, it may only be able to store smaller chunks of information, hence the need for frequent sleep early in life. ( other research shows a newborn's brain grows 1 % a day. )",

In the new study, researchers launched two experiments. In each one, babies aged 6 months or 12 months",
            "Because most babies at those ages are not yet talking, the researchers had to find a nonverbal way to measure how the timing of sleep influenced the strength of a memory.

Now democrats are pinning their hopes on the man many of them blame for hillary clinton's loss to deliver a major blow to donald trump's credibility. Fbi director james comey is set to face probing questions monday about russia's involvement in the presidential election at a highly anticipated public appearance before the house intelligence committee. He's expected to be asked to confirm or deny the existence of criminal investigations into trump or his campaign aides over ties to moscow, though several committee members said comey will likely decline to comment because doing so could undermine active probes. Story continued below key lawmakers in both parties say they will demand that the fbi director clear up, once and for all, trump's explosive claim that president barack obama ordered a wiretap of trump tower in the run-up to the election, according to interviews",

Lawmakers from both parties said on sunday they had seen no proof to support the claim by republican president donald trump that his predecessor barack obama had wiretapped him last year, adding pressure on trump to explain or back off his repeated assertion. Several republicans last week urged trump to apologize for the allegations he made in a series of tweets on march 4. The maelstrom also caused tension with key u.s. Allies and threatens to distract republicans from campaign promises on health care and taxes. \"i don't know the basis for president trump's assertion, \" u.s.

The pair, along with a third defendant scheduled to plead guilty next week, were arrested in april on charges of trading cash, guns, cigarettes and at least one snowmobile for around 1,000 pounds of raw walrus ivory and other animal parts. They obtained the materials by trading with yup ' ik eskimo hunters from the impoverished village of savoonga, located on an island in the bering strait, according to court documents. Under federal law, only alaska natives may harvest walruses, whales, polar bears and other marine mammals, and only for traditional subsistence purposes. Federal law forbids any sale of raw animal parts from marine mammals, though alaska natives are permitted to sell finished works of art crafted from animal parts. A trial for all three defendants had been slated to start this week over a trafficking conspiracy that involved tusks from an estimated 100 walruses, along with skulls, bones and hides of polar bears and whales, court documents said.

The 75-year-old had been in prison since 1984 after he admitted murdering at least 17 women and raping 30 more over a 12-year period, the ap reports. Hansen — who had a wife and children and owned a bakery in anchorage — was nicknamed the \" butcher baker \" after his crimes emerged. He kidnapped his victims, most of whom were strippers or prostitutes, and flew them in his private plane to remote locations, sometimes letting them go in the wilderness and hunting them down. Hansen was caught after a victim escaped and investigators discovered a map in his home marked with the locations of 17 bodies. \" good riddance to him, \" the assistant district attorney who tried the case tells the anchorage daily news. \" he's one of those kind of guys that you kind of hope every breath he takes in his life, there's some pain associated with it, because he caused such pain. \" hansen was played by john cusack in the 2013 movie the frozen ground, which also starred nicolas cage as an alaska state trooper.",

Gregory edgecombe of london's natural history museum says he's discovered a new species of centipede belonging to the giant centipede family scolopendra that's not only horrible, but the first amphibious centipede species ever found. Edgecombe found two specimens of scolopendra cataracta — named after the latin word for \" waterfall \" — in laos and a dna test proved they were unique. However, the \" horrific-looking \" species, described in journal zookeys, had also been found by edgecombe's colleague while on his honeymoon in thailand back in 2001, reports national geographic. George beccaloni explains he was searching for bugs when he found a centipede hiding under a rock. Upon discovery, it escaped into a stream instead of onto land, as a normal centipede would. When beccaloni finally captured the centipede, he noted it was a powerful swimmer with a body impervious to water, per nature world news. But as no centipedes were known to be amphibious, he simply left the centipede in the natural history museum's collection. Unbeknownst to scientists, another s. Cataracta was there — collected from vietnam in 1928 — but wrongly classified. Edgecombe notes s. Cataracta is only found in southeast asia, is carnivorous, and \" can deliver a painful bite, \" but it wouldn't kill a human. It's more likely to come in handy if the species \" goes into the water at night to hunt aquatic or amphibious invertebrates, \" beccaloni says. \" people tend to study streams in the tropics during the day, but there is probably a whole other range of interesting amphibious things that come out at night, \" he adds ominously.

And the size is not that of the usual centipedes you would chance upon in the garden or in the shower drain. This monster can grow up to 7.9 inches or 20 centimeters long and belongs to the giant centipede family scolopendra. Like all other centipedes and monsters in your childhood, this creature is carnivorous and venomous. Featured last month in a zookeys publication, this amphibious centipede apparently only lives in southeast asia, so the rest of you folks could breathe again and calm your racing hearts. This centipede had actually already been discovered in 2001 by london national history museum entomologist george beccaloni during his honeymoon in thailand. What was supposed to be an nice afternoon of looking for bugs turned horrifically when he chanced upon a giant centipede with long legs and a horrifying dark-green color. When he lifted the rock that the centipede was hiding under, it quickly escaped into the stream and plunged underwater into a rock, instead of the forest. This fueled beccaloni's curiosity, who after quite difficulty, was able to capture the centipede in a large water container. As soon as the centipede was in the jar, apparently, it immediately swam powerfully \" like an eel \" and dove to the bottom, with horizontal undulations of the body. When it was out of the jar, however, water almost immediately rolled off of its body, leaving it completely dry. Beccaloni brought the specimen back to the museum, where after consultations and skeptical observations showed that it might not be amphibious, where it would sit in the collection for many years. It wasn't until years later that beccaloni's colleague gregory edgecombe and his thai student warut siriwut described a new species of centipede. So far there had only been four specimens of the species found and studied, but from that the scientists were able to identify main characteristics of the creature. Like all other kinds"

Like all other centipedes and monsters in your childhood, this creature is carnivorous and venomous. Featured last month in a zookeys publication, this amphibious centipede apparently only lives in southeast asia, so the rest of you folks could breathe again and calm your racing hearts. This centipede had actually already been discovered in 2001 by london national history museum entomologist george beccaloni during his honeymoon in thailand. What was supposed to be an nice afternoon of looking for bugs turned horrifically when he chanced upon a giant centipede with long legs and a horrifying dark-green color. When he lifted the rock that the centipede was hiding under, it quickly escaped into the stream and plunged underwater into a rock, instead of the forest. This fueled beccaloni's curiosity, who after quite difficulty, was able to capture the centipede in a large water container. As soon as the centipede was in the jar, apparently, it immediately swam powerfully \" like an eel \" and dove to the bottom, with horizontal undulations of the body. When it was out of the jar, however, water almost immediately rolled off of its body, leaving it completely dry. Beccaloni brought the specimen back to the museum, where after consultations and skeptical observations showed that it might not be amphibious, where it would sit in the collection for many years. It wasn't until years later that beccaloni's colleague gregory edgecombe and his thai student warut siriwut described a new species of centipede. So far there had only been four specimens of the species found and studied, but from that the scientists were able to identify main characteristics of the creature. Like all other kinds"

But trump is far from losing all support. Paul ryan, marco rubio, ted cruz, and others are still sticking by their endorsements for the time being. And rep.

A senior police official says that toll could rise, since \" some people had taken the bodies of their relatives before police arrived, \" afp reports. Based on witness and police reports cited in the ap and bbc, between 1,000 and 1,500 people had gathered before sunrise outside of where the handout was set to take place. Some reports say the site was a chewing tobacco factory compound, while the ap reports it was the home of a tobacco businessman. It's also unclear based on various reports whether the crowd forced their way through the gates or if the rush happened when the gates were opened. What is clear is the devastation that took place once the stampede started. The bbc notes tv images showed \" hundreds of blood-spattered sandals lying at the factory gate, \" while afp reports of relatives rushing through the entrance to find the bodies of loved ones. Such giveaways are common during the holy month of ramadan, when wealthy families offer up their hand-me-downs to the less fortunate, and similar stampedes have happened in the past, the guardian notes. Pm sheikh hasina offered prayers and \" profound sympathy \" to the victims ' families, while the country's religious affairs ministry said it would be giving around $ 125 each to the families of the deceased for funeral costs. Officials told the news agency the factory owner and at least five others have been arrested for not arranging for public safety. ( bangladesh factories have been plagued with issues. )",

Although it's only circumstantial evidence so far, birders have recently spotted a young eagle with two adult birds and chowing down on food from their beaks — behavior the new york city audubon says suggests it may have been the big apple's first eagle birth in over a century, per the new york times. The president of a local park preservation group notes the sight of the young bird feeding leads him to think there's \" probable nesting \" going on, with an audubon conservation biologist calling the possibility \" exciting. \" but not everyone's so sure this eagle can pick up its resident sticker just yet: no nest has been found, and the city's department of environmental conservation speculates the eagles could have ended up on si from nesting sites in nearby jersey. The times notes that bald eagles, whose numbers were pared down nearly to the point of extinction by post-wwii pesticides, are making a comeback, not only in manhattan, but in other cities as well. An apparently active nest populated by a pair of eagles named vito ( after vito corleone in the godfather ) and linda was spotted in april 2015 on staten island's south shore, per dnainfo, but the dec says their breeding efforts failed. Enthusiasts say it's possible the nest of this fowl family may be hidden somewhere deep in the island's woods, which would explain why it hasn't yet been found. \" the way i grew up, we knew about the national bird, but we never saw it, \" a local who's taken thousands of photos of the island's eagles tells the times. \" now they're here.

Other issues: the hill notes that critics will go after his foreign policy weaknesses, as well as lob accusations that he's \" flip-flopped \" on immigration. He ' ll also have to defend fiscal problems back in wisconsin, adds washington post, including an embarrassingly late budget and financing for a new stadium for the nba's milwaukee bucks — a deal that's been called a \" hot mess. \" finally, walker may need to break from what some see as a one-platform campaign focused on unions. \" you can't run solely on your biography, and so far, he's been almost solely focused on that, \" the ex-irp official tells the hill.

The new york daily news reports new york morning show host craig carton was arrested wednesday and charged with securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy for allegedly scamming investors out of $ 5.6 million to pay off gambling debts. According to court filings, carton had racked up millions in losses at two casinos and owed $ 825,000 to an unidentified person. In an email exchange released by the court, an accomplice suggested carton could flee to costa rica or change his identity and start a new life to escape his debt, bloomberg reports. Instead, carton allegedly started a fake ticket reselling business. He allegedly told investors he would use their money to buy blocks of tickets for major music events through agreements with promoters and venues then resell those tickets, nbc new york reports. But: \" carton... Had no deals to purchase any tickets at all, \" us attorney joon kim says. Kim says carton was actually running \" a sham, designed to fleece investors out of millions. \" carton's alleged operation is described by authorities as \" ponzi-like. \" carton, who has been co-hosting boomer &amp; carton for a decade and reportedly earns $ 250,000 a year, is facing up to 45 years in jail and millions in fines.

Scores of lawsuits and hundreds of liens came from waiters, bartenders, plumbers, real estate brokers, and even lawyers who say trump never paid them for their work. On a single project, atlantic city's taj mahal casino, records show 253 subcontractors didn't receive full payment on time. Trump — who told reuters last year that he \" renegotiates \" with around 15 % of contractors — says that's just how he operates. \" let's say that they do a job that's not good, or a job that they didn't finish, or a job that was way late. I ' ll deduct from their contract, absolutely, \" he says. \" that's what the country should be doing. \" usa today, however, notes that the volume of lawsuits suggests that either trump and his businesses are being unscrupulous, or he's terrible at choosing contractors. In many cases, trump organizations appear to have used their legal might to overpower those claiming they were stiffed, sometimes leaving them bankrupt. One firm to go bust was that of cabinetmaker edward j. Friel, which never received the $ 83,600 it billed trump for work at the harrah's at trump plaza casino in 1984. \" that began the demise of the edward j. Friel company, \" says friel's son paul, who was the company's accountant.

Better yet, the message delivered by the patient was a great one: i ' m not in pain. The canadian press and the bbc explain that doctors studied the patient's brain waves as they voiced a command: he should think about playing tennis if he were not in pain or about walking around the house if he were. The activities trigger different parts of the brain — motor skills vs. Visual associations — and the man's brain waves suggested he was pain-free. \" scott has been able to show he has a conscious, thinking mind, \" says a british neuroscientist, referring to 39-year-old scott routley. \" we have scanned him several times and his pattern of brain activity shows he is clearly choosing to answer our questions.

In 2009, the man says, he got sick after drinking a can of the soda. After he complained to pepsi, it sent someone to collect the mouse, and reportedly wouldn't give it back until it had decomposed — thereby apparently preventing the man from using it for \" additional testing, \" as the alton telegraph put it back then. But it gets crazier: pepsi recently called for a dismissal of the case, notes the madison st. Clair record. The company pointed to expert testimony that a mouse in a soda would turn into a \" jelly-like \" material before the soda reached the customer. In other words, gizmodo notes, pepsi is essentially saying that \" you'd never know if there was a mouse in your soda. \" well, that's a relief.",

        "summary": "Barack obama may have exited the white house, but some of his administration staffers are unexpectedly sticking around. New white house press secretary sean spicer says 50 state department and national security officials who served under obama will stay at their posts temporarily, while obama appointee thomas a. Shannon jr. Has been named as acting secretary of state pending rex tillerson's confirmation, the new york times reports. The goal is to ensure \" continuity of government \" as just 30 of 660 executive appointments have been filled, according to the partnership for public service. Politico has reviewed the last five administrations and says the last time a cabinet was filled this slowly ( only 2 of 15 nominees have gotten the ok from congressional committees ) was in 1989 under george hw bush. Politico quotes one democratic senator as saying trump's choice to go with \" billionaires with enormously complicated financial situations, and people who have enormous conflicts of interests \" has hampered things. Republicans have instead accused democrats of dragging out the confirmation process, while some transition officials have put the blame on chris christie, who headed trump's transition team before he was fired in november. The times, however, says it has viewed the transition plan created by christie and details what it saw, including guidelines to complete cabinet and ambassador appointments in december. Despite the delay, one transition official doesn't get all the fuss. The transition has \" gone pretty well and this is the best you can expect, \" he tells the daily beast. \" if anybody expects this to be a frictionless process, they're kind of nuts. \"",

Kimberly richardson, 25, who was six months pregnant, made the chilling call behind the triangle town center where she worked: \" help, \" she says. \" i've been shot. \" asked to give her phone number, she says, \" i can't... I can't talk. \" between long silences, wral reports, richardson added the key words: \" he shot me. \" richardson later died in hospital, and her daughter was saved by an emergency cesarean section. Richardson's boyfriend, 25-year-old daniel steele, was arrested at his home that night and promptly charged with first-degree murder. No motive was given, and it's not clear whether steele is the baby's father, though one of richardson's friends tells the news &amp; observer he is. We do know he once worked as a security guard at the town center, but quit in october. As for richardson, \" she was really, really happy \" about being pregnant, says a friend, who describes her as devoted to faith and music. But the friend declined to say more: \" i'd rather focus more on who she was as a person and how much she pursued the lord and i want to focus on the good of that baby, \" she says. The baby is still hospitalized, her condition under wraps. Meanwhile, a fundraising account has raised nearly $ 9,000 as of this writing to help the family with funeral costs and possible medical bills for the daughter, who richardson had already named lacy grey: she \" was born premature due to the tragic loss of her mother, \" the account says.

After a long night of drinking, the pair ended up on less-than-friendly terms, and tostee locked wright on the balcony. Drunk and locked out of his apartment, wright, who was visiting from new zealand, tried to climb down the fire escape, but fell. Prosecutors argued tostee was guilty of murder or manslaughter because he had intimidated wright to the point that she feared for her own safety. But, as the bbc reports, a queensland jury didn't buy that argument, acquitting tostee of all charges after four days of deliberations. The piece of evidence at the heart of the case is an hours-long recording tostee secretly made of the conversation between the two. The recording shows a charged night that included consensual sex, multiple arguments and bouts of physical violence, and several instances of discussing death, even including the idea of falling off the balcony. Minutes before locking her out on the balcony, tostee can be heard on the recording claiming that wright had attacked him. \" you're lucky i haven't chucked you off my balcony, \" he says. \" if you try to pull anything, i ' ll knock you out. \" the australian broadcasting corporation has other relevant excerpts from the recording. Prosecutors argued the recording proved that tostee had terrified wright to the point that she tried to run away from him, while defense attorneys argued tostee was trying to protect himself from a drunk and unstable woman.",

Jesse mclean staff reporter when he first saw a video of a toronto constable threatening to arrest a g20 protester for blowing bubbles, one youtube user was so livid, he couldn't stop writing comments. In fact, the man, who uses the alias \"theforcebewithme, \" can't even remember writing the specific comment that now has him defending a $ 1.2 million defamation lawsuit launched by toronto's now notorious \"officer bubbles. \" const. Adam josephs seeks to compel the google-owned youtube to reveal the identity of the person who created and posted the videos as well as any information it has on the 24 other users who made allegedly defamatory remarks. The case highlights a collision between two worlds: the wild-west of social media, where people under aliases throw insults without pause versus the laws of the old media world, where people are held accountable for everything they write. \"i thought my opinion was my opinion in this country. I probably might not even post anymore, \"",

Adam josephs earned the nickname \"officer bubbles \" when a youtube video was released of him threatening to arrest a girl at the g20 summit for blowing bubbles. Const. Adam josephs did not find the girls bubble blowing funny, and he did not appreciate any of the comments or cartoons that were made of him on youtube. \"officer bubbles \" is now suing for $ 1.2 million dollars. According to the star, const. Adam joshephs isn't suing for the video that was posted of the incident ( see video below ), but instead, is suing for the mean comments and cartoons that made fun of him. The cartoons depict \"officer bubbles \" arresting everyone from santa clause to president obama. One of the 24 commentators involved in the lawsuit, who goes by the name of theforcebewithme, said \"i thought my opinion was my opinion in this country. I probably might not even post anymore. \" the cartoons have already been removed from youtube, which could put an end to the lawsuit.

It's a safe bet they never foresaw this application: this super thin and strong form of carbon is entering the world of fashion — in the form of a little black dress with tiny led lights that change color in time with the model's breath. ( see a video here. ) graphene powered the lights and functioned as a sensor, while nylon fabric helped fill out the dress itself. The team behind it says it suggests dresses of the future could change color on the fly, notes smithsonian. The dress was created by high-tech clothing expert francesca rosella for tech-fashion company cute circuit, and britain's next top model finalist bethan sowerby took it for a spin on the catwalk in manchester, reports the manchester evening news. Because graphene is, as the bbc describes it, stronger than diamonds yet stretchable like rubber, researchers say it is still in its \" infancy \" in terms of its use in real-world applications. The silicon republic reports that among several recent breakthroughs, graphene has been shown to transmit massive amounts of electric current at the nano level, which could have far-reaching effects on electronics.

Researchers who analyzed 123 observational studies on saturated and trans fats published in the last 30 years found people who consumed a diet high in saturated fats saw no increased risk of ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, or death from all causes — though the certainty was \" very low \" and researchers say they may pose other health risks, per new scientist. People who consumed a diet high in trans fats, however, saw a 34 % boost in their risk of death from any cause, a 21 % increased risk of chd, and a 28 % higher risk of death from chd, per a press release. They found no link between trans fats and ischemic stroke and couldn't confirm an association between trans fats and type 2 diabetes based on inconsistencies in the studies reviewed. Saturated fats generally come from animal products, like butter, meat, and egg yolks, and some plant products, like chocolate and palm oils. \" ruminant \" trans fats also occur naturally in some of those foods. But it's the \" industrially produced \" trans fats in margarine and processed food that consumers should limit, lead author russell de souza tells livescience. Made from plant oils, these fats — to be phased out within three years — are more harmful. However, \" there is no one nutrient or food that's responsible for all heart disease, diabetes, or death, \" de souza says. \" the whole diet matters. \" that means when cutting back on fats, people should be careful not to replace them with other poor choices, like sugars and starches. Instead, choose fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and unsaturated fats like olive and canola oils, de souza says. ( you might also want to steer clear of southern food. )",

That's according to an analysis of 123 studies of dietary fat and cardiovascular health. Most dietary advice recommends limiting the consumption of saturated fats, which are found in butter, milk, meat and egg, due to the risk of developing heart disease. But russell de souza of mcmaster university in ontario, canada, and his team were unable to find a clear association between these fats and the chances of heart or cardiovascular disease. This wasn't the case with industrial trans fats, which are made by hydrogenating plant oils and are found in margarine and some processed foods like cake. The analysis suggests that eating more trans fat is associated with a 21 per cent rise in the"

        "summary": "Don't be surprised if this beast appears in your nightmares tonight. Shark expert mauricio hoyos padilla has released footage of a massive, 20-foot-long great white shark that might just be the largest ever caught on camera, reports abc news. Though padilla says he first found the shark near guadalupe island off the mexican coast in 2013, it isn't clear when this video was recorded; an earlier video of the shark appearing to high-five a diver was released in june. Nicknamed \" deep blue, \" the female shark is estimated to weigh 5,000 pounds and was believed to have been pregnant when the footage was taken. It shows deep blue approaching a cage of divers before swimming toward a camera — seemingly with a smile on her face. \" a shark of that size is at least 50 years old and that tells me protection and conservation efforts are really working, \" says padilla of nonprofit marine research organization pelagios-kakunjá. \" deep blue has been spared from longlines and the inherent dangers of being in the wild, and somehow she has found her way in the vast ocean. \" though great white sharks often visit guadalupe island to feed on seals in november and december, padilla says they head to shallow waters to give birth. \" these areas are close to shore and very vulnerable to several human threats, \" he says, per the washington post. The video of deep blue, who is tagged, has tallied 2.7 million views since it was posted on facebook on monday. ( this heartwarming video shows a great white rescue. )",

Abrams — the former minority leader of the state house — defeated former state rep. Stacey evans by a large margin to secure the democratic nomination, the atlanta journal-constitution reports.

Air force veteran gina ortiz jones won the democratic nomination for a house seat, and would be the first openly lesbian congresswoman from the state if elected. Score one for the establishment.

His path toward mr. World began when he saw an ad for the mr.

That is when i felt that i could do it. \" and he did, winning the title in 2015. Speaking of that good nature, the journal reports khandelwal enjoys visiting with his grandmother and volunteering. Other desirable hobbies include cooking and table tennis, reports the india times. A press release explains the 46 would-be mr. Worlds were chosen from thousands of applicants and subjected to 12 days of \" fierce competition \" from which khandelwal emerged victorious and was handed the $ 50,000 prize.
