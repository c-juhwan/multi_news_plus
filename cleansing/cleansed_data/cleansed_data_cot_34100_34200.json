A pilot identified as colonel hassan hamada, 44, went awol during a training mission near the jordanian border today, then landed in jordan and requested political asylum, reuters reports. His motives aren't terribly mysterious: his hometown of kfar takharim has been under artillery and helicopter fire in recent days. Hamada reportedly smuggled his family to turkey before his fateful flight. Jordanian officials are currently debriefing hamada. They tell the ap he ' ll be allowed to stay in the country on \" humanitarian grounds, \" since if he returned to syria he might be tortured or killed. Syria is one of jordan's top arab trading partners. The defection is noteworthy because the air force has long been considered one of assad's most loyal units. Plus, as the atlantic puts it, \" defecting from the army is one thing, but flying off in a blaze of glory makes for quite the symbolic kiss-off. \"",

Prosecutors allege teacher's aide erica kenny, 22, and teacher chanese white, 28, encouraged about a dozen boys and girls, aged 4 to 6, to battle each other on the playground at lightbridge academy in cranford, nj, per the new york post. They were \" throwing each other to the ground, hitting each other, \" a prosecutor tells cbs new york. \" most parents would be astonished by the behavior, \" another adds. The so-called fight club came to light when kenny sent videos of the fights to friends on snapchat, prosecutors say, and investigators got their hands on the footage. At one point, a voice believed to be kenny's eggs on the kids and quotes fight club, reports nbc new york. No serious injuries have been reported. Police believe the videos were recorded on aug. 13 but are exploring whether this was more than a one-time incident. \" as parents and caregivers, we are shocked and saddened by this isolated incident and we have assisted the prosecutor's office from the start of its investigation into this matter, \" says a statement from lightbridge, which has since fired both women. A mother whose son was in the women's class in the 2013-2014 school year tells nj.com \" he came home with a broken finger once, and now i ' m worried about what happened while he was there. \" she adds the day care offers a live feed of classrooms for parents, but cameras don't show the playground.

Normally, a spacecraft headed to the iss circles the earth 16 times during the trip; in the latest excursion, the soyuz spacecraft orbited the planet just four times, thanks in part to equipment and computer software improvements. \" we're trying to cut that amount of time that they had to be in those close quarters, \" says a nasa rep. Still, officials may ultimately decide the longer trip is better because it gives astronauts more time to get acclimated to space.

The infamous borough of indie beards, craft beer and defunct artisanal mayonnaise-only stores is adding another highly unnecessary yet totally predictable entity to its list of food offerings: an avocado-only restaurant. Avocaderia calls itself \"the world's first avocado bar, \" which is the real pits for a similar-sounding restaurant in amsterdam that opened earlier this year. The new york joint will serve smoothies, salads, bowls and ― you guessed it ― toast, all made with that delicious green instagram gold. Avocaderia avocaderia's beet hummus toast. A press release from the brand said the restaurant, which opened this month in sunset park, was inspired by partner francesco brachetti's move to mexico several years ago. \"avocados in mexico were delicious and widely used in many different dishes, \" said brachetti",

Avocaderia, as the new avocado-centric carryout restaurant is set to be called, should be opening \"soon \" in brooklyn – which, outside of maybe mexico, is where i'd expect a dedicated",

Claiming to be the world's first quick-serve avocado bar, avocaderia will be serving the creamy fruit on every single item on its menu when it opens at brooklyn's industry city in sunset park this friday. Courtesy of avocaderia visitors will be able to sink their teeth into a wide variety of avocado toasts, with toppings ranging from beets and hummus to poached eggs. Avocaderia's menu, which will change based on seasonal ingredients to offer fresh selections, is divided into four different categories: toasts, smoothies, salads and bowls, and specials. Courtesy of avocaderia the specials, which will change on a monthly basis, include selections like their quinoa bowl, garnished with avocado mash, and sandwiches topped with avocado and sprinkled with a creamy yogurt and fresh"

The alleged attack in douma occurred late saturday amid a resumed offensive by syrian government forces after the collapse of a truce with the army of islam rebel group. First responders said they found families suffocated in homes and shelters, with foam on their mouths. The syrian civil defense were able to document 42 fatalities but were impeded by strong odors that gave rescuers difficulties breathing, said a rep for the group, known as the white helmets. A statement by the white helmets and the syrian american medical society, a relief group, said more than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centers with difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth, and burning of the eyes. It said patients gave off a chlorine-like smell. Some had blue skin, a sign of oxygen deprivation. The syrian observatory for human rights said at least 80 were killed, including around 40 from suffocation. But it said the suffocations were the result of shelters collapsing on people inside. \" until this minute, no one has been able to find out the kind of agent that was used, \" said the white helmets'rep. He said the government was also targeting homes, clinics, and first responder facilities with conventional explosives and barrel bombs. Videos posted online by the white helmets showed victims, including toddlers in diapers, breathing through oxygen masks at makeshift hospitals. The syrian government said the claims were \" fabrications.... The army, which is advancing rapidly and with determination, does not need to use any kind of chemical agents, \" it said. Says a state department rep, per cnn: \" russia's protection of the assad regime and failure to stop the use of chemical weapons in syria calls into question its commitment to resolving the overall crisis. \"",

In an interview with german channel rtl, annegret raunigk says it is \" quite a strain battling against the cliches \" about her age, the guardian reports. The soon-to-retire teacher, who was treated at an ivf clinic in ukraine, says she has \" always liked life with kids \" and \" the constant challenges \" involved, and she isn't nervous about having to raise young children in her 70s. Raunigk said she became pregnant to grant her 9-year-old daughter's wish for a younger sibling, though the girl appeared alarmed when she learned her mother, who's due in august, will enter the hospital soon to lower the risk of premature birth, the guardian notes. \" i don't interfere in anyone else's life and i don't expect them to interfere in mine, \" says raunigk, who was already germany's oldest mother when she gave birth to her 13th child at the age of 55. She says she believes \" it should be up to everyone to decide for themselves \" whether they take advantage of what science has made possible. Her critics include bioethicist arthur caplan, who calls the high-risk pregnancy \" unethical \" and \" irresponsible. \" having quads is hard enough on the body at 21, he writes at nbc news, and at 65, raunigk \" seems to have entered a world of indifference as to what is likely to happen to her four babies. \" ( a 42-year-old mississippi woman expecting triplets had quadruplet girls last year instead. )",

The patient paid schreiber $ 1,000 cash, was given five pills, passed out, and woke to what the sun sentinel describes as a \" deformed, one-inch-long penis. \" the warrant contains some graphic details: the man took off his bandages to find \" his penis had retracted so far that it protruded less than one inch from his body. \" schreiber's advice, according to the patient, was to \" just put two sticks [ on ] either side of his penis and wrap it up to keep it straight. \" he's now left with a mutilated penis and an inability to engage in sexual activity.

As livescience reports, hansen's disease is rare in the us, with just 100 to 200 cases reported in a typical year, and it's not clear where the children may have caught it. It's possible to get infected through contact with armadillos in the us, says one infectious-diseases specialist, but the risk is low. It's also possible to get infected through \" prolonged close contact \" with others who have the disease, though probably not through casual contact. Plus, an estimated 95 % of people are naturally immune. California officials are not overly concerned about contagion, the los angeles times reports, but the press-enterprise notes that the school saw a high number of absences after the diagnoses. A significant number of the estimated 6,500 people in the us with hansen's disease were born in another country, and may have contracted it there; transmission is more common in some african, asian, and south american countries. The disease is caused by a bacterium, and it can take two to 10 years before an infected person shows symptoms. As cbs la notes, leprosy is commonly associated with peeling skin and sores. It can be easily treated with antibiotics, but if untreated, hansen's disease can permanently damage the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes; it can even paralyze or blind sufferers. The children's school disinfected classrooms, but \" almost all of it will be overkill because this disease is not that contagious, \" says the specialist. There's just quite a bit of \" stigma \" attached to it, he adds. It will be weeks before the cases are confirmed to be hansen's. ( click for more on the armadillo connection. )",

The average for december in the country's capital is 18 hours. This followed an atypically wet and chilly summer, which prompted more than the usual number of calls to local mental health services and visits to psychiatrists. \" when they hear about this, many people say, ' it's clear now why i was depressed, ' \" roman vilfand, the head of russia's weather service, says. Vilfand notes the bleakness was brought about by warm air masses sweeping in from the atlantic and saturating the sky with clouds. The lack of sunlight isn't the only issue now that it's winter. With the darkness comes extreme cold, with temperatures throughout russia plummeting into deep-freeze territory. In yakutsk ( also spelled yakutia ), generally considered to be the country's coldest area, temps have hovered at around minus 80 degrees fahrenheit, the bbc reports. The siberian times notes it was so cold in oymyakon, sometimes dubbed the coldest village in the world, that a new, recently installed electronic thermometer actually broke. To underscore the brutal weather, one local yakutskian posted a picture of herself on instagram showing her bundled up, her eyelashes crusted with ice. \" this is nothing but a trip to work in [ -52 ], \" she posted. \" now, every girl in yakutsk has a photo like this. \" ( it's approaching antarctic levels there. )",

According to the bbc, the law passed wednesday creates punishments including fines up to $ 4,300 and classes about the horrors of prostitution for anyone caught buying sex. Supporters of the law, which overturns a 2003 law that put legal responsibility on the sex seller, say it will make sex workers safer, and france's prime minister calls it a victory for women's rights. One women's rights activist says sex workers can now call the police for help without fear of punishment. The ap reports the law will also let foreign sex workers in france get temporary resident papers if they leave prostitution. One lawmaker says 85 % of prostitutes in france are the victims of human trafficking. But sex workers protested against the law during its final debate. In addition to the new law potentially making it harder for them to make a living, many sex workers and advocates say it actually puts them in danger. One opponent says the law will make johns hide their identities, which makes it easier for them to hurt sex workers. Others say sex workers will now be asked to meet johns in private at their homes instead of a safer place. Opponents claim it will also stop johns from seeking help when they fear a sex worker is being harmed. There are an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 sex workers in france, where prostitution remains legal. A number of other european countries have introduced similar laws since 1999, but france's law includes some of the toughest penalties for buying sex in europe.",

            "Paris ( ap ) — french lawmakers on wednesday approved a bill against prostitution and sex trafficking that bans buying sex, not selling it. Customers will face fines and be made to attend awareness classes on the harms of the sex trade. The legislation, which passed 64-12 in the parliament's lower house, the national assembly, makes french law one of the toughest against sex buyers in europe. Prostitution in itself is legal in france — though brothels, pimping and the sale of sex by minors are illegal. The new measure does away with a 2003 law that banned passive soliciting by sex workers on the street and thus put the legal onus on prostitutes. This new bill focuses the punishment on the client, introducing a 1,500-euro ( $ 1,700 ) fine that would rise to 3,750 euros for a sex buyer's second offense.

Those convicted would also have to attend classes to learn about the conditions faced by prostitutes. It has taken more than two years to pass the controversial legislation because of differences between the two houses of parliament over the issue.

            "Paris ( ap ) — french lawmakers on wednesday approved a bill against prostitution and sex trafficking that bans buying sex, not selling it. Customers will face fines and be made to attend awareness classes on the harms of the sex trade. The legislation, which passed 64-12 in the parliament's lower house, the national assembly, makes french law one of the toughest against sex buyers in europe. Prostitution in itself is legal in france — though brothels, pimping and the sale of sex by minors are illegal. The new measure does away with a 2003 law that banned passive soliciting by sex workers on the street and thus put the legal onus on prostitutes. This new bill focuses the punishment on the client, introducing a 1,500-euro ( $ 1,700 ) fine that would rise to 3,750 euros for a sex buyer's second offense. The convicted client will be obliged to",

Those convicted would also have to attend classes to learn about the conditions faced by prostitutes. It has taken more than two years to pass the controversial legislation because of differences between the two houses of parliament over the issue.

Everitt jameson of modesto was reported for suspicious activity on facebook after allegedly posting gifs from october's fatal attack in new york city. According to the san francisco chronicle, undercover fbi agents started communicating with him via social media on dec. 11. \"jameson has espoused radical jihadi beliefs, including authoring social media posts that are supportive of terrorism, communicating with people he believes share his jihadi views, and offering to provide services to such people, \" fbi agent christopher mckinney writes in an affidavit. Court documents filed friday state jameson, a tow truck driver, asked an fbi agent he believed to be an isis leader for an assault rifle, ammunition, and pipe bomb materials, the los angeles times reports. Jameson allegedly said pier 39, a popular tourist destination, was a good location for an attack and planned to use explosives to herd people toward where he could kill them. He earned a sharpshooter rifle qualification in both m16 and ak-47 rifles from the us marine corps before being discharged for not disclosing his asthma. The fbi searched jameson's home in modesto on wednesday, finding guns, explosives, and a signed note taking credit for an attack. Part of the note read: \" you've allowed donald j trump to give away [ jerusalem ] to the jews. \" documents state jameson appeared to get cold feet about the attack after an fbi employee accidentally called him on monday.",

The swedish carmaker, owned by the chinese firm geely, is poised to become the world's first traditional auto manufacturer to start phasing out cars powered by the internal combustion engine alone. That means that, starting in 2019, all new volvo car models will either be all electric or hybrids, reuters reports. Five new models, which will be churned out at various plants around the world, are planned for the period between 2019 and 2021. Models launched before 2019 that run strictly using the old-fashioned engine will continue to do so. \" people increasingly demand electrified cars, \" volvo car group ceo hakan samuelsson says, adding that the company's goal is to meet those customer demands now and in the future. With this announcement, volvo not only inches closer to full-on competition with tesla, which so far dominates the electric-vehicle market, but it also aligns with china's own big push toward electric. The wall street journal and forbes note the country's recent policy initiatives in the electric-car arena, as well as sales of electric cars that topped half a million in 2016 — almost four times the number sold in the us, and double the number sold in europe.

( other reports have cited an article at breitbart news, but it relies on the heat street piece. ) the two articles say that us intelligence officials went to the fisa court ( which deals with intelligence matters ) because they wanted to investigate possible activity between two banks in russia and a computer server in trump tower ( which, to make matters more confusing, might actually be located in philadelphia ). Excerpts: heat street: \"two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to heat street that the fbi sought, and was granted, a fisa court warrant in october, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'u.s. Persons ' in donald trump's campaign with ties to russia. \" bbc: it says justice department lawyers went to the fisa court. \" their first application, in june, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in july and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 october, three weeks before election day. \" the fact checker's assessment? even if the stories are accurate, and that hasn't been confirmed, they do not say that president obama was behind the request. Plus, they involve a computer server, not the tapping of phone lines. And, finally, they \" do not back up the administration's revised claim of politically motivated investigations. \" as a result, trump gets the blog's worst rating of four pinocchios.

        "summary": "Coffee, what can't you do? it's been suggested the beverage may be able to lower your risk for multiple sclerosis, melanoma, and retinal degeneration, among other things. Now it appears the brewed beverage might also help men who are suffering from a decidedly sensitive issue: erectile dysfunction. A study published in plos one by researchers at the university of texas health science center at houston found that men who consumed more caffeinated beverages ( coffee, tea, soda, and sports drinks were all used in the study ) were less likely to be impotent than subjects who refrained from or drank very little of it, cbs news reports. But although a variety of men ( e.g., those who were obese or had high blood pressure ) seemed to benefit from coffee's boost, there was one group on whom the caffeine had a negligible effect: diabetic men. The study had 3,724 men take a health and nutritional survey that asked them about their caffeine intake and whether they suffered from ed, per the study. Two to three cups o ' joe per day seemed to be the sweet spot in terms of helping with impotence: men who downed that amount ( about 85 to 170 milligrams of caffeine ) were 42 % less likely to report ed than men who polished off the lowest amount of caffeine in the study ( zero to 7 milligrams ), cbs notes; meanwhile, guys who started to surpass that three-cup cap and finished 171 to 303 milligrams of caffeine were 39 % less likely to report ed than their caffeine-deprived co-participants. So how exactly does coffee mitigate this problem? researchers think that the caffeine may enhance blood flow to the penis by getting certain muscles and arteries down there to chill out and relax, notes cbs. ( coffee may be able to clean out a different set of pipes: your arteries. )",

She digs into the existing research on caffeine — most dehydration-related studies zero in on that particular element of the drink, largely because it's known to stymie the absorption of sodium, which then needs to be flushed out. And it turns out one of the most touted studies is from 1928, and involved a participant pool of... Three. They had their urine measured after drinking four cups of coffee daily ( and sometimes tea ), cutting those drinks off for two months. They then returned to caffeine, drinking caffeine-infused water, and their urine volume rose, indicating dehydration. But what have more recent studies found? a review of 10 studies by a uconn researcher found no damning conclusions: hammond writes that 80 % of the comparisons involving caffeinated water showed no difference in urine volume. Another study found a 41 % increase in volume, but the study participants had refrained from drinking coffee before the study, so hammond points out that the finding isn't necessarily applicable to regular coffee drinkers. But a january study out of the uk's birmingham university may be: participants habitually drank three to six cups daily, reports npr, and drank coffee in the study's phase one and then an equal amount of water in phase two. They had their urine volume and kidney function analyzed. The bottom line: no sign of excess dehydration.

But when we're exhorted to drink six or eight glasses of water a day ( a disputed figure that i've discussed previously ), it's usually emphasised that drinks like coffee and tea don't count towards your daily liquid total because they're dehydrating. Or so we're told. What's the evidence? although tea and coffee contain many different substances the one on which most research focuses is caffeine. Even then there is so little research on the topic, that one of the most frequently mentioned studies was conducted way back in 1928 with a sample of just three people. The three men were studied over the course of two winters. Sometimes they were required to drink four cups of coffee a day; sometimes they drank mainly tea and at other times they abstained or drank water laced with pure caffeine. Meanwhile the volume of their urine was measured regularly. The authors concluded that if the men consumed caffeine-laced water after a two month period of abstinence from both coffee and tea, the volume of their urine increased by 50 %, but when they drank coffee regularly again they became inured"

Not only could police not find her killer, but no one at ellis prison farm could identify the girl — who was white, five and a half feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes — and an investigation that followed offered no clues about who she might be. Now, sheriff clint mcrae and the walker county sheriff's office hope that sharing the few facts they have will lead to new information. Authorities say the girl — last seen wearing jeans, a yellow shirt, a white knit sweater, a rectangular brown stone pendant on a gold chain, and leather sandals — first visited a gas station on the city's south side, where workers gave her directions to ellis prison farm. She left on foot, eventually arriving at a truck stop on i-45 on the north side of huntsville. There, she again asked for directions, which employees wrote down. When they asked if the girl's parents knew her whereabouts, she said, \" who cares? \" she did, however, say she was from the rockport and aransas pass area about 260 miles away, per the corpus christi caller-times, though no one there could identify her.

The original ad has been clicked more than 4 million times. The kids, ages 2 to 11, are identified only by their first names, and lada didn't reveal much else about them other than to say they're all in different foster homes and that their case has been removed from the state website because so many inquiries have poured in. Some critics have suggested the response has been so great because the kids are white: one overland park resident, for instance, says the children look like they stepped out of a \" lands ' end ad \" and that kids of other races — the star notes kansas has around 1,200 kids looking for families — don't get the same hype. Still, the director of an unrelated kansas nonprofit says she hopes the kids end up under one roof. \" that bond between siblings is the strongest thing they've got when parents are gone, \" she says. It's not impossible: a couple in missouri is in the process of adopting five siblings, ages 6 to 15, from a filipino orphanage, reports the joplin globe.

        "summary": "The navy seal who says he's the one who killed osama bin laden was identified yesterday as robert o ' neill by sofrep, a website dedicated to military and special-ops news. O ' neill is said to be the same man referred to as \" the shooter \" in a march 2013 esquire article about the raid and who plans to reveal himself in an interview airing during a two-part fox news special next week. Whether the interviewee turns out to be o ' neill or someone else, that person joins matt bissonnette on the government's persona non grata list for speaking publicly about the mission: a letter posted on sofrep from naval special warfare command talks up the \" quiet professionals \" who typically make up seal teams, adding that \" little individual credit \" is ever given because of the \" nature of our profession \" and that one person shouldn't get all the credit and glory for an operation that took years to plan and execute. Indeed, a pentagon statement to business insider shows that the defense department is steaming about the supposedly broken seal \" ethos, \" which notes, \" i do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions. \" although the statement stresses that \" former or retired service members are free to... Exercise their first amendment rights, \" it warns they're still bound by nondisclosure agreements and advises the \" individual \" set to appear on fox to not blab about sensitive info. At least one person is calling out the nswc: former navy seal jonathan gilliam ( also a fox news commentator ) penned an open letter that says, \" please explain to our community how sending an open letter to your'teammates'through the press, preaching about the quiet professional, was somehow the proper example to your fellow seals. \" ( bissonnette is now under criminal investigation. )",

Looking back at the crisis and incidents of 2014, it's easy to make educated predictions about what security vulnerabilities are most likely on our enemies ' hit list in the year to come. 2014 saw a rapidly scaled back approach to fighting overseas war and a breakdown of proactive military planning.

A sheriff's deputy testified at a preliminary hearing for one of the boys accused of trying to kill deserae turner in a small utah town that the teen said the plot started as a joke, but his friend told him it \" would be pretty easy to get rid of her, \" people reports. The deputy testified that before the attack, one boy texted, \" let's get this done, bro, \" to his friend, who responded: \" yeah man, hold on. Are we clear? \" prosecutors want both boys to be tried as adults for attempted murder, kutv reports. Deserae has been in the hospital since feb. 16, when searchers in smithfield found her in the dry canal bed she was allegedly lured to by the boys, who are also accused of stealing $ 55 from the girl's purse and destroying her cellphone. In a march 10 video shown in court, deserae said she couldn't recall much, but she remembered being in a muddy canal with the boys, the deseret news reports. Police say she was shocked to discover her supposed friends allegedly tried to kill her. The preliminary hearing for the boy accused of pulling the trigger was held on tuesday and the second boy's was on wednesday, the salt lake tribune reports. The judge ruled for both cases to move forward and will decide later on whether to move the cases to adult court.",

Mathematicians andrew beveridge and a student from macalester college turned to \" network science \" to sort it out, searching for instances in which two characters ' names appeared within 15 words of each other in a storm of swords — the third book in the series and inspiration for the third and fourth seasons of the hbo show, per entertainment weekly — to create a network of links. Jon snow, for example, was often linked to samwell tarly but never to daenerys targaryen. Tyrion lannister boasted not only the most connections, but also most interactions and connections to important characters, per the study. \" our analysis suggests that he is the true protagonist of the book. \" \" acting as the hand of the king, tyrion is thrust into the center of the political machinations of the ( capital ) city, \" the authors write. Lannister was followed closely by jon snow and, perhaps surprisingly, sansa stark. \" jon snow is uniquely positioned in the network, with connections to highborn lords, the night's watch militia, and the savage wildlings beyond the wall, \" the authors say. While stark appears somewhat secluded in king's landing, her network importance lies in connections to characters who \" are aware of her value as a stark heir \" and \" repeatedly use her as a pawn in their plays for power. \" beveridge tells quartz that while targaryen is isolated on essos, she remains connected to important characters on westeros. \" daenerys really represents the future — you can see what's about to happen based on the people she's linked with, \" he says.

A woman lost control of her car on the interstate shortly before 3am sunday in florida, crashing into a guardrail, wftx reports. Danielle hagmann of fort myers saw the accident and stopped to help. Her father, steven berkowitz, tells the news-press \" it's not in her nature \" to not offer help when it's needed. And despite what happened next, he says hagmann \" does not regret stopping. \" while hagmann was helping the woman, another driver slammed into the crashed car, pinning hagmann against the guardrail. Hagmann lost both legs — one just above the knee and the other mid-thigh — and remains in intensive care. The 30-year-old massage therapist didn't qualify for health insurance at work and hadn't signed up for insurance through the affordable care act. Berkowitz estimates that his daughter's medical bills and prosthetic costs will total $ 1 million over the next year and $ 2 million for the rest of her life. Hagmann and her wife also have five children, including three foster children, and her future as a massage therapist is very much in doubt. Her family has set up two gofundme pages to raise money for her medical care. As of this writing, they've received about $ 18,000 in total donations. The other two people involved in the crashes escaped with minor injuries. An investigation into the second crash is ongoing.",

Researchers have turned to 57,000 women over age 55 in the women's health initiative program to conduct the largest study of its kind on the relationship between oral health and mortality, and, reporting in the journal of the american heart association, they note that \" how many teeth you have in your mouth at a given point in time \" is a pretty good indication of your \" overall, cumulative health status, \" as one researcher tells cnn. Researchers felt it was important to study the population of older women since menopause has a negative effect on oral health, medscape reports. Older women with a history of periodontal disease, which is a gum infection, have a 12 % higher risk of premature death from any cause than older women without such a history, per a press release. Similarly, women who experienced complete loss of natural teeth were 17 % more likely to die early, though it's an epidemiological study and does not demonstrate that oral decay is the root cause of these premature deaths, reports the new york times. The research did not find a direct correlation between gum disease and heart disease, so researchers call for more regular screenings of oral health alongside screenings for, say, diabetes and high cholesterol as yet another preventive measure to help assess overall health as we age.

        "summary": "Tuesday is primary day in new york, the biggest prize until california votes on june 7, and all five remaining campaigns went into overdrive monday. Polls suggest big wins lie ahead for front-runners hillary clinton and donald trump — but there's still plenty of room for surprises, and in this year's races, every delegate counts. A roundup of coverage: this is the first competitive gop presidential primary in the state in 40 years, and the first in 24 years for democrats, politico reports in a look at how merely winning may not be enough for clinton and trump. To get all 95 delegates up for grabs, trump needs at least 50 % of the vote in every congressional district. Fivethirtyeight takes a district-by-district look at the gop primary and finds that trump's weakest spots could be brooklyn, where russian jews favor ted cruz, and manhattan, where a \" ridiculously \" well-educated group of voters could hand john kasich a victory. Politico has a list of districts to watch in both races, noting that around half of the state's democratic votes will be cast in new york city, but only around 15 % of republican ones. The washington post reports on monday's \" flurry of retail politicking \" in new york city, with clinton drinking \" bubble tea \" at kung fu tea in flushing while trump rolled out a \" diversity coalition \" at trump tower. Sanders, meanwhile, slammed both clinton and corporate greed at an outdoor rally in long island city monday night, the hill reports. \" it is an enormously important primary because there are a lot of delegates at stake, \" he said. \" tomorrow, new york state can help take this country a giant step forward toward the political revolution. \" the ap notes that if he fails to defy the polls and defeat clinton, he faces \" increasingly limited opportunities to change the trajectory of the race. \" vox reports on a factor likely to hurt both trump, who tends to benefit from high turnout, and sanders, the choice of many independents: new york ranks a dismal 48th out of 50 states in voter turnout — and tuesday's primaries are closed. The deadline to register party affiliation was in october, which means two of trump's own children can't vote for him.",

A police rep says an explosive device was thrown from a bridge and exploded at a pier after falling into the chao phraya river below. Security camera footage shows a sudden blast of water dousing people on a walkway at the pier as bystanders ran for safety. Prayuth chan-ocha, the country's military-installed prime minister, describes the first bomb as \" the worst incident that has ever happened in thailand, \" the bbc reports. \" there have been minor bombs or just noise, but this time they aim for innocent lives, \" he says. \" they want to destroy our economy, our tourism. \" he said in a televised address that the government will expedite \" all investigative efforts to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice. \" the victims include five thai, four chinese, two malaysians, and a singaporean.

With a big smile and her sweet southern manner, the texas native endeared herself to many celebrities and scored major tabloid scoops: donald and ivana trump's divorce, woody allen and mia farrow's impending parenthood.

She was 94. An affable blonde known for pealing laughter, smith wrote a column that celebrated her famous friends, from tom hanks to liza minnelli to madonna, and was read around the world for more than a quarter-century. Despite her towering reputation, smith held a lighthearted opinion of herself. \"we mustn't take ourselves too seriously in this world of gossip, \" she said in 1987. \"when you look at it realistically, what i do is pretty insignificant. Still, i ' m having a lot of fun. \" born in fort worth, texas, in 1923, smith graduated from the university of texas in 1949 with a degree in journalism and, a year later, moved to the big apple. For nearly 30 years, smith bounced from job to job — publicist for singer kaye ballard; assistant to mike wallace and \"candid camera \" creator allen funt; ghostwriter for igor cassini's cholly knickerbocker gossip column.

Anbang, which bought the hotel for $ 1.95 billion in 2014, says it will pay more than $ 100 million in severance agreements, hundreds of which have already been signed. \" we have not finalized any plans in terms of the scope, nature, and details of the renovation project or the exact timing and duration of the hotel's closure. We are currently developing conceptual plans and will share additional details once those plans are finalized, \" an anbang rep tells reuters. Back in 2014, a hotel analyst predicted that converting the waldorf astoria to condos could raise $ 4 billion in sales. For now, there's no word on how many condos will be created or what they might cost, but be warned: \" a potential buyer needs more than money to qualify for our apartments, \" anbang's chairman told a crowd at harvard last year.

This time, a legion of robots are getting in the way of a 12-bar pub crawl. Critics are loving it: the film \" stands on its own as one of the sharpest, saddest, and wisest comedies of the year, \" writes dana stevens at slate. \" the five actors constitute a superb ensemble, creating a group dynamic that's as toxic as it is hilarious, \" and the film's \" compact dramatic structure and steady flow of good jokes puts most mainstream american comedies... To shame. \" \" this is a tighter, smarter film than either shaun of the dead or hot fuzz, \" featuring \" a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia, \" notes tom huddleston at time out london. Sure, \" some of the goofier gags fall flat, and too many of the characters remain undefined... But the film is carried through on sheer, giddy energy. \" wright \" has saved the best for last, \" observes peter bradshaw in the guardian. It's \" a double-whammy of funny and clever: a good-natured sci-fi comedy of male mid-life discontent. \" the movie is \" childish fun with adult language and grown-up costumes, and ( wright ) executes it with energy and precision, \" writes ao scott in the new york times. Its robots represent \" the threat of uniformity, dullness and predictability, the clean and responsible approach to life, and to movies, that the world's end protests with every atom of its being. \"",

An nbc statement notes three newbies — groundlings veteran heidi gardner, comic chris redd, and musical comedian luke null — will join the show's cast, filling the slots left empty by bobby moynihan, vanessa bayer, and sasheer zamata, who all left after last season, the washington post notes. The writing pen is getting a boost, too, with the addition of at least seven new writers, per the hollywood reporter, which notes the show is coming off the whirlwind success of last season's nine emmys — notably for melissa mccarthy's portrayal of sean spicer, kate mckinnon's supporting actress contributions, and alec baldwin's turn as donald trump. Deadline notes last season was also the show's most-watched in nearly 25 years. But the show has also been plagued with complaints about its lack of staff diversity, with the post noting zamata, a black woman, was hired in 2013 only after executive producer lorne michaels held special auditions following complaints about the show's lack of racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. Vanity fair calls the behind-the-scenes nimesh patel the \" most intriguing new hire \" for the show in that regard: patel joins the writing squad from a south asian perspective.
