Turns out the patient was suffering from the \" oral allergic symptom \" his sister had long endured, and now that her bone marrow cells were in his body, he is to share in that suffering possibly for the rest of his life, reports sciencealert. This kind of allergy transfer has been observed in bone marrow transplant patients before, but researchers reporting in the journal of the european academy of dermatology and venereology say this is the first time that such an allergy transfer has actually been proven, a finding that could help scientists better understand how allergies start in the first place and thus how to treat them. An allergic reaction is typically the body's immune system mistaking something that is harmless, such as an otherwise safe type of food or dust, for something it needs to fight. The blood cells themselves are behind this reaction, and because most blood cells form in our bone marrow, this type of transplant may actually result in a semi-permanent or permanent allergy transfer. And while it's extremely rare, other procedures have been shown to at least temporarily transfer allergies between patients, as was the 2015 case in which an 8-year-old canadian boy developed a severe allergy to fish and peanuts following a blood transfusion, reports redorbit. In the kiwi case, scientists used fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) to prove that the cells causing the man's allergy had indeed come from his sister.

Experimental testing after the leukemia patient exhibited symptoms of an allergic reaction, which include tingling and swelling of the lips, mouth and/or throat, experts first identified which cells were causing the reaction, and then used a technique known as"

Slated to be near gallaudet university in washington, dc — the only university for the deaf and hard-of-hearing worldwide — the new starbucks will have up to 25 employees who all know american sign language whether they are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or hearing. Visual displays will also help customers and show when the orders can be picked up. The system is similar to starbucks ' first signing store, in kuala lumpur, malaysia, where customers write notes on paper and see their orders appear on a screen. Sadly, it's far from the typical experience for deaf customers: \" before i go into any store, i ' m anticipating and figuring out how i ' m going to order and communicate, \" adam novsam, a starbucks deaf utility analyst at the company's seattle headquarters, tells npr. \" typically, it is not an easy or smooth experience.

Jeffrey meyer, whose team endeavored to do exactly that. Their focus: the brain protein mao-a, which breaks down and therefore drains the body of three mood-regulating chemicals, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. After giving birth, a woman's mao-a surges, peaking five days postpartum. So researchers designed a \" dietary supplement \" kit that includes tryptophan, tyrosine, and blueberry extract with blueberry juice. The first two \" compensate for the loss \" of the mood-related chemicals, per a press release; the latter was added for its antioxidant effects. Some 21 woman began taking the supplements three days after giving birth and took them for just three days. They were then subjected to a sad-mood-induction test, as were 20 control mothers. \" the results were dramatic \": a sharp increase in depression scores for the controls, but no such depression for the test group. If the results can be replicated on a larger scale, the impact could be staggering; up to 75 % of new moms experience the temporary moods swings dubbed the \" baby blues, \" reports webmd, which tend to resolve within a couple weeks. The most severe cases develop into longer-lasting postpartum depression, which more than one in 10 new moms suffer from. ( new dads are affected by postpartum depression, too. )",

        "summary": "Critics aren't just calling boyhood the movie of the year — they're calling it one of the greatest movies of all time. Director richard linklater actually shot the coming-of-age story over 12 years, allowing audiences to watch actor ellar coltrane literally come of age onscreen. The results are apparently breathtaking; as of this writing, the movie is at 100 % on rotten tomatoes with 86 reviews counted. Here are some highlights: dana stevens at slate calls it a \" gradually unfolding miracle. \" \" i can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power, and the melancholy, of film's intimate enmeshment with time \" in this way, she writes. \" compressed into the space of under three hours, growing up seems as inexplicable a feat as a magic trick. \" \" it's fundamentally a story about ordinary life in nondescript middle american suburbia, \" writes andrew o ' hehir at salon, and it does run long, as linklater lingers on scenes. \" but capturing the texture of ordinary life — the moments that would be excised from any normal movie — is pretty much the point. \" for o ' hehir, \" it comes awfully close to a masterpiece of american moviemaking. \" it's \" one of the most extraordinary films in decades, \" gushes claudia puig at usa today. \" linklater infuses his film with empathy, humor, and soulfulness. We emerge almost shaken, with a breathtaking sense that we have witnessed something authentic, uplifting, and profound. \" somehow across all those years the tone remains dazzlingly constant, and \" the four actors ' emotional investment is palpable. \" \" i ' m always skeptical about films that emerge from the thin mountain air of the sundance film festival wreathed in rave reviews, \" writes lou lumenick at the new york post. But boyhood \" pretty much lives up to the hype at sea level. \" it's \" a heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the united states over the past 12 years. \" \" want to know what it's like to be in on the discovery of a new american classic? check out boyhood, \" advises peter travers at rolling stone. It ' ll make you \" feel euphoric about movies, about their mystery, their power, their ability to move us to laughter and tears. \" linklater takes his place among the great directors, while coltrane \" gives a performance that will be talked about as long as audiences talk about movies. \"",

In a release, it stressed that this doesn't mean the matches were fixed, only that it had received alerts about strange betting behavior that warranted a closer look. In addition to the wimbledon matches, one at the french open also is under investigation. The unit noted that other factors such as \" incorrect odds-setting; well-informed betting; player fitness, fatigue and form; playing conditions and personal circumstances \" could explain the anomalies.

The most drastic measures so far will force a statewide reduction in usage by 25 % from 2013 amounts, with some inland regions forced to cut consumption by up to 36 % over the next nine months, the sacramento bee reports. The state water resources control board unanimously approved the regulations, based on residential per capita use last summer, after about eight hours of testimony and discussion yesterday. Chair felicia marcus said the move was about \" preparing for a drought that can go beyond what we have seen in this century, \" though some argued the regulations were unattainable, unfair, and unwelcome. A sacramento regional water authority rep said the plan shows \" significant inequity \" when it comes to sacramento, which faces some of the toughest measures. Others noted the regulations could slash state jobs, crush industrial businesses, kill vegetation, and spawn wildfires, the los angeles times reports.

        "summary": "The founder of a yoga chain once called \" the starbucks of yoga \" has been found dead in his home under what police are calling \" suspicious circumstances, \" the washington post reports. Police were called to the san diego home of trevor tice monday around noon for a welfare check, and found the 48-year-old founder of corepower yoga dead inside. A neighbor tells san diego's 10news that a contractor working on tice's home told her he saw broken glass and blood inside the house monday. All police are saying officially is that homicide detectives are investigating; no cause of death has been released. Tice started with just one corepower yoga studio in denver in 2002; since then, it has boomed into \" the largest privately held chain of yoga studios in the country, \" with more than 160 locations in 100 cities, per its website. Its hourlong classes blend three types of yoga ( bikram, ashtanga, and vinyasa ), which has irked some \" yoga purists, \" per the post. In january, tice purchased the five-bedroom, $ 3 million home where he was eventually found dead; he was believed to have lived there alone. Neighbors tell 10news he didn't live there full-time, and say they found it odd that though his car was parked outside the house friday, his dogs were left outside all weekend. An autopsy should be completed \" within the next day, \" per the denver post.",

The class-action lawsuit filed wednesday by siera strumlauf and benjamin robles — who used to go to starbucks multiple times every week — claims the company has \" saved countless millions of dollars \" through an act of intentional fraud against its customers. According to tmz, the suit alleges all three sizes of starbucks lattes are regularly under-filled by at least 25 %. And while the foam will occasionally reach the top of the cup, the lawsuit cites food science when it claims foam doesn't count toward a drink's volume. The lawsuit blames new pitchers with \" fill lines \" issued to starbucks locations in 2009 for the problem. They say those fill lines cap milk at an amount that couldn't possibly fill the company's cups. Starbucks counters that its \" handcrafted beverages \" are going to vary by location and employee, and its customers are aware of that. Robles and strumlauf are seeking damages for starbucks latte drinkers everywhere. ( a starbucks employee made better headlines with her gesture on behalf of a deaf customer. )",

The site notes west was unhappy about the president's travel ban and other things he's done since he took office, though it's not clear what sources revealed this info. Cnn wasn't able to get in touch with west's reps, either, but it says that a source had previously noted one of west's priorities is his hometown of chicago — the city trump said he may send the feds into if the \" carnage \" doesn't stop. A trio of tweets from dec. 13 are among the now-missing, with west relaying he met with trump \" to discuss multicultural issues, \" including \" bullying \" and \" violence in chicago. \" \" i feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change, \" he noted. He had also posted a signed pic of trump's \" person of the year \" cover for time. \" to kanye you are a great friend thanks, \" the president-elect wrote, signing his name. West's twitter account doesn't give much in the way of clues about the tweet purge: he's only posted a couple of times since the holidays, and they don't include anything about trump. \" propaganda, \" however, a new song out by rapper king myers and produced by west, voices its support for refugees and muslims and calls for trump's impeachment.",

The democrats ' plan, which focuses on a minimum 30 % tax on millionaires as well as defense and farm cuts, lacks the 60 votes it would need to dodge a filibuster. The gop plan would keep cuts but require president obama to decide where to make them; but the administration won't sign a plan without revenue increases. Meanwhile, president obama is set to meet tomorrow with congressional leaders for a last-minute meeting on the issue. But others are saying it's as good as done. The sequester is \" going to happen, \" says rep. Jim jordan, a gop leader. \" it's not the end of the world. \" the latest from capitol hill: both parties are seeing benefits to the sequester, the new york times reports. Republicans get cuts, liberal democrats appreciate a chance to limit defense spending, and obama gets to talk about other key issues for a while. But republicans have a new concern, politico reports: the sequester could give the president vast control over the federal budget, and he could make sure his priorities ( ie, obamacare ) get funding while denying cash to programs he's less invested in. Even assuming the sequester goes through, the wrangling isn't over, the christian science monitor notes. It ' ll take a few weeks for sequestration's effects to be felt; in the meantime, lawmakers can still work on changing the plan, or dropping it. Negotiations could ultimately become tied to a fight to keep the government running; current funds run out march 27.",

        "summary": "Even if you really, really did not want to care about the twilight cheating scandal, admit it: you were a bit floored by kristen stewart's surprisingly emotional, candid apology to robert pattinson for cheating on him with rupert sanders ( read it in full here ). Particularly notable is the fact that this is the first time stewart has ever directly confirmed her relationship with pattinson, though it's been the subject of rumors for years. The best reactions: the dramatic \" i love him, i love him \" line makes stewart's statement \" strangely authentic-sounding, \" an entertainment pr expert tells the huffington post. But the expert's theory is that stewart was forced into the mea culpa — perhaps by pattinson — because \" this is the sort of thing famous people generally don't acknowledge. \" on the other hand, the whole cheating scandal could have been crafted by their publicists as a way to break them up, seeing as many assume kristen has been acting as \" rob's beard. \" this is weird, writes leah beckmann on gawker. The normally stony-faced stewart's statement is \" pumped with all the desperate emotion and feelings one would expect from any 22-year-old apologizing for cheating on her boyfriend, \" but it seems a bit much \" for a couple of on-set cuddle pics. \" normally, a \" pr intern could have managed \" this type of situation — so what's going on? \" something wicked this way comes, for sure. \" in the atlantic, eleanor barkhorn notes that not only was the apology shockingly raw, it was immediate. One theory: \" stewart has tremendous financial incentive to make this scandal go away as soon as possible, \" what with the final twilight movie coming out in november. Then again, stewart has never appeared to give a crap what anyone thinks, and doesn't play the marketing game the way other young starlets do. Maybe \" she just wanted forgiveness, so she asked for it. \" the whole thing \" feels like a high school fuck up, \" writes jessica coen at jezebel. \" even the overwrought apology ( your boyfriend is'the most important thing in my life ' — really? ) sounds like a kid with a case of the swoons. \"",

        "summary": "At&t says any cellphone customer can sign up for unlimited data plans starting friday, a change that comes just days after verizon announced a similar move and sprint and t-mobile beefed up their offerings. All four major cellphone providers now offer unlimited plans, a major reversal from a few years ago, per ap. At&t's version costs the same as verizon's for a family of four at $ 180, but it's pricier for an individual — $ 100 per month vs. $ 80, while sprint is at $ 50 ( that goes up $ 10 in a year ) and t-mobile at $ 70. Those figures are from cnet, which has a detailed breakdown of all the plans. By cnet's calculations, the two-year cost for a single line of unlimited data is as follows: at&t, $ 2,400; verizon, $ 1,920; t-mobile, $ 1,680; and sprint, $ 1,320. All the plans will slow down data speeds once you hit a certain limit, with at&t and verizon setting that at 22gb, sprint at 23gb, and t-mobile at 28gb. Sprint also said thursday that it's letting unlimited customers watch video in high definition rather than dvd quality. T-mobile announced a similar change monday after verizon said hd video was included. At&t's unlimited plan degrades video to dvd quality, but customers can turn hd video back on for free.",

        "summary": "The us military believes someone in a niger village may have tipped off attackers to the presence of us commandos and nigerien forces in the area, setting in motion the ambush that killed four americans, a senior defense official said tuesday. The official says the army green berets and about 30 niger forces stopped in a village about 85 miles north of niger's capital, niamey, for an hour or two to get food and water after conducting an overnight reconnaissance mission, the ap reports. After they left, they were ambushed by about 50 heavily armed enemy fighters. The official says the us believes someone in the village alerted militants in a relatively new isis offshoot that calls itself islamic state in the sahel. The official backs up a survivor's account of a morphed mission, saying the joint us and niger team was initially sent on a routine mission to meet local tribal leaders. But after they had set out on oct. 3, they received a new assignment, the official says. They were asked to assist a second american commando team in the area by collecting intelligence at a location where an al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb insurgent had last been seen. Because the insurgent was no longer in that area, military commanders believed the operation wasn't risky, the official says. The group that attacked is not believed to be linked to the aqim militant. Army records show that the four soldiers killed had little to no combat experience, though the pentagon stresses that all four went through intensive special forces training, the wall street journal reports.",

Critics seem to be big fans of trainwreck, an r-rated flick about \" amy, \" a woman turned off by monogamy, though perhaps not for long. Alongside snl alum bill hader and lebron james, schumer, who also wrote the flick, shines. Here's what critics are saying: trainwreck is a \" very entertaining romantic comedy \" that is both conventional and not, writes ty burr. It's certainly not revolutionary: schumer's usual \" daring is more subdued \" for the big screen, but her performance still \" serves as confirmation that a star is born, \" he writes at the boston globe. James is impressive, too, though burr says the movie, at more than two hours, is a bit \" padded. \" joe williams at the st. Louis post-dispatch applauds the acting on all fronts. \" schumer is so scary-good in trainwreck that it almost seems risky to speak her name, \" he writes. She \" has the ball skills to be the next lebron james, \" who, it turns out, is a \" revelation \" here. Then there's tilda swinton, who is \" amazing \" as amy's boss. Overall, \" this is a fully fleshed-out movie, the funniest of the year, \" williams writes. Rafer guzman isn't as impressed. \" trainwreck doesn't flip the rom-com on its head but merely gives it an awkward shove \" as a woman plays \" the slovenly screw-up \" rather than a man, he writes at newsday. He thinks there are too many characters and failed jokes. More importantly, hader \" generates zero chemistry with schumer. \" at least john cena, who makes an early appearance, shows \" solid comedic timing. \" people lining up to see schumer as \" the subversive truth-teller, the feminist role model … are likely to be disappointed, \" writes esther breger at new republic. \" their loss. Trainwreck is a surprisingly old-fashioned romantic comedy, the kind that rarely gets made anymore. \" you might not love her character at first, but \" slowly, schumer develops from parody-persona into an emotionally resonant character who managed to make me cry twice, \" she writes.

But not for long, perhaps, in the united arab emirates ( uae ). From october 11th blackberry mobile phones will not work there for anything but basic telephone calls, unless research in motion ( rim ), the canadian firm that makes the phones, can strike a deal with the gulf state's regulatory authorities. The uae's regulators say the blackberry's proprietary network and tight encryption make messages the devices send over the internet too secure. Other gulf countries seem to agree. They ( and india ) are also threatening to limit blackberry use unless ways can be found to let their governments intercept some sorts of communication. This could affect not only blackberry owners in the gulf but millions of people in transit. And a wider ban could shrink blackberry sales in a small but lucrative and fast-growing market. Security experts believe rim has made it possible for the authorities in the united states and other countries to do varying levels of monitoring. However, it denies offering anything to one government that is not on offer to all, and it insists that it does not possess the encryption keys that handsets use to",

            "Houston -- this should be the proudest moment of tom brady's career, but at this very second he has a mystery to solve. Someone has stolen tom brady's jersey. The white no. 12 jersey the greatest quarterback of all-time wore on sunday in the greatest comeback in nfl history. Taking these two factors into account, this is a pretty damn special jersey. But right now, tom brady doesn't have it. Somewhere between the time he took it off and right now, an individual picked up his jersey and walked off. Could be a thief. Could be an over-eager equipment manager. With two large security guards flanked on either side of him, brady goes through his locker searching for the jersey the way you or i would look for car keys in the living room. These are the best brady moments because they are the ones where he seems relatable. Human even! a few minutes later, patriots owner robert kraft approaches the super bowl li mvp with a box of gorgeous-looking cigars.

About 300 students chanted \" death to france, death to america \" in a western neighbourhood of the capital kabul, an afp photographer said. Nearby, hundreds more gathered on a flyover and chanted \" death to america \" and \" long live islam, long live afghanistan \", another afp photographer said.

More than 30 people have been killed worldwide in attacks and violent protests linked to \" innocence of muslims \", including 12 people who died in an attack by a female suicide bomber in kabul on tuesday. The crudely made film produced by us-based extremist christians has triggered protests in at least 20 countries since excerpts were posted online. In reaction to the uproar, the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo published cartoons mocking the film and caricaturing the muslim prophet, including two drawings showing him naked.

And even now, the family is still being bullied; they say they've received negative comments online. But they don't want the kids who bullied michael punished: \" i don't think that's what mike would want. I would rather teach people how to do right, \" says his mom. Stepdad shannon suttle adds that the cartoon itself is all about friendship, and says, \" it teaches the most basic moral values. \" but there have been acts of kindness: suttle called the actress who voices michael's favorite character, pinkie pie, requesting that she record a message for him. She did, and got the entire cast to do the same. \" when we play the my little pony messages for him, there is increased activity on the eeg, \" suttle says.

        "summary": "An announcement expected friday out of health and human services has abortion rights advocates and doctors ' groups steeled for a new battle on the family planning front. Per the ap and new york times, white house officials and other sources say a reagan-era ban is about to be rebooted: one that forbids family planning clinics from sharing space with providers of abortions and related services, or from referring women to such providers. The already existing hyde amendment bars clinics from using federal title x grants for abortion services, with nbc news noting groups like planned parenthood put the feds ' money toward non-abortion-related health services and pay for abortion services out of private money; they still sometimes offer abortions and related services at the same site and with the same workers. The new rule would effectively quash that option. What's still unclear is whether a ban on discussing abortion will ensue. That \" gag rule \" had been instituted by reagan, though it never went into effect; president clinton then rolled it back and mandated \" non-directive counseling \" that included various options, including abortion. The new proposal reportedly will nix the requirement for grant recipients to include abortion in the conversation, though it may not ban the topic outright. Abortion critics say this move is the right one, an action to \" disentangle taxpayers from the abortion business, \" as marjorie dannenfelser, head of abortion-opposition group susan b. Anthony list, puts it to nbc. Abortion rights advocates disagree. \" this is an attempt to take away women's basic rights, period, \" says planned parenthood exec dawn laguens. \" everyone has the right to information about their health care — including information about safe, legal abortion. \"",

But weather underground data suggested it went even higher, to 129.2 fahrenheit or 54 celsius, reports mashable, which would tie the record for the hottest temperature recorded in modern times. The temp would need verification by the world meteorological organization. Only the 134 degrees recorded in california's death valley on july 10, 1913, is higher, and experts including weather underground historian christopher burt believe the novice weather observer who recorded that temperature probably made a mistake, usa today reports. The higher figure for ahvaz would tie the temperature recorded in kuwait last year and in death valley in 2013. Either way, the city of 1.1 million people was a lot warmer than the average steam room on thursday even before factoring in the humidity, which brought the heat index to more than 140, higher than the index at the us national weather service measures, the washington post reports.

Acting nasa administrator robert lightfoot says it would cost up to $ 900 million more to have the orion capsule crew-ready when it goes into space with nasa's space launch system \" super rocket, \" cbs reports. Lightfoot says granting trump's request would also further delay the first launch, which he says has already been pushed back from late 2018 to some time in 2019. A study found that adding astronauts would be \" technically feasible, \" but \" we decided that the baseline plan we had in place was the best plan, \" lightfoot told reporters friday.

Lightfoot says the plan is still to have astronauts in an upgraded version of the orion capsule in a second flight scheduled to take place two years after the first. The space launch system is the centerpiece of nasa's plan to have humans on mars by the 2030s, though critics including newt gingrich, who has advised trump on space issues, believe that with private companies like spacex working on reusable rockets, the sls might be obsolete by the time it launches, the new york times reports.",

            "Nasa managers have ruled out putting a crew on board an orion capsule atop the agency's huge space launch system rocket for the gargantuan booster's maiden flight in 2019, citing technical risks and higher costs, up to as much as $ 900 million, agency officials said friday. Earlier this year, the trump administration asked nasa to look into the possibility of either adding a crew to exploration mission 1, em-1 for short, or moving up the launch of em-2, the flight nasa already earmarked for the sls booster's first piloted mission. That flight is targeted for launch in the 2021 timeframe. The nasa study concluded that while it would be possible to upgrade the orion spacecraft to accommodate a crew for the em-1 flight -- equipping it with life support systems, crew displays, a validated launch abort system and other critical elements -- it would have required an additional $ 600 million to $ 900 million in funding. And there would be additional technical risk and likely delays to accelerate software development and to retrofit the em-1 orion capsule to support a two-person crew. As a result, acting nasa administrator robert lightfoot said agency managers and white house officials agreed it made more sense to stick with the original plan, launching an uncrewed orion capsule atop the first sls booster in 2019, followed by a piloted mission",
            "Acting nasa administrator robert lightfoot released a statement friday, may 12, stating that nasa will not fly a crew on the first launch of the space launch system ( sls ) rocket and orion spacecraft. From the statement: nasa appreciates the energy, creativity, and depth of engineering and program analysis that was brought to the decision, but ultimately, the decision was made not to fly crew on the first flight after weighing the data and assessing all implications. However, the work we did on this evaluation will flow into our planning for the next two years. We look forward to using this information to strengthen our em-2 posture. Advertisement - continue reading below nasa was encouraged to explore the possibility of putting astronauts on the first flight of sls and orion by president trump's nasa transition team. As a result, nasa and lockheed martin, the primary manufacturer of the orion spacecraft, conducted a feasibility study to determine if it would be safe and practical to fly astronauts on the maiden flight of the sls, known as exploration mission-1 or em-1. Most popular during a press conference held on may 12, however, robert lightfoot announced that em-1 would remain uncrewed as originally planned. \" at the end of the day we found it technically feasible to fly a crew on em-1, \" lightfoot said.

            "Nasa managers have ruled out putting a crew on board an orion capsule atop the agency's huge space launch system rocket for the gargantuan booster's maiden flight in 2019, citing technical risks and higher costs, up to as much as $ 900 million, agency officials said friday. Earlier this year, the trump administration asked nasa to look into the possibility of either adding a crew to exploration mission 1, em-1 for short, or moving up the launch of em-2, the flight nasa already earmarked for the sls booster's first piloted mission. That flight is targeted for launch in the 2021 timeframe. The nasa study concluded that while it would be possible to upgrade the orion spacecraft to accommodate a crew for the em-1 flight -- equipping it with life support systems, crew displays, a validated launch abort system and other critical elements -- it would have required an additional $ 600 million to $ 900 million in funding. And there would be additional technical risk and likely delays to accelerate software development and to retrofit the em-1 orion capsule to support a two-person crew. As a result, acting nasa administrator robert lightfoot said agency managers and white house officials agreed it made more sense to stick with the original plan, launching an uncrewed orion capsule atop the first sls booster in 2019, followed by a piloted mission",
            "Acting nasa administrator robert lightfoot released a statement friday, may 12, stating that nasa will not fly a crew on the first launch of the space launch system ( sls ) rocket and orion spacecraft. From the statement: nasa appreciates the energy, creativity, and depth of engineering and program analysis that was brought to the decision, but ultimately, the decision was made not to fly crew on the first flight after weighing the data and assessing all implications. However, the work we did on this evaluation will flow into our planning for the next two years. We look forward to using this information to strengthen our em-2 posture. Advertisement - continue reading below nasa was encouraged to explore the possibility of putting astronauts on the first flight of sls and orion by president trump's nasa transition team. As a result, nasa and lockheed martin, the primary manufacturer of the orion spacecraft, conducted a feasibility study to determine if it would be safe and practical to fly astronauts on the maiden flight of the sls, known as exploration mission-1 or em-1. Most popular during a press conference held on may 12, however, robert lightfoot announced that em-1 would remain uncrewed as originally planned. \" at the end of the day we found it technically feasible to fly a crew on em-1, \" lightfoot said. However,"

Police, who recovered pieces of the 10-year-girl in the north carolina woods, aren't revealing how zahra baker was killed. But her stepmom has confided to investigators that the girl's body was dismembered by her dad. Shortly before her death, the girl, who had lost a left leg to cancer and her hearing to cancer treatments, was reportedly raped by two male friends of the family, a tipster has told police, according to cnn. A user of the social networking instant messaging virtual universe website told cops that zahra's parents, adam and elisa baker, and baker's ex-husband talked about a chainsaw massacre the same day police speculate zahra was killed. The online conversation \" regarded their involvement with chainsaw massacre role-playing, \" said a search warrant. Investigators are seeking mental health records on zahra's stepmom, who reportedly abused 3 biological children for years. During a search of the family home in hickory, police took some 30 blood swabs, and removed several cameras, cell phones, a knife and stun gun, reports wsoctv.",

Martin lewis, 62, was a detective in the vice department in san antonio until he retired in 2004, reports cnn. The department \" primarily investigates prostitution, gambling, and liquor violations. At this point, we don't have info that he was ever assigned to infiltrate a gang, \" a police spokesman says. In facebook postings, lewis boasts about being a \" 1 % er \" and appears in photos wearing bandidos patches, according to cnn. In other developments: waco police say they've now found 318 weapons at the crime scene and the number is expected to go up. The weapons, including an ak-47, 118 handguns, and 157 knives, have been \" found in sacks of chips, stuffed between bags of flour, stuffed into the bench seating, hidden in shelves, thrown into trash cans, placed in the kitchen stoves, discarded on floors, and even so far as to attempt to flush a handgun down a commode, \" the department says in a facebook post. The ap has reviewed video footage from the twin peaks restaurant that shows most bikers, staff, and other patrons fled inside when the shooting started. Some bikers on the patio can be seen trying to direct people to safety, while inside, bikers can be seen running into the restaurant's bathroom and kitchen. Only one of the dozens of bikers on video can be seen firing a gun, the ap notes, although the video coverage doesn't include the parking lot, where most of the shooting happened. There is at least one woman among the detained bikers: sandra \" drama \" lynch, who's known for \" organizing charity concerts for cancer patients, rescuing dogs, and fighting for motorcycle-friendly legislation, \" according to the waco tribune-herald. Her co-director in a biker advocacy group tells the tribune-herald that the 53-year-old and her husband had \" nothing to do with nothing \" and were \" arbitrarily \" rounded up. \" she's the mama, \" he says. \" she's the room mother who takes care of all the mcs in waco. If someone has cancer or gets in an accident, she's the one who helps put benefits together so they don't lose their houses. \" police spokesman sgt. W. Patrick swanton, however, says the people now behind bars weren't exactly upstanding citizens, cnn reports. \" your law-abiding citizen doesn't throw firearms into a bag of tortilla chips, \" he says",

( associated press ) file - in this march 7, 2007, file photo, penn state university president graham spanier speaks during a news conference at the penn state milton s. Hershey medical center in hershey, pa. Spanier says... ( associated press ) graham spanier says he wouldn't have ignored child sexual-abuse complaints as penn state's president because he was beaten repeatedly as a child. Spanier's lawyer, peter vaira, tells the associated press that spanier received regular \" disciplinary beatings \" by his father, and had to have his nose straightened several times. Vaira says the abuse was never sexual. Spanier sent a letter to penn state university's board of trustees saying he would not have turned a blind eye to the victims of convicted child molester jerry sandusky, the former assistant football coach, because of his own abuse history. The letter was first reported monday by the patriot-news. A recent internal report on the sandusky scandal blasted spanier, former coach joe paterno and others for failing to report the abuse complaints to authorities."

        "summary": "Wisconsin voters go to the polls today for the first of six recall elections prompted by gov. Scott walker's controversial collective bargaining law — and interest is so high, some local officials predict \" presidential-election level turnout, \" reports politico. Campaign finance records have been shattered as outside interest groups on both sides have poured more than $ 30 million in, which comes shockingly close to the $ 37 million total spent last year on the governor's race. The christian science monitor notes that a total of $ 35 million to $ 40 million, including candidate spending, is expected to be racked up when all is said and done. Last year, just $ 3.75 million was spent on state assembly and state senate elections, notes the washington post. Why? because, as one state senator's rep explains, \" these recalls will have a ripple effect across the entire nation. \" six republicans face recall today, and two democrats next week. Though the democrats have a chance to win control of the state senate, that would be an \" almost entirely symbolic \" victory since republicans would still control the assembly and the governor's mansion, a political scientist explains. Even so, a victory for the democrats would be a stinging rebuke of the gop agenda — which includes the collective bargaining law as well as tax cuts, education aid, and medicaid cuts, and voter id restrictions — and could lead to a recall effort against walker himself. A republican victory, on the other hand, could invigorate the tea party. Many see this as the first big contest of the 2012 election, since many other states, as well as the federal government, are fighting similar battles.",

Fulton tells the washington post that barclay — a recently retired army lieutenant colonel — was a \" consummate expert \" and active member of the group who had been taking part in similar events for more than 30 years. \" he knew how to do it and how to do it safely. \" barclay, he says, was wearing a doublet instead of full body armor because there were no other riders in the ring. In the accident, fulton says, \" something happened with that spear, and he lost control of it or it turned, hit the ground, and as his horse was moving, the tip of it went into him. \" he adds: \" it is a horrible set of circumstances that caused this. \"",

        "summary": "Puerto rico could be without electricity for four to six months after the island was ravaged by hurricane maria on wednesday, the mayor of san juan tells nbc news. A spokesperson for the governor's office who describes the situation as \" total devastation \" adds to cnn: \" we are 100 % without power. \" any electricity in puerto rico, including at hospitals, is currently coming from generators, abc news reports. Maria was the strongest storm to hit the island in nearly 70 years. Puerto rico's office of emergency management says telecommunications have \" collapsed, \" and residents are being told to stay in their homes until thursday due to massive flooding. More than 12,000 people are in shelters, but no deaths have been reported yet. Maria weakened to a category 2 hurricane with 110mph winds wednesday but could return to at least a category 3 after moving back out over the ocean. However, usa today reports it's unlikely to threaten the us mainland — thanks to tropical storm jose. Jose, which is currently south of new england, weakened a high-pressure ridge that had been over the eastern us and atlantic, and a weather underground meteorologist says maria will likely curve east into the path already carved by jose. Without jose, maria could have followed hurricane irma's path into florida.",

How dare i promote it when its credibility is down the toilet? \" the book in question is the voyeur's motel, and it tells the bizarre and creepy story of gerald foos, who claims to have spied on guests at his colorado motel for three decades starting in the 1960s. The post, however, discovered something talese did not: foos sold his motel in 1980 and bought it back again in 1988, calling into question whether he was able to spy on guests in that stretch and thus raising doubts about his general veracity. The book drew wide attention when it was excerpted in the new yorker in april, and none other than steven spielberg bought the movie rights. What seems clear even after the post article is that foos did indeed spy on guests through the 1970s. A detective who looked into the case has perhaps the best take: \"i have no doubt that mr. Foos may have been involved in some nefarious activity while he owned the manor house, \" says stephen conner. \" i just do not think it arose to the magnitude described by mr. Talese. \" the hollywood reporter sees talese's disavowal as \" a dramatic statement that's sure to send shock waves rippling from the publishing world to hollywood, \" while slate — which critically picked apart the new yorker excerpt — says \" the real question for talese at this point is: how hard did he try to vouch for the story he was telling? \" foos, for his part, tells the post he never lied, though talese now calls him \" certifiably unreliable. \" he adds: \" i did the best i could on this book, but maybe it wasn't good enough. \"",

The trooper, meanwhile, says it was nearly 2am and he thought the teens were trying to break into his home ( the trooper hasn't officially been ided, but nj.com says the home belongs to kissinger barreau, a 2009 graduate of the state's police academy ). An investigation by the state attorney general's office so far mainly jibes with what 18-year-old jesse barkhorn has told new jersey advance media: that the teens knocked on the door, that the trooper came downstairs and started cursing at the teens through the door ( the ag's office calls it a \" verbal exchange \" ), and that the trooper followed the teens outside with his gun as they fled in their car. Where they differ: the trooper says he ided himself as law enforcement, but the teens say they didn't hear that. Barkhorn says they saw the gun's laser before the trooper fired three shots with his personal weapon. \" at this point we're freaking out, ' it's a gun. It's a gun, ' \" barkhorn tells the ap. \" i was like,'dude, get out of here. ' \" one bullet struck a tire, stopping the car about 1.5 miles later. Two ex-new jersey prosecutors who admit they've only seen public reports on the case tell nj.com the trooper could be in trouble if he can't prove deadly force was justified. What could hurt his case: police scanner recordings that indicate the trooper followed them in his ford explorer, nj.com reports. \" it was traumatic, \" barkhorn tells the ap. \" you don't really appreciate things until you have a gun pointed at your head. \" the ag's office is still investigating, per the daily record.",

A police report states williams was at fault when she entered a florida intersection june 9 and was t-boned by another vehicle that had the right of way; the couple inside, jerome and linda barson, suffered major injuries. Jerome, 78, died two weeks later. According to the barson family's lawsuit, williams ran a red light and was driving too fast while distracted, tmz reports. Williams has previously claimed she entered the intersection on a green light but was forced to slow down to 5mph in the middle of the intersection due to traffic and the light turned red while she was in the intersection, per espn. But witnesses also told police she ran a red light, the boston globe reports. The lawsuit says that williams created a scenario in which the crash was unavoidable, and that the barsons ' car was \" crushed, the front windshield shattered, the airbags deployed, there was crush damage to the rear on the driver's side, and the back window was shattered. \" linda barson suffered a cracked sternum and multiple broken bones.

A paper published thursday in bmj case reports says cases of anisakiasis are on the rise in the west due to the increasing popularity of sushi and other dishes involving raw or under-cooked fish. The report gives the example of a portuguese man who was suffering vomiting, fever, and stomach pain. He told doctors he had recently eaten sushi, and they discovered an anisakis larva attached to his stomach lining, ctv news reports. According to cnn, the anisakis is a parasitic worm that lives in mackerel, squids, salmon, herring, cod, red snapper, and halibut. There's no treatment for anisakiasis, which can also cause bowel obstruction and digestive bleeding, besides physical removal of the anisakis larva, which can require surgery, the guardian reports. Anisakiasis is common in japan due to the prevalence of raw fish in the diet, with between 2,000 and 3,000 cases diagnosed per year. But cases are starting to pop up in the us and elsewhere in the west. To avoid getting the parasite, patronize high-quality sushi restaurants. \" properly trained sushi chefs can detect anisakis larvae, \" one doctor says. \" they are grossly visible in the fish. \" or if you're making sushi at home, freeze the fish for at least four days beforehand to kill the larvae.

He was reportedly in the company of his brother and two other men. The afp reports that on july 1, men pretending to be flight school students made their instructor land a helicopter in the prison courtyard, emerged with balaclavas, used a grinding machine to open the door to the prison's visiting room, and spirited faid, 46, away. It was the second bold escape faid has made: in 2013 he got out of a different prison using explosives concealed in a tissue box and was on the run for six weeks. He is serving a 25-year sentence tied to the 2010 death of a policewoman during a bungled robbery. As for what the country plans to do with him, justice minister nicole belloubet had this to say: \" we're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely. \" ( this fugitive managed to elude thousands of cops for weeks. )",

William flannigan, azcentral bobby wilson, state senate candidate in legislative district 2. ( photo: courtesy of bobby wilson ) a big crowd gathered in a tucson church last week, ready to hear candidates ' plans for gun-control legislation from people vying to become lawmakers at the state capitol. All was going more or less as expected. Then, it was bobby wilson's turn to speak. Wilson, one of two republican candidates who attended the july 9 meeting, took the mic and told a story of how he shot and killed a crazed attacker in an act of self-defense while a teenager. That attacker, it turned out, was his mother. He said his life story illustrates the importance of having \" a good guy there with a gun \" rather than gun-control legislation. \" you can pass all the laws you want to in this world, and when you've got somebody out there that wants to harm somebody, they're going to do it if you don't stop them, \" wilson told the crowd.

        "summary": "Some visitors go to kazakhstan's altyn-emel national park — a preserve the cbc says is four times the size of hong kong — to view ancient burial sites or catch a glimpse of wildlife; others go to listen to the park's famous singing dune. The nearly 500-foot-high pile of sand, which stretches for about 2 miles, is tucked away in the tian shan mountain range near china's border, reuters notes, and when the weather is especially arid, visitors can hear a sound that some compare to an organ. The dune's melodious moaning can be set off by wind or when the sand is disrupted by people: in a youtube video of one family wanting to demonstrate the desert chant, you can hear the ominous sound ( when the father isn't yelling at his kids to keep quiet ). But while the strange symphony used to be attributed to rumors such as genghis khan being entombed underneath it, scientists have come up with a more likely explanation — for this dune, and for the many others like it around the world. The \" booming and burping \" sounds, as live science puts it, are caused by varying sound waves moving within the dune, per a 2015 study in physics of fluid. By analyzing the sounds that moved through similar dunes in death valley and the mojave desert, the researchers found that the way grains of sand rubbed against each other produced the mystery tune. \" booming sand dunes are able to produce a persistent, low-frequency sound that resembles a pure note from a music instrument, \" nathalie vriend, the study's lead researcher, tells live science, even pinpointing the note to \" a dominant audible frequency between a d and g sharp in the second octave below middle c, and several higher harmonics that may be heard from distances far away and may last for minutes. \" vriend adds that just a bit of movement is all it takes to trigger the very noticeable lowing. \" it is really difficult to comprehend that such a small and thin avalanche creates such a loud sound that booms over the desert floor, \" she notes.

Per the new york times, korean air chief cho yang-ho announced in a statement sunday he was removing cho hyun-ah ( aka heather cho, said to be 43 or 44 ) and her younger sister, cho hyun-min ( aka emily cho, 34 or 35 ), from their executive roles within the company after a series of high-profile incidents, including cho hyun-ah's \" nut rage \" outburst on a korean air flight in late 2014 that ended up earning her nearly five months in prison. After her stint behind bars, she found another high-level job within her father's conglomerate, this time running a hotel business. Now marketing exec cho hyun-min is in the spotlight as she faces allegations of a business meeting that went awry ( she's accused of hurling water in the face of one of the meeting attendees; police are looking into it ), as well as a recently released audio tape purporting to document her yelling at korean air officials. One person who seems particularly mortified ( at least on paper ) about the women's behavior: their father. \" i am deeply sorry that problems connected to my family have worried the people and employees of korean air, \" cho yang-ho said in a statement sunday. \" i feel crushed by the immature behavior of my daughters. \" he adds, per the guardian: \" everything is my fault and my wrongdoing. \" his son, cho won-tae, who's president of korean air, was accused of assaulting an elderly woman in 2005 after she yelled at him for the way he drove, per the wall street journal.",

Both agents were transported to a local hospital, where martinez died from his injuries later sunday. Details on what happened are sketchy, though national border patrol council officials tell ktsm that they believe both agents were attacked, probably with rocks. \" border patrol officer killed at southern border, another badly hurt, \" trump tweeted. \" we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the wall! \" authorities say culberson county sheriff's office deputies helped secure the scene while the border patrol's special operations group searched for suspects or witnesses. The fbi has now taken over the investigation and jeanette harper of the agency's el paso office says a more detailed account of the incident will be released monday, the houston chronicle reports. She says contrary to earlier reports, the agents were not fired upon. Texas gov. Greg abbott tweeted his condolences, saying resources must be increased to prevent other attacks.",

You may, however, have less to worry about if the commuter in your relationship is a woman. Men who have a long commute, the study finds, are more likely than long-traveling women to bail on a relationship. And that breakup is more likely to happen in the initial years of commuting. In fact, if you and your partner can stay together for five years of commuting, you're significantly more likely to be together for good, ozy reports. Why? \" there could be another selection process at work there as well, that the ' weaker'relationships can't take that kind of strain in the first place, \" the study's lead author tells the local.

According to the study, 11 percent of swedes have a journey to work that consists of a 45-minute commute or longer. Many commuters have small children and are in a relationship. Most are men. \"one of the long-term risks with commuting is that it can sustain gender-based stereotypes both at home and in the labour market, \" sandow said. In families where the man commutes, the woman is often forced to take a less qualified job closer to home, which means both less money as well as a larger share of the the responsibility for kids and household. Although women commuters also experience an increase in salary and career prospects, earlier studies have shown that they experience more stress and feel less successful career-wise than commuting men. The risk of divorce goes up by 40 percent for commuters and the risk is the highest in the first few years of commuting.

            "\"to be able to commute to work can be a positive thing because it means you don't have to uproot your family with every career move but it can also be a strain on your relationship, \" said author erika sandow to the local. According to the study, 11 percent of swedes have a journey to work that consists of a 45-minute commute or longer. Many commuters have small children and are in a relationship. Most are men. \"one of the long-term risks with commuting is that it can sustain gender-based stereotypes both at home and in the labour market, \" sandow said. In families where the man commutes, the woman is often forced to take a less qualified job closer to home, which means both less money as well as a larger share of the the responsibility for kids and household. Although women commuters also experience an increase in salary and career prospects, earlier studies have shown that they experience more stress and feel less successful career-wise than commuting men. The risk of divorce goes up by 40 percent for commuters and the risk is the highest in the first few years of commuting.

There was also no difference in terms of bacteria found in urine. \" although our study was only in nursing home women, many other studies have been done in other populations, which have not shown a benefit, \" says lead author manisha juthani-mehta. For example, a 2012 review of 24 studies on cranberry juice, which is still touted by the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists, determined it \" cannot be recommended for the prevention of utis. \" paying for cranberry capsules with \" limited potential benefit \" for preventing utis, therefore, \" does not seem worthwhile, \" says juthani-mehta.

        "summary": "So just where are we on the fiscal cliff? after mitch mcconnell and harry reid hit an impasse yesterday, mcconnell called in joe biden, and after a flurry of offers that included president obama and went throughout the night, politico finds \" major progress \" and reason for hope this morning. Still, the senate recessed at 7: 27pm and won't be in session until 11am today, notes the hill. The top sticking points: both sides want to stop billions in automatic spending cuts — the sequester — but differ on how to offset them, notes the hill. Democrats have raised their tax-hike threshold to $ 450,000 per family, but mcconnell wants $ 550,000, notes cnn. There's also disagreement over the estate tax, which republicans want to keep at 35 %, exempting inheritances under $ 5 million. What if we get a deal? john boehner has vowed to put any deal to a vote, and either pass it or amend it and send it back to the senate. What if we don't? democrats could push through a tax-rate extension for those making less than $ 250,000 plus jobless benefit extensions, but senate republicans could call for 60 votes to pass the measure, which still wouldn't address the sequester, politico notes. Anything that gets through the senate could get an immediate house vote, the hill adds — but house passage of such a bill would appear unlikely. How did we get here in the first place? it's no big surprise, observes the new york times, thanks to short-term patches used by both parties to gain leverage. First, it was the republicans with the threat of government shutdown and the debt ceiling; now, it's the newly victorious dems prying the gop away from its tax commitments. All those short-term plans are now coming to a head. Is anyone smiling in this mess? well, boehner finally scored applause from his party last night for his negotiating, despite house republicans ' earlier rejection of his efforts.

He ran to help injured spectators, including one man whose legs were blown off. Arredondo can be seen, wearing a cowboy hat, in an iconic photo in the gallery ( warning: it's graphic ), apparently holding the man's severed artery, nbc news reports. \" i kept talking to him. I kept saying,'stay with me, stay with me, ' \" arredondo tells maine's portland press herald. Another widely-circulated photo shows arredondo, who is reportedly a red cross disaster team member, carrying one of his american flags, soaked with blood. But this is far from the first tragic twist in arredondo's life, as nbc news points out after delving through past media coverage of the costa rica native. He lost his son, marine lance cpl. Alexander arredondo, during the 20-year-old's second tour of duty in iraq in 2004. Arredondo got the news on his 44th birthday, and immediately climbed inside the marine corps van and set it afire, burning himself severely. He became a peace activist and started sharing his son's story via a mobile memorial in his pickup truck that he drives around the country, and in 2007 he was beaten at a washington anti-war demonstration. Four years later, his other son, brian, killed himself at 24. He had struggled with depression and drug addiction after his brother's death, mother jones reports; he was facing jail at the time of his suicide. \" we are broken people, \" arredondo told the boston herald last year.

One of elvis presley's private planes, presumably used to jet the late heartthrob to shows across the country, is up for bid in an online auction until july 27, with a likely sale price in the six figures. But you ' ll likely need more cash if you actually want to get the plane in the air. As cnn reports, \" there's no engine, the cockpit's a mess and the velvet seats have lost their plush. \" the telegraph describes it as a \" heap of rusty metal \" in a \" decrepit state. \" it's no wonder: the current owner purchased the plane for $ 430,000 at an auction only last year, but it had previously sat unused for 35 years on a runway in roswell, nm. There it remains, looking no better and still without an engine and some cockpit components. The 1962 lockheed jetstar has a few things going for it, though. It comes with documents certifying elvis ' onetime ownership and \" an immaculate safety manual, \" per the telegraph. There's also the potential to turn a profit, as the auction house that sold the plane in 2017 predicted it could be worth millions when restored. Adding to the allure is the fact that the plane is the only one owned by elvis that is not housed at his graceland estate. According to barrons, elvis ' other two planes, the lisa marie and hound dog ii, sold jointly for $ 15 million in 2015, and graceland subsequently announced a \" permanent \" agreement to keep the jets in memphis.",
