The autopsy indicates that may be the case: the report states rhoden suffered what appears to be a defensive wound to his right forearm, and that one bullet passed through a door before striking him. The 40-year-old was also shot in the torso and cheek. His cousin, gary rhoden, 38, was found dead in the same trailer; a \" muzzle stain \" on the side of his head indicates one of the three shots he received to the head was made with the gun pressed against him.

Published in the journal circulation, the study found those who regularly ate a southern diet — composed of fried or fatty foods, eggs, processed meats like bacon and ham, organ meats like liver, and sugary drinks — also had a higher risk of a heart-related death, hypertension, and diabetes compared to those who ate less southern food, reports livescience. Previous research tied the diet to an increased stroke risk. Though the study didn't investigate why the diet was worse than others — researchers found no heart risk among convenience, plant-based, and sweets diets — a researcher tells healthday excess saturated fats in processed meats and sugar can boost cholesterol, insulin resistance, and body weight to hurt the heart. Sodium and nitrate preservatives also fill blood vessels with plaque. The southern diet is most often consumed by black men in southern states, but \" regardless of your gender, race, or where you live, if you frequently eat a southern-style diet you should be aware of your risk of heart disease and try to make some gradual changes to your diet, \" a researcher says in a press release. \" try cutting down the number of times you eat fried foods or processed meats from every day to three days a week as a start, and try substituting baked or grilled chicken or vegetable-based foods. \" ( if not, here are heart attack tips. )",

But ever since businesses started offering shark cage-diving experiences in 2007, they say the animals have turned aggressive and begun attacking boats, reports the guardian. Consider this quote from a 72-year-old lifelong resident who rarely recalls seeing a shark up close as a kid. Now \" we see them all the time and not just one, sometimes three or four surrounding our boats, \" he says. \" we are being targeted, and it's only a matter of time before they get someone. \" as a result, islanders have petitioned government officials to shut down the shark operations, reports radio new zealand. \"it's like jaws anonymous out there, \" says one local fisherman. Oban is located on stewart island, which is home to just 380 people but a popular destination for tourists — especially those curious to see sharks. Companies under permit from the department of conservation lure the fish within a few miles of shore using baited hooks or buckets of chum, then lower tourists down in cages from their boats to see them firsthand. One such company was caught violating its permit by continuing a dive when a shark was agitated, reports stuff.co.nz. \" no other shark cage-diving operations operate this close to a tourist resort that is involved with the sea, \" says the owner of a fishing charter business. One dive operator, however, says that the fears are overblown and that the criticisms have been going on for years. \" we've probably become immune to it. \" ( these rare sharks were flocking to long island. )",

The tripoli court that sentenced seif al-islam, who is being held by a militia that refuses to hand him over to the central government, also sentenced to death eight others, including former libyan spy chief abdullah al-senoussi, who is in government custody.

        "summary": "In the wake of the massacre in las vegas, an outpouring of prayers, condolences — and opinions. Here's what some editorial boards and columnists are arguing: this was a \" nightmare scenario, \" writes phillip carter at slate, and he outlines three reasons why. One: \" the geometry of paddock's attack \" — that is, the \" distance, elevation, and obscuration \" — was one that the stepped-up security measures we now have at public events are no match for. \" it would have taken secret service-type precautions, of the sort deployed to protect presidents since john f. Kennedy's assassination, to prevent an attack like this. \" \" this is a nixon in china moment for trump, \" writes the philadelphia inquirer editorial board, which argues richard nixon found conservative support when visiting communist china because of his anti-communist attitudes. \" trump's stature with the gun-rights activists who helped him win the presidency opens the door for him to argue for more gun control. \" time will tell whether the man who once called for a ban on assault weapons will play the part of the \" nra's tool \" or not. \" the remedy that seems so self-evidently moral to so many — take away guns — finds no societal consensus, \" writes gil smart for tcpalm. As such, he thinks the most prudent approach is to push for a remedy that \" enjoys broad support. \" he nominates one: limiting the size of magazines; large-capacity ones were used in sandy hook, aurora, columbine, and fort hood among other massacres. The los angeles times editorial board has no interest in such middle ground. \" the gun lobby argues that military-style weapons are necessary for hunting, and for sport shooting. \" in its view, \" these are weapons of war, not of sport, and to argue otherwise is to either lie, or to not understand the difference. \" they must go, but we continually show we don't have the \" political will \" to make that happen. At the new york times, nicholas kristof isn't calling for a ban, but he is calling for action, and he sees the auto industry as a model worth emulating. He does the math behind the staggering drop in auto fatalities per 100 million miles driven since 1921, and observes that there \" was no single solution \" behind making that happen, \" but rather many incremental efforts. \" he suggests eight such incremental efforts we could make on the gun front.",

When you tour the museum, you come away with a powerful sense of immigration as a human experience, which — despite plenty of bad times, despite a cultural climate in which jews, italians, and others were often portrayed as racially inferior — was overwhelmingly positive.

The rover has discovered rock in the endeavour crater that's full of what appear to be clay minerals — suggesting it had extended contact with water, the bbc reports. Despite talk of water, \" what opportunity has mostly discovered, or found evidence for, was sulfuric acid, \" says a nasa rep. But \" clay minerals only tend to form at a more neutral ph. This is water you could drink. \" that points to intriguing possibilities: \" this is water that was much more favorable for things like pre-biotic chemistry — the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life, \" says the nasa spokesman. \" the fundamental conditions that we believe to be necessary for life were met here, \" he notes, per space.com. It's not the first time opportunity has found clay in the area — but the rock, called esperance, has the highest concentrations the rover has seen. Opportunity, which landed in 2004, wasn't expected to last this long. \" the rover could have a catastrophic failure at any moment. So, each day is a gift, \" says another nasa spokesman.",

In an upcoming episode of the science channel's nasa's unexplained files, audio from apollo 10 — which flew to the far side of the moon in 1969, two months before apollo 11's moon landing — reveals conversations among the astronauts as they hear odd sounds from the cosmos through their instruments, cnn reports. \" did you hear that whistling sound, too? \" one asks. \" sounds like … you know, outer-space type music, \" another answers. \" i wonder what it is. \" whatever \" it \" was, astronauts eugene cernan, john young, and tom stafford were wary of informing their higher-ups what they were hearing while out of contact with earth. \" shall we tell [ nasa ] about it? \" one asks, per fox news. \" i don't know, \" says another. \" we ought to think about it. \" they opted for silence, thinking such a report might \" cast doubt on their suitability for future spaceflight, \" per cnn.

The transcripts were revealed in 2008, but this is the first time the audio has been publicly heard. In addition to \" we're not alone \" speculation, one theory for the eerie sounds, which lasted about an hour, is that charged particles may have clashed with a magnetic field, rt.com notes ( though it adds the moon doesn't have a magnetic field to speak of ). Meanwhile, per cnn, a nasa technician who's interviewed on the science channel show insists that \" radios in the two spacecraft [ the lunar module and the command module ] were interfering with each other \" — an assertion that ex-astronaut and show voice-over al worden disputes. \" the apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, \" he says during the broadcast. \" logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there's something there. \" ( nasa erased original footage of the moon landing. )",

        "summary": "Pope benedict xvi is the first pope to step down since 1294, so you probably have quite a few questions about what happens next. But it turns out the process the papal conclave will use to elect the next pope will be fairly familiar: with the exception of a period of mourning, the process will be the same as it would have been had the pope died. Details on what's to come, from the wall street journal, msnbc, the duck of minerva, nbc news, and the ap: the conclave must begin between 15 and 20 days after the pope resigns. The cardinals eligible to vote — a group that does not include pope benedict himself, because the voters must be under age 80 and he is 85 — are sequestered in the sistine chapel. They are searched for cell phones and pagers upon entering, and all connections to the outside world are removed. Two ballots are held each morning and two each afternoon; they are burned after each round. Black smoke signals that no decision has been reached, while white smoke and bells signal that a new pope has been chosen. It could take longer this time around than it did last time, since pope benedict reverted back to the rule requiring a two-thirds majority. Under pope john paul ii, only a simple majority was needed if inconclusive voting continued for 12 days. If things stretch on too long, the church could find itself leaderless at easter. But traditionally, papal conclaves only last a few days; the longest one in the past two centuries was only five days. The united states will have a bigger part in the process than ever before, since almost 10 % of the conclave will be american. That's thanks to benedict, who named three new american cardinals last year, giving the us the second-largest voting bloc. The new pope looks over st. Peter's square as he is introduced with the phrase, \" habemus papam! \" ( latin for, \" we have a pope! \" ) and gives his first blessing. As for the former pope, benedict xvi will retain the title \" bishop of rome emeritus, \" but one expert says he doubts benedict will use it. Technically, the conclave can elect any baptized roman catholic male to be pope — but it will probably pick a cardinal, as it has done every time since 1378. Click to see the frontrunners.",

In a follow-up to last week's wall street journal article that alleged an adult film actress was paid $ 130,000 in 2016 to stay mum on a consensual sexual encounter with a then-married donald trump in 2006 comes the in touch article, published wednesday. It is based on a 2011 interview with stephanie clifford, who goes by the stage name stormy daniels, and describes her meeting trump at a 2006 golf tournament and having \" textbook generic \" sex that night. Among the more salacious details: that the encounter allegedly happened four months after melania trump gave birth, and that trump told clifford she was beautiful \" like his daughter. \" per the article, the two met up on future occasions, with the times quoting it as saying trump last called clifford in late 2009 or early 2010. The in touch article says it backed up clifford's claims via a polygraph and corroboration from an adult-film colleague and her ex-husband. Clifford has since denied the affair, and trump's lawyer, michael cohen, again disputed the account to the times, calling it the recirculation of \" an old and debunked story. \" as far as recirculation goes, slate group editor-in-chief jacob weisberg also elaborated on his conversations with clifford in august and october of 2016 ( no story was published at the time ) in a piece for slate, writing, \" the worst trump had done, she said, was break promises she'd never believed he would fulfill. \" like the in touch article, weisberg says clifford told her trump had promised her a slot on the apprentice. The story has gotten the late-night treatment, too: stephen colbert discussed it wednesday, quipping, \" wow, maybe in touch magazine should lead the russia investigation. \"",

        "summary": "The strange kidnapping case of denise huskins in california is over in the most important sense: the 29-year-old is safe and sound, reports the los angeles times. Now police have to figure out what on earth happened. The saga began monday afternoon when her boyfriend called police to report that she had been abducted for ransom hours earlier from his home in vallejo. Then yesterday, the san francisco chronicle got an emailed recording of a woman believed to be huskins. \"i ' m kidnapped, otherwise i ' m fine, \" she said, before including a reference to the french alps plane crash to prove the date. This morning, huskins left a voicemail for her dad informing him that she was ok and had been dropped off at his home in huntington beach, more than 400 miles away from vallejo. Mike huskins wasn't home at the time, and he called police after hearing the voicemail so they could go check on her. \" it doesn't sound like she knew what a big deal this was, \" he says. \" she said,'dad, i just want to let you know that i ' m all right. ' \" police in vallejo and huntington beach are working together to investigate the case, and they've named no suspects. \"we are still treating this as a kidnap for ransom, \" says one police official. \"we have no reason to believe otherwise. At this point, from an investigative standpoint, nothing has changed. \" huskins and boyfriend aaron quinn work together as physical therapists, and neither has spoken to the media since huskins'safe return.",

        "summary": "Doctors at texas ' md anderson cancer center and houston methodist hospital have made history with the first partial skull and scalp transplant from a human donor. Jim boysen, 55, of austin underwent a kidney-pancreas transplant in 1992 and had been taking immune suppression drugs to prevent organ rejection since. The drugs, however, increased his risk of cancer and in 2006 he was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, the bbc reports, which attacked muscles under his scalp — the ones \" that make your hair stand on end when something gives you the creeps, \" adds the ap. Radiation treatment left boysen with \" a wound that was basically all the way through his skull to his brain, \" reconstructive plastic surgeon jesse selber says, and the immune suppression drugs kept his body from healing it. Then, suddenly, boysen's kidney and pancreas began to fail — and the serious wound prevented doctors from carrying out a new transplant. After 18 months, a single donor was found; all boysen's transplants were done in a single 15-hour operation on may 22. More than 50 doctors and health workers gave boysen a 10-by-10-inch cap-shaped skull graft and a 15-inch-wide scalp graft, which reaches almost from ear to ear. The operation marked another first: the first composite tissue transplant performed alongside a solid organ transplant, khou reports. Boysen already has feeling in the scalp, which \" shocked \" a doctor during a test, and his new scalp has been sweating when hot. \" i ' m amazed at how great i feel, \" says boysen, who was to leave the hospital yesterday. The donated skin is a remarkable color match to his own, to boot. \" it's kind of shocking, really, how good they got it. I will have way more hair than when i was 21. \" ( a woman just met the man who wears her brother's face. )",

        "summary": "Michelle moon has had some wrenching conversations with her daughter, julianna snow, who, at just 5 years old, is dying of an incurable disease. She's endured painful procedures and numerous hospitalizations during her battle with charcot-marie-tooth, a neurodegenerative illness that has robbed her of the ability to walk, eat normally, or even breathe without the help of a machine, leading to the first such conversation with her mom when she was just 4. As recounted by moon on her blog in july of this year: \" julianna, if you get sick again, do you want to go to the hospital again or stay home? \" \" not the hospital. \" \" even if that means that you will go to heaven if you stay home? \" \" yes. \" many such conversations have followed, with moon and her husband making sure julianna understands what it means to die, and understands that's what will happen if she does not go back to the hospital. Moon has written about those conversations — and her and her husband's decision to honor their daughter's wishes, if they remain the same, by not sending her back to the hospital if her prognosis is not good — on both her blog and the mighty, and now cnn explores the family's sad story in a 2-part series. If julianna gets sick again, a hospital visit might just prolong her suffering rather than save her life, moon tells cnn, and her and her husband's desire to put their daughter through that in hopes of getting a bit more time with her is \" selfish, \" she says. But the decision is controversial, with some arguing a 5-year-old is too young to understand the stakes. \" our nurse cried with us and told us she believed children with terminal illnesses do understand death, \" moon wrote in a recent post on the mighty explaining the difficult decision. \" they may not understand everything about it, but who really does? \"",

Professor karen king got the scrap in 2011 from a collector, though its history before that remains unclear. Preliminary testing suggests it's legit, though king now wants other scholars to weigh in.

        "summary": "Think our evolutionary progress is irreversible? researchers at the university of michigan say tiny house dust mites evolved from organisms that specialized and later de-specialized in order to survive over millions of years, phys.org reports. The large-scale genetic study, published in systematic biology, challenges one of the basic suppositions of evolutionary biology — called dollo's law — which states that evolution goes one way and cannot be reversed. But dust mites evolved from parasites that once lived in warm-blooded vertebrates and caused harm to the host. They then evolved into free-living dust mites that lived in nests, and, with the advent of civilization, jumped ship to the sofas, carpets, and mattresses in human homes. What's more, the finding could help us deal with allergies, because house dust mites are the no.1 cause of human allergy symptoms. \" our study an example of how asking a purely academic question may result in broad practical applications, \" says an author of the study.",

        "summary": "Perhaps it was too intriguing to be true: a rep for the us mint and an expert on the san francisco mint throw water on the latest theory surrounding the $ 10 million in gold coins uncovered in california — that they were the long-hidden spoils of a 1901 gold heist from the sf mint. \" we do not have any information linking the saddle ridge hoard coins to any thefts at any united states mint facility, \" mint rep adam stump tells cnn, and that determination follows a good deal of research, he adds to the san francisco chronicle. \" we've got a crack team of lawyers, and trust me, if this was us government property we'd be going after it. \" richard kelly, who wrote a book on the sf mint, sees a further issue with the dates of the uncovered coins — they're stamped 1847 to 1894, and he thinks ones taken from the mint would be dated nearer to 1901. \" we assume from the times and all the records that they were new coins [ taken ]. Back then, once coins were printed they flew out of the mint. \" and a coin dealer tells the los angeles times that each of the six bags of double eagles ( that's a $ 20 coin ) stolen would have held coins bearing the same date and mint mark. The buried coins feature \" 12 times as many permutations as we should have, \" he says. The chronicle also takes a look at what one coin collector considers to be the smoking gun: an 1866 double eagle that had no \" in god we trust \" motto on it; 1866 was the year that motto began gracing the coins, and jack trout told the paper that he believed the presence of the rare and valuable coin amid the buried haul signaled that it had to have come directly from the sf mint. But the chronicle turns to the encyclopedia of us gold coins, which presents the coin as anything but one-of-a-kind: per the encyclopedia, 120,000 \" no motto \" double eagles were produced in san francisco in 1866 before the changeover occurred.

The four bullet wounds she sustained were in the chest, head, and hand.

That ex had described pistorius as \" certainly not what people think he is. Oscar has such a way with women. She's probably not the only one he's got. \" but another ex tweeted that \" i have dated oscar on and off for 5 years, not once has he ever lifted a finger to me or made me fear for my life. \" in a talk scheduled for the day she died, steenkamp was planning to reveal her past in an abusive relationship. \" i was in an abusive relationship at the same time [ his mother used to abuse him ] and all together these factors encouraged my move to jozi [ johannesburg ], \" she would have said. In a chilling video for her new reality series, steenkamp left a prophetic message about death, the new york post reports. \" i think the way that you go out — not just your journey in life — but the way that you go out to make your exit is so important, \" she said.",

        "summary": "When paleontologists on a national geographic society expedition dug up a 100-million-year-plus sample sticking out of the dirt in montana in 1997, they initially thought it was a rock — until they saw it had teeth. Now, 17 years later, they've finally gotten around to naming and describing the creature, believed to be the oldest horned dinosaur ever found in north america, national geographic reports. A study published this week in plos one introduces aquilops americanus, a relative of the triceratops with an eagle-like face but a much smaller frame: scientists believe the dino was about 2 feet long and weighed around 3.5 pounds, or \" about as much as a large bunny rabbit. \" the skull bones point to a teen dinosaur, though scientists suspect the adult version wasn't significantly bigger. \" imagine a chihuahua beside a great dane, \" cleveland paleontologist michael ryan tells national geographic in describing the differences between aquilops and its ceratopsian cousins. Ryan adds that this early cretaceous animal didn't have the fancy neck frill the triceratops boasts or long brow horns: instead, it's populated with plenty of tinier horns and a sharply hooked beak that leads scientists to infer it was a picky vegetarian. And because this fossil looks most like ceratopsians from asia, it serves as an important clue regarding how dinosaurs migrated across the continents millions of years ago, ryan explains.

The fossil skull is the oldest definitive evidence of a ceratopsian, the group of horned dinosaurs that includes triceratops, on the continent. Paleontologists describe the dinosaur wednesday in the journal plos one. Named aquilops for its \" eagle-faced \" appearance, the dinosaur was quite small. Based on comparisons with similar ceratopsians from asia, paleontologist andrew farke expects that aquilops was no more than two feet long ( 0.6 meter ) and weighed about three and a half pounds ( 1.6 kilograms ) — \" about as much as a large bunny rabbit. \" while the skull bones indicate that aquilops was the dinosaur equivalent of an adolescent, farke notes, the adult animal probably wasn't much bigger. The paleontologists who found the little skull didn't know what they had found at first.

            "The fossil record for neoceratopsian ( horned ) dinosaurs in the lower cretaceous of north america primarily comprises isolated teeth and postcrania of limited taxonomic resolution, hampering previous efforts to reconstruct the early evolution of this group in north america. An associated cranium and lower jaw from the cloverly formation (?middle – late albian, between 104 and 109 million years old ) of southern montana is designated as the holotype for aquilops americanus gen. Et sp. Nov. Aquilops americanus is distinguished by several autapomorphies, including a strongly hooked rostral bone with a midline boss and an elongate and sharply pointed antorbital fossa. The skull in the only known specimen is comparatively small, measuring 84 mm between the tips of the rostral and jugal. The taxon is interpreted as a basal neoceratopsian closely related to early cretaceous asian taxa, such as liaoceratops and auroraceratops. Biogeographically, a. Americanus probably originated via a dispersal from asia into north america; the exact route of this dispersal is ambiguous, although a beringian rather than european route seems more likely in light of the absence of ceratopsians in the early cretaceous of europe. Other amniote clades show similar biogeographic patterns, supporting an intercontinental migratory event between asia and north america during the late early cretaceous. The temporal and geographic distribution of upper cretaceous neoceratopsians ( leptoceratopsids and ceratopsoids ) suggests at least intermittent connections between north america and asia"

In 1997, during a national geographic society-funded expedition to montana led by richard cifelli of the sam noble oklahoma museum of natural history, paleontologist scott madsen, currently at the utah geological survey, found a rock dating to",
            "The fossil record for neoceratopsian ( horned ) dinosaurs in the lower cretaceous of north america primarily comprises isolated teeth and postcrania of limited taxonomic resolution, hampering previous efforts to reconstruct the early evolution of this group in north america. An associated cranium and lower jaw from the cloverly formation (?middle – late albian, between 104 and 109 million years old ) of southern montana is designated as the holotype for aquilops americanus gen. Et sp. Nov. Aquilops americanus is distinguished by several autapomorphies, including a strongly hooked rostral bone with a midline boss and an elongate and sharply pointed antorbital fossa. The skull in the only known specimen is comparatively small, measuring 84 mm between the tips of the rostral and jugal. The taxon is interpreted as a basal neoceratopsian closely related to early cretaceous asian taxa, such as liaoceratops and auroraceratops. Biogeographically, a. Americanus probably originated via a dispersal from asia into north america; the exact route of this dispersal is ambiguous, although a beringian rather than european route seems more likely in light of the absence of ceratopsians in the early cretaceous of europe. Other amniote clades show similar biogeographic patterns, supporting an intercontinental migratory event between asia and north america during the late early cretaceous. The temporal and geographic distribution of upper cretaceous neoceratopsians ( leptoceratopsids and ceratopsoids ) suggests at least intermittent connections between north america and asia"

Three of them are chlorofluorocarbons — which were mostly banned by the 1987 montreal protocol — and one is another ozone-destroying gas called a hydrochlorofluorocarbon. The scientific team from europe and australia says the gases are likely coming from the northern hemisphere, possibly due to chemicals used in electronic-component cleaning or insecticide production. Most concerning of the four is cfc-113a, which is being emitted in small amounts but still doubled between 2010 and mid-2012, new scientist reports. This particular chlorofluorocarbon was covered in a loophole that let industries apply for exemptions to the montreal protocol, said lead researcher johannes laube. \" what's more, the three cfcs are being destroyed very slowly in the atmosphere — so even if emissions were to stop immediately, they will still be around for many decades to come, \" said laube, the bbc reports.",

The \" greeting pine \" stands on a mountain overlooking the valleys of huangshan and is believed to be a millennium old. It has its own guardian: he's the 19th one and is tasked with checking on the tree every two hours around the clock. Hu xiaochun tells nbc news that in addition to protecting the distinctive evergreen from squirrels and monkeys, he has to protect it from tourists, most of whom stop in front of it for a photo. \" human sweat damages the bark, and we are trying to ensure that it keeps growing naturally, \" he says. \" the chinese now have disposable income to allow them to travel for pleasure, and these sites are becoming inundated with commercial enterprises and the tourists who use them. As a result some sites are being ' loved to death, ' \" says one expert. More than 3.3 million people visited huangshan in 2016, with most of them stopping at the greeting pine, so named because of two large branches that appear to be welcoming guests with open arms, the sixth tone reports. Nbc news describes tourists as pushing against the fence surrounding the tree in an attempt to get closer. The concern over the tree's health comes as china increasingly focuses on environmental issues, a big change from its previous \" growth-at-all-costs \" approach to economics and the environment.",

So it's safe to say tillerson is in dc for a while? don't count on it, reports the washington post, which talks to no fewer than 19 current and former administration officials and capitol hill aides and concludes that tillerson's move \" to reassure trump of his convictions may well be too little and too late for the long term. \" one person uses the term \" death spiral \" to summarize the situation. Related coverage: big picture: an assessment at politico is in sync with the one at the post. \" nothing about wednesday's events will dispel the image of tillerson as a man unhappy and ill at ease with the president he serves — both in substance and in style, \" write eliana johnson and nahal toosi. They recount the various policy clashes on everything from north korea to qatar to the paris climate accord, along with the pair's very different management styles. Maybe worse: at the weekly standard, michael warren thinks the press conference may have made things worse by drawing more attention to the negative press. \" the ill feelings are out in the open and threaten to undermine trump's authority and/or tillerson's job. \" trump's take: he says the reports are bogus. \" rex tillerson never threatened to resign, \" he tweeted thursday. \" this is fake news put out by @nbcnews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me. \" he also suggested that the senate intelligence panel investigate \" fake news networks. \" trump loyalists: the daily beast talks to three white house aides who wish tillerson would just go already. The president, however, seems reluctant to see yet more turnover in his administration. Before and after: a post at axios contrasts tillerson's life as the ceo of exxon, where he called all the shots and reined nearly like a king, with his new role. \" after a perfect career, your last public act is already an obvious failure — and you have to keep doing it. \"'suicide pact '?: buzzfeed, quoting an anonymous source, reports that tillerson, treasury chief steven mnuchin, and defense chief james mattis have a \" suicide pact \" under which all three will resign if trump moves against one of them.

Two years later, the justices made clear that this right also applies against state and local governments. Since then the supreme court has repeatedly declined to say anything more about how far states and cities can go in restricting gun rights, but today it granted a plea to weigh in, this time in a case from new york city. The request for review came from the new york state pistol and rifle association and a group of gun owners who live in the city. They were challenging the city's ban on transferring even licensed, unloaded guns anywhere outside the city limits – including to a weekend home or shooting range for target practice – restrictions they describe as \"draconian. \" after the lower courts rejected their challenge and upheld the restrictions, the nyspra and gun owners went to the supreme court.

        "summary": "Two species of birds might be deliberately starting wildfires in australia, the tech times reports. This might seem outlandish, but cultural geographer mark bonta tells newsweek it's \" standard knowledge \" among the aboriginal community and firefighters in northern australia. According to the washington post, birds of prey are known to hunt around the edges of wildfires — which force small animals to flee their hiding places — but those fires don't always start where the food is. That's why brown falcons and black kites are apparently picking up burning sticks and dropping them elsewhere to start new fires. Bob gosford, a lawyer who works with australia's aboriginal people, has collected 15 accounts of birds starting fires, a behavior that is referenced in at least one old aboriginal ceremony. He and bonta of penn state are working on getting their findings published in a peer-reviewed journal. If the pair can prove that birds are starting fires, it \" would force us to rewrite what we know, \" bonta tells newsweek. It's been taken for granted that either humans or lightning cause wildfires. The change would mean birds, not humans, may have been responsible for the fires that cleared the savannas. It would also open the possibility that humans learned to control fire by watching birds. \" the birds aren't starting fires from scratch, but it's the next best thing, \" bonta tells the post. \" fire is supposedly so uniquely human. \" bonta admits their findings won't be accepted by the scientific community until they have video of the birds ' behavior. That's why they're asking people around the world to keep an eye out for fire-starting birds and to have their cameras handy. ( speaking of surprising animal behavior, one aquarium taught an asthmatic otter to use an inhaler. )",

        "summary": "The aclu claimed a \" big victory \" tuesday in its fight with the trump administration to reunite families separated at the border. \" these families thought they might never see each other again. Tonight's court ruling will change lives, \" the aclu tweeted on a federal judge's preliminary injunction to order all children affected by a \" zero tolerance \" immigration policy back with their parents. Per the los angeles times, kids younger than 5 must be reunited with parents within 14 days; older children must be reunited within 30 days. In a ruling brought about by a \" chaotic circumstance of the government's own making, \" us district judge dana sabraw noted \" the unfortunate reality \" of cars, money, and other personal items being tracked better than the more than 2,000 children who've so far been taken from their parents, per politico. \" certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process. \" under sabraw's mandate, parents also can't be detained or deported without their kids, unless it's shown a parent is unfit or otherwise poses a danger, and prompt phone contact between parents and kids must be allowed, per nbc news. The injunction was a response to a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two women separated from their children, including a congolese woman who made headlines. Sabraw's ruling comes on the heels of an executive order from president trump that was supposed to remedy the separations, but which stayed \" silent on the issue of reuniting families that have already been separated or will be separated in the future, \" wrote sabraw, a george w. Bush appointee. \" tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited, \" lee gelernt, deputy director of the aclu's immigrants ' rights project, said in a statement.",

Hunter osborn also has a felony charge of furnishing harmful items to minors after he posed for red mountain high's varsity football team photo with his genitals exposed as he stood grinning in the second row of players; there's just enough space between two players in the front row to allow his offending parts to be seen. Kpho notes that about 3,400 students received a copy of the yearbook, per mesa police ( though a knxv reporter tweeted only 250 students nabbed a copy before the school caught on ); court docs indicate the team photo was also distributed at football games. Cops say osborn purposely had his penis sticking out over the top of his waistband during the photo, which was taken with 69 students between the ages of 15 and 19 present ( hence the 69 misdemeanor counts ), as well as 10 faculty members. Osborn, who was 18 when the photo was taken, says he was dared to do it and that he now is \" disgusted \" with himself. Although the school issued a harsh statement saying it was \" dismayed, \" some — including a neighbor who describes osborn as an otherwise smart, considerate person who holds down a steady job and goes to church — are saying a criminal probe is taking it too far. \" it's something that's going to be on his record for the rest of his life, \" a sophomore at his school tells kpho. And a student who put up a change.org petition to \" free hunter osborn \" notes: \" he didn't put the picture in the yearbook, he didn't create the page, he wasn't the editor that approved it, or the teacher responsible for publishing it and distributing it to students. \" the school has recalled the yearbooks to make \" a minor but critical edit for the inappropriate content, \" and osborn was released on his own recognizance with an electronic monitor after being jailed saturday.

Paul ciancia, 23, was shot in the leg and took a bullet in the mouth that split his tongue and knocked out his teeth, reports the new york daily news. Officials say he is listed in fair condition and will require surgery and extensive physical therapy. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of tsa agent gerardo hernandez and could face the death penalty. Four others, including two tsa agents, were injured. A note made it clear ciancia hated tsa agents, but his background doesn't provide many clues to his motive. At the catholic boys'school he attended in delaware, near his family's home in southern new jersey, he is remembered as a quiet loner. He was mostly silent in class apart from the occasional sarcastic comment, but \" i've seen him smile and laugh before, \" a classmate tells the philadelphia inquirer. Ciancia and his younger brother, taylor, were both badly affected by the death of their mother in 2009, a classmate of taylor ciancia's says, describing the pair as awkward. \" they had some depression issues, and they both got obsessive, \" she says. Ciancia had lived in la for about a year before the shooting, acquiring at least three weapons, but seemed normal when a former roommate met him for lunch just a week before the shooting. \" he would always talk about documentaries he would watch about whatever, but there was never any kind of hatred, or any hatred group, or anything like that, \" the roommate tells abc 7. \" he said he was going back to new jersey, going to work for his dad, making amends with family problems, and spending the holidays with his family. That's all i know. \" the fbi says it has found no evidence he associated with radical groups and he told police at the scene that he acted alone. At lax, meanwhile, 100-foot pylons leading to the airport have been lit up in memory of hernandez, the first tsa agent to be killed in the line of duty, the new york times reports. The father of two, who would have turned 40 next week, had worked for the tsa since 2010 and \" was always excited to go to work, \" his widow says. \" he was a joyful person who took pride in his duty for the american public. \"",

It's the first time the hague has tried someone in absentia since the nuremberg trials. Hezbollah is shielding the four suspects from arrest, the new york times explains, and if international authorities ever do apprehend the four, they ' ll be entitled to a new trial should this one convict them of charges including premeditated murder and terrorism. But prosecutors launched into opening arguments today nonetheless, saying the feb. 14, 2005, attack was intended to sow fear, and arguing that the perpetrators used more explosives than necessary to kill hariri. Indeed, 22 others died in a suicide blast that created a crater 35 feet wide. The prosecutors ' case is based primarily on records from more than 50 cellphones, along with roughly 500 witness statements, which they say show that the accused closely charted hariri's movements for months and obtained the van that was then loaded with explosives. The nearly four years of preparation has already cost $ 325 million, notes the bbc; in response to accusations that the money is wasted, the tribunal has said \" justice is not a waste of time. \"",

Fifi was long thought to be an urban legend, but newly opened documents from britain's national archives show that she was real, the washington post reports. Fifi was her code name; her real name was marie christine chilver, and she was \" one of the expert liars of the world, \" according to a british airman she helped return to england after he was shot down. That adventure earned her the attention of britain's special operations executive, the bbc reports. Her new job was to pose as a french freelance journalist, meeting trainee agents in bars and testing their discretion. The majority of trainees failed the test, the bbc notes, and that could lead to their firing. The half-english, half-latvian chilver, who spoke many languages, was \" a symbol of seduction — not surprising, since she's said to have bedded trainee agents to find out whether they talked in their sleep, \" writes a national archives researcher. After the war, she conducted intelligence work in germany and set up an animal charity in latvia, the independent reports; she died in 2007. \" she didn't have many friends, \" says one worker at chilver's charity. \" i think she led a lonely life. \"",

        "summary": "A woman protesting us immigration policy climbed the statue of liberty's base and forced the monument's evacuation on the fourth of july hours after several other demonstrators had hung a banner on the statue's pedestal and had been arrested, the ap reports. About 100 feet above ground, the climber engaged in a roughly four-hour standoff with police before two new york police department officers climbed up to the base and went over to her. With the dramatic scene unfolding on live television, she and the officers edged carefully around the rim of the statue's robes toward a ladder, and she climbed down about 25 feet to the monument's observation point and was taken into custody. The woman was later identified by police sources as 44-year-old therese patricia okoumou, an immigrant from congo who lives on staten island, per the new york post. Sources say okoumou told first responders she was protesting the trump administration's border separations and was doing it for \" the children in texas, \" per buzzfeed. Okoumou had participated earlier in displaying a banner calling for abolishing the government's chief immigration enforcement agency, says jay walker, a member of rise and resist, which organized the demonstration; the group initially tweeted the climber had \" no connection \" to the demonstration. Walker later said she was involved but others had no idea she would make the climb, which wasn't part of the planned protest. The climber apparently ascended from the observation point and visitors were forced to leave liberty island hours before its normal 6: 15pm closing time. Earlier and farther below, at least six people were taken into custody after unfurling a banner that read \" abolish ice, \" an official says.",

Longer vowels — like turning \" five \" into \" fiiiive, \" as franchesca ramsey does here. Longer consonants — including the way \" fascinatingly \" becomes \" fffascinatingly \" in this vlogbrothers video. These examples all come from popular youtube accounts, beck notes, so the speaking style clearly works. Maybe they picked it up from more informal news broadcasters like jon stewart ( who uses youtube voice in this clip ). \" what's interesting is how similar people end up sounding, rather than sounding like themselves, \" baron tells her. \" in an attempt to make yourself sound special, you end up sounding like this whole genre of other people. \" read more about youtube voice in beck's article — or check out these six youtube stars who are making millions.",

The company points to added convenience for shoppers who miss their delivery and prefer the option of picking up their package at a nearby store, but even the director of the ups access point locker program notes that \" providing additional convenient delivery locations is one of the secrets to more shopping cart conversions. \" consumerist chimes in that the company benefits, too, because trying to deliver one package at a time to people who aren't home \" is a lot less efficient than the business-to-business shipping that ups was used to before amazon prime happened. \" to use a smart locker, people scan their \" sorry we missed you \" slip at a kiosk typically located outside convenience stores like 7-eleven, and the door with the waiting package opens. After testing the program in chicago, it is expanding to illinois, new york, pennsylvania, virginia, and washington state, and will next include california, florida, georgia, massachusetts, missouri, new hampshire, new jersey, and texas. Cbs news reports that \" it makes business sense \" given more than one-third of online shoppers surveyed say they want an alternative way to pick up packages, while bloomberg reports that the company already has 8,000 us stores that receive packages ( not necessarily with smart lockers ), including local retailers and pharmacies, and another 16,000 in europe.

            "United parcel service inc. Will install lockers outside 300 retailers in the u.s. As the shipping giant expands it use of alternate delivery sites. The move expands ups's experiment with outdoor lockers at nine chicago-area locations, which were typically placed outside of retailers and accessible around the clock. The company is working with the 7-eleven convenience-store chain and independent stores to offer the new lockers. The program lets customers pick up packages at their own convenience while eliminating the need for ups to make costly second and third home-delivery attempts. The rollout marks an expansion of ups's access point program, which until now generally recruited local retailers and pharmacies to receive packages and store them indoors. The company now has 8,000 such locations in the u.s. And 16,000 in europe. \"ups access point lockers can be easily accessed when it fits the shopper's schedule, giving an online retailer added value to present at checkout, \" kalin robinson, director of the locker program, said in a statement thursday. \"the lockers enable more shoppers to enjoy the ease and simplicity of buying online. \"",

That prompted ups to try a self-service \" smart locker \" program in 2014, testing whether customers would want to pick up packages if they weren't home for delivery. Ups says it's expanding the trial from its initial test in chicago to more than 300 locations across the country, in an attempt to help customers who want to get their deliveries faster. Of course, it makes business sense for the delivery service, since asking customers to meet the company halfway cuts down on delivery time, resulting in lower labor and gas costs.

        "summary": "The united states is in an escalating dispute with... Canada? the two nations have been clashing over trade policy in regard to the lumber and dairy industries, with the us slapping tariffs on timber from its second-largest trading partner and president trump sounding off on what he views as unfair practices. A look at what's going on: trump and trudeau spoke by phone tuesday, and the us and canada then issued two very different readouts, notes business insider. The us deemed it \" amicable \" in a short synopsis, while canada's went into more detail and complained about \" unfair \" american actions and \" baseless \" accusations. The washington post explains the wonky dairy dispute. It notes that canada's industry \" is one of the world's most highly protected, \" and us farmers think it unfairly freezes them out. One recent sticking point revolves around a cheese-making product called ultrafiltered milk. It was a money-maker in canada for us farmers until the canadian government reclassified it and made it subject to heavy import taxes, reports slate. Canada, for its part, thinks the us floods the global market with too much milk. As for lumber, one key difference explains the problem, per the atlantic: us lumber companies generally harvest trees on private land, while canadian companies do so on public land. Us companies say this amounts to a subsidy that allows canadian firms to flood the us market with cheap wood. A post at the canadian site maclean's thinks trump is going to go after wine sales in british columbia next, arguing that the canadian product has an unfair advantage over us wine because of grocery store rules. These disputes actually go back decades, flare up occasionally, and generally are worked out quietly, explains the new york times. This public flap, however, sets the stage for upcoming nafta negotiations. A story at politico suggests that canada is an easy target because it can't retaliate. Plus, trump \" has a chance to look tough and decisive on the international stage as he tries to renegotiate nafta, one of his big campaign promises. \" commerce secretary wilbur ross describes the problems from the us point of view in this video. Canada's foreign minister suggested that instead of imposing retaliatory tariffs, canada would take the us to international court, reports cnn. \" when it comes to defending canada's economic interests, we're going to play hard, \" said chrystia freeland. Bloomberg interviews trudeau about all this and his dealings with trump, and he compliments trump for being a good listener. \" he has shown that if he says",

Per a news release, researchers report that two independent studies support the same theme: that a diet with very low to zero carbs prompts the liver to produce ketone bodies to power vital organs like the brain, and that this seems to help those mice on that diet live better and longer. That doesn't mean these findings will translate to humans, reports phys.org, and following a strict keto diet requires \" drastic \" measures, per one of the researchers. The diet may also come with other health risks, such as obesity. Currently, keto diets help clinically manage conditions like epilepsy, reports medical xpress. Exercise, too, create ketones, which the researcher adds \" may be one of the mechanisms why it shows such protective effects on brain function and on healthspan and lifespan. \" in one study published in cell metabolism, researchers found this helped \" extend \" both longevity and healthspan. In the second, also in cell metabolism, midlife mortality went down while memory was improved in elderly mice.

            "So-called \" keto \" diets have been gaining public attention for an array of weight loss and health benefit claims. But scientists are still uncovering what exactly happens in ketosis, when carbohydrate intake is so low that the body shifts to producing ketones to help fuel organs.

The 53-year-old man lost consciousness a few minutes after diving into waters around 80 feet deep, the bbc reports. Authorities say it was the veteran diver's first dive in the sewol. He is the first diver to die during the search and the government has now ordered health checks for all divers involved in the operation. Not counting the diver, the death toll from the disaster now stands at 263, with 39 people still missing, reports cnn. Around 130 divers are still searching the submerged ship, where closed cabin doors blocked by debris are making it difficult to search the few rooms that have yet to be checked. Shipping documents have revealed that the doomed ferry was severely overloaded on a regular basis, and investigators today for the first time indicated that overloading was one of the causes of the tragedy — by way of the arrest of four chonghaejin marine company officials, who face charges of accidental homicide, the new york times reports. Says a prosecutor, \" we are still calculating exactly how many tons of cargo the ship was carrying, but based on what we have found out so far, it's clear that it was carrying more than allowed. \"",

Her teenagers had called their dad, who then called police, when she never made it home that night, per waay. Holman's shoes, phone, and pocketbook were all inside the car, but holman herself was nowhere to be seen. A crew of firefighters, police dogs, and local law enforcement spent all day saturday looking for holman, but they still hadn't found any sign of her by nightfall. Then, sunday morning, came the news everyone wanted to hear. Holman had been found alive, though with some broken bones, and was \" alert \" and \" able to walk out of the woods \" on her own, per a facebook post by pelham's police department. A volunteer gave her his shoes to replace the ones holman had left in her car, per wvtm. Holman's family released a statement later sunday, saying the time she'd been missing had been \" very emotional, \" and that \" her ability to withstand these injuries, the weather conditions, and the length of time in the woods is a testament to her resiliency. \" amy miller, who helped look for holman and says she's her best friend, says holman told her she'd lost her way in the dark after the crash and eventually hunkered down underneath a rock overhang, wiat reports. Authorities are still putting together the rest of holman's ordeal.",

The city has invited former naacp leader rachel dolezal, who triggered a national conversation about race and identity last year when it was revealed that she had presented herself as black even though she was born to white parents, to participate on a panel. The controversy forced her from her post as president of the spokane, wash., chapter of the naacp. On twitter, dolezal said she was looking forward to attending the event. The announcement of dolezal's participation has renewed the conversation surrounding her, with several citizens and media outlets calling for cary to \" rethink this, \" as paul blest at indyweek put it. Cary city council is divided, with people speaking out on both sides of the issue. Festival organizers hope the event will give people the \" opportunity to see her in a different light, \" and ignite discussions about the wider role of race and self-identity.

He anticipates dolezal will help bring about similar discussions. She is expected to participate in a structured conversation with representatives of the naacp and african-american studies professors from area universities to \"allow a fuller understanding of how she has come to view racial identity and what we might learn from her perspective, \" according to jireh management. [... ] \"we are not trying to win everybody, but we are trying to remind everyone what the true values are in life, \" he said. \"when we talk about mlk, we talk about a man that sacrificed his life to make sure that equality was experienced for all man and that justice was given and forgiveness. \" dolezal, who was born to white parents, drew national attention last year after resigning as president of the naacp chapter in spokane, wash., following allegations that she lied about her racial identity. Hurricane matthew continued to confound forecasters wednesday, as the storm's movement slowed and its expected track shifted to the east, away from north carolina's coast. [... ] the forecast changed in part when matthew slowed down over the caribbean, reducing the influence of an upper-level trough of low pressure that had been expected to steer the storm northward into the carolinas, said ryan ellis, a meteorologist at the national weather service in raleigh. There's still some uncertainty in the models, ellis said, as well as factors, such as its interaction with land along the coast, that could change the storm's strength and trajectory. \"this has been one of the hardest ones to predict that i can remember, \" ellis said. \" college is about learning, and it is our expectation that the members of the marching pirates will learn from this experience and fulfill their responsibilities. While we affirm the right of all our students to express their opinions, protests of this nature by the marching pirates will not be tolerated moving forward. \" the university's chancellor, cecil staton, held a different tune. \" while we acknowledge and understand the disappointment felt by many pirate fans in response to the events at the beginning of today's football game, we urge all pirate students, supporters and participants to act with respect for each other '"

Lawyers for the men are trying to block the executions, and some had argued a stay of execution was still in place for the inmates. On thursday the arkansas supreme court said there's no stay in place. The ap notes the execution dates appear to have been set so close together, with the inmates being executed in pairs, in an attempt to finish them before arkansas'supply of one of the execution drugs, midazolam, expires at the end of april. Attorneys for some of the men argue that midazolam, which knocks the inmates out before other drugs kill them, doesn't keep them from experiencing pain and thus the state's lethal injection protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Arkansas must also obtain a new supply of another execution drug, potassium chloride, because its supply expired last month.",

The numbers: hughes writes he sank $ 20 million into it ( independent of the purchase itself ). As for traffic losses, the wall street journal reports via comscore that november 2015 traffic was down 38 % year-over-year, to 2.3 million unique visitors. What's next: the atlantic highlights one idea. \" good! \" so proclaims erik wemple at the washington post. \" it would have been understandable if hughes had lost his nerve after a couple of decades. But this guy lost his nerve after a couple of years. \" the twitterati: sample tweet: \" this is the silicon valley version of the saudi oil prince who crashes a lamborghini in the desert and walks away. \"",

Men with a meat-heavy diet ranked higher than those with carb-heavy diets, but smelled \" more intense, \" per npr. \" we've known for a while that odor is an important component of attractiveness, especially for women, \" says a study co-author. The scientists tested this by using a spectrophotometer to shine a light on the male participants'skin and measure the color that is reflected back, which turns out to be a pretty good gauge of diet. They also had the men complete a survey about their eating habits, and finally put on a clean shirt and exercise. Then women were asked to blindly rate the resulting sweat samples, and they rather consistently \" found that men who ate more vegetables smelled nicer, \" the co-author says. In less diplomatic terms, \" carbs are making you stink, man, \" writes clay skipper at gq, concluding, \" an apple a day can keep the doctor away, but it turns out it can also maybe help get you laid. \" ( apparently celery works pheromone wonders. )",

It requires work — knowing when not to eat your carbs ( do if you're on a regular gym schedule; don't in the days before a wedding ) and being able to rationalize your questionable, often late-night decisions to go for simple ones ( doughnuts ) over complex ones ( whole grains ). Eating carbohydrates, basically, is like putting on a chainsmokers song: knowing when to do it, and how, is the difference between self-optimization ( getting turnt in an uber ) and self-harm ( forcing her to walk out on that candlelit dinner for two ). Now, a recent study adds another layer of difficulty to this already strained partnership: according to ladies, eating carbs not only makes your body odor stronger; it also makes it suck more. How do the science people know this? according, to npr, they measured dudes ' eating habits in two ways: a spectrophotometer, which uses the hue of your skin to determine how many fruits and vegetables you're eating ( the plant pigments begin to show up on you, so you literally are what you eat, i guess ); and an eating habits questionnaire that"

He slowed to get driver michael johannes ' attention — johannes ' brakes had started to fail as he drove 65mph, and he had just started to smell something odd as renning flagged him down — but both drivers were able to pull over to the side of the road. Then an electrical malfunction caused the chevy trailblazer's doors to lock and trap johannes inside, and that was when renning's adrenaline kicked in. \" the interior of the car was completely filled in smoke. You couldn't see who or what was inside, \" renning tells wcco. After asking his girlfriend to call 911, he ran toward the suv as johannes tried to kick out the passenger side window. Renning \" grabbed the top of the door frame and pulled until the glass shattered, \" he says, then pulled johannes out. Renning was unharmed and johannes suffered only minor cuts and smoke inhalation. For his trouble, renning was nominated for a good samaritan award by the state police and will also be rewarded with a beer, courtesy of johannes. Johannes ' previous car had been totaled two weeks before, and he'd just purchased the used 2006 suv. \" we're going to take our time in selecting our next vehicle, \" he notes.

Among the astounding numbers: since last night, walmart has sold 1.3 million tvs and 1.8 million... Towels? yes, towels. The company's president and ceo says just 26 store protests took place, and \" many of them did not include any walmart associates. \" he estimates less than 50 actual walmart workers took part. The atlantic wire doesn't see how that could possibly be correct, but thinks the group organizing the protests is probably exaggerating, too — it claims strikes in 100 cities, 1,000 protests, and \" hundreds and hundreds \" walking off the job. Reuters reports that at one chicago walmart, just one single employee out of 500 took part, but four busloads of protesters eventually joined him. A protest at a california walmart was particularly big, with 1,000 people taking part; nine of them were arrested peacefully after refusing to disperse, the los angeles times reports.",

The debt crisis, mario draghi told the european parliament, has exposed the inadequacy of the financial framework created in 1999 and shown the need for stronger financial ties between member nations. Europe's leaders have only made matters worse with hesitancy and half-measures, and they need to hurry up, \" dispel the fog, \" and decide what they want the eurozone to look like in years to come, draghi said. As the euro hit a 2-year low against the dollar, european union officials called for a eurozone-wide guarantee on bank deposits, reuters reports. Such a move could ease the growing banking crisis in spain, where newly released figures show that depositors worried about the state of the country's banks moved a record $ 82 billion out of the country in march, well before the government stepped in to partly nationalize the country's fourth-biggest lender.",

During a court hearing monday in nevada, they told the judge they are not asking for a stay of execution, but that they want to make sure dozier is executed humanely, the las vegas review-journal reports. Medical experts have raised concerns with the drugs the state is planning to use to execute dozier; the combination of fentanyl, diazepam, and cisatracurium has never been used before and experts say the cisatracurium, a paralytic, could mask signs of pain and suffering dozier experiences during the execution. Even the judge at monday's hearing expressed concerns about \" new frontiers as far as the drugs and the protocol and it happening. \" dozier, 46 — convicted of two murders, per the las vegas sun — has reportedly told the judge in person and in writing that he wants the execution to proceed, and has said he's not concerned about pain and suffering. But \" these issues pose a moral dilemma. That's the best i can say, \" assistant federal public defender david anthony said after monday's hearing. \" as a defense attorney, i try to help people and save people, and so it creates a moral dilemma. \" anthony noted that the state's chief medical officer, who designed the drug cocktail that will be used, resigned last week and that he had not yet discussed the new medical officials overseeing the execution with his client; their lack of experience could make things riskier, he argued, per the los angeles times. \" it's not a shame for anyone here if we need to push the pause button, \" he said. Dozier's next court date is wednesday.",

        "summary": "Ever wished you were a bit taller? how about 4 inches taller? if you smoked marijuana as a prepubescent boy, that wish may not have come true. Researchers at a university in pakistan studied levels of hormones linked to growth and puberty in the blood of 217 boys addicted to marijuana and 220 who didn't smoke at all. They found that though levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone, linked to puberty, were higher among pot users, growth hormone levels were significantly lower. When researchers checked back in with the males at age 20, they found non-smokers were almost 9 pounds heavier and 4.6 inches taller on average than their smoking counterparts, science daily reports. Marijuana users may think the drug helps them relax, but researchers actually traced the cause to added stress on the body. In saliva samples taken from 10 marijuana addicts, researchers found boosted levels of the stress hormone cortisol, the belfast telegraph reports. \" marijuana use may provoke a stress response that stimulates onset of puberty but suppresses growth rate, \" the study leader says, adding, \" early puberty is associated with younger age of onset of drinking and smoking, and early matures have higher levels of substance abuse because they enter the risk period at an early level of emotional maturity. \" about 7 % of youngsters aged 11 to 15, or 250,000 kids, used pot in england in 2013, reports the daily telegraph, but most cannabis users fall into the 15-to-24 age group.
