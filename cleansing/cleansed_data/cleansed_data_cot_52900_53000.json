He says senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and democratic leader chuck schumer \" have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. \" but trump tweeted at the wrong account, tagging a schumer fan instead of the senator.

In some areas where the chemicals are used, birth defects and cancer rates have spiked up to four times the national average. Though the chemicals are said to be safe when used properly, the people handling them often have no training or the right protective equipment. \" i prepared millions of liters of poison without any kind of protection, no gloves, masks or special clothing, \" says one farmer, now near-death due to a neurological disorder. \" i didn't know anything.

Although cnn says the cause of the fight was \" unclear, \" the police chief of the dih salah district of baghlan tells the ap it appears the fight broke out after a relative of a provincial police officer was killed during the celebration for a local mullah's son, for which 400 or so people had gathered at a private house. Meanwhile, the police chief tells the guardian that \" a local security official fired in the air after the verbal exchange heated up … and then both sides started trading fire. \" the paper notes that \" celebratory gunfire \" and fatal shootouts are \" woefully common \" in the region. The paper cites a december wedding in which 17 women and children were killed after afghan army soldiers heard such celebratory gunfire and blasted mortars at the wedding party by mistake. The ap notes that baghlan and other northern afghan provinces have been riddled with insurgent attacks since the 2001 us-led invasion overthrew the taliban, but it adds that local feuds and other criminal activity still proliferate under the cover of war.

Among the people speaking up for schaquana evita spears, a 30-year-old single mom of six, is lisa nicholson — the woman whose baton rouge home spears's sons, ages 13, 12, and 10, broke into. \" i would prefer for her to spank her own kids than for them to come into someone's house and for [ the homeowner ] to kill them, \" nicholson tells the advocate. The fate they faced instead after allegedly stealing what the advocate reports was $ 1,700 in goods, including a computer and hoverboard: per the east baton rouge sheriff's office report, the oldest boy's wounds were bleeding, and the 12-year-old's skin was broken by the lashes. Wbrz reports the 13-year-old's injuries were on his arms, with marks on his body, and he told police an rca cable was used; the youngest boy had a small scratch on the hand. In a statement, the district attorney hillar moore said the case is under review and noted \" the law does not allow excessive pain or cruelty but does allow physical parental discipline. \" but some experts, referencing a 2016 study, tell the advocate that corporal punishment is not effective and can actually lead to worse behavior. \" it's been hell, \" spears — whose kids were, as of wednesday, in the care of a grandmother — tells wbrz. \" i never could imagine trying to be a good mother would end me up in jail. \" a gofundme page set up for spears says she lost her job over the incident. \" jus [ sic ] want my life back, \" she wrote on facebook on friday.

It was originally a low-cost, simple design, intended only for mating and disconnection when servicing the console. Refinement came with later designs, although they remained compatible.

How this \" watson for genomics \" will work: after dna sequencing on cancer patients, that info will be plugged into watson, which will analyze and cross-reference existing medical data and then spit out what's probably causing the cancer mutations and what precision treatment is likely the best option — a task that was previously extremely time-consuming due to the volume of data and not very scalable. Plus, physicians in any part of the country — not just those near urban centers with top cancer facilities — will have access. Forbes notes the project won't do much to help patients outside the va system and that no one knows yet exactly how effective watson will be at pulling off this ambitious job. But it says while \" efforts like the cancer moonshot have trouble living up to their own hype … they can grease the wheels of progress a little bit. \" ( watson released its own cookbook last year. )",

Judge matthew sciarrino said that while private speech is protected, the writer's communication doesn't merit the same treatment because his tweets were public, reports the new york times. The case involves writer malcolm harris, who was busted while occupiers marched across the brooklyn bridge. Prosecutors demanded two days of harris'tweets in a bid to contradict his expected defense that it was police who led protesters off the bridge walkway and into the road. Twitter fought the request, and the aclu filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that prosecutors should be required to obtain a search warrant in such a case, and that the process shouldn't skip over the writer of a tweet to go directly to twitter. While the prosecution was delighted with the ruling, a twitter statement expressed \" disappointment, \" adding: \" twitter's terms of service make it absolutely clear that its users own their content.

        "summary": "The tsunami that killed hundreds, possibly thousands of people after an earthquake in indonesia on friday was much bigger and more devastating than would normally be expected after that kind of quake, scientists say. \" we expected it might cause a tsunami, just not one that big, \" geophysicist jason patton tells the new york times. Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on sulawesi island are usually caused by \" megathrust \" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \" strike-slip \" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one friday, which moved the earth horizontally, patton says. The sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 indian ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert adam switzer at the earth observatory of singapore tells the ap that this is unfair. \" what it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic, \" he says. \" they don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time. They don't take into account submarine landslides. \" the official death toll now stands at 844, though authorities, who have been preparing mass graves, have been unable to access some hard-hit areas, the guardian reports.",

( ap photo/tatan syuflana, file ) ( associated press ) makassar, indonesia ( ap ) — an early warning system that might have prevented some deaths in the tsunami that hit an indonesian island on friday has been stalled in the testing phase for years. The high-tech system of seafloor sensors, data-laden sound waves and fiber-optic cable was meant to replace a system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004. But inter-agency wrangling and delays in getting just 1 billion rupiah ( $ 69,000 ) to complete the project mean the system hasn't moved beyond a prototype developed with $ 3 million from the u.s. National science foundation. It is too late for central sulawesi, where walls of water up to 6 meters ( 20 feet ) high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in the cities of palu and donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings. \" to me this is a tragedy for science, even more so a tragedy for the indonesian people as the residents of sulawesi are discovering right now, \" said louise comfort, a university of pittsburgh expert in disaster management who has led the u.s. Side of the project, which also involves engineers from the woods hole oceanographic institute and indonesian scientists and disaster experts. \" it's a heartbreak to watch when",
            "By contrast, the fault that ruptured on friday was a so-called strike-slip fault, in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami. But under certain circumstances it can, dr. Patton said. A strike-slip fault might have some amount of vertical motion that could displace seawater. Or the fault's rupture zone, which in this case was estimated to be about 70 miles long, may pass through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, so that when the fault moves during the quake, it pushes seawater in front of it. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly. The violent shaking during the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that would have displaced water and created waves. Such events are not uncommon; several occurred during the 1964 9.2-magnitude alaska earthquake, for example. Dr. Patton said a combination of factors may have contributed to the tsunami. Studies of the seafloor will be crucial to understanding the event. \"we won't know what caused it until that's done, \" he said."

The homeowner is not as mobile as she, used to be, so she mainly lives on the first floor of her two story-story home. The woman has a caretaker and was introduced to the caretaker's boyfriend mark potts. But when the woman's daughter paid a visit, they found potts was living under her roof. \"when police searched the upstairs room, they found several suitcases, a duffel bag and other personal items belonging to potts. He was taking up residence there. He didn't bring in new furniture but he was living there, \" higgins said. Police said when they found potts, he also had a small handgun on him. \"this guy put this woman in fear and he probably killed any future feelings of security and we are going to make sure he is held accountable for that, \" higgins said. Potts is facing criminal trespassing charges. The name of the caretaker has not been released just yet but according to higgins, police are investigating and he expects charges to be filed against her as well.

Meanwhile, a generation has come of age as the post-9/11 conflict has continued, the ap notes.

Friedman lays out why she's reluctant to fully toast coulter's thesis, noting many men also drink to deal with the day-to-day, and that pop culture — especially via boozy women protagonists on tv and in the movies — has much to do with it, too, presenting alcohol \" as both a coping mechanism and a bonding tool. \" and she cites her own personal imbibing, relaying how her boozing sessions tend to serve a more active \" plotting \" purpose to direct her \" outrage, \" with her drinking buddies serving as sounding boards. \" maybe patriarchy does drive us to drink, just as patriarchy drives us to shave our legs and wear bright lipstick, \" she concludes. \" or maybe it doesn't, and we get drunk for the same reasons that men do.

But salvadoran officials don't think it will come to that. Foreign minister hugo martinez tells the washington post that the government will lobby congress to find a way for people losing tps status to remain legal us residents. \" we think we have sufficient time and will work hard for this alternative, \" he says. Congressional democrats support finding a way for the salvadorans to stay, though they have multiple other immigration issues to deal with, reuters reports. Advocates warn that el salvador has one of the world's highest murder rates, making it a dangerous place to deport people to — and that its economy will be devastated if it loses billions of dollars in remittances from the us. \" this is really bad news for our country, \" nayib bukele, the mayor of san salvador, tells the los angeles times. \" our country doesn't create opportunities for the salvadorans who live here. Imagine what we're going to do with 200,000 more coming in. \" experts say that if there are mass deportations, many former tps holders are likely to try to move to the us illegally — as will some salvadorans displaced by the skilled and bilingual new arrivals.",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - some 200,000 salvadoran immigrants allowed to live and work in the united states since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on monday, marking the trump administration's latest move to tighten immigration enforcement. The united states will end the salvadorans'temporary protected status ( tps ) on sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for el salvador to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in el salvador that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless. The decision to end tps for salvadorans is part of the administration's broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the united states illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in el salvador and gave the salvadorans few options but to leave the united states or remain illegally. The trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in the united states whose home countries have been affected by disasters. Salvadorans are by far the largest group under tps, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in the united states. Critics have complained tps has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments. Patricia hernandez, 53, arrived in the united states in 2000 and applied for tps after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in north carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her honduran husband. The couple have two u.s.-born teenage sons. \"this is a real blow for everyone, \" said hernandez by telephone. \"most of us pay taxes, we're not living off the government, we're not criminals. \" the family will move to honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central america.

Among the project's ambitious goals: to create a state-of-the-art protective shield to keep space debris and asteroids from reaching earth's surface. Space regulation is another focus: since the late 1960s, the outer space treaty has assigned liability for objects sent into space on the nation launching them.

Before adjournment today, congress approved legislation to help rescuers and clean-up crews suffering from illnesses linked to the wreckage caused by the sept. 11 terrorist attacks in new york city. The senate approved it on a voice vote, the house by a vote of 206-60. New york senators charles schumer and kirsten gillibrand, in a statement, called it a \"christmas miracle. \" for all of its ambitious achievement,"

        "summary": "On friday, two friends became the proud new owners of a california ghost town. Cerro gordo, a 300-acre town nestled in the inyo mountains not far from death valley, has a \" wild west \" history thanks to the discovery of silver there in 1865; within four years, mining operations made it the largest producer of silver and lead in the state, and it later became the largest producer of zinc carbonates in the entire country. But that era ended, and by 1950, cerro gordo was basically abandoned. The previous owners, brothers who inherited the town from their family — the property listing says the town had been owned by the same family for decades — decided to sell it while attempting to keep its history intact, and received a dozen serious offers after announcing the sale in june. The original asking price was $ 925,000, but brent underwood and jon bier ended up purchasing it for $ 1.4 million, the new york times reports. The entrepreneurs ' plan is to revive the town, developing it into a destination while preserving its history. There are nearly two dozen buildings on the property, the san francisco chronicle reports, including a church and theater, a general store, a museum, a two-story hotel, an eight-bed bunkhouse, and of course a saloon; in addition to its iconic swinging doors and two pianos, the saloon features a bloodstain underneath three bullet holes on one wall. ( the real estate agent tells cnn the town \" averaged a murder a week \" at the peak of the mining era. ) its caretaker — he's been there 21 years, nbc la reports, and is currently the only person living in the town — will stay there as buildings are restored. Underwood and bier plan to move there in august, the sacramento bee reports. Among other things, they plan to build an observation deck; mount whitney and death valley national park can be seen from parts of the town. \" you very much feel like you're back in time, \" underwood says.",

Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new a350 xwb line of jets. The main tool is a set of led lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports fast company. Another factor: because of the planes'relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: has it worked? it's a little too early to tell. The first such jet landed in the us only earlier this month via qatar airways, though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets, notes a post at science alert.

        "summary": "Just weeks after france unveiled a plan to ban sales of gas and diesel cars by 2040, its neighbor to the north is following suit. Britain's government on wednesday unveiled a nearly $ 4 billion plan to improve air quality that would see sales of new gas and diesel cars end by 2040. \" poor air quality is the biggest environmental risk to public health in the uk and this government is determined to take strong action in the shortest time possible, \" a government rep says, per the guardian. The plan, which includes few concrete promises, sets aside $ 1.3 billion in funding for ultra-low-emission vehicles, plus more for low-emission taxis, and nearly $ 1.6 billion to promote cycling and walking. Money is also designated to retrofit public transport and improve air quality on roadways. Poor air quality, worsened by rising levels of nitrogen oxides from car exhaust, is tied to an estimated 40,000 deaths in the uk each year, including some 9,000 in london, plus billions in lost productivity, per the bbc. \" we can't carry on with diesel and [ gas ] cars, \" uk environment secretary michael gove told the bbc, via cnnmoney. \" there is no alternative to embracing new technology. \" but meeting the government's goal won't be an easy feat. Demand for electric, fuel cell, and hybrid cars spiked 40 % in the uk in 2015, but those cars only made up less than 3 % of the market. The ceo of the society of motor manufacturers and traders notes consumers still have \" concerns over affordability, range, and charging points \" for low-emission vehicles.",

A roundup of coverage: trump said he will ask congress to pass a law ensuring new immigrants \" support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years. \" the rule already exists as part of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996, though large parts of the act were rolled back under george w. Bush and barack obama, fox reports. Trump plans to expand the list of benefits that new immigrants will not be eligible for. In one of his most controversial remarks, trump defended his choice of billionaire investor wilbur ross as commerce secretary, explaining that he doesn't want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration, the guardian reports. \" i love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions i just don't want a poor person, \" he said. The ap reports that trump made no mention of the assorted scandals he is dealing with in washington, apart from a brief reference to the \" witch hunt \" russia probe. \" all we do is win, win, win, \" trump said, boasting of the gop's 5-0 winning streak in special elections and slamming \" unbelievably nasty \" democrats and the media. \" the truth is, people love us... They haven't figured it out yet, \" he said, per the hill. Trump said he has come up with a plan to put solar panels on his proposed border wall, but dismissed wind energy, the new york times reports. \" i don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your house and your factory as the birds fall to the ground, \" he said.

It included protesters escorted out by police, trump attacking the news media and supporters waving signs saying \"drain the swamp \" in washington. Trump's first trip to iowa since taking office on jan. 20 came against a backdrop of problems in washington. His legislative agenda is struggling to gain traction, a federal investigation of alleged russian meddling into the election and possible collusion with trump's campaign continues, and his approval rating is below 40 percent in most polls. But trump touted job gains and an improving stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working, and he lauded his wealthy appointees such as his top economic adviser gary cohn, a former goldman sachs executive, and commerce secretary wilbur ross, a billionaire",

( associated press ) cedar rapids, iowa ( ap ) — struggling to advance his agenda in washington, president donald trump traveled to the midwest on wednesday for a raucous rally with his loyal supporters — the kind of event he relished before winning the white house. Trump touched down wednesday evening in rainy cedar rapids, iowa, and headed to a local community college, where he got a look at agriculture technology innovations before leading a campaign rally. He reveled in georgia republican karen handel's congressional victory in an election viewed as an early referendum on his presidency. \" we're 5-0 in special elections, \" trump said in front of a boisterous crowd that packed a downtown arena. \" the truth is, people love us... They haven't figured it out yet. \" he also applauded republican ralph norman, who notched a slimmer-than-expected win in a special election to fill the south carolina congressional seat vacated by mick mulvaney, and mocked handel's challenger, jon ossoff, saying the democrats \" spent $ 30 million on this kid who forgot to live in the district. \" trump"

Now it's eric holder's call to either heed the fbi and justice dept advice or risk the perception of special treatment for the retired four-star general. The story goes back to 2012, when petraeus retired as cia director in the wake of his affair with army reserve officer paula broadwell. An investigation found classified documents on her computer and evidence that she had access to his private cia email account. Petraeus denies divulging any classified information, and says he would refuse a plea deal. As the case dragged on, fbi and justice officials questioned whether petraeus was getting special treatment. A federal official tells nbc news that the times leak is meant to pressure holder, who was expected to decide on charges by the end of last year. President obama has supported the ex-general, saying in 2012 that there was no proof petraeus had leaked information \" that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security. \" so will the storied military man, who commanded us forces in iraq in 2007 and again in afghanistan in 2010, go on trial? so far, it's hard to get quotes on the record. \" i can't say, \" said fbi director james comey when asked about the investigation. \" i mean, i guess i could say, but i won't say. \"",

A warrant out of hungary states sebastian gorka has been wanted on charges for \" firearm or ammunition abuse \" since september 2016. According to buzzfeed, the warrant is still active. It's unclear what gorka did to earn the warrant, though he has boasted in the past of regularly carrying two pistols and was stopped trying to carry a pistol through an airport in 2016. A hungarian news outlet reports the warrant could be from an incident in 2009. Gorka, a former breitbart writer, tells the guardian the warrant is \" more #fakenews. \" on twitter he responded to coverage of the warrant by saying he moved to the us in 2008. New york notes gorka didn't necessarily have to be living in hungary to have been there at some point in 2009. Gorka's actual role at the white house was unclear before he left in august ( he claims he resigned, but reports say he was fired by new chief of staff john kelly ). However, it does appear gorka was wanted by hungary at the same time he met with that country's foreign minister as a white house adviser, which is, if nothing else, slightly ironic.",

The boston globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines ( translation here ). The review also published a rebuttal by brown egyptology professor leo depuydt, who points to \" gross grammatical errors \" he says no native speaker of coptic would make, the new york times reports. ( more criticism of the papyrus here. ) the new findings certainly don't prove that jesus was married, a point that king has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \" questions like, ' why does jesus being married, or not, even matter? ' \" king was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in east germany in the ' 60s.",

Black lives matter activists are among those praising obama, who spoke about being \" comfortable in your blackness \" and of the importance of compromise and bringing about change through the political system, the guardian reports. \" to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough, \" obama said. \" it requires changes in law, changes in custom. \" more: activist april reign, originator of the #oscarssowhite hashtag, says that while they may disagree a little on tactics, she was pleased he wasn't holding back. \" now that he's got his second-term swag on, he's able to let loose a little bit, \" she says. \" i think he hit a lot of the right marks and i think it's one for the ages. \" obama — who told the crowd that now is the best time in history to be \" young, gifted, and black \" — also praised black lives matter activist britanny packnett for joining the white house's task force on 21st century policing, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. If she had \" refused to participate out of some sense of ideological purity, \" he said, \" then those great ideas would have just remained ideas. But she did participate. And that's how change happens. \" this was one of the best — and blackest — speeches of obama's career, writes mathew rodriguez at mic, who praises the way obama encouraged graduates to be black any way that they wanted to be, \" to embrace their own style and sexuality like the late musician prince, \" and reminded them \" that their blackness gives them unique insight into the struggle against inequality and racial injustice. \" in what janell ross at the washington post calls the most interesting line of the speech, obama told the audience to expand their \" moral imagination \" to identify not just with struggling black folks, but with refugees, transgender people and \" the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the advantages but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change and feels powerless to stop it. \" ross sees this as either a call for disaffected white men to join a new political coalition — or concern about the \" tangle of fear, anxiety, and anger \" gripping many voters this year.",

Average adult reading speed ( 250-280 words per minute ), suggests pp should have taken 29-32 minutes and tos 15-17 minutes to read. For those that didn't select the clickwrap, average pp reading time was 73 seconds. All participants were presented the tos and had an average reading time of 51 seconds. Most participants agreed to the policies, 97 % to pp and 93 % to tos, with decliners reading pp 30 seconds longer and tos 90 seconds longer. A regression analysis identifies information overload as a significant negative predictor of reading tos upon signup, when tos changes, and when pp changes. Qualitative findings suggest that participants view policies as nuisance, ignoring them to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. Implications are revealed as 98 % missed namedrop tos 'gotcha clauses ' about data sharing with"

However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl ( and therefore we never got to them ). We also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available?warts and all? for people to experiment with.

Mitch carter was a 17-year-old student at bakersfield high school in 2010 when he dressed up in the suit to mock the golden hawk mascot of arch-rival golden west high school for an ill-fated skit, the los angeles times reports. Students — including plenty of football players — piled on top of him, delivering kicks and punches in a beating that lawyers said left carter with a traumatic brain injury. After a jury found the district liable for his injuries, it decided to settle with him for $ 10.5 million, most of which will be covered by insurance. Lawyers said carter, once an honor roll student, has struggled with depression and poor grades in college since the beating. His future medical care costs will be more than $ 5 million, according to the lawyers. \" i would trade everything just to have a full functioning brain, \" he said after the award was announced. The bakersfield californian recaps the wild trial that was brought to an end by the settlement. It included accusations of conspiracy and cover-up from carter's lawyers, who brought in students to testify that the high school was obsessed with football and protected star players.

Since the rules were proposed in july, several abortion rights advocates and abortion providers have vocalized their concerns, saying the requirements could be costly and create more obstacles for people obtaining abortions. \" the rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe, legal abortion in texas, \" said blake rocap, legislative counsel for naral pro-choice texas. \" it's so transparent that what they're really trying to do is denying access to abortion. \" the rules, which were introduced by the department of state health services, would require all medical facilities, hospitals and clinics to cremate or bury fetal remains, no matter the period of gestation.

Following criticism from medical providers, the state's health and human services commission clarified that the requirement does not apply to miscarriages or abortions that take place at home. It also does not require birth or death certificates to be filed, to maintain confidentiality. The move comes after months of public comment periods, hearings and more than 35,000 comments submitted to health officials since the rules were first proposed in early july. With little notice, gov.

Since the rules were proposed in july, several abortion rights advocates and abortion providers have vocalized their concerns, saying the requirements could be costly and create more obstacles for people obtaining abortions. \" the rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe, legal abortion in texas, \" said blake rocap, legislative counsel for naral pro-choice texas. \" it's so transparent that what they're really trying to do is denying access to abortion. \" the rules, which were introduced by the department of state health services, would require all medical facilities, hospitals and clinics to cremate or bury fetal remains, no matter the period of gestation. After taking public comments this summer, the department resubmitted updated rules with an analysis of financial impact. The department also added an additional month for people to submit their opinions. The new comment period ends monday. The department has not said when the",
            "Pro-choice supporters rally outside the supreme court before the june 2016 court ruling in a case that imposed heavy restrictions on abortion clinics in texas and was struck down. ( michael reynolds/european pressphoto agency ) after months of fierce opposition from abortion rights advocates and the medical community, texas will require fetal remains to be cremated or buried instead of disposed in sanitary landfills. On monday, health officials finalized the new rules prohibiting hospitals, abortion clinics and other health care facilities from disposing of fetal remains — regardless of the period of gestation. The rules will take effect dec. 19, according to state health officials, the texas tribune reported. Following criticism from medical providers, the state's health and human services commission clarified that the requirement does not apply to miscarriages or abortions that take place at home. It also does not require birth or death certificates to be filed, to maintain confidentiality. The move comes after months of public comment periods, hearings and more than 35,000 comments submitted to health officials since the rules were first proposed in early july. With little notice, gov. Greg abbott ( r ) approved the proposal, saying that he does not believe fetal remains should be \"treated like medical waste and disposed of in landfills, \" the texas tribune reported. The health commission has said the rules will result in \"enhanced protection"

Villagers first spotted the naked child looking \" very comfortable in the company of monkeys \" in january in the katarniya ghat forest range, a police officer tells the ap. They tried to approach but the monkeys chased them away, reports the deccan chronicle. Police were later able to seize the girl, though monkeys also chased an officer as he \" sped away with her in his police car, \" the officer says. The \" highly aggressive \" girl was then taken to a hospital in bahraich, uttar pradesh, where doctors say she initially walked on all fours, ate off the floor with her mouth, and ran from humans, per the telegraph. She's described as being wound-covered, with long hair and nails. She is now walking upright, eating with her hands, and responding to humans, authorities say. She doesn't appear to speak any language ( the telegraph says she makes only \" unintelligible muttering[ s ] \" ), but is warming up to her doctors and nurses — a possible sign that she retains memories of living with humans, a doctor says. A psychological assessment also indicates she likely had human contact before her time with monkeys, according to doctors. Though media outlets are calling the child mowgli in a nod to rudyard kipling's the jungle book, doctors have given her the name of durga, after the hindu warrior goddess. Doctors believe she is 8 to 12 years old. Officials say they're reviewing missing child cases in the hope of identifying the girl, per the bbc. ( kipling admitted something about his book in this 1895 letter. )",

People think nothing of it, \" davis said. \" youngsters invariably say, ' i know a lot of guys who've got guns. I know a lot of girls who've got guns. ' it becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change. \" davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th congressional district, wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. Davis said his grandson was \" a pretty regular kid \" who loved playing basketball and knew all the pros and their stats, who also loved music and whose grades were improving after a rough patch. \" the question becomes where does a 15-year-old obtain a gun? who let the 15-year-old have a gun and under what circumstances? \" davis asked. \" there's no answer for that except that the availability of guns is so prevalent in america to the point where you almost can't tell who has a gun \" anymore.",

Danny davis ' grandson, police said saturday night. \"first-degree murder charges are expected, \" said anthony guglielmi, a spokesman for the chicago police department. The two are in custody for questioning and have been classified as suspects in the murder, said officer michelle tannehill, a police spokeswoman. \" the detectives are with them and charges are expected, but we don't have their ages or genders until the charges are approved, \" tannehill said.

Jovan wilson, whose paternal grandfather is davis, was killed about 7 p.m. Friday while his mother was out picking up dinner for the family, guglielmi said. The incident originally was believed to be a home invasion, he said, but police later learned that wasn't the case. \"there was a history between the young people involved.

What's unclear is whether he will get the necessary 40 % to avoid a runoff with the second-place finisher. With 97 % of returns in, de blasio had 40.02 %, bill thompson 26 %, and christine quinn 15 %. Trailing those three were city comptroller john liu ( 7 % ) and, yes, anthony weiner ( 5 % ). The eventual democratic winner will face former mta chief ( and rudy giuliani deputy ) joe lhota in the general election in november. He won the gop race over billionaire john catsimatidis. There will be a recount of yesterday's ballots, and some 30,000 votes, including absentee ballots, still need to be counted a first time. A final result may not be known for 10 days and thompson has made it clear that he won't drop out in the name of party unity: he chanted \" three more weeks! \" at his election night event, referring to a time before a potential runoff, which polls show he would lose. Exit polls showed that de blasio, the city's public advocate, did well with a wide swath of voters from different ethnic groups and locales, reports the new york times. More so than the other candidates, he advocated a clean break from michael bloomberg, making a particular issue of bloomberg's stop-and-frisk policy. The mayor interjected himself into the campaign when he accused de blasio of running a \" racist \" campaign — in part because the candidate featured his afro-sporting teen son in a tv ad. De blasio is white, his wife is black, and he would be first city mayor with an interracial family, notes the times.",

China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion, resulting in efficiency gains that have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in gdp since 1978. Reforms began with the phaseout of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, growth of the private sector, development of stock markets and a modern banking system, and opening to foreign trade and investment.

( associated press ) obama's arrival wednesday evening in kingston, jamaica, was low-key compared to the excitement he stirred in the caribbean upon his election in 2008. Greeted at the airport tarmac by dignitaries including prime minister portia simpson miller, obama slipped into a motorcade that ran through mostly quiet, empty streets. The visit comes amid a perception that obama's interest in the region has failed to materialize. Yet his travels — first to jamaica, then to the summit of the americas in panama — follow a year of increased attention to the region by the u.s. President. His immigration executive orders, his efforts to",

        "summary": "President trump's relationship with the media is very much front and center again, most notably after three cnn journalists resigned over a retracted story. Trump himself went after the network on twitter — \" what about all the other phony stories they do? fake news! \" — and a white house spokesperson on tuesday pushed an anti-cnn video by right-wing provocateur james o ' keefe. Meanwhile, the president also is publicly feuding again with the new york times. Here's the latest: cnn mess: the network yanked an online article alleging that trump confidante anthony scaramucci had ties to a russian investment firm, and the new york times has more details on what happened and on how the network's respected \" triad \" vetting system for sensitive stories failed. ( here is cnn's apology note, which does not specify what was incorrect. ) awful timing: it couldn't come at a worse time for cnn in the \" fake news \" wars, observes washington post media reporter paul farhi. Despite trump's suggestion to the contrary, farhi writes that cnn is not looking at \" big management changes. \" interesting nugget: he notes that cnn investigations editor lex haris, one of the three to resign, was away at a conference when the story ran. O ' keefe video: in a press briefing, white house deputy press chief sarah huckabee sanders pushed an undercover video by o ' keefe showing a cnn producer seeming to question the network's russia coverage, reports the hill. \" whether it's accurate or not i don't know, but i would encourage everybody in this room, and frankly, everybody across the country to take a look at it. \" you can see it here. Another coming: o ' keefe tells the ap that another video involving a second cnn employee is coming. Meanwhile, cnn stood by john bonfield, the producer in the first video: \" diversity of personal opinion is what makes cnn strong, we welcome it and embrace it. \" times feud: after the new york times ran an article suggesting that trump was not hands-on during the senate's health bill talks, he tweeted that it was another \" false story \" about him. \" they don't even call to verify the facts of a story, \" he complained. To which reporter glenn thrush responded, \" call your office, sir. @nytimes spoke to many, many, many members of your staff yesterday - &amp; ran everything by your team. \" ' nice smile ': trump's relationship with the media isn't all adversarial.

Austin pledger, from thorsby, ala., was first prescribed risperdal, manufactured by janssen pharmaceuticals, in 2002 when he was 8; at the time, the drug wasn't fda-approved for kids, and its label said risk was \" low \" for gynecomastia ( the condition in which men's breasts grow larger ), thomas kline, one of pledger's attorneys, tells the daily news. But when the fda gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then — and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, kline says. A janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to people noting the company is \" disappointed \" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that pledger's \" quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking risperdal, \" per the daily news. But stephen sheller, another pledger attorney, says \" there was grave mistreatment of children \" and that johnson &amp; johnson \" hid data from the fda, prescribing doctors, and parents. Documents showed they knew there was much [ a ] higher percentage of children getting gynecomastia than they admitted, \" reports the wall street journal.

Police say aidan was denied food and insulin, and they say his parents were complicit in that denial; their \" gross negligence \" caused his death, police say, per the sydney morning herald. If convicted, they face 25 years in jail. The workshop was run by hongchi xiao, a chinese man who describes himself as a \" healer \" and practices what he calls \" paidalajin \" therapy. It involves fasting, stretching, and slapping the skin until it bruises in order to release \" poisoned blood. \" he has not been charged in aidan's death, and in a facebook post shortly after the incident he denied responsibility.
