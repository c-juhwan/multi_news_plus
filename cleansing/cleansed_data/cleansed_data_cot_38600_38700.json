        "summary": "President trump spent much of friday evening digging into a claim he'd made the previous day that spurred instant backlash. On thursday, trump accused democrats of inflating the death toll in puerto rico from hurricane maria, which a recent george washington university report updated from 64 to 2,975. Then, as everyone headed into a weekend set to be dominated by hurricane florence news, trump took to twitter to first send a series of tweets and retweets praising fema, and himself, for the cleanup and rebuilding efforts after the hurricane. Next, trump continued to push back on the widely accepted study that nearly 3,000 people had died as a result of hurricane maria. First, per deadline, trump quoted geraldo rivera, who's been in trump's corner on the hurricane hubbub. That tweet: \" they say all these people died in the storm in puerto rico, yet 70 % of the power was out before the storm. So when did people start dying? \" ( the los angeles times notes 96 % of puerto rico's residents had power before the storm. ) then trump cited a washington post article noting he'd been told by officials in october that 16 people had died. \" over many months it went to 64 people, \" he tweeted. \" then, like magic, ' 3000 people killed. ' \" he went on to rip the gwu study, ending with: \" fifty times last original number - no way! \" the hill reports on puerto rico gov. Ricardo rossello's response. \" mr. President — i'd very much be willing to walk you through the scientific process of the study, \" rossello tweeted, adding: \" in the meantime, i hope you consider sending a message of support to show you stand with all of the us citizens in puerto rico that lost loved ones. It would certainly be an act of respect and empathy.",

Colin savage, a 64-year-old avid cyclist and marathon runner, journeyed to argentina on a hiking trip. After turbulence forced the passengers to stay seated for most of the flight, savage, who is 6-foot-2, reports being cramped against the seat in front of him. Almost two days after his return home, savage says he felt severe pain in his lower back. Doctors told him that he had deep vein thrombosis, and that blood clots had traveled up his legs and into his lungs, nearly killing him. The world health organization says anyone who travels in a cramped space for more than four hours is at risk; the cdc cites the same number of hours. Air canada said in a statement that the who \" have advised there is no risk with air travel for healthy passengers \" and that travel by train, bus, or car carries \" similar risk. \" a 2010 telegraph article on the death of a healthy 36-year-old woman who spent most of a transatlantic flight asleep and died after blood clots reached her heart and lungs explains the mechanics: the veins in the pelvis are somewhat squashed when seated, making for sluggish blood flow in the calves. The reduced flow helps raise the risk of clots, an issue exacerbated by reduced oxygen pressure. As far as cramped spaces go, usa today reported that seat pitch — the distance from a point on one seat to the same point on the one behind it, and a good approximation of legroom — has shrunk 2 to 5 inches, based on carrier, in 20 years. And while airlines are making more extra-legroom seats available — the wall street journal reports they make up more than a quarter of united's coach seats — travelers have to pay extra.

It is known that immobility is one of the factors that may lead to the development of a blood clot in a deep vein – so-called \"deep vein thrombosis \" or dvt.

        "summary": "Charles manson, the cult leader whose hippie followers terrorized los angeles with seven gruesome murders in 1969, has died after almost 50 years behind bars. He was 83. The california department of corrections says manson, whose death sentence for orchestrating the killings was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972, died of natural causes sunday night at a hospital in kern county, the ap reports. On aug. 9, 1969, some of his followers, known as the \" manson family, \" murdered pregnant actress sharon tate and four others at her home. The victims were stabbed a total of more than 100 times. The next night, his followers murdered grocer leno labianca and his wife, rosemary, and scrawled words including \" pigs \" on the walls in their blood. Manson, who was born in cincinnati, had a troubled childhood and ended up in reform school when he was 8. He spent much of his early life in prison for various crimes and started the cult after being released in san francisco in 1967. Months after the la killings, manson and three female followers were arrested and sentenced to death after what was then the longest trial in american history. Tex watson, his \" right-hand man, \" was arrested later. Prosecutors said manson, whose name became a byword for evil, hoped his disciples would, with the murders, trigger a race war he called \" helter skelter. \" after being found guilty, he shaved his head, reports the san francisco chronicle. \" i am the devil, \" he said. \" and the devil always has a bald head. \" he was later convicted of two other murders. In prison, manson carved a swastika on his forehead and was cited for breaking the rules scores of times. He was denied parole a dozen times, most recently in 2012.",

        "summary": "More fodder for the debate on when babies should be sleeping in their own rooms: a new study in pediatrics suggests 6 months of age is a good target, which generally contradicts advice from the american academy of pediatrics. The aap says babies should sleep in the same room as mom for a minimum of six months, with a year being preferable, but the new study suggests that's too long. \" the longer you leave a baby in the same room as a parent, the worse the outcomes are in terms of sleep, \" says the study author, per healthday news. In this case, he's referring to babies'sleep — the study didn't examine parents'sleep. For the research, penn state researchers surveyed 230 first-time moms over two and a half years about the amount of sleep their babies were getting, either in a room with parents or in a room of their own. At 4 months of age, the longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep for room-sharing babies was seven hours, compared to nearly eight hours for babies sleeping on their own, though both groups got the same amount of sleep overall. At 9 months, babies in their own rooms slept 40 minutes longer at night than room-sharing babies. But perhaps most surprising is that the trend continued past 2 years of age. By that time, babies who'd slept in a room of their own at 9 months were sleeping 45 minutes more per night than toddlers who'd shared a room with their parents at 9 months old, reports cnn. Room-sharing babies didn't just sleep in shorter stretches: they also had a less consistent bedtime routine and were four times more likely to be moved to the parents ' bed at night.

A series of collapses have fouled the site in recent years, with officials confirming that an 11-foot-long stretch of tomb wall was found to have crumbled early yesterday, on the heels of a more modest collapse the day prior at the temple of venus.

The telegraph reports that concerns first emerged after the 2010 collapse of the house of the gladiators, which resulted in $ 145 million being provided for restoration work that began in february 2013.

And while water-conserving efforts have been indisputably successful — urban californians cut their water consumption 21.5 % in june as compared to june 2013, the mercury news reports — a trio of landscaper designer wrote an op-ed in the times last summer about an unwanted effect of \" gravelscaping \": hotter days due to fewer plants and trees \" transpir[ ing ] moisture to cool the air. \" now, researchers at the university of southern california have run various land-cover scenarios to determine whether that's so. In a nutshell, la's daytime temps would be up to 3.4 degrees warmer thanks to the dramatic reduction in irrigation if the city went entirely without lawns. But, as they report this week in geophysical research letters, if those lawns were replaced with drought-tolerant vegetation ( as opposed to pavers and gravel ), there would be a 5.4 degree dip in nighttime temps to more than make up for the daytime warming — a phenomenon they hadn't foreseen. \" in retrospect, it makes sense that reducing soil moisture would change the thermal properties of the soil and surface-atmosphere coupling in this way, \" researcher george ban-weiss says.

The latest dip: tesla confirmed tuesday that it has complied with a voluntary request from the justice department to hand over documents related to musk's august comments about possibly taking the electric car company private. The ap quotes a tesla statement saying it has not \" received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process \" and that it anticipates the matter should be put to bed quickly. Cnbc adds the request was made in august. That news followed a tuesday morning report from bloomberg, attributed to two sources, that the doj had launched a criminal fraud investigation in parallel with the already announced sec investigation. Bloomberg described the probe as in its early stages. Morningstar analyst david whiston had this to say to reuters: \" for now this just brings more overhang to the stock and a probe will probably take months. \" the ap notes musk's tweets initially drove shares up 11 %, leading short-sellers to allege that musk improperly manipulated the stock price. Tesla stock remains down nearly 4 % for the day on the news, at $ 283.",

The letter recommended that the department split with loehmann, who later resigned and went on to graduate from the city of cleveland's police academy. A cleveland police spokesman told the media group that officers didn't look at the file before hiring loehmann. \"unfortunately in law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and i am under the impression ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed, \" the letter reads.

            "Cleveland, ohio — cleveland officials drove to independence to gather information about hiring the officer who eventually shot tamir rice, but never looked at his personnel file. Cleveland police spokesman sgt. Ali pillow said wednesday officers asked independence police about timothy loehmann before hiring him in march, but police there referred them to the human resources department. Pillow said the independence human resource department told them loehmann had no disciplinary actions taken against him. Loehmann officially resigned from independence but officials there had been prepared to release him from duty. The personnel file contained reports by a top independence police official who questioned loehmann's ability to handle the duties of a police officer after an emotional breakdown during firearms training and other incidents that caused concern for his superiors. They eventually decided they wanted to release loehmann from the department but allowed him to resign. Loehmann fatally shot the 12-year-old boy on nov. 22 less than two seconds after he responded to a complaint about tamir waving a gun that turned out to be fake. Cleveland police on wednesday amended their written policy on reviewing public personnel files for someone trying to get hired, pillow said. They previously had no policies about viewing personnel files. Pillow said detectives assigned to do background checks on potential hires interviewed the personnel director for independence and asked about any disciplinary actions taken against loehmann. Pillow said"

Christopher morris, working for time magazine, can be seen in several online videos being attacked by a man at the virginia event. This tweeted video shows the attack and this one the aftermath, where morris is kicking at his assailant from the ground; here, morris can be seen before the attack, apparently hurling an epithet at the attacker. The trump campaign later said morris was taken down by a secret service agent. The attack occurred when \" black lives matter \" protesters appeared at the rally and morris, a war photographer, tried to get a shot of them. \" i stepped 18 inches out of the [ press ] pen and then he grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and then he slammed me to the ground, \" morris tells a cnn reporter in this tweeted video. Morris says in another tweeted video that he was briefly detained when he tried to show a trump press official what had happened. \" i said he choked me, so i put my hand on him, and that's when i was arrested, \" says morris. When another photojournalist complained about the attack, the secret service agent apparently told him that morris had \" put his hands on me \" ( this video does appear to show morris pushing the agent first ). As for trump, he didn't react to the body-slam but did respond when the crowd chanted \" all lives matter \" to the protesters, the guardian reports. \" oh folks, isn't it sad? \" said trump. \" we've gotta unify our country, we've gotta unify our country.

        "summary": "Obamacare appears to be on pace to cost the federal government a lot more than it was counting on. So far, the government is on pace to sink $ 11 billion into subsidies for consumers who bought coverage on the federal insurance exchange, according to a new report from the department of health and human services. If things are going similarly for state-run exchanges, the total subsidy bill could be $ 16.5 billion, the la times estimates — the congressional budget office had predicted a cost of just $ 10 billion. The bump is a result of more people than expected buying coverage. The subsidies, available to anyone making less than four times the poverty level, lowered the cost of coverage by an average of 76 %. The report comes alongside two new analyses showing that, if you don't count those subsidies ' effects, obamacare has dramatically increased the price of coverage. A manhattan institute study, reported at forbes, found that premiums for individually-purchased care rose an average of 49 %, though some markets, like new york city, saw dramatic decreases. Another study, from conservative economist mark pauly, found a more modest increase of 14 % to 28 %, the washington post reports. But the comparison is difficult, pauly notes, because post-obamacare plans offer more benefits.",

The court disagreed. \"petitioner requests that this court enlarge the common-law definition of 'person ' in order to afford legal rights to an animal, \" wrote the judges. \"we decline to do so. \" the judges decided that because tommy doesn't have societal obligations, he's not entitled to societal protections.

Senate president pro tem david long and house speaker brian bosma announced changes this morning that \" clarify \" the state's controversial new religious freedom law and aim to protect gays and lesbians. \" we're here to announce that it's fixed, \" bosma said, though he insisted the compromise language wasn't needed to change the actual law, but \" to clarify the perception \" of that law. The compromise measure states that the law can't be used to discriminate against customers of a business based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, the indianapolis star reported earlier. Churches and other nonprofit religious organizations, including schools, are exempted, but the protection does extend to housing and employment. The proposal is officially being presented to lawmakers now that the press conference is over, the star notes. The measure was put together by gop leaders alongside business leaders, and gov. Mike pence's chief of staff met with the group late yesterday, but no one has said whether pence will sign it, and the chief of staff said last night that the governor still needs to review it. But, the atlantic notes, pence did say tuesday that he wanted to sign such a clarifying bill, and that he wanted it by week's end. Asked if there are enough votes to pass the compromise in the legislature, both bosma and long gave a firm \" yes. \" they also both made it clear they believe they've satisfied both sides of the debate, but the star noted earlier that the deal \" is unlikely to make either liberal or conservative activists \" 100 % happy. Asked specifically about the case of the pizzeria refusing to cater a gay wedding, bosma said, \" we can unequivocally say that rfra cannot be used to discriminate against anyone, \" but individual cases of how people attempt to use it will be decided by the courts.",

When the campaign season began, a gop takeover there seemed assured, but now democrats appear favored to remain in control, real clear politics reports. Here are the top races you should have your eye on: maine: all signs point to the senate getting its second independent here, with former gov. Angus king leading the polling. And king isn't saying who he ' ll caucus with. ( rcp predicts the democrats. ) \" i ' ll see what's going on when i get down there, and what's best for maine, \" he said last month, according to the ap. Massachusetts: elizabeth warren is looking increasingly like the favorite here, and she's acting like it, politico reports. \" we can taste it. Can you taste it? \" she asked a crowd in boston this weekend. But the race is hardly decided; a poll out yesterday had scott brown up by 1 point. Montana: this is an incredibly close — and decidedly nasty — race between incumbent democrat jon tester and republican denny rehberg, with rehberg a slight favorite to win. The campaign has seen close to $ 50 million in spending — much of it from outside groups, the montana standard reports. Indiana: did richard mourdock's rape comments cost him this race? many assume so, though because indiana's strict telemarketing laws restrict polling, it's hard to know for sure. But conservatives definitely haven't given up, pouring loads of money into the race. Libertarian andy horning may also suck some disaffected mourdock voters away from challenger joe donnelly. Wisconsin: democrat tammy baldwin is a slight favorite here, but the state has been trending red lately, and thanks to scott walker's law restricting unions, democrats have been short a crucial cash flow, meaning an upset win for tommy thompson is possible. Virginia — this is a close one between former gov. Tim kaine and george \" macaca \" allen. The result will probably mirror the presidential race here, as neither candidate has been shy about running with his party's standard-bearer, politico points out. \" we're running as a team, \" allen said recently. \" the romney-allen-cantor team. \"",

The 5th circuit court of appeals decided that the law's requirement for abortions to take place in expensive ambulatory surgical centers did not impose an \" undue burden \" on women seeking abortions, even though the only such centers are in major cities, reports nbc. Lawyers for abortion providers argued that the law would leave some 750,000 reproductive-age women, mostly near the mexico border, more than 200 miles away from the nearest abortion clinic, reports the austin american-statesman. \" today's ruling has gutted texas women's constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe, legal abortion essentially disappear overnight, \" says the president of the center for reproductive rights, whose lawyers represented the abortion providers. A spokesman for state attorney general greg abbott, who is running for governor, called the decision a \" vindication of the careful deliberation by the texas legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of texas women, \" reports the new york times, which notes that texas had 41 abortion clinics before parts of the law came into effect last summer. Wendy davis, abbott's democratic opponent, issued a statement saying, \" women should be able to make these deeply personal decisions without the intrusion of politicians like greg abbott, who supports making abortion illegal even in cases of rape and incest. \" ( in her new memoir, davis reveals that she had aborted a child in the second trimester after doctors discovered a severe brain abnormality. )",

            "Robin williams, the comedian who evolved into the surprisingly nuanced, academy award-winning actor, imbuing his performances with wild inventiveness and a kind of manic energy, died on monday at his home in tiburon, calif., north of san francisco.

Owens, 65, was denied a divorce from her millionaire husband of 39 years after he told a uk judge their \" minor \" disagreements are simply a part of married life, reports the times. In a case last year, owens had petitioned the court for a divorce, complaining of \" continued beratement \" from her husband following her affair in 2012. Hugh owens, 78, admitted he often \" teases \" his wife \" in a very loud voice, \" but said he'd forgiven her infidelity and believed the pair should remain married into old age, per the mirror. The judge sided with the husband, noting tini's complaints were \" of the kind to be expected in marriage \" and \" an exercise in scraping the barrel. \" during an appeals court hearing on tuesday, tini — who has slept apart from her husband for several years and now lives away from their worcestershire home — said she feels \" unloved, isolated and alone. \" a judge responded that \" it is not a ground for divorce if you find yourself in a wretchedly unhappy marriage. \" that provoked tini's lawyer to call for the law to change to introduce \" no-fault \" divorces \" in line with current thinking and social norms. \" he says it's unfair of a judge to ask his client to live separately from her husband for five years before again filing for divorce without his consent given their ages, per the telegraph. It isn't clear when a decision is expected. ( a man blames uber for his divorce. )",

Nbc news reports that 24,024,621 early or absentee votes were cast as of wednesday in the states that allow for them, while six days out from election day in 2014, that figure was just shy of 13 million. The total early voting count in 2014 came out to 21,218,015. The balance between voter party affiliation has also shifted, though just slightly: in 2016 at this time, 43 % of early voters were democrats, 40 % were republicans; now, gop voters are making up 43 % of the early birds, while dems claim 41 %. Cnn's own analysis of a handful of seven critical states finds that women and older voters are performing their civic duty earlier in greater numbers in those states. The los angeles times reports that 18 states are already seeing early-voting numbers exceed their previous ones, and four states ( texas, arizona, colorado, and nevada ) are on track to surpass their total voting tallies before election day even gets here. \" something special is going on right now, \" a university of florida political scientist notes. \" the numbers we're seeing are unprecedented. \" he adds that if this pace keeps up, it's possible that total midterm voter participation could exceed 50 % — a feat that hasn't been seen since the 1914 election. The times notes that such an impressive turnout is useful for gauging interest in a particular election, but as for whether \" a wave \" is coming from either side on nov. 6, the paper offers this: \" sorry, can't say. \" ( just days before the 2016 election, trump urged early voters in four states to change their votes. )",

But americans'desire for giraffe parts — skulls, hides, whole feet — isn't helping, per a humane society report out thursday. It cites us fish and wildlife data showing some 40,000 giraffe parts were brought into the us between 2006 and 2015, per the new york times. Across eight states, investigators tracked down giraffe bone pistol grips, boots, rugs, pillows, $ 10 tail-hair bracelets, and whole feet selling for $ 75 each, in addition to a $ 7,500 stuffed juvenile giraffe and a $ 4,500 skin. As the fish and wildlife service doesn't list the giraffe as endangered, the items are entirely legal. Yet \" it's important to raise awareness among the public to the fact that these things are sold across the country, \" says the humane society's adam peyman, calling for additional protections for giraffes. If the animal was listed under the endangered species act, for example, trade in giraffe parts would likely be banned, or at least require a government-issued permit, experts previously explained at the conversation. But as the humane society puts blame on the trophy hunters, who typically leave behind all but a giraffe's neck and head, hunters ' rights group safari club international is hitting back. \" despite the rhetoric in the media, legal regulated hunting is one of the most effective means of conservation, \" it says, per the times.",

Bush certainly faces plenty of challenges, including dire poll numbers, dougherty writes, but fellow establishment candidate marco rubio is failing to gain traction, meaning bush and his resources could still end up as the party's best chance of avoiding having donald trump or ted cruz as its nominee. If you're \" wagering on the republican race, jeb bush is the best ' value bet, ' \" dougherty decides, noting that people are attracted to comeback stories like that of john mccain, who beat the odds to win the nomination in 2008. \" everyone thinks he's toast. But he still has a real shot. \" not so fast, says ed kilgore at new york, who considers dougherty's lines of reasoning pretty shaky. Marco rubio's failure to catch fire is more likely to benefit chris christie or john kasich, he writes, and while the pro-bush super pac right to rise still has plenty of money, it has already blown $ 50 million with little to show for it. Also, kilgore writes, mccain's 2008 miracle stands out because it \" was a miracle, involving a candidate demolition derby that mccain luckily negotiated like mr. Magoo. \" if bush manages to pull off a comeback, \" it will be in defiance of just about everything we've learned \" up until now, kilgore decides.

Second, jeb's super-pac has an awful lot of money. And third, john mccain pulled off this sort of comeback in 2008. Unfortunately for jeb, all three arguments are shaky at best.

Many insiders see papademos as an appropriate choice for compromise between the parties, but some remain skeptical. Some within papandreou's pasok party are calling for a \"political person, \" while the opposition \"wants a technocrat, \" a pasok official tells the wall street journal. The opposition wants to reshuffle several ministries, but current finance minister evangelos venizelos will likely retain his position. \" there has to be continuity on who the eurozone is talking to, \" the pasok official says. But not everyone is happy with the plan. A meeting of greece's president and all party leaders has been canceled after the communist party and a leftist party, angered over the absence of elections for the unity government, boycotted the gathering, ekathimerini.com notes. \"are we saved? \" a taxi driver asks reuters. \"i don't think so if nothing is done to stop this practice of slapping more and more taxes, because people's pockets will be empty. \"",

        "summary": "The rich really are getting richer — and by 2016, they ' ll own more than the rest of the world, says a research paper published by anti-poverty charity oxfam. The paper shows that global wealth owned by the richest 1 % jumped from 44 % in 2009 to 48 % in 2014, putting this elite group on track to cross the 50 % mark by next year, the bbc reports. Those in the top group had an average wealth of $ 2.7 million per adult last year ( the bbc notes that to qualify as part of that group, one needs to be worth about $ 750,000 ). Meanwhile, the poorest 80 % of the world owned just 5.5 % of the world's riches and claimed an average wealth of $ 3,851 per adult. Oxfam's research backs up a similar 2014 report from credit suisse, as per the bbc. \" the scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering, \" oxfam executive director winnie byanyima says in a statement. \" do we really want to live in a world where the [ 1 % ] own more than the rest of us combined? \" byanyima, who's co-chairing the world economic forum meeting in davos this week, will underscore these points by presenting a seven-point plan for governments to narrow the gap in their own countries. Included in oxfam's plan are calls to get tougher on corporate tax evasion, invest in free public health care and education, and lobby for equal-pay laws to help women get ahead in the workplace. The charity is hoping its report \" shines a light \" on how the richest of the rich get their money ( a good chunk of it's inherited ) and how they push for rules regarding money to benefit them.

With sightings on the rise — throughout the lower 48 states and in chickadees as well as nuthatches, woodpeckers, crows, and jays — scientists report in the journal mbio that they may be close to knowing the cause. They used sophisticated rna sequencing to identify a novel virus, which they are calling poecivirus, found in 19 of 19 affected captured birds with so-called avian keratin disorder. They aren't ready to say poecivirus is it, but they do say they have a \" a strong, statistically significant correlation \" on their hands. The virus was found in two of nine controls; it's possible the two acquired it so recently their beaks haven't started to change, reports national geographic. \" it's a gut-wrenching experience when we see these small birds with gross beak deformities, \" a wildlife biologist with the us geological survey in anchorage says. \" they're handicapped in everything they do. \" the researchers named poecivirus after the black-capped chickadees ' linnaean name, poecile atricapillus, reports the scientist.

        "summary": "Hope you like seahorse-and-chips because new england is just about out of cod thanks in part to global climate change, reuters reports. According to a study published thursday in science, the waters in the gulf of maine have warmed faster than 99 % of all other ocean waters. And that's sent heat-hating cod toward the cooler waters off canada, norway, and greenland. One of the study's authors says it should serve as a \" wake-up call \" for climate scientists and fishery management to work together. Npr reports management was setting quotas on cod to help their numbers replenish. But they weren't taking warming waters into account and were still catching too many cod. Researchers say the gulf of maine is warming so fast due to changes in the atlantic gulf stream and the pacific ocean, as well as climate change in general, reuters reports. Starting in 2004, the temperature in the gulf of maine rose by more than 0.4 degrees every year. The amount of cod caught in that time dropped precipitously, to only 1,000 tons in 2013. And researchers says those numbers are unlikely to ever completely recover, according to npr. This has led to skyrocketing cod prices in new england, where some restaurants are doing away with the fish entirely, the christian science monitor reports. At the same time, the warming waters off the coast of maine are suddenly teeming with seahorses, which are typically found further south, according to npr. So how bad could breaded and fried seahorse be?",

Hart, who has since lost her job, spoke with the daily beast's eve conant about how obama's state of union won back her confidence. Plus, more daily beast contributors weigh in on the speech. Velma hart didn't want to become a media darling for telling the president she was \"exhausted \" with him last september at a televised town-hall meeting. She's a \"staunch \" supporter, she says, both then and now.

Usa today notes gurriel \" has been contrite \" since the incident, and had wanted to apologize to darvish. He made that gesture \" in a uniquely baseball fashion \" when he came up to bat to face darvish: when gurriel walked up to the batter's box, he took off his hat and tipped it toward darvish as a conciliatory offering. Just the night before, dodger pitcher rich hill purposely stepped off the mound to allow the game 6 crowd to keep booing gurriel in what he called a \" silent gesture \" in support of darvish, per sports illustrated. And not everyone seemed to accept gurriel's mea culpa, with some saying his gesture wasn't enough, notes the sacramento bee. \" no one cares about your ' i ' m sorry i got caught on live tv ' hat tip, \" one fan tweeted. Yahoo sports notes that darvish, who'd tweeted a message of positivity about the incident, \" didn't appear to react in the moment. \" for his part, however, gurriel appears to feel closure. \" i feel spiritually happy, \" he said post-game, per usa today. \" i felt like i had to salute him because from the very beginning he acted like a gentleman. \"",

The spending — which soared after netanyahu took office in 2009 but slowed down a few years later — also included at least $ 100 a day in grooming expenses for the couple and $ 20,000 a year on takeout food, even though taxpayers also paid for a cook. Ahead of the report's release, the couple invited a celebrity interior designer to tour the official residence and released a video showing run-down parts of the residence and a shabby kitchen the designer declared was like that of \" a romanian orphanage from 1954. \" but the guardian reports that critics soon charged that the dilapidated kitchen in the video was where workers took their meals and that the netanyahus actually use a lavish, newly renovated kitchen on another floor. Critics also said showing the interior of the official residence was a breach of security and questioned whether the designer's involvement constituted an illegal campaign donation, reports the new york times.

In one of the city's worst maritime disasters, a steamer named the city of chester departed for eureka on a foggy day, only to be hit by a much larger steamer arriving from hong kong with chinese passengers aboard. The wreck was found by national oceanic and atmospheric administration researchers using a sonar system; the agency's forerunner originally thought it had found the ship's remains just a month after the sinking, the washington post reports, but now the location has been confirmed. The wreck is at a depth of 217 feet and it won't be raised, but a nearby museum exhibition will tell the story of the ship's sinking, which happened at a time of widespread anti-chinese racism. \" when this happened, it happened in an atmosphere in which the population was dead set against the chinese, \" the director of noaa's maritime heritage program tells the san francisco chronicle. \" they accused the chinese of standing there impassively and watching these white people drown. \" it later emerged, however, that chinese sailors had heroically dived into the water to rescue passengers from the other ship. \" what this shipwreck reminds us of is that you don't need to make assumptions based on color, language, religion, or nationality, \" the noaa director says.

Malcolm alarmo king is a health nut, the orange county register explains, who didn't want to eat the jail's all-salami menu, so he asked for kosher, high-protein meals. The sheriff's department complained that such pricier fare was reserved for those with religious restrictions. So king's lawyer listed his religion as \"festivus. \" no, you didn't miss anything in that seinfeld episode; keeping kosher is not one of the precepts of festivus, a goofy made-up holiday that involves wrestling, an aluminum pole, and telling people how much they've disappointed you.

            "Festivus may only come around once a year – more often if you watch seinfeld reruns – but longtime county inmate malcolm alarmo king was able to celebrate it three times a day while locked up at the theo lacy jail in orange. King's quest for a healthier eating option while behind bars ended with a county lawyer forced to research the origin of festivus and its traditions and a superior court judge recognizing the holiday – which lodged its place in pop culture on an episode of seinfeld – as a legitimate religion. The menu selection at theo lacy apparently didn't please king, 38, when he was booked into the jail on drug charges in april. They serve salami there. And that didn't quite fit in with the fitness buff/ gym clothes model's lifestyle. So king, who is also suspected of being in the country illegally from liberia, asked for kosher meals. That was not because of his religion, but because they were healthier – and the 5 ' 8″ 180 lb king wanted double portions to maintain his physique, said his attorney, fred thiagarajah. Judge derek g. Johnson signed off on the high-protein double portion kosher meals for king. That didn't sit well with the sheriff's department – which pays for the food. Kosher meals are more expensive than the regular jail fare – and reserved for those with a religious need. The sheriff's department interviewed king in may about his religious leanings. When asked what his religion was he answered \"healthism. \" \"he's healthy so he said health and added an 'ism, ' \" said thiagarajah, who acknowledged to the county and a judge and to the watchdog that it was a farce. When sentencing day came, king pleaded guilty to the sale or transport of a controlled substance – a felony. Two other felonies were thrown",
            "A festivus for the rest of us? a convicted drug dealer in california thinks so. He cited his adherence to the holiday celebrated on a famous episode of \" seinfeld \" to get better meals at the orange county jail.

            "Festivus may only come around once a year – more often if you watch seinfeld reruns – but longtime county inmate malcolm alarmo king was able to celebrate it three times a day while locked up at the theo lacy jail in orange. King's quest for a healthier eating option while behind bars ended with a county lawyer forced to research the origin of festivus and its traditions and a superior court judge recognizing the holiday – which lodged its place in pop culture on an episode of seinfeld – as a legitimate religion. The menu selection at theo lacy apparently didn't please king, 38, when he was booked into the jail on drug charges in april. They serve salami there. And that didn't quite fit in with the fitness buff/ gym clothes model's lifestyle. So king, who is also suspected of being in the country illegally from liberia, asked for kosher meals. That was not because of his religion, but because they were healthier – and the 5 ' 8″ 180 lb king wanted double portions to maintain his physique, said his attorney, fred thiagarajah. Judge derek g. Johnson signed off on the high-protein double portion kosher meals for king. That didn't sit well with the sheriff's department – which pays for the food. Kosher meals are more expensive than the regular jail fare – and reserved for those with a religious need. The sheriff's department interviewed king in may about his religious leanings. When asked what his religion was he answered \"healthism. \" \"he's healthy so he said health and added an 'ism, ' \" said thiagarajah, who acknowledged to the county and a judge and to the watchdog that it was a farce. When sentencing day came, king pleaded guilty to the sale or transport of a controlled substance – a felony. Two other felonies were thrown",

        "summary": "Japan says it killed 333 minke whales, including 122 pregnant females, at its controversial annual hunt last summer. The hunt is, as always, under fire for its lack of apparent connection to legitimate scientific research and for killing whales rather than taking a non-lethal survey ( japan says its aim is to show the whale population is healthy ). This year's 12-week expedition, in which whales were killed using harpoons fitted with explosives, has also been particularly criticized for the number of pregnant females that were killed. Of the 128 mature females killed, 95.3 % were pregnant, reports the guardian. The expedition was detailed in a report to the international whaling commission. \"the killing of 122 pregnant whales is a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of japan's whale hunt, \" a humane society international program manager says in a statement. Whether japan's whale hunts are legal is a bit murky, notes the new york times. Under a 1946 international ruling, countries may kill whales for scientific research. In 2014, an international court found japan's whale hunt was for commercial purposes, not scientific, and temporarily banned the country from whaling in the antarctic ocean; a year later japan began a new program that reduced the number of whales it kills by two-thirds and that, per japan, has a scientific purpose. But experts contend the new program is still for profit; the whale meat is eventually sold as food. \"they've sought to exploit this loophole, \" one legal expert tells the nyt. Japan says that aside from research purposes, whale hunting is an important part of its culture, notes the bbc. Other countries still hunt whales for meat, but only japan hunts whales in antarctica under the scientific research exemption. ( minke whale vocalizations are fascinating. )",

        "summary": "Researchers believe they have spotted evidence of what could be the most remote body of water in our solar system: a vast ocean below the surface of pluto. In a study published in nature, researchers explain that the 600-mile-wide sputnik planitia region, a plain that is part of the heart-shaped feature on the dwarf planet's surface, appears to have accumulated so much ice over millions of years that it caused pluto to flip over and reorient itself, space.com reports. The researchers believe the plain was created by an asteroid impact that weakened the crust, causing nitrogen ice to rise from a subsurface ocean in quantities big enough to eventually roll the planet over. Cracks on pluto's surface support the rolling-over theory. \" it's like freezing ice cubes, \" researcher james keane says in a university of arizona press release. \" as the water turns to ice, it expands. On a planetary scale, this process breaks the surface around the planet and creates the faults we see today. \" mit news reports that researcher richard binzel says readings from the new horizons spacecraft revealed that pluto is still a little warm, and the measurements point to a subsurface ocean. \" it's not a liquid, flowing ocean, but maybe slushy, \" says binzel, who describes pluto as \" hard to fathom on so many different levels. \" ( what looked like snails on pluto's surface were actually dirty icebergs. )",

The existence of a subsurface ocean may solve a longstanding puzzle: for decades, astronomers have observed that tombaugh regio, which is pluto's brightest region, aligns almost exactly opposite from the dwarf planet's moon, charon, in a locked orientation that has lacked a convincing explanation.

        "summary": "A third cop at the scene of a fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen in chicago last week was relieved of his policing powers after an autopsy found 18-year-old paul o ' neal had been shot in the back and the cook county medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide, the ap reports. But another puzzling question is now emerging regarding the thursday night shooting, per the chicago tribune: why, despite the gathering of police body cameras and squad car dashcams, the shooting wasn't captured on camera. O ' neal was behind the wheel of a supposedly stolen jaguar when he's said to have crashed the car into two police vehicles. Police sources say two officers fired at him while he was still in the jaguar ( a dashcam reportedly captured one of the cops during that shooting ), but o ' neal soon took off running, with a third officer fast behind him. It was that officer who shot o ' neal, killing him, but his bodycam did not capture the shooting. Police don't think the officer who shot o ' neal failed to activate the camera purposely, saying the lack of recording could have been due to officer distraction, damage from the car crash, or the officer's own unfamiliarity with the camera. The three officers had only started using their body cameras about a week before the shooting, and the head of the fraternal order of police union says the \" learning curve \" for the equipment and \" heavy-stress situation[ s ] \" may cause an officer to neglect to turn the camera on. The attorney for o ' neal's family, which monday filed a civil suit against the officers involved, scoffs at those explanations. \" how convenient that they don't work, \" the attorney told reporters, per the chicago sun-times. \" if there is not a cover-up, i don't know where there is one. \" bodycam use in chicago has been given higher priority since the 2014 shooting of laquan mcdonald, who was shot 16 times by a chicago cop.",

Then came consumer reports, jd power, and most importantly, the internet. Now, consumers have a wealth of information on any given product at their fingertips, and they no longer need to rely on brand knowledge, writes james surowiecki in the new yorker. Indeed, according to a new book, \" the rise of brands was a response to an information-poor environment, \" surowiecki notes. Now, some 80 % of customers say they view online reviews before buying pricey items, according to a pricewaterhousecoopers study. What's more, thanks to social media, \" a dud product can become a laughingstock in a matter of hours. \" surowiecki points out that the phenomenon doesn't apply to status-conferring luxury items or purchases like coca-cola, \" where the brand association is integral to the experience of a product. \" the winners here? better-informed consumers, who have seen quality rise while prices don't — as well as new companies, whose quality products can quickly make a splash.

The kansas city star notes one amusing mix-up that's already confused fans on both sides of the pond. On the uk's doctor who site, the description for the doll notes she's sporting \" signature braces \" — which aren't the contraptions for one's teeth, but rather the british word for \" suspenders. \" the official barbie twitter account tried to remedy that confusion for americans by referring to the accessory as \" signature suspenders, \" but that just led back to more head-scratching for british fans, as the word \" suspenders \" means \" garter belt. \" \" it took me a minute to realise the show hadn't gone in a completely different direction, \" one commenter tweeted.

It's not clear whether the drone shot down by a patriot missile in southern israel carried explosives, but hamas says it has sent several drones to carry out \" special missions \" inside israel. In other developments: thousands of people fled their homes in northern gaza after the israeli military dropped leaflets warning of an impending assault — but even though the united nations has doubled its number of spots for displaced people to 20,000, there is a shortage of places for people to take refuge, the palestinian authority's uk envoy tells the bbc. \" there are no shelters, no bunkers, no place to go, except their homes, \" he says. \" if they leave their homes, they will be hit on the street. \" israel attacked more than 200 targets overnight but after a brief raid by israeli commandos yesterday, there was no sign of a major escalation in northern gaza. In israel, mass text messages that at first appear to be official ones are causing alarm, the washington post finds. Some warn of impending hamas rocket attacks, while one read, \" suicide bomber sneaked to tel aviv and center targeting shelters. Beware of strangers in shelters. \" it's not clear who is behind the messages. With the palestinian death toll now at 172, including 18 members of one family killed in a strike over the weekend, israel is continuing to reject international calls for a ceasefire, and hamas is still firing rockets, cnn reports. Despite efforts to persuade both sides to agree to a truce, \" hope for peaceful resolution seems to be even further away, \" germany's foreign minister said yesterday.",
