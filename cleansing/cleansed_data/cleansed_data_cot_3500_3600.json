Just hand me my walkie-talkie. ' \" residents in the immediate area were asked to \" take shelter \" while police searched for the shooters. Curtis banks, 26, and his brother, marvin banks, 29, were later taken into custody; the clarion-ledger notes that both have felony convictions, as well as multiple weapons charges to their names. \" no sir, i didn't do it, \" curtis banks said as he was taken into police headquarters. A third person, an unidentified woman, has been detained, notes the ap. Deen was hattiesburg's officer of the year in 2012 and a k-9 officer; tate was a recent police academy graduate.

A surprising new study in nature is linking cerebral palsy to genetic variants and challenging the notion that environmental factors are solely responsible, the globe &amp; mail reports. \" nobody really wanted us to do this [ study ], because they were told over the years that genetics doesn't have a role, \" says study co-author stephen scherer. \" we did it anyway. \" in testing genes of 115 kids with the disorder and their parents, chromosomal abnormalities turned up in 10 % of the children. And 10 % is apparently huge: \" this was shocking, \" says scherer. \" when i told a bunch of people in the clinical genetics unit, they literally fell off their chairs. \" the abnormalities the kids have are copy number variations ( cnvs ). The globe &amp; mail explains than rather than having two copies their genes ( one from mom and one from dad ), these kids had one or three; one had either been deleted or copied. Scherer says we all have cnvs, but \" some of these kids have massive cnvs that affect dozens and hundreds of genes. \" until now, scientists believed cerebral palsy ( the most common reason for physical disability in kids ) was caused by physical issues like an infection or stroke in babies during pregnancy or birth, according to a press release. Genetic causes were only considered when no environmental ones were found.

Perhaps that's why the footprints were able to hide in plain sight for years before observant paleontologists spotted the tell-tale signs of dinosaur toes. They're now celebrating the discovery of some 50 rare footprints left by long-necked sauropods and the three-toed theropod ancestors of tyrannosaurus rex, who roamed the coast of what is now scotland's isle of skye some 170 million years ago. Described in the scottish journal of geology, the two tracks of footprints left in lagoon sediment, along with a scattering of other prints, are among the few known to have come from the middle jurassic period and show sauropods were \" so successful that they were probably exploring whatever environments they could, \" steve brusatte of the university of edinburgh tells national geographic. It was brusatte and student paige depolo who created 3d maps of the prints found at brothers ' point in 2016, some as big as car tires, per the guardian. Sauropod footprints had then been found in one other spot on the island. But these prints are \" slightly older \" and show \" the presence of sauropods in this part of the world through a longer timescale than previously known, \" depolo says in a release. Brusatte adds the prints prove sauropods weren't just confined to swamps, as was the consensus a century ago. He says they were \" so dynamic and so energetic \" there was barely a place they didn't explore; their footprints have been found on all seven continents. Researchers expect more prints will be found on skye, where they've identified other possible trackways, per nat geo. ( meanwhile, ancient human footprints are making waves. )",

A third of the prisoners are believed to have al-qaeda ties. Two prison guards and five inmates were killed as gunfire and blasts erupted in the city overnight. Local military units moved in with helicopters to battle the militants early today and many have since backed off, reports cnn, which estimates some 270 inmates have escaped.

The group uncovered a us air force c-45 plane that crashed in the east end of lake ontario on its way to griffiss air force base near rome, new york, on sept. 11, 1952. As the democrat and chronicle and rome sentinel report, the plane's left engine began to fail; the five aboard decided to parachute out, with the pilot first putting the plane on autopilot in an attempt to crash it away from residential areas. But the plane, having lost nearly 1,000 pounds, gained altitude and took a slightly different course until its fuel ran out roughly 70 minutes later. At around 11pm the plane was seen flying low near oswego, with witnesses saying \" a powerful light, like that of a searchlight, appeared for several seconds after the crash. \" a coast guard search began right away and was stopped two days later, without success. Enter jim kennard, roger pawlowski, and roland stevens, who have been scouring the oswego end of lake ontario for ships for three years and found the plane \" well beyond the mile offshore reported by a few eyewitnesses, \" notes kennard. He tells the daily news the 34-foot-long plane doesn't look too bad — sonar images show it's missing its nose cone, a blade, and part of its body behind the left wing, and a windshield is broken.

That information turned out to be harder to come across than he had planned. Now, thanks to diedinhouse, homebuyers can search for murders, suicides, suspicious or natural deaths, fires, and meth labs at an address before they purchase the house, according to time. Diedinhouse \" can help you decide whether you need to be actively worried about ghosts or not, \" in the words of time. That's especially good news for homebuyers in massachusetts, where the law specifies \" alleged supernatural phenomenon \" don't need to be disclosed before the sale of a house. Bloomberg reports the site boasts approximately 30,000 searches so far — including by people actively seeking out haunted houses. Though at $ 11.99 per search, it might be a little too pricey to spend a day looking for some spooky news to give family and friends about their houses this halloween.

        "summary": "Seahorses, known not only for their funky shape but also for being monogamous and for the odd trait that it's the males who give birth, might be in more trouble than thought. It's long been known that the small fish are just one of many to get caught up in fishermen's nets, but new research in the journal fisheries suggests that millions more than previously realized are dying every year because of the problem. Haikai magazine calls it an \" accidental slaughter \" of some 37 million seahorses annually, based on data gathered from surveys and field tests in 22 countries. That figure is about six times higher than previous estimates, which might help explain why many of the 41 species of seahorses around the world are now deemed vulnerable or near threatened, per national geographic. For the most part, seahorses are not intentionally caught. Many fishermen talk about finding one a day in their nets, which they sell for roughly the cost of a pack of cigarettes because traditional chinese medicine values the fish. But the study finds that even this low level of bycatch adds up to huge numbers, while other, less memorable small fish are probably also suffering the same fate. Compelling fishermen to stop using trawl nets isn't easy, as the lead researcher says: \" these people are often very poor, and they need to feed their kids. But we're trying to find that balance to make the resources work for them. \" thailand, the biggest exporter of seahorses, temporarily banned the trade last fall.

Seahorses, easily recognized by their necks and long-snouted, horse-like heads, are some of the most unique animals on the planet. Not only are they monogamous, but they're the only animal in which the males, not the females, give birth. But they're also in trouble. When fishermen use trawl nets or other gear to catch shrimp and fish, seahorses are often scooped up along with the intended catch. This has a big impact on their population. Many of the 41 species are considered vulnerable or near threatened by the international union for the conservation of nature, the organization that sets the conservation status of species. Once fishermen have the seahorses in their possession, some sell them to traders who export them to other countries. About 80 countries trade in seahorses, which are traded either live or dried. Most of the dried ones end up in china and other countries in east asia where they're used in traditional medicine to cure everything from impotence to abdominal pain.

' \" but despite getting lots of facebook \" likes \" for his humorous approach, there's a serious undercurrent to melgaard's trolling. \" did it ever occur to you that this … is to address the fact that suicide is one of the leading causes of death amongst the lgbt community for ages 15 to 24? \" he wrote to the upset parties on his personal facebook page on friday. \" i just find it kind of ridiculous that when we pay attention to one sub-group within society, some other groups tend to freak out. \" the doritos forhelp account was taken down less than a day after melgaard started it, per digiday and a saturday post by melgaard, but his friday post calling out the haters received almost 5,000 likes. \" anyone being ' upset ' over this issue is really just slowing down the collective progress for all of humanity, \" he wrote. \" and you're doing it for no reason other than your personal bias. \" ( a writer for the week says the term \" troll \" is \" insipid. \" )",

The promotional stunt for the zinger sandwich comes two months after the fast food chain unveiled rob lowe playing kentucky fried chicken founder col.

            "Hormone-crazed tweens can buy justin bieber fan tees and justin bieber sweatpants and justin bieber shorts, but bieber doesn't have his own fashion line yet, per se. And rather than take the plunge with $ 19 zebra party dresses and $ 8 stretch pleather leggings, he's just dipping a toe into the tween fashion and beauty market with nail polish launching in december exclusively at wal-mart, the mecca of tween icon brands. Bieber collaborated with nicole on a line of shades called \"one less lonely girl, \" which is apparently a song that he sings. The shade pictured here is called \"step 2 the beat of my heart, \" but the other polishes don't have the chunky glitter, if you happen to be 11-years-old and into this but not the glitter-sort-of-thing. But this seems like an odd branding move because sure, bieber appeals to young ladies, so it makes sense that he would make stuff for them to buy. But he appeals to them because they find him sexy, as we understand it ( not knowing anything about the kid except that he exists and has hair and lips ). Do 10-year-olds really find it hot that the dude is making nail polish for them? or maybe we're just really old and don't know what's hip in teen love these days"

Prosecutors there are looking into whether the trump organization violated campaign finance laws with payments of hush money to two women after alleged affairs with trump. Dershowitz, however, says the organization's treasurer, not trump himself, would seemingly be at fault there. As all this unfolds, dershowitz has four-pronged advice for the president: \" don't fire, don't pardon, don't tweet and don't testify. \" he adds that if trump had abided by those rules, \" he'd be in less trouble than he is today. \"",

So, i think the southern district is the greatest threat. \" trump's legal team has cited the constitution in arguing that the president should not sit down for an interview with mueller, who is investigating russian interference in the 2016 election as well as potential collusion with trump's campaign and obstruction of justice. Trump has routinely denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt. \" the president's legal quandary in new york, meanwhile, continues to deepen after prosecutors"

Their crime: \" sexting \" illicit material while under the age of 18, abc11 reports. The kicker: they were old enough to be charged as adults in north carolina, but young enough to be considered sexually exploitable minors, so copening and denson were both the adult perpetrators and underage victims. And copening, who was suspended as quarterback of his high school football team over the charges, could have been considered a sex offender for life had he not accepted a plea deal ( as did denson ) that dropped the felony charges down to misdemeanors. \" you can be labeled a convicted sex offender as an adult at the age of 16, but you are a minor by being under the age of 18 to commit the offense in the first place, \" a raleigh attorney tells fox news. \" it really makes terrible sense logically, but that's the way the law is written. \" and north carolina isn't alone: while 20 states have so-called \" romeo and juliet \" laws to ensure that teen lovers aren't prosecuted for swapping such photos, the rest don't provide such leeway, per the guardian. Indeed, authorities in copening's case saw no way out: \" we have no choice, \" a sheriff's sergeant explains to fox. \" the easiest way for the state to fix it is just to treat everyone under 18 as a minor. \" as for copening and denson, they can each get their record expunged by completing the terms of probation, which includes no cellphones for a year, wral reports.",

Scientists have developed a computer program they say plays an effectively perfect game of fixed-limit heads-up texas hold ' em, the bbc reports. The cepheus system \" can't be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing, \" developers say. The game won't necessarily win every hand, the guardian reports, but it should beat humans in the long run.

The program reportedly learns from its mistakes, experiencing what might be called electronic \" regret \" over moves that don't work out perfectly. If you're skeptical, you can try playing against it right here. Its favored version of poker starts with players receiving two cards the other player can't see, and that's key to the significance of cepheus. Computers have previously developed winning strategies for games like chess, but in those games, each player has all the information about what's happened so far — they're called \" perfect information games. \" prior to cepheus, \" no nontrivial imperfect-information game played competitively by humans \" had been \" solved, \" researchers write in science. At the guardian, poker writer christopher hall has some doubts: \" one of the bot's limitations appears to be that it did not seem to adapt against my change of style, something that could be its undoing.

Its revenue figure comes in as higher than the gdp of poland ( and a lot of other countries included in the international monetary fund's 2015 ranking ). Walmart boasts 11,500 stores around the globe, visited by 260 million customers each week — and it got that way by \" annihilating main street, \" quartz notes, undercutting the \" clothing, appliance, and dry goods stores that were once the heart of local commerce. \" with more than 2 million workers, walmart is the third-largest employer on earth ( only the dod and china's people's liberation army claim more workers, per forbes ). That workforce means it had to pull $ 2.7 billion out of its wallet when it agreed in january to raise wages of 1.2 million workers to a full-time average of $ 13.38 an hour and a part-time average of $ 10.58.

        "summary": "Last night's state of the union address has been described as \" defiant \" and \" assertive, \" but how about \" accurate \"? the media this morning is questioning a few of president obama's bigger claims. Among the shakier ones: \" our combat mission in afghanistan is over. \" not if you define \" combat \" as direct confrontation with the enemy. In addition to helping train afghan forces, the us is still tasked with preventing a resurgence of al-qaeda and other militant groups in afghanistan, politico reports. \" our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. \" the us bureau of economic analysis says that the most recent figures available — for the third quarter of last year — show the real gdp was growing at an annual rate of 5.0 %. It was actually higher than that in 2003, at 6.9 %, and 2000, at 7.8 %. And regarding the speed of job growth, that appears to have been a reference to a preliminary, not a final, figure for 2014, usa today reports. \" since 2010, america has put more people back to work than europe, japan, and all advanced economies combined. \" well, that figure comes from the international monetary fund's list of \"advanced economies, \" which includes some spots, like hong kong, that aren't independent countries — and it doesn't count china, the washington post reports. \" we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. \" this line in cybersecurity is highly questionable, politico reporters write: \" there are no guarantees, even with the best-written bill, that hackers can be stopped from wreaking havoc on government departments or private companies. \" \" in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage. \" here, obama may actually be underselling himself, politico reports. The study in the new england journal of medicine that offers the 10 million figure doesn't include sign-ups under obamacare since november.",

Below are 7 selfies that did not end well: it's not a good idea to take selfies while driving, especially if you have seven passengers in your car. A maine man learned this lesson the hard way when, mid-selfie, his car veered off the road and slammed into a tree, injuring several of his friends. A word of advice: rattlesnakes are not always willing to cooperate and pose for selfies with you. Two twentysomethings with the kfc/taco bell munchies decided to follow up their fast food binge by climbing on board a boat harbored in a connecticut marina and taking some selfies. Unfortunately for them, the flashes from the camera woke up the family asleep on the boat, and the alleged intruders ran away, leaving their fast food bag and receipt behind as evidence. They were later arrested. A 19-year-old texas man was taking selfies with a loaded gun when he fatally shot himself in the throat by accident. If you're going to ( allegedly ) rob a church, you probably shouldn't leave your phone behind at the crime scene, especially if there are selfies on it that the police can use to identify you. Likewise, taking selfies with the $ 5,000 you allegedly stole from a truck, using the victim's stolen ipad to take the photos, is basically the equivalent of turning yourself in, claims one reddit user in a thread that helped track the thieves down. The incriminating photos were posted to the alleged victim's own icloud account.

Prosecutors in the coastal region of kiel, tipped off by berlin prosecutors who'd recently searched the 78-year-old man's villa for stolen nazi art, aren't divulging much yet, but a police rep did say that a torpedo and anti-aircraft gun had been removed and other weaponry had been found as well, reports the local. Alexander orth — mayor of the town of heikendorf, where the man lives — wasn't surprised by the discovery because the elderly man \" was chugging around in that thing during the snow catastrophe in 1978, \" adding that \" some people like steam trains, others like tanks. \" and because the tank can no longer fire weapons, the pensioner's lawyer tells the german paper süddeutsche zeitung, via the local, that the man hasn't actually broken any laws. Prosecutors, meanwhile, are investigating whether possession of the tank, torpedo, anti-aircraft gun, and other weapons violates germany's war weapons control act. Orth, meanwhile, did concede: \" i took this to be the eccentricity of an old man, but it looks like there's more to it than that. \" ( check out what officials found in this austrian bunker. )",

A pentagon spokesperson confirms to cnn that plans are underway, though still in the \" infancy \" stage. Meanwhile, the idea is drawing all kinds of reaction, both positive and negative. Details and developments, including the idea that trump is masterfully trolling his critics with this proposal: in favor: count david french of the national review as among those in favor. His tweet sums up: \" in the more than 16 years since 9/11 our military has 1 ) toppled the taliban. 2 ) toppled saddam. 3 ) defeated the follow-on aqi insurgency. 4 ) defeated the isis caliphate in iraq and syria. 5 ) endured years of grinding deployments while fighting with honor. I ' m fine with a parade. \" the criticism: chris cillizza at cnn hits a common point in an op-ed, making the case that any parade would be mostly about trump's ego. Cillizza's hunch is that trump saw the one in france and thought, \" we need something bigger \" — because, in the president's world, \" bigger is always better. \" another quote in wide circulation: democratic rep.

That translates into a drop of 15.9 abortions per 1,000 women in 2006 to 11.8 per 1,000 women in 2015. The numbers have dropped each year in that 10-year span. One caveat: california, maryland, and new hampshire did not participate in the cdc stats, notes the washington post. Still, while the numbers are not 100 % complete, they are believed to accurately capture the nationwide trend. Better access to birth control and various states ' efforts to restrict abortions were seen as two big reasons for the decline. Some of the stats: age: most of the women getting abortions were in their 20s, reports cnn, with 31.1 % aged 20-24 and 27.6 % aged 25-29. Race: white women had the lowest rate, 6.8 abortions per 1,000 women, while black women had the highest, at 25.1 per 1,000. Location: rates in the reporting states ranged from 2.8 per 1,000 in south dakota to 23.1 per 1,000 in new york. When: 91 % of the abortions happened at 13 weeks or less of gestation.

Chris suggs didn't like what was happening to the town he loved, so he decided to do something about it.

But the 29-year-old from ohio tells the bbc she got death threats from the deaf community when she started her post-hearing music career. Harvey was born with near-perfect pitch but also a condition that caused her to gradually lose her hearing, npr reports. She was a college freshman, studying to become a choral director, when she finally lost her hearing altogether. Harvey, who says \" music was my life, \" dropped out of school and lost direction. But her father encouraged her to try singing again, and she used an electric tuner to learn how to stay on key without hearing herself. That was followed by hundreds of shows, three albums ( a fourth comes out later this year ), and, of course, america's got talent. Despite her success, harvey hasn't been fully embraced by the deaf community. \" i got a lot of backlash from certain people in that community because i was promoting oralism, \" she tells the bbc. Oralism is pushing deaf people to conform to the hearing world through speech and lip-reading rather than using sign language, and \" oral \" can be lobbed as an insult at deaf people accused of doing \" hearing \" things. \" when you're doing something that is living inside the hearing world, such as music and singing, it can be frowned upon, \" harvey says. A deaf blogger says what happened to the singer shows the \" ugly side of our community. \" but harvey isn't going to let criticism — or death threats — stop her. \" i really wanted to change the idea of what is possible, \" she says. \" if it hacks off a couple of people, well, it's encouraging a heck of a lot more, so they can just get over it. \"",

A 2012 federal law prevents iranians aiming for careers in energy or nuclear sciences from getting visas to study in the us, the ap notes, but that doesn't mean iranian nationals can't study science or engineering here, a state department official says, noting that decisions are made on an individual basis. The national iranian american council has criticized the move and called on umass to \" immediately reverse this harmful, discriminatory, and unnecessary action. \" a group of umass students has set up a facebook page to oppose the policy, which they call \" unique … among all higher education institutions, \" though the iranian american council suggests that virginia commonwealth university has a similarly worded policy, masslive reports. As for the 2012 law, the students say that's for the departments of state and homeland security to enforce, but \" this educational institution is taking upon itself to be a law enforcer. \" a university official says his colleagues didn't want to institute the policy, but did so for transparency reasons.

Four sources said to be \" in and close to the white house \" confirm to nbc news an earlier report by axios that wall street financier anthony scaramucci — \" mooch \" to those close to him — is set to be named as dubke's replacement. The announcement could come friday. A source tells nbc scaramucci was at the white house thursday, where he met with trump and ivanka trump and was offered the job. That source adds trump has long known scaramucci, 53, who stumped for trump during the campaign and has been \" a good advocate for the president. \" he also defended donald trump jr. On twitter regarding the latter's june 2016 meeting with a russian lawyer. Still, nbc notes scaramucci wasn't initially team trump: he first lent his support to scott walker, then jeb bush in the primaries portion of the presidential campaign. Scaramucci was appointed by trump last month to a position with the export-import bank, a position he ' ll vacate if the comm director one becomes official. One white house insider who was apparently thrown by the news of scaramucci's impending appointment: chief of staff reince priebus, who axios says found out about his potential new colleague only after the decision had been made. Meanwhile, press secretary sean spicer, who's been taking care of dubke's responsibilities since he left, is expected to remain on staff, but it's \" unclear \" exactly what he ' ll be doing, axios notes.",

        "summary": "Californians love their in-n-out burgers, and a democratic leader's attempt to drum up support for a boycott isn't exactly taking off. The brouhaha started when journalist gabe schneider tweeted a state filing showing that the chain had donated $ 25,000 to the gop, reports usa today. That prompted california democratic party chairman eric bauman to tweet the following: \" et tu in-n-out? tens of thousands of dollars donated to the california republican party... It's time to #boycottinnout - let trump and his cronies support these creeps... Perhaps animal style! \" but if bauman was hoping to rally opposition to the chain similar to that of chick-fil-a, he doesn't appear to have been successful. The los angeles times notes that the state party has made a point to say that bauman's boycott call was \" just his personal view, \" and not an official position of the party. The original tweet has gotten its share of support online, but the la times also finds sentiment among democrats that boycotting the chain over a political donation might be a little much. Republicans, meanwhile, were quickly trying to take advantage with public shows of support for the chain, while in-n-out says it has contributed equally to both parties in 2018. Fortune notes that the chain's founder, rich snyder, was an evangelical christian, which explains the bible verses on wrappers. \" however, it's not clear that the company's current leadership is nearly as aligned with the republicans as that of chick-fil-a, a company that has backed organizations that restrict lgbt rights, \" writes grace dobush. And los angeles magazine reports that in-n-out does indeed donate to democratic-backed political groups.",

        "summary": "Bad news, cheese lovers: the delicious snack's future is uncertain after a recent fda decision. The fda clarified last week that wooden racks, used by many cheesemakers to age their product, \" cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. \" that means cheesemakers who have been using such racks for decades may not technically be allowed to sell their cheese, though the fda did say last night that a compromise is possible. The executive director of the american cheese society tells the san francisco chronicle that 65 % of its 1,500 members, ranging from the smallest artisan cheesemakers to the largest factory outfits, use wood to age their cheese. And half of imported cheese is made the same way, she notes to the new york times. \" we're talking about a crushing blow to the artisan cheese industry, \" says one cheesemaker. The wood's porous surface, unlike plastic or metal, prevents mold as it absorbs humidity. And, explains one fourth-generation cheesemaker whose family has been aging its sonoma jack on wooden racks for 83 years, \" it's what gives our cheese its flavor. \" but starting in 2012, a cheesemaker in new york was cited multiple times after listeria was found on her wooden boards, which led state regulators to ask the fda for a clarification on wood boards months ago. ( slate notes that listeria shouldn't be an issue if the boards are \" well-maintained. \" ) it's a confusing issue — particularly because, as another california cheesemaker points out, the fda has been inspecting his facility each year since 2011, and no inspector has ever mentioned his wood racks. Yesterday, after much backlash from both cheesemakers and consumers, the fda said it \" has not taken any enforcement action based solely on the use of wooden shelves, \" forbes reports. The agency says it will work with artisan cheesemakers to determine whether wooden racks can be used safely for certain types of cheese. ( better get this $ 100 grilled cheese sandwich while you still can. )",

        "summary": "\" all cardiology guidelines should be revised, \" according to one doctor, based on new study results some experts are calling \" unbelievable \": heart stents, inserted in hundreds of thousands of patients per year to relieve chest pain, don't appear to actually relieve the pain. Researchers looked at 200 people with narrowed coronary arteries whose chest pain was bad enough to limit activity; all of them received the same pre-op and post-op treatment ( including medication aimed at relieving chest pain ). Then, some received surgery to insert a real stent while some got a fake procedure; neither the patients nor the researchers knew which group they were in. The good news: both groups reported feeling less pain six weeks later, and both groups performed better on a treadmill test. The bad news: there was no difference in pain level between the two groups, the new york times reports. Subjects who received real stents did, however, experience improved blood flow through the artery that had been partially blocked. But since stent procedures carry risks, including death, a doctor who wrote an editorial accompanying the study says that based on these results, stents should only be given to patients having heart attacks. A previous study found stents did not prevent heart attacks or deaths from heart disease, but cardiologists continue to use them to ease chest pain. As a press release explains, the new study was focused on patients with only narrowed arteries, meaning they would be getting the procedure for pain relief. Some experts point out limitations of the new study, including the fact that it only followed patients for six weeks and it did not look at patients with more severe blockages or blockages in more than one artery. And even the lead researchers won't go so far as to say some patients with severe disease should avoid stents, noting that medication is not an option for everyone.",

        "summary": "A sampling of the coverage and tributes to hugh hefner in the wake of the death of the 91-year-old founder of playboy: perfect timing: \" hefner the man and playboy the brand were inseparable. Both advertised themselves as emblems of the sexual revolution, an escape from american priggishness and wider social intolerance, \" per the new york times. \" both were derided over the years — as vulgar, as adolescent, as exploitative, and finally as anachronistic. But mr. Hefner was a stunning success from his emergence in the early 1950s. His timing was perfect. \" gay rights: hefner ran a futuristic short story in his magazine in 1955 in which heterosexuality was illegal and homosexuality the norm, notes the washington post. The piece had been rejected elsewhere, and even some of hefner's own readers were scandalized. His response? \" if it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too. \" 1967 cover story: time revisits its own cover story on hefner and his magazine in 1967. \" america was undoubtedly ready for it anyway, but hefner seized the moment. He was the first publisher to see that the sky would not fall and mothers would not march if he published bare bosoms; he realized that the old taboos were going, that, so to speak, the empress need wear no clothes. \" wise investment: people hits the highs and lows of his life. Among the tidbits: a young hefner launched his magazine in 1953 after pulling together $ 8,000 from 45 investors, including his mom. Visit to the playboy mansion: rob lowe recalls what it was like to visit in the 1980s as a young movie star in a first-person piece at esquire. ( \" awesome, obviously. \" ) at usa today, journalist marco della cava encountered a more subdued hefner in the 1990s. \" my memories remain that of a rather quiet man who was curious about others and the world around him. Maybe a man more akin to hugh marston hefner, than to hef. \" pioneering tv: billboard notes that hefner had groundbreaking tv shows, too, beginning with playboy's penthouse in the late 1950s. \" the show boosted his personal and professional reputation and promoted what eventually became known as the ' playboy philosophy, ' a lifestyle that included politically liberal sensibilities, nonconformity and, of course, sophisticated parties with expensive accouterments and the ever-present possibility for recreational sex. \" his style: a piece at the hollywood reporter praises hefner as a fashion icon for men. With his silks and robes, he was the original \" pajamas dresser. \"",

Npr reports the sanders campaign was already celebrating receiving 2 million donations when news came in thursday that two major endorsements had gone their way. According to msnbc, the communications workers of america endorsed sanders after an \" overwhelming \" victory in an online poll of its 700,000 members. That was followed by democracy for america — a progressive group founded by howard dean's brother — throwing its support behind sanders, npr reports. \" it's a much needed boost for a candidate whose campaign's momentum seemed to stall a bit lately, \" msnbc states. The sanders campaign announced hitting 2 million donations wednesday night, the washington post reports. That's more than any other candidate from either party. In fact, sanders is only the second presidential candidate ever to surpass 2 million donations — and his campaign is confident he can break the 2.2 million record set by obama's reelection campaign. The average donation to the sanders campaign is $ 30. Meanwhile, hillary clinton has raised nearly double what sanders has — despite having only 600,000 donations at the end of september, according to npr. Nearly 75 % of donations to the clinton campaign are $ 1,000 or more. A statement from the sanders campaign states the 2 million donations show \" we can run a strong and we believe winning campaign without a super pac, without contributions from millionaires and billionaires. \" ( check out a rapper interviewing sanders. )",

Magnotta's torture of animals fits the profile of a serial killer, but his quest for notoriety resembles the profile of mass murderers who plan to make a huge splash and don't care if they die in the process. Magnotta is an \" attention whore \" who thought of himself as a criminal genius, but proved completely unable to stay ahead of a real-life international manhunt, the profiler says. \" what happened here is that fantasy met reality; reality won. \"",

There's still hope for believers, though: the underwater robot from norwegian company kongsberg maritime isn't finished mapping the lake, a project called operation groundtruth that will result in the first high-resolution survey of the body of water, reports discovery. It should wrap up next week. In addition to finding the movie prop, the drone named munin has turned up a shipwreck and has debunked a claim that the lake has a mysterious trench in which a monster might hide, reports the herald. As for the prop, it was used in the private life of sherlock holmes, directed by billy wilder. By most accounts, wilder didn't like the look of the prop's two humps and ordered them removed before a shot — not realizing they were the main things keeping the \" monster \" afloat. A tourism official at visitscotland tells newsweek that the mapping project won't hurt the legend — and the related $ 60 million industry — even if no evidence turns up. \" people like the idea that there is possibly something lurking there. \" ( one longtime hunter thinks nessie is a catfish. )",

            "Advertisement a michigan pilot who disappeared after a plane crash in ontario may have tried to end his life, police said. Xin rong, 27, a doctoral student at the university of michigan, rented a plane from the ann arbor municipal airport on march 15, and near midnight, it crashed, according to a press release obtained by mlive. The cessna 172 was found about 60 kilometres east of marathon, ontario provincial police told the canadian press last week. Xin rong was piloting a cessna 172 that crashed in northwestern ontario last week. ( photo: xin rong/facebook ) they said the pilot wasn't found near the crash site and ended their investigation. Meanwhile, the university of michigan police department was investigating rong as a missing person. They confirmed wednesday that he was aboard the plane, and that an air and ground search for him has been suspended. \"police have reasons to believe his actions likely were an act of self-harm, \" a news release obtained by the chronicle journal said, but there were no details on how they came to that conclusion. \" when ( rong ) exited, and how ( rong ) exited, is still a mystery. \" rong is a student in the school of information, according to his linkedin page, researching artificial intelligence, \"language networks \" and \"text mining. \" he had worked at microsoft and google. His personal website appears to have disappeared. Transportation safety board of canada investigation data that the chronicle journal obtained revealed the plane had travelled nearly 800 kilometres before crashing, empty, in the woods. While it was headed for harbour spring, mich., it didn't land anywhere before the accident, investigators said. They think the plane was on auto-pilot and ran out of fuel. \" when ( rong ) exited, and how ( rong ) exited, is still a mystery, \" said one investigator.

Pankow, professor of chemistry and engineering at portland state university in oregon. \"but the bottom line is, there are toxins and some are more than in regular cigarettes. And if you are vaping, you probably shouldn't be using it at a high-voltage",
            "Electronic cigarettes are widely believed to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes, but a new study suggests they aren't harmless. Research published wednesday in the new england journal of medicine found high-powered tanks used in e-cigarettes to heat nicotine-laced liquid produced a type of formaldehyde not previously detected in e-cigarettes, making the cancer risk from formaldehyde five- to 15-times higher than from traditional cigarettes....",
            "E-cigarette vapor can contain cancer-causing formaldehyde at levels up to 15 times higher than regular cigarettes, a new study finds. Researchers found that e-cigarettes operated at high voltages produce vapor with large amounts of formaldehyde-containing chemical compounds. This could pose a risk to users who increase the voltage on their e-cigarette to increase the delivery of vaporized nicotine, said study co-author james pankow, a professor of chemistry and civil and environmental engineering at portland state university in oregon. \" we've found there is a hidden form of formaldehyde in e-cigarette vapor that has not typically been measured. It's a chemical that contains formaldehyde in it, and that formaldehyde can be released after inhalation, \" pankow said. \" people shouldn't assume these e-cigarettes are completely safe. \" the findings appear in a letter published jan. 22 in the new england journal of medicine. Health experts have long known that formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals are present in cigarette smoke. Initially, e-cigarettes were hoped to be without such dangers because they lack fire to cause combustion and release toxic chemicals, a portland state news release said.

Monday's protests were peaceful, however, with the dozens of activists gathered outside ferguson market offering free candy and cigarettes to try to keep people out of the store. Jason pollock's documentary stranger fruit features previously unseen surveillance footage from hours before the alleged theft and shooting and claims that the 18-year-old brown didn't steal boxes of cigarillos in a strong-arm robbery but traded them for marijuana in a previously agreed deal. The store's owners and st. Louis county prosecutor robert p. Mcculloch have rejected the documentary's claim, with the prosecutor calling the video \" pathetic \" and \" poorly edited, \" the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. Mcculloch released five surveillance videos from the wee hours of aug. 9, 2014, and told reporters monday that the full version of the footage shows \" there was certainly an attempt to barter for these goods \" on brown's behalf, but \" the store employees had no involvement at all in that. To suggest he's coming back to get what he bartered for is just stupid. \" pollock's response to the ap: mcculloch is \" a master at deception, i ' ll give him that, and he tricked the world for a long time, but he can't trick us now.

Security agents were on the scene in 25 minutes, taking charge of evacuations, the washington post reports — and indeed most of those evacuated were working for the cia, notes the wall street journal: just seven of the 30 people evacuated worked for the state department. Washington didn't get in the way of the cia's efforts, intelligence officials say: \" there was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground, by people at every us organization that could play a role in assisting those in danger. \" still, the journal highlights potential problems in the relationship between the state department and the cia, suggesting that the highly secretive role of the agency may have hindered the response to some extent. The consulate functioned in large part as cover for the agency, and investigators in congress say intelligence agents and state officials may not have been clear on their respective roles there. The cia, according to critics in congress, has maintained secrecy in part to duck blame; agency insiders reject the assertion.

        "summary": "If you've been waiting two decades for dumb and dumber to, the sequel to 1994's cult classic dumb and dumber, well, let's hope you aren't as disappointed as critics. The flick starring jim carrey and jeff daniels has just a 28 % approval rating from critics on rotten tomatoes as of this writing. Here's what they're saying: this \" disappointing return \" is \" so uninspired that it could retroactively tarnish our affection for the original, \" writes lindsey bahr at the ap. \" the boys are up to their same old stunts, which is the fundamental problem: they've stayed the same. We've changed. \" she especially takes issue with the \" insidious racism \" and \" misogynistic treatment of women. \" at a time \" when dumb buddy comedy has become an entire strain of filmmaking \" ( think the hangover, wedding crashers, etc. ), dumb and dumber to \" feels strangely old-fashioned, \" writes betsy sharkey at the los angeles times. That might have something to do with the \" expected blind jokes, fart jokes, pee jokes, and poop jokes, \" sharkey says. But at least carrey \" is mind-blowing to watch \" and \" back at the top of his game. \" rafer guzman at newsday says fans of the original might leave the theater satisfied. \" carrey is as energetic and rubber-faced as ever, while daniels has improved, vying for co-star status instead of playing the straight man, \" he writes. But as far as their characters go, \" harry and lloyd remain less than endearing, \" guzman writes. \" maybe that's the secret to their success. \" finally, ty burr at the boston globe has kind words. \" everyone has piled into this dumber, sillier, more consistently funny reprise with an enthusiasm that's infectious, \" he writes. In terms of the humor, \" the batting average is surprisingly high, \" though \" some of the misfires are vile. \" overall, \" it's a movie to make you groan and smile in equal guilty measure. \"",

The denver post reports the couple were at 12,400 feet, just above the tree line and about 2,000 feet below the summit, per cbs denver, when they were hit by lightning. The chaffee county coroner's office says bartlett, 31, likely died instantly. Pocius, 32, was taken from the mountain via helicopter about 4.5 hours later — a rescue slowed by the fact that witnesses had to hike at least 2 miles down the mountain, then drive to a place where they had cellphone reception, reports 9news. The post describes bartlett and pocius as outdoors-lovers who had married at the denver botanic gardens. The couple's wedding website recounts how they met at a bar where bartlett, a teacher, worked as a part-time cocktail waitress; she gave pocius a hard time for ordering scotch with ice on the side. He asked for her number, and they quickly realized \" we had both found ' our person.'six months after we started dating seriously, we found ourselves engaged. \" the denver channel has this quote: \" she was a soft, gentle breeze in any space she graced. Our family is saddened by her passing, yet certain that katie-bug is in a loving, blissful, and perfect space. \" according to national weather service data, bartlett is the first person to be killed by lightning this year in denver; the mount yale region was hit by just two cloud-to-ground lightning flashes on friday.",

The plaintiff would also need to make specific charges in order to sue, but boehner accuses the president of doing an end-run around \" the american people and their elected legislators on \" matters ranging from health care and energy to foreign policy and education. \" even some conservative scholars believe house lawmakers have no legal standing for the suit — and if they did succeed, president obama would be out of office long before the case had finished working its way through the courts, notes dana milbank at the washington post, who believes the real source of the problem with expanding executive power is \" congressional dysfunction \" — which could be fixed by compromises, not lawsuits.
