        "summary": "Yesterday, comedy central announced that trevor noah would be taking over the daily show, a fresh, biracial — albeit male — face to add to the late-night pantheon. But that was yesterday. Today, there's a tempest brewing over noah's twitter account, in which he says things like this, as spotted by buzzfeed's tom gara: @trevornoah: \" ' oh yeah the weekend. People are gonna get drunk &amp; think that i ' m sexy! \" - fat chicks everywhere. \" @trevornoah: \" messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. # elclasico \" @trevornoah: \" so now that adele is singing, does that mean it's over? \" @trevornoah: \" in thailand hookers are so cheap, even cheaper than food. Tough choice between big mac or quarter poundher deluxe. \" @trevornoah: \" originally when men proposed they went down on one knee so if the woman said no they were in the perfect uppercut position. \" reactions ranged from those accusing noah of misogyny and anti-semitism to those accusing him of just being lame, notes the new york times. Comedy central, though, stood by him. Noah \" pushes boundaries; he is provocative and spares no one, himself included, \" says a statement. \" to judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair. \" roseanne barr, for one, tweeted that \" u should cease sexist &amp; anti semitic ' humor ' about jewish women &amp; israel, \" reports politico. Noah himself responded this morning in a quickly deleted tweet: \" twitter does not have enough characters to respond to all the characters on twitter. \" in a slate piece, jessica winter writes that while, sure, \" twitter is a space for comics to try out material that isn't fully baked, \" and noah by no means has the monopoly on misogyny in comedy, \" the problem is that noah's jokes are so annihilatingly stupid. Are they even jokes? are they meta-jokes, like the \"my arms are so tired \" airplane joke he made on his first daily show appearance? or did he mean that as a joke, too?!? trevor noah: ontological mystery. \"",

The driver of a car that pippa, 28, was riding in smilingly pointed what looked like a gun at pestering paparazzi in paris over the weekend. Now he says he was just goofing around, and the gun wasn't real. \" it was not a real gun. It was just a stupid joke, \" said a representative. The french aren't laughing, though, especially in the wake of the shocking shootings in toulouse last month. Paris authorities warned that everyone in the car ( including grinning pippa ) could face arrest and even two years in prison. \" anybody involved in the illegal use of a handgun in public is liable to arrest and interrogation, \" a source told the sun. But so far, no one has filed a complaint, and the \" targeted \" photographer didn't feel threatened, reports abc. The driver hasn't yet been identified. Her royal hotness was in the front passenger's seat, and sitting in the back were two men, including aristocrat fashion designer viscount arthur de soultrait, whose wild birthday party pippa attended ( for photos, check here ).

The ap reports the news is being hailed by opponents to nestle's action — and by nestle.

The longer view isn't quite as favorable sounding: npr reports that between 1947 and 2015, nestle extracted an average 62.6 million gallons annually, with the rights unchanged at 8.5 million. Nestle told the state its claim to the water dates to an 1865 claim held by the owner of the arrowhead springs hotel; the board found that claim was limited to \" riparian \" — meaning at the water's origin — use \" and is not valid for nestle's current appropriative diversion and use of water \" from the forest. The company was notified of the findings — the result of an investigation begun in 2016 and borne from complaints spurred by the state's drought — on dec. 20. A letter accompanying the findings recommended that nestle immediately halt unauthorized distributions and outlined steps it recommends the company take over the next 18 months.",

What he came across this summer in the village of huanchaquito, however, is \" not what we've seen before, especially on the coast, \" he says. Locals noticed bones poking out of a sandy ridge in 2011, and peruvian archaeologist gabriel prieto went to investigate. He was greeted with a shock: the remains of 42 children and 76 llamas sacrificed some 600 years ago in a ritual by the chimú, who controlled part of coastal peru from around 1100 until they were overthrown by the inca in 1470, phys.org reports. Verano and prieto's expansion of the dig this summer added to the \" exciting discovery \" as even more remains were found. \" it's not a place where you'd think to look, \" tulane university's verano says of the site, about 100 yards from a beach. He notes erosion and construction nearby helped reveal the forgotten remains. While verano has come across the bodies of adults captured and killed in peru, children are a rarity, he says. He explains the children may have been killed as a gift to the sea. ( as prieto explained to national geographic in 2011, \" in the north coast of peru, the ocean is very closely tied to agriculture because the temperature of the water can determine whether there will be rain or not. \" ) as for the llamas, the chimú may have believed they would transport the children to the afterlife. The discovered bones and teeth are now being analyzed. ( other recent peruvian discoveries include the world's highest ice age camp and ancient designs in the desert. )",

This year, prieto and verano expanded the dig and completed the study of children's remains excavated in 2011 with support from the national geographic society and the stone center for latin american studies at tulane. Their latest excavation uncovered numerous additional sacrificial victims, which will allow for a more detailed reconstruction of this unusual event, verano said.

This year, prieto and verano expanded the dig and completed the study of children's remains excavated in 2011 with support from the national geographic society and the stone center for latin american studies at tulane. Their latest excavation uncovered numerous additional sacrificial victims, which will allow for a more detailed reconstruction of this unusual event, verano said. The researchers think that the sacrifice may have been an offering to the sea",

The agate scraper found at a rock shelter was below a 15,800-year-old layer of ash from mount st. Helens, making it potentially older than any other evidence of human occupation west of the rocky mountains, reports the ap. Analysis of the tool — which is made from orange agate not usually found in the area — revealed it had been used to butcher an animal believed to be the extinct buffalo species bison antiquus, ktvz reports. University of oregon archaeologist patrick o ' grady says the team plans to keep excavating the site after the \" tantalizing \" find, which may be older than any other find predating the clovis people once thought to be the first in north america, nbc news reports. University of washington professor of archaeology donald k.

            "Grants pass, ore. ( ap ) — archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western north america. The find was announced thursday by the u.s. Bureau of land management, which controls the land on which the site was found. University of oregon archaeologist patrick o ' grady, who supervises the dig, says the rimrock draw rockshelter outside riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of mount st. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. Bureau of land management archaeologist scott thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the rockies, and another predating the so-called clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from asia into north america. The earliest clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago.

Beneath the layer of volcanic ash, archaeologists discovered a small orange agate tool believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood.

She \" was so excited, \" recounts mom karin carpenter, who explains that after a holiday dinner of white rice and soy sauce — paige had \" extensive \" food allergies — her daughter got into the pool with her sister. Fewer than 15 minutes later, she was out of the pool, complaining of a stinging nose. Her condition quickly snowballed into something much more serious, involving difficulty breathing, and she was taken to the er. On dec. 4, after a week in a coma, the girl from roseville, calif., was taken off life support; it's still unclear what triggered the reaction, reports ktla. As carpenter writes on a gofundme page, she speculates about possible contributing factors: the plane, entering an environment full of allergens that were new to her, the area's large feral cat population, pesticide runoff in the pool from an adjacent golf course, or a bronchial spasm caused by the pool's temperature. The family is \" devastated, \" but sister violet is bringing healing, insisting that the family hang its christmas decorations because paige \" loves christmas. \" the gofundme campaign has raised more than $ 30,000 to date. The most heart-tugging line on the page, from carpenter's description of the events immediately after paige got out of the pool: \" she looked into my eyes and screamed, and said, ' mom, i ' m dying. I know i am because i can see it in your eyes. ' \" ( a teen's allergic reaction recently caused her to \" burn from the inside out. \" )",

One caver made it more than 1,000 feet in and found something wild: two stone rings up to 16 inches high intentionally made from pieces of chopped-up stalagmites ( pillar-shaped mineral deposits that stick up from the ground ), probably by neanderthals some 176,500 years ago, scientists now say. A press release notes \" until now the oldest formally proven cave use dated back only 38,000 years. \" while previous research had suggested the structures predated the arrival of modern humans in europe around 45,000 years ago, the ap reports the notion that neanderthals could have made them didn't fit long-held assumptions that these early humans were incapable of the kind of complex behavior necessary to work underground. \" their presence at [ 1,102 feet ] from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which can be considered a major step in human modernity, \" the researchers concluded in a study published online wednesday by the journal nature.

That turned out to be great news for japan's shibukawa animal park, which had a 121-pound aldabra giant tortoise named abuh escape earlier this month. Channel news asia reports abuh is allowed to wander around the zoo during operating hours. But on aug. 1, the 35-year-old tortoise wandered right on out, according to the asahi shimbun. Aldabra giant tortoises can survive for months without food or water, but the zoo was anxious to have abuh back and was offering a $ 4,500 reward for her safe return. The asahi shimbun reports abuh was returned wednesday after a family spotted her on a steep hill in a forest 160 feet or so from the zoo. But channel news asia states the tortoise was found in some bushes nearly 500 feet from the zoo. Regardless, abuh didn't make it far. The zoo says she appears healthy and has been eating pears and watermelon since her return. \" we were so relieved that she came back safely as she is so popular among children, \" zoo staffer yoshimi yamane says, per gizmodo. Yamane says the zoo will try to take steps to prevent abuh from escaping in the future, as this was actually her second disappearing act in a month.",

A new study — based on \" reconstructions \" of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges — finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the industrial revolution, reports usa today. \" we can say with 95 % probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries, \" the lead author tells the washington post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. Nasa puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100 — if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in proceedings of the national academy of sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the west antarctic ice sheet, which \" is hypothesized to be already underway. \" there's no surprise why: humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say. If not for humans, sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal \" nuisance \" floods in the us would have been avoided, according to climate central.

A police supply sales representative told officials about the order; zimmerman told them the gear was for his own safety. He called the infrared device \" an extra layer of security at the point of entry at his residence, \" the records say, via usa today. Zimmerman wore a gps ankle device during the period, which he often complained was uncomfortable, prompting authorities to adjust it. He and his wife moved at least three times last year, the records indicate, and he told police the couple would be changing their phone numbers after the media got hold of hers. Meanwhile, in accordance with directions, he phoned police every other day between 10am and noon to check in. At one point, deputies noted a trip to a sporting goods store and checked the store's surveillance video to ensure he hadn't entered the gun section.",

Usa today estimates that 40 % of non-defense federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, and the washington post has details on how the pentagon is scrambling to prepare. In short, it's a logistical mess, with about 400,000 civilian employees told they'd have to stay home unless a deal is reached. \"the planning itself is disruptive, \" says the defense department's comptroller. \"people are worrying right now about whether their paychecks are going to be delayed, rather than focusing fully on their mission. \"",

        "summary": "His public push to end sexual violence against children was so significant it reportedly nabbed him a nomination for the 2015 nobel peace prize. Joel davis ' private actions couldn't have been more contradictory, say police. The 22-year-old columbia university student, who started youth to end sexual violence before becoming chairman of a group of more than 5,000 human rights organizations, was arrested tuesday in manhattan on charges of child pornography and attempting to sexually exploit children, reports the columbia spectator. Davis allegedly responded to a post left by an undercover fbi agent on a \" fetish \" website, per the washington post. In a series of text messages, he admitted to past sexual experiences with children as young as infants, including a 13-year-old boy he met in june through the grindr app, police say. Showing \" the highest degree of hypocrisy, \" davis also tried to arrange meetings with children supposedly in the care of undercover agents, says the fbi's william f. Sweeney jr. \" as if this wasn't repulsive enough, davis allegedly possessed and distributed utterly explicit images of innocent infants and toddlers being sexually abused by adults. \" us attorney geoffrey s. Berman calls the development \" as unfathomable as it is sickening \" given that davis has rubbed elbows with angelina jolie, served as a youth ambassador for the un special representative on sexual violence in conflict, and is now leading the international campaign to stop rape and gender violence. Davis, who last year described being \" tormented by the recollection of my childhood sex abuse \" and spoke out about child rape in war zones in a 2014 huffington post op-ed, could face up to 70 years in prison.",

Then, anytime within the next 24 hours you can buy all three from amazon at 5 % off, to a maximum of $ 5 each. That might not sound like much, but as intomobile points out, amazon's prices are usually lower anyway, so that discount is something of a bonus.

Starting this saturday, users of amazon's price check app will be able to score up to $ 5 off a purchase of any product if they use the app in-store. Here's how it works: after waltzing into a brick-and-mortar retailer, whip out your iphone or android device ( with location services enabled ) and get to scanning those barcodes. After placing a desired item into the app's virtual basket, a 5 % discount will be applied to the product within 24 hours.

            "Not long after wrapping up their string of black friday/cyber monday deals, amazon has pulled back the curtain on yet another way they ' ll be snagging purchases away from physical retail outlets. Starting this saturday, users of amazon's price check app will be able to score up to $ 5 off a purchase of any product if they use the app in-store. Here's how it works: after waltzing into a brick-and-mortar retailer, whip out your iphone or android device ( with location services enabled ) and get to scanning those barcodes. After placing a desired item into the app's virtual basket, a 5 % discount will be applied to the product within 24 hours.

        "summary": "Puppy lovers, rejoice. Officials in eastern china last week canceled the jinhua hutou dog meat festival. If that name makes you a little queasy — well, there's good reason for that. The 600-year-old tradition saw at least 5,000 of dogs slaughtered on the spot, and served up as the main dish. As the story goes, the festival stemmed from a tradition begun in the 14th century, when the barking dogs that revealed an army's position were fed to the soldiers on the general's angry orders, reports the new york times. The ancient custom was scuttled following a web campaign staged by animal-rights advocates, who posted graphic images from past festivals of cooked dogs and leftover carcasses. The people's daily shares the observations of one blogger, \" i've seen the dogs being stabbed, strangled, and even beaten into comas and thrown into boiling water. \" some say it's an encouraging sign that, as pet ownership gains steam in china, so too does the animal-rights movement. But not everyone is on board. Wrote another blogger, \" i personally think dog meat is like alcohol. They are both components of our ancient chinese culture. \"",

        "summary": "What was unprecedented in april is now becoming... Routine? the leaders of north and south korea will meet again sometime in september, their third such meeting in five months, reports cnn. This time, however, the south's moon jae-in will travel to pyongyang to meet with kim jong un. High-level officials from the two nations announced the meeting after talks in the demilitarized zone on monday. No agenda has been released, but the two sides have been discussing everything from a possible peace declaration to economic projects, notes reuters. One potential sore spot: the plight of 12 north korean women now in south korea as restaurant workers. The north claims they were kidnapped — or perhaps tricked into defecting — and must be returned, while the south maintains they defected of their own accord in 2016 through china, per yonhap news. \" if our female citizens'repatriation issue is not resolved as quickly as possible, it could serve as an obstacle not just to the planned reunions of separated families between the two koreas but also to the overall inter-korean relations, \" said uriminzokkiri, a propaganda website for the north, last month. South korean officials declined to say if the issue came up in monday's talks.",

A spokesman for the prosecutor tells cleveland.com that the grand jury \" ultimately makes the charging decision in all fatal use of deadly force cases that involve law enforcement officers. \" in a statement to fox 8, the chief of the cleveland police patrolmen's association called the move an \" attempt to totally disrespect and disregard our justice system \" and warned such efforts would worsen the \" increasing lawlessness of an emboldened criminal element. \" ( ex-cop michael slager was indicted yesterday in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. )",

        "summary": "The weekend brought photos of tesla's first model 3 sedan to roll off the production line, but it wasn't all positive news for the automaker. The wall street journal on sunday posted an analysis of data out of hong kong that suggests just how severe an effect the reduction of a significant tax break for electric vehicles has had on tesla. The tax break had dropped the cost of a model s 60 to a roughly $ 73,000 price tag; under the new tax rules, it costs about $ 118,000, per quartz, which notes that elevated price is basically the same as buying a new mercedes-benz there. March was the last month where the electric vehicles were available at the lower effective price. Newly purchased teslas registered by first-time electric vehicle owners that month: 2,939. And in april: zero. And then in may: five. Tesla said in a statement that its \" business does not rely on \" favorable government policies, though its securities filings note it is not immune to the effects of changing such incentives. The journal notes tesla is working to get its vehicles into china, citing one gloomy quote on the subject from an analyst: \" hong kong is the fashionable china. It's not exactly painting a glowing picture for the future of tesla in china. \"",

The plunge in interest in tesla cars came after the government eliminated tax breaks for electric-vehicle ( ev ) owners, a policy that went into effect on april 1 and is expected to last until march next year. Now, the city has capped the tax waiver at hk$ 97,500 ( $ 12,500 ) on private evs, and is only applicable to first-time owners.

Uk officials have approved the drug nalmefene for use along with counseling to help reduce alcohol dependency, the international business times reports. The official approval means people who fit the right profile can request the prescription drug. \" those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services, and taking part in therapy programs, \" says a researcher. Nalmefene, which can be taken once a day, helps people feel less of an urge to drink, experts say. It's considered appropriate for many people drinking the equivalent of at least half a bottle of wine daily, the guardian reports. Plenty of potential candidates to take the drug \" probably don't even recognize themselves as an alcoholic, \" says a health official, who compares it to a nicotine patch. But since nalmefene is intended to be used to gradually reduce alcohol intake, it's not a good solution for people who need to quit right away, the guardian notes.",

Experts say the drug reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. The national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) has published formal guidance recommending nalmefene, following draft guidance released in october, which means that patients have the right to request the drug if they meet certain requirements. Nalmefene, also called selincro, is suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the world health organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women. It helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake and is therefore not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop immediately. The pill costs £ 3, can be taken up to once a day, and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink. Lyndsey dudley, a spokeswoman for nice, said the drug would be suitable for people who \"probably don't even recognise themselves as an alcoholic \".

Nalmefene is available from today and costs £ 42.42 for a 14-tablet pack, or about £ 3 a day. Around 35,000 people are expected to be given nalmefene in the first year. Professor carole longson, director from nice health technology evaluation centre, said: \" many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem.

The doj's civil rights division penned a letter friday asking maricopa county, the state's most populous, to determine if federal law was violated regarding, among other things, the number and location of polling sites ( the county cut them from 200 to 60 in 2012 in an apparent bid to save money ). The justice department's reason for this request: reports of \" disproportional burden in waiting times … in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations, \" the letter noted. Those waiting times were incredibly inconvenient: the ap notes that some voters waited nearly six hours, with the last vote cast at almost 1am at one site; polls had closed at 7pm, but voters already in line at that point were allowed to cast ballots. Poll workers even reportedly brought pizza to hungry voters. Maricopa county has until april 22 to respond to the doj's letter, which included 10 specific requests for information, including polling locations, procedures, and response to public backlash, the arizona republic reports. \" we are going to gather the information … and we will make it public, \" the county elections director says. Despite these issues, arizona's secretary of state certified the primary results on monday, calling it for donald trump and hillary clinton, per the ap.

Contrary to the long-standing belief that caffeine may cause heart palpitations that can lead to heart failure, new research in the journal of the american heart association suggests the claim is, well, rubbish. Researchers surveyed 1,388 people with an average age of 72 about their caffeine consumption, reports nbc news. Some 61 % of participants said they consumed some amount of coffee, tea, or chocolate daily. After looking for premature ventricular and atrial contractions in the heart, scientists concluded there was no link between caffeine consumption and heart palpitations, heart fluttering, or other irregular heartbeat patterns, even among those who consumed a lot of caffeine each day. \" clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent disturbances of the heart's cardiac rhythm should be reconsidered, as we may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate, coffee, and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits, \" says the lead author of the study from the university of california-san francisco. Current aha guidelines suggest that a patient with extra heartbeats avoid caffeine, which can worsen the problem, notes cbs san francisco.

        "summary": "\" this is a tragedy that no community should have to experience, \" charleston police chief greg mullen told reporters after a mass shooting at a historic black church left nine people dead. \" i do believe this was a hate crime, \" he says of the attack, which is believed to have been carried out by a young white man who is still at large. The president of the charleston naacp tells the post and courier that a survivor says the gunman briefly sat down in the emanuel ame church before opening fire on a prayer meeting, but at a news conference this morning, mullen said the shooter stuck around for almost an hour before the shooting began, the ap reports. Mullen also distributed a surveillance video of a possible suspect and vehicle, and added that the victims were six females and three males. The naacp chief says the gunman told one woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened. \" it is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives, \" mullen told reporters. \" i can assure you that we're going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up and to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else. \" mayor joe riley called the suspect \" one hateful person, \" describing the shooting as \" the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine. \" in other developments: helicopters are circling charleston in the search for the suspect, who's described as a white male, around 21 years old, slender, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, and timberland boots, the guardian reports. Police say he is \" obviously extremely dangerous. \" state sen. Clementa pinckney, the church's pastor, was in the church at the time of the attack, and state house minority leader todd rutherford tells the ap that the lawmaker was among those killed. The 41-year-old \" never had anything bad to say about anybody, even when i thought he should, \" rutherford says. \" he was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody. \" the post and courier has more on the history of the church, which it calls the \" spiritual home to one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of baltimore, \" and which many in the city call \" mother emanuel. \" its roots go back to 1816, and it was burned after one of its founders tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Members went underground until after the civil war,",

The nominee, philip bilden, a former military intelligence officer who ran the hong kong branch of a private equity firm, said in a statement that he had informed defense secretary jim mattis that he did not want to continue to seek confirmation a month after he had been named for the post. It was the latest case in which wealthy businesspeople whom mr. Trump has favored for government jobs have been tripped up by the demands of avoiding conflicts of interest. On feb. 3, vincent viola, a billionaire wall street trader and mr. Trump's choice for secretary of the army, withdrew because he decided it was too difficult to detach himself from his business interests.

            "President trump's nominee for secretary of the navy withdrew from consideration on sunday, saying that meeting the government's ethics guidelines would require too great a financial sacrifice. The nominee, philip bilden, a former military intelligence officer who ran the hong kong branch of a private equity firm, said in a statement that he had informed defense secretary jim mattis that he did not want to continue to seek confirmation a month after he had been named for the post. It was the latest case in which wealthy businesspeople whom mr. Trump has favored for government jobs have been tripped up by the demands of avoiding conflicts of interest. On feb. 3, vincent viola, a billionaire wall street trader and mr. Trump's choice for secretary of the army, withdrew because he decided it was too difficult to detach himself from his business interests. Mr. Bilden said in a statement that he fully supported the president's agenda.

According to npr, the raids were the first since president trump signed a jan. 26 executive order on undocumented immigrants. That order redefined \" criminal alien, \" expanding the definition beyond the couple million \" bad hombres \" the president mentioned during the campaign to include undocumented immigrants who are only suspected of a crime or those who've committed low-level offenses, such as using a fake social security number to get a job, the hill reports. All last week, homes and businesses were raided in broad daylight — a change in tactic from the obama administration that one government aide says is possibly meant to \" send a message \" under trump. Immigrant advocates are also reporting that ice agents are stopping immigrants at random or going door to door in minority-heavy neighborhoods to ask for ids, though ice denies these tactics. There have also reportedly been major raids in kansas, texas, florida, and virginia. Many advocates see this week as punishment for sanctuary cities and an attempt to \" instill fear \" in immigrants. And while officials maintain they're targeting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records, advocates say it doesn't help their case that the first deportation under trump was a \" working mom with two us kids. \"",

Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \" shutdown, \" thus basically flipping the switch from \" off \" back to \" on. \" proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, sky news reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with parkinson's disease.

An international team of scientists studying antarctica's emperor penguin population is calling for the birds to be reclassified as \" endangered \" after finding that, if sea ice continues to melt at its current rate, all of the continent's penguin populations will be in decline by 2100, with the total population down 19 % from today's numbers; the researchers project two-thirds of the 45 known colonies will drop to less than half their current size. They're calling for the establishment of marine reserves to help protect the penguins. Writing in the journal nature climate change, the researchers say there will at first be an increase in the current total of 600,000 penguins due to a recent increase in sea ice, phys.org reports — algae grows under the ice, which sustains the krill that the penguins eat. But one expert explains that too much ice elongates the females ' march to the sea to obtain food; not enough ice, and waves could fracture colonies come spring. Most of the planet's 18 types of penguins are dropping in population size, reports reuters, with only king, adelie, and chinstrap thought to be increasing.

The report urged governments to list the birds as endangered, even though populations in 45 known colonies were likely to rise slightly by 2050 before declining. Such a listing could impose restrictions on tourism and fishing companies. The study is the first to project the long-term outlook for antarctica's largest penguins, which can grow 1.2 meters ( four ft ) tall, seeking to fill a gap in understanding climate change and wildlife in one of the remotest parts of the planet. Overall, numbers were set to fall by at least 19 percent from current levels by 2100 as sea ice melts.

Play facebook twitter embed trump under fire over'tapes'threat as white house searches for new fbi director 3: 03 comey's ouster means that the senate will have to confirm a new director to replace him, a process that has already shown signs of controversy as democrats are demanding more answers about the timing of the firing and the fbi's investigation into possible ties between the trump campaign and russia. A host of democrats have said that they won't consider a new replacement to lead the fbi until a special counsel has been appointed to oversee that investigation, which comey was leading. \"frankly we should hold off on the fbi director until we get this special prosecutor, \" said sen. Mark warner, d-virginia, the top democrat on the intelligence committee, indicating that he would try to slow down or block the confirmation of any fbi director. The bombshell that shook washington this week has further strained a slow-moving senate schedule that is void of any major legislative achievement. For the first months of this year, the upper chamber has been consumed with processing trump's nominees — including the successful confirmation of supreme court justice neil gorsuch — as well as gop-backed congressional review act measures to roll-back regulation from the obama administration. The senate has moved slowly, in part because of its rules,"

Judith gan, 64, went into rashmi patel's office on feb. 17 of last year for a full-mouth extraction, during which 20 teeth would be removed and implants would be inserted. But during the procedure, patel allegedly ignored the sedated woman's worsening condition — even though the low-oxygen alarm went off multiple times, gan started gurgling, wheezing, and changing color, and one of patel's assistants \" begged \" him to stop working on her, inspectors say. The assistant finally called 911, but by then gan had stopped breathing and \" flat-lined, \" according to a health inspectors'report. She was declared dead at a hospital; patel has also been charged with evidence tampering. Gan had health problems, including a heart attack six months prior to her death and two strokes in the two years prior, the monitor daily reports; she was also on medication that could have interfered with sedation. \" that's of course an issue into whether she should have been sedated in the first place, \" the gan family lawyer says, per fox connecticut. But, he adds, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy \" ruled out a lot of potential problems as causes of her death. Her pre-existing things did not... Suddenly occur and cause her to die. \" officials also say patel, 45, should not have planned so many procedures at once. The dental commission declined to revoke his license, but it did put him on five years of probation and banned him from performing sedation, the hartford courant reports. He has previously been accused of failing to monitor a sedated patient who choked on gauze but survived, the ap reports, as well as other problems.

If she's a girl, her name will probably include \" diana. \" but it most likely won't be her first name, just one of many, the atlantic wire points out. Europe's largest betting firm is already taking bets, reports people. Kate will probably breastfeed the little one. That might seem obvious, but up until princess diana, british royals typically used wet nurses. There may ( or may not ) be a nanny. But just one, and any royal siblings may share. ( a far cry from the two to four nannies per child some american celebrities use. ) however, sources tell the daily beast that kate plans to be a full-time mom and doesn't want a nanny, an idea that initially shocked prince charles. She may, however, have a maternity nurse for the first few weeks. Speaking of royal siblings, kate may be having twins. Medical experts say hyperemesis gravidarum, the severe form of morning sickness that caused kate to be hospitalized, is linked to having twins, radar reports. Kate wants her child to lead as \" normal \" a life as possible. Even so, that \" normal \" life will likely include a $ 2 million wardrobe in the first year alone, according to an expert who has dressed royals in other countries. But another expert notes that those clothes will probably be \" sensible, \" and that royal babies are typically brought up with \" few parties, not too many toys, and very dull meals. \"",
