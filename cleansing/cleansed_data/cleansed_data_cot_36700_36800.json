During a white house event on friday with a strong statement: \" no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal. \" but as usa today notes, headlines about trump using the term \" shithole countries \" about certain nations during an immigration meeting threatened to overshadow the moment. The president ignored questions about the incident during the event, but there were plenty of other developments: to clarify: jake tapper of cnn reports that trump referred to african nations as \" shithole countries \" but did not use the term about haiti. Trump did, however, ask, \" why do we need more haitians? \" and asked that they be taken out of any immigration deal. The two different trump remarks have been conflated a bit, perhaps explaining why trump specifically denied saying anything \" derogatory \" about haiti. Senator's view: tim scott of south carolina, the lone black republican in the senate, says he spoke to sen. Lindsey graham, who attended the meeting, and graham told him the \" shithole countries \" stories are \" basically accurate, \" reports the post and courier. If so, that's \" incredibly disappointing, \" says scott, adding that america's strength is the \" ability to weave together multiple communities for one nation. \" ( democrat dick durbin also confirmed that trump used the term. )",

For more on how vulture figured it out, click here — or read on for the top five: robert downey jr.: his success is particularly striking, seeing as he was \"nearly unhireable \" just 10 years ago. Will smith: if he's attached to a project, \"it ' ll get made and be a hit. \" he'd probably be no. 1 on the list if he'd made more movies recently. Johnny depp: this once-outsider is now decidedly mainstream, and the pirates franchise has done particularly well for him. Denzel washington: sure, he's not as \"flashy \" as the top three on this list, but he's consistent — all of his last 10 films, save one, grossed in excess of $ 50 million.

Authorities are today expected to make arrests involving a huge cyberfraud ring in which thieves hacked into more than 1,000 stubhub accounts, reports the ap. The stubhub site itself wasn't hacked, according to a company spokesman: instead, cyberthieves broke into other websites and pilfered customer data, then used passwords and login info to make fraudulent ticket purchases for events through stubhub. Neither the company nor law enforcement has indicated the exact amount that was allegedly stolen or how many arrests are imminent, but the stubhub spokesman did note to reuters that the scheme involved multiple countries. It was a \" pretty intense network of cyber fraudsters working in concert with each other, \" he says. This news is likely to prove worrisome to consumers, who have already faced security breaches at target, neiman marcus, and ebay itself.

Seems bill koch — the twin of david koch and younger brother of charles koch who left the family business after a lengthy legal battle — stands accused of imprisoning an exec at his own oxbow corporation. Kirby martensen has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that bill koch lured him to his remote aspen ranch, interrogated him at length, and held him against his will. Martensen says an anonymous letter accusing him of defrauding oxbow prompted the company to review his email, which revealed his skepticism at what the huffpo calls the company's \" tax avoidance strategies. \" he describes the ordeal at koch's ranch in length, then says he was fired and forced to fly to san francisco aboard a private plane with a man he believed was armed ( perhaps not coincidentally, he's suing in not-very-koch-friendly san fran ). A koch rep confirms they investigated and fired martensen, and says oxbow is \" pursuing appropriate action. \" bill koch, perhaps best known for bankrolling the boat that won the 1992 america's cup, is the only defendant in martensen's lawsuit.",

Us and canadian researchers led by eli puterman of the university of british columbia have been studying the length of telomeres, the dna-protein caps at the ends of chromosomes that inevitably shorten as we age and whose lengths are linked to age-related diseases. Puterman compares telomeres to the plastic tips that keep shoelaces from fraying, only here they protect genes from degrading, reports healthday. And while stressful events in adulthood don't seem to have an impact on telomere length, every childhood trauma appears to up the risk of having shorter telomeres by 11 %. To test this, puterman and his team reviewed the health records of 4,600 people drawn from the larger us health and retirement study, which has been surveying adults over age 50 biannually since 1992. Telomere lengths were measured via saliva swabs, and volunteers provided details ranging from weight, smoking history, and education to financial and social traumas in childhood and adulthood, including a parent losing a job, child abuse, and parental drug addiction. Time notes that the exact mechanism at play remains unknown, but that the \" striking and disturbing \" correlation between childhood trauma and shortened telomeres could involve the epigenome, which regulates gene expression. The researchers stress that they've found a link, not a cause. ( drinking soda is also linked to shorter telomeres. )",

Maria chappelle-nadal wrote during a facebook exchange on her personal, non-public page thursday morning. The democrat preceded it by writing that she'd likely get a visit from the secret service, and the kansas city star reports that the agency is indeed investigating. It seems that pretty much every top political leader in the state from both parties has called on her to resign, but chappelle-nadal says she will not do so. \" i am not resigning, \" she tells the st. Louis post-dispatch. \" what i said was wrong, but i am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across america are feeling right now. \" among the critics calling for her to step down are republican gov. Eric greitens and democratic sen. Claire mccaskill, who called the comment \" outrageous. \" joining in the condemnation is democratic us rep. William lacy clay, who called chappelle-nadal \" an embarrassment to our state. \" chappelle-nadal quickly deleted the post, and she now says she didn't mean it. But she adds that she was \" very frustrated \" over the president's response to the charlottesville violence, pointing out that the city of ferguson, which she represents, just marked the three-year anniversary of the michael brown shooting. Charlottesville, she said, \" is worse than even ferguson. \" asked by kmox if she would apologize for the assassination post, she said she would apologize when trump apologized.",

Johnsonville was a robust mill community in the 19th century, but it is now abandoned and up for sale at auction.com. Bids start at $ 800,000, and the top one will get a 62-acre site that includes a large family home, a general store, a chapel, a wooden dam, and a covered bridge. A millionaire named ray schmitt bought the site in the 1960s and \" began restoring it to its former grandeur, \" explains a press release about the sale. He set about moving quaint new england structures into the village in the apparent hope of creating a tourist attraction on the former mill site, reports the hartford courant. It never quite took off, however. Schmitt died in 1998 and various development plans have fizzled over the years, leading to the current auction. The village, located within east haddam, has eight structures in all. As with any self-respecting ghost town, rumors of hauntings abound — with some saying the spirit of schmitt himself remained ( to see his dream through ) and others claiming the spirits of mill workers haunt one home, reports the connecticut post. Who definitely has been there: hollywood. The press release notes the buildings have featured in films like freedom ( which starred cuba gooding, jr. ); the location was also used in billy joel's \" river of dreams \" video. Bidding gets underway on oct. 28, just in time for halloween. ( click to read about a home sale that included a $ 122,000 cat. )",

Scarface, whom neighbors tell wfts had only been adopted a month earlier, attacked the 52-year-old, at which point her husband ismael ran out to try to help. Their son antoine harris, 22, next jumped in with a knife and stabbed the dog in the head and neck before all three fled the backyard and into the house and called police.

Health officials would then question family, friends, and anyone else who may have come into contact with the patient, possibly isolating and testing them as well. Hospital workers in garb designed to protect them from bodily fluids would run tests on the quarantined patient, paying special attention to equipment and clothing sterilization and proper disposal techniques.

Lately, you've probably seen a couple of your facebook friends post the results of a quiz app that figures out your most-used words in statuses. Or maybe you posted it yourself. It looks something like this: the \"quiz, \" created by a company called vonvon.me, has risen to over 16 million shares in a matter of days. It's been written about in the independent, cosmopolitan, and elitedaily. Sounds fun, right? wrong. That's over 16 million people who agreed to give up almost every private detail about themselves to a company they likely know nothing about. \"ooo! if i click here and auth in with facebook it ' ll scan my entire year of posts, store the data and tell my most used words. Sign me up! \" — saved you a click ( @savedyouaclick ) november 19, 2015 the app, like many facebook quiz apps, is a privacy nightmare.

Just 10 days after their sept. 17 wedding, the british woman awoke on her honeymoon in mexico with \" terrible sickness and diarrhea with funny sounds coming from her throat, \" her mom tells the telegraph. Fensome, 54 — who had eaten grouper the previous night, per the sun — was rushed to a hospital, where she died within 10 minutes. The cause: ciguatera poisoning — an illness caused by eating contaminated reef fish — which caused her to have a heart attack, her brother says; fatal cases are rare. Experts explain a toxin produced naturally by algae and found primarily in the caribbean, hawaii, and central america is consumed by small reef fish, which are eaten by larger reef fish like snapper and amberjack that make their way onto dinner plates. A study notes cooking doesn't eliminate the toxin, usually concentrated in organs or viscera; it can lead to months of nasty symptoms from poor circulation to shooting pains. Though as many as 50,000 cases of ciguatera poisoning may occur annually — the number is expected to spike as the algae moves into the gulf of mexico and us southeast atlantic — information about this \" hidden death sentence...

        "summary": "In 1918, the double whammy of world war i and the worldwide flu pandemic drove down american life expectancy for a third year in a row. A century later, another triple-year decline has been recorded — and this time, suicide and drug overdoses are major causes. According to the centers for disease control and prevention's annual report, us life expectancy dropped to 78 years and 7 months in 2017, down around a month from the year before, the ap reports. Men could expect to live 76.1 years, and women 81.1. Public health experts called the statistics alarming, noting that early deaths among middle-aged people did the most to bring life expectancy down. After 22 years of steady rises, life expectancy dropped in 2015 and again in 2016, though it will need to drop a lot more to reach the level of 1918, when life expectancy was 39. \" these sobering statistics are a wake-up call that we are losing too many americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable, \" cdc director robert redfield said in a statement. Another cdc report found that the number of drug overdose deaths rose almost 6,600 in 2017 to 70,237, cnn reports. The suicide rate rose to its highest in at least 50 years, with rates much higher in rural counties than in urban ones. Another factor was a harsh flu season. Experts say they find it worrying that in the us, life expectancy is going in a different direction than in most developed nations. \" life expectancy is improving in many places in the world. It shouldn't be declining in the united states, \" joshua sharfstein at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health tells the washington post. ( a recent study predicted that by 2040, there will be 63 countries with higher life expectancy than the us. )",

While that number is down from 1.3 billion in 1990, it still leaves far too many who \" defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies, with no dignity or privacy, \" says the study. The practice puts them at risk for a wide range of health problems, including cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis a, and typhoid, and it's especially dangerous for young children. India is the worst offender, with an estimated 600 million public defecators, but the report also singles out sub-saharan africa because it has 26 nations where the practice is increasing. In nigeria, for instance, the un estimates 39 million public defecators, up from 23 million in 1990. The report says a big part of the problem is that people don't understand the health risks, as evidenced by unused latrines put into place by unicef in various poor nations.

( ap ) — authorities searched monday for a 13-year-old girl they believe is in danger after her parents were found dead in their western wisconsin home. Deputies went to the home in barron after dispatchers received a 911 call from an unknown person at around 1 a.m. Monday, barron county sheriff chris fitzgerald said. He said they found the bodies of jayme closs ' parents, though he didn't release their names. He also said there had been gunshots, but he stopped short of saying that's how the couple died. Investigators don't have any leads or suspects, but they have enlisted the help of the national center for missing and exploited children and the fbi, which has agents who specialize in missing children cases, the sheriff said.

Well, it only took two days for another journalist to identify this shadowy hero. The ap article had said the man was just outside the frame in the famous white house situation room photo. But the intelligence blog cryptome noticed that his yellow tie wasn't cropped out, and soon found his face in other shots on the white house flickr feed. He even showed up in a photo with leon panetta two days later, wearing the same tie. The next day, an observer reporter showed the picture to a friend, who recognized john from his days playing college basketball. The paper soon found the man's name, address, even gpa. When they called the cia, sources urged them not to publish it, saying john had been devastated by the article, and scared for his family. Two days later, a government official said john has been changed from an overt employee to a covert one — making it a crime to leak his identity to the press.

        "summary": "A closely watched trial about the modern west and the freedom of ranchers to use federal land begins monday in las vegas. The big name involved is rancher cliven bundy, who led an armed standoff in nevada against federal agents in 2014 over unpaid grazing fees. His adult sons also face charges. Some coverage: seventeen men are charged, and three separate trials are planned. Jury selection for the first six begins monday. The bundys themselves will be in the second round. Courthouse news has details on the legal process. The ap has background on bundy's standoff, explaining how it has its roots in a decades-long dispute between western ranchers and the feds over land rights. Read it here. This previous story in the atlantic lays out the beliefs of bundy, who doesn't recognize federal authority over the land in question. These trials are about far more than just one family; they're about a movement, one sure to be emboldened if the men are acquitted, writes a columnist at the las vegas sun. In fact, two of bundy's sons were acquitted in october after another standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in oregon. Prosecutors have a big potential problem: an unrelated ethics investigation into a federal agent who plays a key role in the bundy case could upend the prosecution, reports the arizona republic. Juror identities are secret, but the las vegas review-journal is trying to change that. High country news has a primer on the bundy case, including links to background pieces here. After the standoff ended, bundy came under fire for his comment that african-americans might be better off as slaves.",

Putting that theory into practice, however, already has landed young a jail sentence for practicing medicine without a licence — and last week it cost him $ 105 million in a civil suit, reports nbc san diego. A former patient named dawn kali sued young after she underwent his regimen of baking soda infusions and colonic therapy in the hope that it would cure her breast cancer and allow her to avoid chemo and radiation. Instead, her cancer grew, and she eventually turned to a medical oncologist. The mother of four, now with stage 4 cancer, accused young of negligence, and a jury needed only about three hours to agree. \" i hope that this sends him the message that he will not be able to profit off of hurting other people, \" says kali's attorney. The award — more than double what kali asked for — includes $ 1 million for medical expenses, about $ 89 million for pain and suffering, and $ 15 million in punitive damages. \"it's totally outrageous, \" says young, who was sentenced last year to nearly four years for practicing medicine illegally. He also says it is \" appalling \" that kali got so much more than she sought, especially since she knew he was not a medical doctor. Kali's new doctor says she has between three and four years to live.

Per a press release, university of bristol scientists who conducted a meta-analysis of thousands of studies say there's a \" surprisingly limited \" amount of evidence that shows light drinking — 32 grams per week, the equivalent of four units ( basically two small drinks ) — has any detrimental effect on infants. Researchers sifted through almost 5,000 abstracts from 1950 to 2016, finding 26 observational studies relevant to how light drinking may be tied to pregnancy complications, birth characteristics, and developmental delays. The findings: consuming up to four alcoholic units weekly while pregnant was tied to an 8 % higher risk of having a small baby compared with abstaining, though an imperial college london obstetrics expert notes to the guardian there may be \" other possible explanations \" for this elevated risk. A less-clear link to light drinking was a somewhat heightened risk of early birth. But an expert tells sky news that although the findings may ease the minds of women who accidentally consumed alcohol while pregnant, \" our advice as health professionals must be the safest option is to avoid alcohol \" altogether.

Ambassador to afghanistan karl w. Eikenberry brief reporters ahead of afghan president... ( associated press ) an article out this week in \" rolling stone \" magazine depicts gen. Stanley mcchrystal as a lone wolf on the outs with many important figures in the obama administration and unable to convince even some of his own soldiers that his strategy can win the war. A band of mcchrystal's profane, irreverent aides are quoted mocking vice president joe biden and richard holbrooke, the special u.s. Representative for afghanistan and pakistan. Mcchrystal himself is described by an aide as \" disappointed \" in his first oval office meeting with an unprepared president barack obama. The article says that although mcchrystal voted for obama, the two failed to connect from the start. Obama called mcchrystal on the carpet last fall for speaking too bluntly about his desire for more troops.",
            "By michael hastings this article appears in rs 1108/1109 from july 8-22, 2010, on newsstands friday, june 25. ' how'd i get screwed into going to this dinner? \" demands gen. Stanley mcchrystal. It's a thursday night in mid-april, and the commander of all u.s. And nato forces in afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the hôtel westminster in paris. He's in france to sell his new war strategy to our nato allies – to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually have allies. Since mcchrystal took over a year ago, the afghan war has become the exclusive property of the united states. Opposition to the war has already toppled the dutch government, forced the resignation of germany's president and sparked both canada and the netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. Mcchrystal is in paris to keep the french, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him. \" the dinner comes with the position, sir, \" says his chief of staff, col. Charlie flynn. Mcchrystal turns sharply in his chair. \" hey, charlie, \" he asks, \" does this come with the position? \" mcchrystal gives him the middle finger. [ asset ] the general stands and looks around the suite"

Given the arcing trajectory of the rock, \" it's almost like catching a football, but you don't want to catch this football, \" he told cnn. A day later, however, he briefly took his eye off the ball. While chatting on a cell phone on a balcony of a neighbor's home he was defending from the lava, clinton was hit with a flying lava bomb that broke two bones in his leg and left his ankle hanging \" like a hinge, \" reports nbc news. \"'that didn't just happen ' was my first thought, \" he now says, per cnn. \" i knew it was real because of the pain … it was the most extreme force i ever felt in my life. \" while a neighbor put out flames from the lava bomb — launched as \" a direct line-drive, \" according to clinton, rather than the more typical arc — he was rushed to a hospital, where he remained tuesday. \" i thought i was gonna bleed out, \" he says, though his ex-wife tells cnn the scalding rock may have actually cauterized his wound. Still, the california native, who has lived in hawaii for 12 years, won't be able to put weight on his injured leg, fitted with a metal rod, for at least six weeks, per khon. But like most hawaiians, clinton isn't complaining. \" for the most part, we've enjoyed the whole time — front row seats to every aspect of a lava flow you can imagine, \" he says about his quest to defend homes. \" it's just been amazing. \" ( thanks to the kilauea volcano, hawaii is also battling a toxic steam cloud. )",

The 79-year-old liquor store clerk had chased after a man in a black mask who stole $ 300 worth of scratch-off lottery tickets on oct. 27 and was knocked to the ground as the perpetrator sped away. \" it shook up the plaza, \" an officer tells the palm beach post. Arezoumandifar was the previous owner of the store and had stayed on after its sale to help the new owners get started, reports the sun sentinel. During his last shift on sunday, family members gathered to prepare a celebratory dinner. But arezoumandifar never showed. A customer found the man dead of a single gunshot wound behind the store's counter around 8pm. A surveillance camera failed to capture the crime, but police say arezoumandifar was shot while behind the counter. The cash register was found empty. Police aren't saying whether sunday's crime has any link to the october robbery. In that incident, police traced the stolen lottery tickets to a couple, who face charges over another robbery at a 7-eleven. The man is in jail, but the woman was questioned and is considered a person of interest, police say. \" it's very sad, \" says a woman who works nearby, adding arezoumandifar spoke little english but would kiss her hand to say hello. \" i ' m begging of anybody who knows anything to come forward, \" arezoumandifar's daughter tells wpbf. \" he didn't deserve the way he died. \" ( another case of tragic timing, this time involving a wedding. )",

But a new study suggests it isn't actually the taste of the food that we crave, but rather a reminder of an emotional bond we shared with the person who made the dish for us in our youth. University of buffalo researcher shira gabriel explains in a press release that \" comfort foods are often the foods that our caregivers gave us when we were children. \" after about 100 participants tracked their feelings and eating habits in a diary for two weeks, gabriel and her team found those with positive associations with their caregivers or parents tended to chow down on comfort foods more often when feeling sad or lonely. \" you don't think ' i ' m having mac and cheese today because i ' m feeling lonely and i need my mom, ' \" she tells the washington post, \" but that's actually part of what's happening. \" researchers also conducted an experiment: they reminded half of the participants of a time they felt lonely or isolated, but gave the other half of the group no such reminder. When all were served potato chips, those who had revisited feelings of loneliness reported enjoying the snack more than the others. \" comfort food is especially appealing when we're lonely, \" says gabriel. \" but if you didn't really get along with your parents, these sorts of foods probably aren't going to make you feel better. \" she says the study explains why people eat certain foods even if they're dieting or already full. The trouble is, \" although comfort food will never break your heart, it might destroy your diet, \" gabriel says. In a previous study, gabriel found people tend to eat soup when they feel lonely, perhaps because it brings back memories of being sick and cared for by someone when they were young. ( another study found comfort food isn't actually comforting. )",

Maduro — who said tuesday that the revised workweek would last at least two weeks, per reuters — has blamed the energy problems on erratic weather caused by el nino, including a drought. \" we are requesting international help, technical and financial aid to help revert the situation, \" he said, per the bbc. \" we are managing the situation in the best possible way while we wait for the rains to return. \" opposition members, though, blame \" mismanagement and corruption, \" cnn notes, and the new york times reports an electoral panel has started the process to allow maduro to be removed from office. \" maduro says that ' we in government don't stop working for a second.

She's sampled dirt from tropical forests to deserts around the world and found it \" teeming with so many different types of organisms, \" she tells npr. She also found something pretty unexpected when she and nine other scientists invaded central park recently and collected 596 samples of dirt. After extracting the dna, her team had 167,000 varieties of microbes — count every mammal on the planet then multiply that number by 30 — 80 % of which were unknown to science, the washington post reports. As national geographic puts it, that's \" microbial richness on a scale we can barely understand. \" that microbial richness actually isn't so rare. Essentially, \" there's as much biodiversity in the soils \" of central park's 843 acres as ramirez's team has found in soils \" from the arctic to antarctica, \" she says. The fact that the study found that soil diversity at \" a single urban location matches that observed across natural ecosystems spanning multiple biomes and continents, \" however, was surprising. But there's an explanation. Central park features numerous plants and animals and has been treated with fertilizer and chemicals. There is also \" a high level of species that are considered potential human pathogens, \" national geographic reports. In general, though, soil is just that complex.

At the end of the day, they had compiled a catalog of 836 species of plants and animals. It's impressive that central park – an 843-acre island in an ocean of manhattan concrete – can play host to so many species. But that's hardly a complete inventory of the biodiversity of the place. Along with its plants and animals, central park is home to invisible wildlife too. The ground swarms with invertebrates, fungi, and a wealth of microbes.

It's possible to distinguish between the five species of turtles in the central park's turtle pond just by looking at them. But if you dig up a patch of dirt by the pond and look at the bacteria it contains, they might well look like just a bunch of rods and spheres. The diversity of microbes is instead a matter of chemistry. They have evolved a staggering range of ways to break down molecules and grow on them. In recent years, scientists have developed powerful new tools for measuring that diversity. Rather than looking at feathers or stripes, they look at dna. A team of researchers has now used this approach to carry out a sort of microbioblitz in central park. They marched their way systematically through the park, and every fifty 50 yards or so, they stopped, bent down, and scooped up some dirt. All told, they gathered 596 scoops.

To be more precise, they plucked out different versions of that stretch, each carried by a different species. The scientists then looked at the sequence of each of those versions.

Smithsonian curator nicholas pyenson and researcher alexandra boersma were presumably going about their business when — in boersma's words — \" this beautiful little skull from alaska \" jumped out at them, according to a press release. The 9-inch partial skull had been in the smithsonian's collections since it was discovered in 1951, but it had never been properly studied. Pyenson and boersma rectified that, making a shocking discovery: the skull belonged to a brand new genus and species of dolphin, which they dubbed arktocara yakataga. They published their findings tuesday in peerj. The long-extinct arktocara yakataga lived 25 million years ago and is related to the highly endangered south asian river dolphin. Gizmodo calls the south asian river dolphin the \" weirdest dolphin on earth. \" it swims on its side, has a long beak, and can't see, instead using echolocation to find its way around. Boersma says it's \" kind of mind-boggling \" to find a relative of the south asian river dolphin all the way up in alaska. She and pyenson plan on digging for more arktocara yakataga fossils next year. They believe the new species could teach us more about the evolution of both dolphins and whales.

        "summary": "Lawmakers are calling for an investigation into possible \" political interference \" amid accusations that the justice department is pushing for the sale of cnn before it will approve at&t's merger with time warner. Sources tell politico the doj gave the companies an \" ultimatum \" monday demanding they drop either at&t's directv or time warner's turner broadcasting, which includes networks cnn, tbs, and tnt. But \" it's all about cnn, \" a source tells the financial times. The fear is that president trump — who vowed to block the $ 85 million deal in an october 2016 speech — is intervening to target the \" fake news \" network he's used as a punching bag throughout much of his presidency, an idea backed by trump's suggestion last month that news outlets should be punished. The white house and doj's antitrust division say there's been no white house interference. Indeed, doj officials say the companies offered to sell cnn and the doj rejected the plan. But at&t ceo randall stephenson says they \" never offered to sell cnn and have no intention of doing so. \" while there are bipartisan concerns that the deal would create a too-powerful mega group, a court battle is now likely if the merger is rejected. \" any indication that this administration is using its power to weaken media organizations it doesn't like would be a profoundly disturbing development, \" says sen. Al franken, while sen. Brian schatz wants an investigation, per the hill. Both are democrats; fellow dem richard blumenthal, however, says cnn's sale may be \" necessary, \" noting \" the doj seems to be doing its job. \"",

In fact, turkey plans to ask nato for the right to place the missiles on syria's border, reuters reports. British prime minister david cameron, touring a syrian refugee camp in jordan, said officials will work directly with rebels to help \" shape the opposition \" — politically, not militarily — for a future transition of power. Turkey, the us, britain, and france are already set to sit down with syria's opposition groups tomorrow in doha, qatar — no word yet, however, on whether that meeting will include rebel fighters. Cameron said syrian president bashar al-assad's safe exit \" could be arranged \" with immunity as part of a transition of power, reuters reports. Cameron \" would favor him facing the full force of international law, \" but \" if he wants to leave he could leave, that could be arranged. \" meanwhile, fighting escalated in damascus today, with the free syrian army taking responsibility for mortar attacks that rocked government strongholds, reports the new york times. Rebels also reported regime airstrikes and shelling in the suburbs and clashes with government forces.

Can you give it to me? \" after quickly agreeing to use the technology to promote his movies, thompson said weinstein put his hand up her dress. The video, which only captures the two from the waist up, doesn't show weinstein's hands at that point, but does show thompson reacting with discomfort and telling weinstein, \" that's too high. That's too high. \" it also shows her joking about his advances, saying that \" data is hot. \" sky news aired only portions of the video.

The economy has already hit the fed's goal of 5 % unemployment and is closing in on its goal of 2 % inflation, fed chair janet yellen said wednesday. A decision to raise interest rates would be a \" testament, also, to how far the economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the great recession, \" she said. According to the new york times, the fed has kept its benchmark rate near zero for seven years in order to \" stimulate economic growth by encouraging risk-taking by investors and borrowing by businesses and consumers. \" financial markets put the odds of a rate increase at 75 % when the fed meets in mid-december, usa today reports. According to the wall street journal, yellen has warned about waiting to long to increase rates, as that could actually lead to another recession. But yellen said the economy is still fairly weak, so rate increases would come slowly over the coming years, the times reports. According to the journal, a report on november job growth due friday will have an impact on the fed's decision later this month. Since june, the us has been adding an average of 195,000 jobs per month, usa today reports. According to the times, raising interest rates means the fed is confident the us economy can keep growing without as much support from the government.",

Focusing on dna methylation, which is what happens when there are changes not to a gene's underlying code but to how the gene is activated, researchers report in the journal circulation: cardiovascular genetics that smoking impacts 7,000 genes, or roughly one-third of a person's entire genome. Cigarette smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of death globally and accounts for 6 million deaths every year. The news isn't entirely grim. In looking at the blood samples and smoking habits of 16,000 people across 16 studies dating as far back as 1971, researchers say the vast majority of affected genes returned to normal within five years of the smoker quitting. \" your body is trying to heal itself, \" one says.

And national security letters, which the fbi and other intelligence organizations can use to gather phone and internet records, are still \" comparatively easy \" to obtain, per the daily beast. Officials also acknowledge that there are other existing methods to get around two of the expired laws — one that addressed wiretaps of a person using more than one device, another that allowed officials to wiretap \" lone wolf \" suspects — and that those two laws were rarely or never used, per the times.

But that's just one of several strange elements of the story out of nisku, south of edmonton. Police say it began around 9: 30am monday when a woman, her 6-week-old infant, and her father were kidnapped from a leduc county home and forced into a vehicle, per the ap and edmonton journal. The father, who was in the trunk, escaped while the vehicle was moving shortly before the woman and infant were also able to flee, police say. Uninjured, all three were picked up by a man in a truck before the suspects'vehicle plowed into the back of the truck and wound up in a ditch 17 minutes after the kidnapping took place, police say. Federal police afterward found a man, two women and two female youths inside the crashed white bmw, all naked, reports ctv news. A video from the scene reportedly shows officers surrounding the vehicle before a nude man is led away. It was just 17 degrees outside at the time, reports global news, which notes all five naked individuals were taken to a hospital. A witness tells ctv that stun guns may have been used. The youths have since been released from custody, while the adults — who police say knew their alleged victims, per cbc news — are charged with kidnapping and resisting arrest. Police haven't disclosed a motive but believe drugs and alcohol may have been involved. ( also in alberta, women escaped jail only to be nabbed at an escape room. )",

Among the challenges: immigration: homeland security is only funded through feb. 28 — unlike most of the government, which is budgeted through september — which will offer conservatives the chance to wear president obama down on his immigration amnesty platform and allow congress \" to take more aggressive action on the issue, \" politico notes. Medicare: the expensive way in which the government pays back medicare providers, known as the \" doc fix, \" has seen a variety of \" patches, \" as forbes calls them, but many are now looking for a permanent solution. Unfortunately, that permanent solution to the sustainable growth rate formula would take money, and a lot of it: $ 140 billion over 10 years, according to the congressional budget office. Transportation: the highway trust fund won't have the money to pay its debts come may, which means federal infrastructure projects could come screeching to a sudden stop. Boehner and co. Will need to find an alternative to raising the gas tax, which has its own complications. Debt ceiling: this year's extension on the country's borrowing authority — which didn't exactly go smoothly in 2014 — has to be made sometime between the late spring and early fall. Miscellaneous: other plans in the gop playbook, according to politico, would be passing bills to: start building the keystone xl pipeline; define a workweek as 40 hours to limit those covered by obamacare; and tighten iran sanctions. Congressional republicans are scheduled to gather in hershey, pa., later this month at a retreat to prepare for \" frictions that will inevitably arise, \" a gop aide says, per the hill.",

            "Just below the surface of the internet sits a network of hidden websites home to some of the worst stuff imaginable. Now hackers are going after pedophiles hiding in the so-called dark net. Since the beginning of october, a group of hackers associated with the hacktivist collective anonymous have waged war on an underground forum called lolita city, where hundreds of users openly trade child porn. They're using hacking tools with nicknames like \" chris hansen \" — after the nbc \" to catch a predator \" host — to bring down the forum and identify users. They call their crusade opdarknet. Lolita city lives on the \" dark net, \" a sort of shadow internet hidden from most internet users. The dark net has sprung up around a service called tor, which lets anyone host websites and browse the web anonymously with an easy-to-use suite of software.

Now hackers are going after pedophiles hiding in the so-called dark net. Since the beginning of october, a group of hackers associated with the hacktivist collective anonymous have waged war on an underground forum called lolita city, where hundreds of users openly trade child porn. They're using hacking tools with nicknames like \" chris hansen \" — after the nbc \" to catch a predator \" host — to bring down the forum and identify users. They call their crusade opdarknet. Lolita city lives on the \" dark net, \" a sort of shadow internet hidden from most internet users.

In the new book shakespeare's bastard: the life of sir william davenant, biographer simon andrew stirling links the two through not only their shared propensity for the written word, but certain physical characteristics, most notably a droopy left eyebrow. It's not the first time the link has been made, notes the los angeles times.

Stirling argues that sonnet 126, in which shakespeare writes of his \" lovely boy, \" is actually about davenant. But not everyone's buying it.

The 41 people arrested on charges including drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, witness tampering, and illegal gambling include every member of the biker gang's indianapolis chapter, the ap reports. ( a 42nd man remains at large. ) the raids followed a year-long investigation in which federal agents used a variety of methods to infiltrate the gang. The bikers ran a \" criminal operation that was as well-layered and sophisticated as most businesses in this city, \" according to us attorney joe hogsett, who says he's not sure why nobody has tried to dismantle the organization before. The raids came as no surprise to a lawyer who represented numerous outlaws in the 1970s and ' 80s. \" let's assume there is something of an afterlife, \" he tells the indianapolis star. \" there is no question at all that all of the outlaws will be found partying at a lower rung of dante's seventh level of hell.

The 67-year-old family business, which mondella took over in 1983, supplied big clients, including red lobster and tgi fridays, and had not seemed to be struggling, the los angeles times reports. Mondella had two daughters from his first marriage and a 5-year-old girl with his second wife, from whom he was separated, reports the daily news. \" poor guy, in this day and age, you can do no jail time for marijuana, \" a law enforcement source tells the new york post. \" i don't know why he would do that, unless there's something worse down there. \" the post's sources also claim that police were tipped off about the pot business in 2013 and used the environmental complaints as a way to get inside the factory.",

        "summary": "In an attempt to begin to tackle the age-old question of what shapes one's identity, researchers at duke and the university of arizona surveyed the caregivers of those with different neurodegenerative diseases to see which ones seemed most likely to strip away the essence of a person. Reporting in the journal psychological science, they say that people can be stripped of their abilities to move, think, and even remember, but it is not until they are stripped of their moral characteristics — i.e., courage, kindness, and honesty — that their caregivers begin to feel that the person's true identity is slipping away. \" essentially, identity is not what we know, but what we stand for, \" reports scientific american. To test this, the researchers asked the caregivers of 248 people suffering from either alzheimer's, fronto-temporal dementia ( ftd ), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) such questions as, \" how much do you sense that the patient is still the same person underneath? \" those caring for als patients were least likely to feel an essential metamorphosis in identity has occurred, while those caring for ftd patients, who suffer from frontal control damage that impacts things like empathy and impulse, were the most likely to feel the patient's identity had changed, reports the wall street journal, which calls the research \" profound. Our moral character, after all, is what links us to other people. \" a statistical analysis of all three groups found changes in moral behavior to predict changes in perceived identity more than changes in memory or intellect, regardless of the type of disease. ( a 38-year-old with alzheimer's says, \" i don't feel like myself because of this disease. \" )",

Fortunately, science appears to suggest that being robbed of one's memory does not equate with being robbed of one's identity.

But some dems had a better day than others. Here's how the analysts saw it: winners: president obama. His speech was one of the \" most moving, inspiring valentines to this country that i've ever heard, brimming with regard for it and gratitude to it, \" writes frank bruni at the new york times.

He managed to effectively tell his \" own story of loss and perseverance, \" hit trump and his \" malarkey \" hard, and deliver a powerful endorsement of clinton, writes chris cillizza at the washington post.

The implications of the devastating series of events from 2011 are still being discovered, as with september's report that the tsunami sent an armada of debris across the ocean, carrying with it at least 289 species to us shores in an unprecedented transoceanic event. Now, another surprise, this one tied to sand. In a study published monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, scientists say they've discovered radioactive cesium in an unexpected place: the groundwater below eight beaches located as many as 60 miles from the plant. And the radioactive material is being released bit by bit back into the ocean, though the scientists note public health \" is not of primary concern. \" that's because, as science news reports, the water is underground and not tapped for drinking. The theory is that cesium-137-contaminated waters reached these beaches in the wake of the disaster, that the cesium essentially became attached to the sand and, over time, found a home in the fresh water-salt water mix below the beach itself. Per a press release, the cesium can't \" stick \" to sand under highly salty conditions, so as the brackish water becomes increasingly salty due to incoming ocean water, the cesium is freed and flows back into the ocean. The find wasn't just a surprise, but significant. As the researchers write, \" aside from the aquifer beneath [ the plant ], the highest recorded present-day activities of [ cesium-137 ] in the aqueous environment in japan are associated with brackish groundwater underneath beaches. \" ( a robot took an important photo at fukushima in july. ) \" it is as if the sands acted as a'sponge'that was contaminated in 2011 and is only slowly being depleted, \" says one researcher.",

        "summary": "Nearly two dozen nail salons were shut down in connecticut — at least temporarily — after a random sweep by the department of labor earlier this month. Inspired by new york state's response to a new york times investigation into nail salons, and after complaints, officials randomly investigated 25 salons from hartford to stamford on aug. 3 and found just two were operating according to wage and hour laws, wtnh and the hartford courant report. The remaining 23 were paying workers in cash, below minimum wage, or without overtime, and avoiding social security and unemployment taxes. Many of the workers were asian immigrants; at one salon, they were paid just $ 4 an hour before tips, says gary pechie of the labor department. More than 50 women will see $ 62,000 in back wages — a figure that could rise. Nbc connecticut reports $ 47,000 was recovered during the raids. Some 119 workers at the salons were paid at least minimum wage, but under the table, pechie says, adding salon owners owe $ 130,000 in civil penalties. A korean american serving as a liaison between pechie and owners says he's embarrassed and surprised by the findings, noting salon owners are \" really deeply sorry for not following rules and regulations. \" pechie adds no managers attempted to impede the raids, though some customers did. Inspectors let workers finish up with clients before closing a business. \" nobody walked out with just three fingernails, \" pechie says.",

Though identified only as e.k.l. In the federal class-action suit, the star-ledger identifies the teen as recent high school graduate elizabeth kyle. And her complaint is fairly straightforward: now that the military is opening up even combat roles to women, it makes no sense to require males to register for the draft at age 18 but not females. In fact, it's unconstitutional, she argues. Kyle filed the complaint via her mother, asserting that the selective service violates the civil rights of females by excluding them. \" if the two sexes can fight and die together, they can register together; if not, then no one should have to register, \" the complaint states, as quoted by courthouse news service. Kyle says she tried to register online but got shut down as soon as she checked the box for female. She hopes to represent a group of women ages 18 to 25 in the suit. Any such change would require congress to tweak the wording of the law, says a selective service spokesperson. Legislation introduced by rep.

A morris county mother, on behalf of her 17-year-old daughter, is suing the u.s. Selective service system and its director, arguing that the system discriminates against women. Specifically, the complaint says selective service is violating american women's equal protection and due process rights under the u.s. Constitution by requiring only males to register for the draft. Under current law, virtually all males 18-25 in the united states must register for the draft, although the draft itself has been mothballed since 1973. Women can enlist in the military, but they are not required to register for the draft. The suit was filed by allison m.

Once she clicked \" female \" during the online registration process, however, the website prevented her from registering. E.k.l. Filed the complaint on july 3 through her mother, allison kyle, claiming that the military selective service act ( mssm ) violates the civil rights of young women but contravene current policies that both the pentagon and congress hold for integrating women into combat roles.
