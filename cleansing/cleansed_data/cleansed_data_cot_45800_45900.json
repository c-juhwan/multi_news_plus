        "summary": "Ten years into research they call \" exhaustive, \" scientists at the university of washington and the buck institute for research on aging are reporting in the journal cell metabolism that they've isolated 238 genes linked to aging in yeast cells. After working with undergrads to painstakingly delete a single gene from each of 4,698 yeast strains, they say that when any of these 238 genes are not present, the yeast's life span goes up — and that 189 of these genes hadn't before been linked to aging. One gene, los1, produced \" particularly stunning results, \" the institute reports — deleting los1 alone helped extend life span by 60 %. Los1 is influenced by a genetic \" master switch \" that's already associated with reduced caloric intake; switching it off seems to mimic the positive health benefits of fasting. Will these findings in yeast have any bearing on humans? \" almost half of the genes we found that affect aging are conserved in mammals, \" says lead author dr. Brian kennedy. \" in theory, any of these factors could be therapeutic targets to extend healthspan. What we have to do now is figure out which ones are amenable to targeting. \" the findings come on the heels of research out of the university of southern california finding that a five-day-a-week diet designed to mimic fasting with an up to 50 % reduction in caloric intake also slows aging, improves the immune system, and reduces heart disease and cancer, reports the telegraph.

            "Comprehensive study finds 238 genes that affect aging in yeast cells. October 5, 2015/novato, california following an exhaustive, ten-year effort, scientists at the buck institute for research on aging and the university of washington have identified 238 genes that, when removed, increase the replicative lifespan of s. Cerevisiae yeast cells. This is the first time 189 of these genes have been linked to aging. These results provide new genomic targets that could eventually be used to improve human health. The research was published online on october 8th in the journal cell metabolism. \"this study looks at aging in the context of the whole genome and gives us a more complete picture of what aging is, \" said brian kennedy, phd, lead author and the buck institute's president and ceo. \"it also sets up a framework to define the entire network that influences aging in this organism. \" the kennedy lab collaborated closely with matt kaeberlein, phd, a professor in the department of pathology at the university of washington, and his team. The two groups began the painstaking process of examining 4,698 yeast strains, each with a single gene deletion. To determine which strains yielded increased lifespan, the researchers counted yeast cells, logging how many daughter cells a mother produced before it stopped dividing. \"we had a small needle attached to a microscope, and we used that needle to tease out the daughter cells away from the mother every time it divided and then count how many times the mother cells divides, \" said dr. Kennedy. \"we had several microscopes running all the time. \" these efforts produced a wealth of information about how different genes, and their associated pathways, modulate aging in yeast. Deleting a gene called los1 produced particularly stunning results. Los1 helps relocate transfer rna ( trna ), which bring amino acids to ribosomes to build proteins. Los1 is influenced by mtor, a genetic master switch long associated with caloric restriction and increased lifespan. In turn, los1 influences gcn4, a gene that helps govern dna damage control. \"calorie restriction has been known to extend lifespan for a long time. \" said dr. Kennedy. \"the dna damage response is linked to aging as well. Los1 may be connecting these different processes. \" a number of the age-extending genes the team identified are also found in c.

In a press conference on sunday, maj. Gen. Ibrahim abdul atti said that over 22 years he had personally researched a cure, eventually getting help from egyptian military intelligence, the new york times reports. \" defeating the virus is a very easy process, but god grants wisdom to whoever he wants, \" atti said. \" you will never find another patient suffering from the hepatitis c virus. \" the military, however, said it would not release the cures outside of egypt. The military released a video showing patients being scanned with an antenna-like device called \" c-fast \" that, according to the cairo paper al-ahram, purportedly has no electronics and is \" powered by the body's static electricity \"; it was reportedly based on bomb-detecting equipment. If aids is detected, the patient's blood is purportedly pulled from the body, purified, and returned in a \" complete cure \" treatment, curing the patient in as little as 16 hours, according to cnn. The general likened the process to feeding the disease back to the patient in kofta. The announcement has been met with just a wee bit of skepticism. Egypt's top presidential science adviser told an egyptian newspaper that the \" cure \" was \" unrealistic \" and \" an insult to egypt. \" per the cdc, egypt has the world's highest prevalence of hepatitis c: at least 10 % of the population has it.",

Busch's lawyer, art margulis, said busch and others were at the mansion when martin's body was discovered. The attorney said martin was busch's girlfriend and there was \" absolutely nothing suspicious about her passing, and it's a tragic and untimely death of a young person. \" officials said an initial autopsy was inconclusive and didn't reveal signs of trauma to her body or obvious natural causes of death. A ruling stating the cause of death is expected after results of toxicology tests come back. That could take up to six weeks. St. Louis county forensic administrator suzanne mccune had said there were no signs of trauma or illness, and an overdose was among the possible causes of death. \" she was against drugs, \" said timothy carlson, who until earlier this month employed martin as his assistant. Carlson, president of the local mto clean franchise, said one of the last tasks she performed before leaving the job was selecting a company to administer drug testing for carlson's"

        "summary": "Voters in five states go to the polls on tuesday, and analysts will again be looking for clues on what the results might mean for the november midterms. Some highlights: kansas: the gop primary for the governor's seat might be the highest-profile contest of the night because of president trump. On monday, trump backed conservative secretary of state kris kobach over the sitting republican incumbent, jeff colyer, notes the ap. One fear for republicans is that if kobach wins, he'd be vulnerable to democrats in november. Ohio: this is a special election, not a primary, to fill the seat of retired gop rep. Pat tiberi. The seat has long been held by republicans, but democrat danny o ' connor is in a surprisingly close race against the gop's troy balderson. A gop loss would be a \" psychological blow \" to the party, per cnn, but no matter what happens, the two candidates will be squaring off again in november. Trump tweeted on behalf of balderson on tuesday. Michigan: an open governor's seat is at stake, and if abdul el-sayed wins the democratic primary and again in november, he would become the nation's first muslim governor. Bernie sanders is a big supporter, notes cnn. Elsewhere, fayrouz saad is one of the democrats vying for the seat of retiring rep. Dave trott, and she has the chance to become the first muslim woman in congress, per the ap. Missouri: the senate race here is getting big attention, because it's seen as one of the gop's best chances to unseat a democratic incumbent, in this case claire mccaskill. State attorney general josh hawley is expected to win the gop nomination tuesday night. Washington state: various congressional primaries are on the ballot, and one interesting facet is that washington uses what the ap calls a \" jungle primary \" system in which all candidates regardless of party are listed on the same ballot. The top two advance. One big race is for the seat of retiring gop rep. Dave reichert near seattle.",

The board will meet wednesday to review the plan for its spinoff of $ 32 billion in alibaba shares and possibly debate selling yahoo's core online businesses, the sources told cnbc.

Yahoo inc.'s board is planning a series of meetings this week to consider selling off the company's flagging internet businesses and how to make the most of its valuable stake in chinese e-commerce powerhouse alibaba group holding ltd.

            "Yahoo's board is debating selling some of its core assets, cnbc learned wednesday from sources close to the matter. Shares of yahoo were up more than 6 percent midmorning wednesday. The wall street journal originally reported the news on tuesday regarding the tech company. The board will meet wednesday to review the plan for its spinoff of $ 32 billion in alibaba shares and possibly debate selling yahoo's core online businesses, the sources told cnbc. The board has received letters from multiple shareholders in recent days regarding the plan, cnbc has learned. Shortly after the journal report tuesday, more than 300,000 yahoo shares changed hands in after-hours trading, pushing the stock up 5.6 percent to $ 35.60. Ivan feinseth, chief investment officer of tigress financial partners, told cnbc that if yahoo was to sell its main growth operations — the mobile, video, native advertising and social media ( mavens ) units — all that would remain would be the poorly performing internet search business. Selling both mavens and the search unit would mean \" there would be nothing left of the company, \" he said. \" i don't know why anybody would want to buy a line of business that's in decline and has stiff competition from google and microsoft, \" feinseth said, referring to the search and \" paid click advertising \" unit. Alibaba itself could be interesting in buying the mavens business, he added."

The 53-year-old judge made what were in effect closing arguments by acknowledging that he became \" very emotional \" when forcefully denying the allegations at a judiciary committee hearing last week. \" i said a few things i should not have said, \" he wrote in an op-ed published thursday evening.

A dolphin will answer when another dolphin mimics its whistle — just as we reply when someone calls our name. The calls enable the marine mammals to communicate over long distances — which is necessary because they live in \"fission-fusion \" societies, meaning that dolphins in one group split off to join other groups and later return. By whistling, they're able to find each",

Police in beijing's chaoyang district said in a statement saturday that an investigation into a kindergarten run by beijing-based ryb education has led to the criminal detention of a 22-year-old female teacher on suspicion of abusing children. The statement, posted on the district police account on the sina weibo microblog platform, identified the woman only by her surname, liu — cnn notes chinese police often don't provide suspects ' full names — and didn't provide further details on her. Ryb education, meanwhile, said it was \" extremely shocked and distressed \" about the crimes the teacher is suspected of committing. The statement didn't provide details of liu's alleged abuses. Ryb said it had fired liu, removed the head of the kindergarten, and is cooperating with further investigations. It also said the company is hiring doctors and psychologists to aid the children who'd been affected, as well as inspecting other branches. The beijing scandal erupted after local media quoted parents as saying their children were forced to strip as punishment and were found with unexplained apparent needle marks on their bodies. The claims couldn't be independently verified. Chaoyang police said a 31-year-old beijing woman, who reuters notes is also surnamed liu, was detained after admitting to spreading false info about the involvement of a military regiment in sexually abusing the children. The statement said the woman expressed \" deep regret \" for her actions. Ryb and its franchisees operate 1,300 day care centers and nearly 500 kindergartens in 300 chinese cities.",

            "Anjan contractor's 3d food printer might evoke visions of the \"replicator \" popularized in star trek, from which captain picard was constantly interrupting himself to order tea. And indeed contractor's company, systems &amp; materials research corporation, just got a six month, $ 125,000 grant from nasa to create a prototype of his universal food synthesizer. But contractor, a mechanical engineer with a background in 3d printing, envisions a much more mundane — and ultimately more important — use for the technology. He sees a day when every kitchen has a 3d printer, and the earth's 12 billion people feed themselves customized, nutritionally-appropriate meals synthesized one layer at a time, from cartridges of powder and oils they buy at the corner grocery store. Contractor's vision would mean the end of food waste, because the powder his system will use is shelf-stable for up to 30 years, so that each cartridge, whether it contains sugars, complex carbohydrates, protein or some other basic building block, would be fully exhausted before being returned to the store. Ubiquitous food synthesizers would also create new ways of producing the basic calories on which we all rely. Since a powder is a powder, the inputs could be anything that contain the right organic molecules. We already know that eating meat is environmentally unsustainable, so why",

        "summary": "Emotions joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust must strike a balance in the mind of 11-year-old riley as she adjusts to a new city and school in disney and pixar's inside out. With a 99 % rating on rotten tomatoes, the flick seems destined to become a classic. Here's what critics are saying: simply put, the film is \" the best one i've seen for a very long time, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. He calls it \" astonishing \" for its \" ability to turn an abstract concept — the contending forces of our psyches — into a spectacle that's as funny, stirring, unpredictable, exciting, and riotously beautiful as it is profound. \" you ' ll want to see this one at least twice: \" the level of invention is so high, and the density of detail is so great, that it's impossible to absorb everything in a single viewing. \" this is \" a boldly conceived film that refuses to follow box-office formula and doesn't condescend, \" writes steven rea at the philadelphia inquirer. Interestingly, he says it's \" the first psychological thriller that's fun for the whole family. \" yes, it can be dark and scary and absurd, but it also has \" just the right mix of wit and whimsy. \" pixar's moviemakers have \" produced another gem. \" \" inside out isn't just a sign of renewed youth from pixar. It's the reason pixar exists, \" writes andrew lapin at npr. There are numerous stops \" inside riley's, and this film's, wonderfully warped mind, \" but each one \" is another masterstroke in visual storytelling, and the film boasts pixar's most ambitious production designs to date. \" amy poehler as joy and the office's phyllis smith as sadness are \" stellar, \" he adds, helping to create a character, riley, we know \" better than we've known any character in film history. \" and more praise: james berardinelli says inside out \" is the best american-produced animated film we have seen in many summers. \" the scenes inside riley's head have an \" un-pixar-like … shimmery, cartoonish look that pixar hasn't previously attempted, \" he writes at reel views. They help the movie find \" its own identity \" in a genre that's visually been \" increasingly generic. \" pixar is finally out of its rut, he says.",

Researchers at the university of sheffield gathered more than 100 children, ages six and seven, and told them not to peek at answers about a fictitious cartoon character on the back of a card ( meanwhile, a hidden camera was on them the whole time ), according to a press release. Then researchers questioned the children, spotted the liars, and evaluated their ability to lie in the face of two entrapment questions. The \" best \" liars fibbed each time, while poor liars did it only once or not at all. Writing in the journal of experimental child psychology, researchers say they were most impressed by a child's ability to keep up a strong cover story for any falsehood. In memory tests that followed, the talented liars showed a more powerful working memory with words, but not with pictures. This is likely because covering up for lies involves juggling a lot of verbal information and \" keeping the researcher's perspective in mind, \" a project leader tells the telegraph. Parents may not want kids to lie, but \" when their children are lying well, it means their children are becoming better at thinking and have good memory skills, \" says developmental psychologist elena hoicka. \" we already know that adults lie in approximately a fifth of their social exchanges lasting 10 or more minutes, so it's interesting to know why some children are able to tell more porkies than others. \" one possible surprise from the study: only 25 % of the children cheated by peeking at the answer.

            "Children who benefit from a good memory are much better at covering up lies, researchers from the university of sheffield have discovered. Experts found a link between verbal memory and covering up lies following a study which investigated the role of working memory in verbal deception amongst children. The study saw six to seven year old children presented with the opportunity to do something they were instructed not to -peek at the final answers on the back of a card during a trivia game. A hidden camera and correct answers to the question, which was based on the name of a fictitious cartoon character, enabled the researchers to identify who had peeked, despite denials. Further questioning, including about the colour of the answer on the cards, allowed researchers to identify who was a good liar, by lying to both entrapment questions; or a bad liar, by lying about one or none of the",

The new york times calls his message an \" acidic \" one, noting he gave no indication of backing down — on ukraine, or in terms of his anger toward the west. As for the economic doom the country is staring down, putin framed it as temporary, predicting it would end within two years as oil demand and the world economy strengthen; he also assigned 25 % of the blame for the ruble's woes to the west's sanctions. Neil macfarquhar, the times ' moscow bureau chief, was one of a number of the 1,200 journalists who live-tweeted the three-hour, 10-minute event. He captured this tidbit, among others: \" # putin says he also does not know how much he earns. It arrives ( in an envelope? ) and he just forwards it to his accountant. \" more substantial highlights from the event, which featured journalists who waved toy animals in hopes of being selected to ask a question ( a bit of color, per the guardian: a journo brandishing a \" green fluffy crocodile \" got to ask about moscow parking fines ): one portion of the event getting plenty of press is an elongated metaphor about a bear — real and stuffed. Putin's comments, per the ap and nbc news: \" maybe our bear should sit quietly, not chasing any piglets around, but just eating honey and berries. Maybe they should just leave him alone? they will not. They are trying to put it on a chain. And as soon as they do it they will tear his teeth and claws out. \" [ the teeth and claws are a reference to russia's nuclear weapons. ] \" once they've taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary. He ' ll become a stuffed animal. \" on russia's interests, per nbc news: \" to chop texas from mexico is fair, but when we make decision about our territories it is unfair. \" \" it might be [ true ], it might be. \" that's putin's take on whether the us and saudi arabia are secretly conspiring to suppress oil prices to hurt russia and iran.

        "summary": "At least 4,000 years before the advent of farming, humans were baking bread. Two dozen charred crumbs found in hearths at an ancient hunter-gatherer site in northeastern jordan have been identified as the world's oldest samples of bread — specifically, a 14,400-year-old flatbread made from wild cereals. That predates the next oldest sample found in turkey by 5,000 years. Making bread from scratch — including grinding cereals — is labor intensive, note the researchers. \" that it was produced before farming methods suggests it was seen as special, and the desire to make more of this special food probably contributed to the decision to begin to cultivate cereals, \" says dorian fuller, one of a team of researchers who discovered the crumbs at the natufian site of shubayqa 1 in the black desert between 2012 and 2015, reports the guardian. Described monday in pnas, the bread was likely made from wild wheat and barley flour, with ground tubers of a plant called club-rush adding a bitter, nutty flavor, reports the bbc. Combined with water, the mixture is believed to have been baked in ashes or on a hot stone and consumed as part of a feast of gazelle, water birds, and hare, remains of which were also found. Tasting a bit like modern multigrain bread, the flatbread might have even formed part of a meat sandwich. Noting \" food remains have long been ignored in archaeology, \" researcher amaia arranz-otaegui believes similar \" bread-like cereal products \" perhaps existed 25,000 years ago. Given this \" exceptional find, \" she now hopes to explore how the natufians ' bread production influenced the later agricultural revolution. ( grape wine dates back a long way, too. )",

Researchers who scanned the brains of more than 150 14-year-olds found that the brain's \" reward hub \" — which plays a role in addiction — was bigger in frequent gamers, as it is in gambling addicts, the los angeles times reports. The researchers couldn't determine whether gaming changed the brain, or whether having a certain brain structure made people likelier to enjoy gaming. The results are \" really provocative, because this is a central hub in the brain's motivational system and dopamine pathway, \" a researcher at cambridge's department of experimental psychology tells reuters. \" the burning question is whether the structural difference is a change caused by the frequent game play, or whether individual differences in this system naturally dispose some people to more excessive play, \" he says. \" for teenagers, parents, and clinicians to make sense of this finding, we need research monitoring brain structure over time. \"",

No word on when the invention might go into production/be put to wide use. While plenty of privacy-loving hikers might hope \" never, \" ray willington at hot hardware has a different take. If google is \" investing production resources on glass, surely it could do the same here, \" he writes. \" imagine being able to map out places of thousands of walkers at once; suddenly, the global mapping task would seem a lot less daunting. \"",

        "summary": "Federal reserve officials voted wednesday to raise a key, short term interest rate for the third time this year, the ap reports. Investors largely expected an increase in the federal funds rate — the interest that banks charge each other — based off public statements by fed officials. The benchmark overnight lending rate was increased by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 2 % to 2.25 %, reuters reports. That's up from a level of near-zero between the end of 2008 and late 2015. The higher range points to an improving us economy with inflation staying near the fed's target of 2 %. The vote to raise rates was 9 to 0. In their statement announcing the decision and marking the end of the \" accommodative \" monetary policy era, fed officials removed a sentence in prior statements that said its interest rate policy was supporting a strong job market and a return to 2 % inflation. By eliminating that statement, they're suggesting that those goals are now within reach and that rate hikes will likely continue, per the ap. Federal reserve policymakers expect to hike rates one more time this year, three times next year, and only once in 2020, the same as they forecast in june. That would put the rate at 3.4 % by 2020, about half a percentage point above the estimated \" neutral \" rate at which interest rates don't restrict or stimulate the economy.",

In a significant about-face, the company announced tuesday it is getting into the synthetic diamond game with lightbox, its new man-made diamond brand that will offer full carat stones from roughly $ 800 beginning in september. That price point is essentially the point: while one of de beers ' genuine one carat diamonds costs about $ 8,000, bloomberg reports similar lab-made ones currently run about $ 4,000. That means synthetics made by de beers ' rivals ( among them warren buffett's helzberg's diamond shops and leonardo dicaprio-funded diamond foundry ) will be extremely expensive in comparison and the gulf between synthetic and real prices will widen, making the two categories more distinct. Cnn notes it's a big change for a company whose execs had pledged to never sell lab-grown stones; it even created a machine whose purpose is rooting out such fakes. It justified the change by citing consumer demand, with ceo bruce cleaver calling lightbox \" affordable fashion jewelry that may not be forever, but is perfect for right now. \" he called a spade a spade: \" lab grown are not special, they're not real, they're not unique. You can make exactly the same one again and again. \" lightbox's gm similarly painted the stones as low-brow in comments to the washington post: \" this is something you might buy for a best friend or for a sweet 16. \" the diamonds will be available in white, pink, and blue and made in a facility in portland, ore., that de beers plans to sink nearly $ 100 million into.",

Piala inc., a tokyo-based marketing firm, introduced a policy last month granting six extra paid holidays per year to non-smoking employees to make up for the cigarette breaks of employees who do smoke. It all started when a non-smoker used the company suggestion box to complain about smoking breaks, a spokesperson tells the telegraph. \" our ceo saw the comment and agreed, so we are giving non-smokers some extra time off to compensate, \" the spokesperson explains. Smoke breaks are particularly time-consuming at the company — about 15 minutes each — because smokers must travel from the office on the 29th floor to the basement. So far, 25 % of the employees have taken days off under the new policy — and, at least according to the spokesperson, four people have quit smoking as a result of the policy. Kyodo news says in japan, where 21.7 % of adults are estimated to smoke, more companies are starting to attempt to rein in the practice, with one company going so far as to ban smoking during work hours.

If you've watched last night's episode, the series'season 5 finale, you ' ll want to next read entertainment weekly's interview with kit harington ( jon snow ), or, at least, our excerpt of it. Vanity fair's headline sums up what countless other publications are this morning asking: \" is this really the last we ' ll see of jon snow? \" he's stabbed julius caesar-style by members of the night's watch, and the season ends with his apparent death. Or not so apparent, but crystal-clear, he tells ew. Here's part of the key exchange: ew: \" i was talking to [ showrunner ] dan weiss and he said jon is really dead. But george r.r. Martin left open the possibility the character might not be dead in the books.... So let me ask you: is jon really dead? \" harington: \" this is my understanding of it. I had a sit-down with dan and david, we did the tony soprano walk [ letting an actor know they're being whacked ]. And they said, ' look, you're gone, it's done. '... But i've been told i ' m dead. I ' m dead. I ' m not coming back next season. So that's all i can tell you, really. \" but harington's words don't stop joanna robinson from asking in vanity fair if it's really, really the end of jon snow. She writes that the show's scene pretty closely mirrors the one that occurred in a dance with dragons, the fifth ( and last-to-be-published thus far ) book in the series, meaning \" the only difference between you show watchers and us book readers... Is we've had four years... To think of creative ways to bring back jon snow. \" she runs down a few of those creative ways here, including a popular one that's popping up in most articles: that melisandre believes he's azor ahai and could resurrect him. Wait, what? more on that and the reasons why he might not be dead ( the last word he uttered in the books, that we still need to unravel the mystery of his parentage ) here, and here.",

The baby tested positive for a non-psychoactive byproduct of marijuana and was ordered removed from her family by a juvenile court magistrate, who said there was \" immediate or threatened physical or emotional harm, \" the plain dealer reports. Who's on sanford's side: the county child services department, which says it only asked for \" protective supervision \" and that taking nova \" would only serve to disrupt the bond the child would develop with her parents, \" per a motion filed by an assistant county prosecuting attorney. The department also notes that it often battles eleanore hilow, the judge who threw the gavel down, for \" rulings disregarding the agency's professional opinion and the opinions of other professionals in the courtroom, \" per the plain dealer. Sanford's lawyer agrees, calling hilow \" ill tempered \" and with a rep for \" punitive decisions. \" in the meantime, sanford hopes her baby will be back home soon. \" if people want to say i ' m a terrible parent, that's their right, \" sanford tells the paper. \" i know in my heart that i ' m an excellent mother. \" nova is now with a family member, who was allowed to take the baby in so she wouldn't have to go to foster care; a hearing is set for december, per fox 8.

Horses? according to research using the oldest dna ever found, horses have been trotting around for millions of years — about 4 million, to be exact. The study, published in nature, explains how scientists used dna from a 700,000-year-old horse foot bone found in canada's arctic to compare ancient and modern species. What they discovered were exceptional details that dated horse evolution back 2 million years further than previously thought, proving the majestic animals kept some intimidating company. Scientists argue that the bone's discovery in permafrost — which slows dna decay — has opened doors to how far back they can look. ( before the find, the oldest dna came from a polar bear that lived more than 110,000 years ago. ) it offers \" great perspectives as to the level of details we can reconstruct of our origins and the evolutionary history of every animal on the planet, \" the study lead tells the la times.

The idea that somehow nikolaevna had escaped execution gripped popular imagination, including an animated film in 1997.

Buried there were the remains of the tsar, his wife and three of their daughters. Traces of the two remaining children, a son and another daughter, were not at the site. In 2007, a grave in yekaterinburg, russia, proved to be the final resting place of the two remaining children.

Cbs news reports nancy kidwell is selling the nevada town she founded in 1951 with her first husband, slim. Cal-nev-ari lies 80 miles south of las vegas and boasts 375 or so residents, a hotel, a general store, a casino, and even a few stop signs. \" it may look bland and boring, but it's pretty cool, \" says one 12-year-old resident. Kidwell got the land from the federal government when it was nothing but an old wwii airstrip. She and slim built it up from nothing, and when slim died in 1983 of alzheimer's — he was 34 years her senior, according to afp — she married his son ace and kept going. Five years after ace's death, also of alzheimer's, kidwell is the town's mayor and police chief; she makes sure there's water in the tank every day, orders provisions for the cafe, and does just about everything else. But at 78 years old, it's time to retire. \" i ' m selling it because i ' m not getting any younger, \" kidwell tells cbs. \" there's no one to take my place, so i have to start providing for the future of the community. \" cal-nev-ari is listed on bizbuysell.com, and there are already a handful of interested buyers. One wants to build an automobile test track; another wants to open a marijuana resort. But there's one catch to the sale: the cemetery where ace and slim are buried and where nancy already has a plot must remain. \" when your roots are somewhere, that's where you want to be, \" she tells cbs.

It ' ll be his first time testifying in front of congress since he recused himself from the russian investigation, and he ' ll face questions centered around three names: president trump, russian ambassador sergey kislyak, and james comey. As a starting point, the washington post explains why sessions'testimony on russia matters. Axios outlines three \" thorny \" questions sessions will face and provides his expected answers. Two involve sessions ' interactions with kislyak; the third has to do with a feb. 14 conversation between sessions and comey. \" this is a big deal, as comey gave his account under oath. \" the washington post draws up a list of its own questions sessions should be asked, and they're spun off of two \" key points \" from comey's testimony: that the fbi knew of sessions ' interactions with russian officials long before it became public and a sticking point around his recusal: if trump fired comey over the russia investigation, how much involvement did sessions have in the firing? cnn asks a thorny question of its own: \" can jeff sessions avoid some questions by citing executive privilege? \" sean spicer on monday suggested such a move is possible, and legal experts tell cnn he could legally do so in certain situations — if a question touched on national security, yes, about a confidential conversation, maybe not. But it could get hairy: the committee could hold him in contempt if he invokes it, leaving it to the courts to decide whether privilege is applicable.

But did you know russians have their own version of an extra large and hairy primate, the almas? and now a researcher in russia says he's found evidence in the form of a piece of bark that almas not only exists but is wandering the forests on the outskirts of moscow. \" the almas is cosmopolitan, \" andrei stroganov tells the moscow times. \" i am not worried: they are benevolent and need our protection. \" the biophysical technologist at moscow's prestigious agricultural academy says he found a piece of tree bark near moscow that appears to have been marked by a large primate. He believes the horizontal scratches on the bark are from a paw print nine inches across, and there are no claw marks to indicate they came from a bear. Long in search of almas proof, he also claims to have confirmed the presence of almas during a recent visit to chelyabinsk in the urals, but declined to go into details. The next step is to send swabs of the bark prints to alabama, where a russian-born researcher will analyze any dna found and do a morphological investigation. But one of stroganov's almas-hunting colleagues has previously been challenged by an oxford geneticist who said last year that after putting out calls for yeti, bigfoot, and sasquatch hairs in 2012, he performed dna tests on the samples sent to him and they pointed to a bear — either a newly discovered species or some hybrid between brown and polar bears, reports national geographic. Back in 1958, the soviet government established a short-lived \" almas commission \" to look for the creature; nowadays, almas is typically thought to roam the kemerovo region of siberia, the caucasus, and the urals.

Herszenhorn reports in the new york times. Republicans accused senate democrats and the obama white house of orchestrating a \"government takeover \" of the financial industry and suggested that the bill would severely harm businesses on main street. A procedural vote to wrap up debate is set for wednesday, and despite the sharp republican rhetoric, the legislation is expected to be approved. It would then need to be reconciled with a version approved by the house in december. Senator christopher j. Dodd, democrat of connecticut and the main sponsor of the regulatory bill, put forward an amendment hoping to broker a compromise over a controversial provision that would force the biggest wall street banks to spin off their lucrative derivatives business. Under mr. Dodd's proposal the new restrictions on derivatives trading would be delayed for two years until after they have been studied by a council of federal regulators. The council would probably kill the provision, and senator blanche lincoln, democrat of arkansas, the author of the rules, said that she would fight efforts to weaken them.
