        "summary": "A mom and dad and their two children were found dead in their northern virginia home yesterday after concerned co-workers of one of the parents called police. Homicide detectives on the scene said there was no threat to public safety, indicating that the deaths could be murder-suicide. The two boys in the family, one in high school and the other in middle school, weren't in class this week. The family had recently attended a community picnic in their herndon neighborhood, and showed no signs of any problem, said a neighbor. The father, who had lived on the block with his wife for 28 years, would frequently be on his front porch waving to cars, and the boys often played soccer in the front yard, he added. Any violence in the home seems \" completely out of character, \" another neighbor told a cbs reporter, wiping away tears. The town close to washington, dc, is considered safe, but there were three murder-suicide cases in the area in the month of july.",

            "Police: 4 family members dead in northern va. Herndon, va. — a mother, father and two children were found dead inside their home outside the nation's capital on tuesday, and although police wouldn't give details on the cause, they said there was no ongoing threat to the community. Officers were called about 10: 30 a.m. And asked to check on the welfare of residents in a herndon, va., home on point rider lane, just across the street from frying pan farm, a popular local park, said fairfax county police spokeswoman lucy caldwell. Police entered the home shortly after noon and found the bodies of the four family members. Police declined to provide any identification pending notification of family. Caldwell would not discuss whether the case was a murder-suicide, but said that homicide detectives are investigating and that there is no public safety threat.

            "Three northern virginia murder-suicides in the last two weeks have left police and residents with many unanswered questions. Over the last two years, the number of murder-suicides in virginia overall has dropped by 12 incidents: in 2010, there were 33 events that yielded 35 murders and 33 suicides, according to the virginia violent death reporting system. In 2011, there were only 21 murder-suicides with 25 people murdered in the incidents. One of those involved a 62-year-old vienna woman, who shot her pscyhiatrist, a 71-year-old mclean man, before turning the gun on herself. Marc leslie, coordinator for the statewide reporting system, run under the department of health office of the chief medical examiner, said there is not enough data to say whether the number of murder suicides will decrease from 2011 totals; countywide numbers were also not available. But following the latest murder-suicide in oakton on wednesday, police from three agencies have been scrambling to find motives in incidents in their jurisdictions. The first of the three was july 14 in the city of falls church. Arlington police found a husband and wife dead in their apartment on july 24, two days before an oakton resident apparently shot his housemate before turning the gun on himself. Officers from arlington county and city of falls church police declined comment on their events; fairfax county police did not respond to",

The team of organic chemists says earwax is a \" neglected body secretion \" that can reveal a person's ethnicity and possibly much more information, fox news reports. When they heated earwax samples from volunteers to release volatile organic compounds ( vocs ), the researchers found that the earwax of caucasians, which tends to be wet, could easily be told apart from the wax of those of east asian descent, which is usually dry, with the former containing heavier amounts of 11 of the dozen vocs they tested for. The researchers became interested in earwax after learning that the same gene linked to whether earwax is wet or dry is associated with underarm odor, which they say \" can convey a great deal of information about an individual, including personal identity, gender, sexual orientation, and health stature, \" reports medical news today. \" we think it possible that earwax may contain similar information. \" last year, biologists were able to determine a blue whale's testosterone and stress levels by taking samples from its 10-inch deep layer of earwax, popular science notes; more on that 10-inch \" earplug \" here.

        "summary": "Squeezing into 2016 with hardly any time to spare is one of the year's best films, according to critics. Jim jarmusch's paterson follows a week in the very routine life of a bus driver and closet poet named paterson, who happens to live in paterson, nj. The flick has a 94 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \" nothing particularly eventful happens, \" which probably makes paterson \" sound like a bit of an aimless snooze — it's anything but, \" writes chris nashawaty at entertainment weekly, acknowledging \" a hushed beauty to paterson and paterson that celebrates the way in which even the most ordinary, prosaic lives can be full of poetry. \" \" in depicting paterson's day-to-day rituals, jarmusch evokes something essential about the artist's way: how he or she must seesaw between observation and insularity, maintaining a firm sphere of privacy while being open to everything, \" writes david edelstein at vulture. \" i've never seen a film that captures the inner world of an artist with such delicacy. \" \" paterson, like most films assured enough to make their own rules, is not just a refreshing change of pace but a revivifying one, \" writes justin chang at the los angeles times. The film is \" its own poem of sorts \": \" a string of clever allusions and linguistic puzzles \" that leads \" to such exquisite rivulets of feeling, \" he writes. It's \" wonderfully serene and beguiling. \" \" jarmusch's quiet spellbinder is intentionally small. It's also a small miracle, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone, calling paterson \" one of the year's best \" films and driver's \" lived-in and lyrical \" performance one of the year's \" loveliest. \" the film \" takes its good, sweet time working its way into your mind and heart. But when it does, you're a goner, \" he adds.",

In the study, they asked men and women how many sexual partners they've had, and they also showed them images that ranged from non-sexual to slightly sexual ( like kissing ) to explicitly sexual. The more partners a person had, the more likely their brains were to light up on eegs when looking at those last two categories, reports medical xpress. The researchers weren't surprised that their subjects reacted to graphic images, but they were intrigued to find the correlation with the g-rated images, too. \"if your brain responds very strongly even to very tame pictures of sex, then you seem to be easily sexually excited in the real world, too, \" says lead researcher nicole prause. The results could help those naturally inclined toward the risque to be safer, she says, as per time. \"being aware that if you are going out, and there is the possibility of having a new partner, and thinking about ways to not get too excited may sound silly, but managing that rather than ignoring it may help with better ways to control risky sexual behavior. \" ( click to read about a recent survey finding that 17 % of us would be ok having sex with a robot. )",

The phases have also triggered stock-room purges, meaning all merchandise in the stock rooms must be moved to the sales floor.

            "Kmart shoppers. Reuters kmart employees believe the company is nearing bankruptcy and is in the process of shutting down all its stores. The chain has closed one-third of its stores in the last decade, and sales have been cut in half in the same time period. Store-level employees who spoke to business insider said many of the remaining 941 kmart stores now appear to be in the midst of liquidation. Stores are being entered into numbered phases — such as phase 1 and phase 2 — employees said. The company has told employees that the phases are part of a \" p2p \" or \" path to profitability \" strategy to make stores more profitable. But employees say it's a liquidation plan, with each phase triggering different cost-cutting measures such as layoffs and labor-hour reductions. The phases have also triggered stock-room purges, meaning all merchandise in the stock rooms must be moved to the sales floor. If there's not enough room on the sales floor for the items, stores will add new overhead shelving. Once the stock rooms are purged, stores typically have no more than nine months before they shut down, according to chatter on employee message boards. Kmart parent company sears holdings denies claims that it's liquidating all its stores. \" sears holdings is highly focused on restoring profitability to the company, and kmart",
            "It's difficult to remember when kmart wasn't known for its drain-circling tendencies. At one time in the discount store's history, parking lots were full, business was booming, and people, you know, actually wanted to shop there. However, by most accounts those days are a distant memory for the chain. Sales have consistently dropped, each new year brings about additional store closures, and it's hard to see how the brand could revive itself. What happened to make people care so little about a store that was once the largest discount retailer in the country? it's a well-known fact that in their heyday, kmart stores were the envy of walmart founder sam walton. But while walmart still reigns with its promise of \"always low prices, \" kmart has slipped further into oblivion. The company originally filed for bankruptcy in 2002, making it the largest bankruptcy of a retailer in history. At the time, it trailed only behind walmart and target, but still was unable to keep afloat. The company later became a unit of the sears holdings corporation, an outfit that has had its own shares of trouble in recent years. At the end of last year, sales in kmart stores fell 7.2 % in the fourth quarter of 2015 — a time when even struggling companies"

Their bond grew so great that pedicone decided to pursue adoption, and her application was approved a few months ago. She says she was inspired to make her daughter's star wars-themed dream come true by a video of another little girl's adoption that featured a bevy of princesses. Pedicone recruited a local star wars costuming group and filled judge barbara crowell in on her plans, and crowell was happy to oblige, even dressing up as leia organa and touching zoe's head with a lightsaber as she announced her official name change. Now pedicone says she and zoe can concentrate on their future together, something they were never fully able to do when zoe was her foster child. \" there are no more strings. … no more case workers. No more attorneys. It is just us, \" she says. ( carrie fisher finished filming the next star wars movie before her death this week. )",

Editor's update for jan. 3: the annual quadrantid meteor shower is peaking tonight, but the bright moon will interfere with the display. See our latest forecast here: quadrantid meteor shower peaks tonight: how to see it stargazers can start the new year off with a bang this weekend as the first meteor shower of 2015 reaches its peak on saturday night ( jan. 3 ). The first meteor display of the year will be the quadrantid meteor shower. Meteor showers are usually named after the constellation in the sky where their radiant is located: the point in the sky from which they appear to radiate. Thus, the perseids are named for perseus and the geminids are named for gemini. But there is no constellation named quadrans, so where did the quadrantids get their name? it turns out that there once was a constellation named quadrans muralis, the wall quadrant, which was incorporated into the constellation boötes in 1922.

            "The annual quadrantid shower is nominally active during the first week of january, and is best seen from northerly latitudes. However, peak activity lasts less than a day.

Moreover, in 2015, the bright waxing gibbous moon will wash out but the brightest quadrantid meteors. But if you're game, try watching between midnight and dawn on january 3 and/or 4. This meteor shower favors the northern hemisphere. That's because its radiant point – the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to radiate – is far to the north on the sky's dome. Plus the quadrantid meteor shower is capable of matching the meteor rates of the better known august perseid and december geminid showers. It has been known to produce up to 50-100 or more meteors per hour in a dark sky. So why isn't the quadrantid shower as celebrated as the perseid and geminid showers? it's because the quadrantid shower has a narrow peak that lasts for only a few hours.

Witnesses say aubry, who was dropping off daughter nahla at berry's place, was still in the driveway when martinez approached him and said, \" we have to move on, \" apparently a reference to berry's bitter custody battle with aubry, the daily mail reports. Aubry then allegedly pushed and punched martinez and a full-on melee ensued, ending with martinez pinning aubry on the ground and performing a citizen's arrest. Aubry \" was booked for a private persons arrest for battery, \" an lapd spokesperson confirms to people. Nahla missed the whole thing, because berry took her inside, tmz reports. Both men ended up right down the hall from one another at a hospital, but both have since been released. Aubry went to an la jail, where he was booked and released, while martinez and berry went to thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house and then quickly returned home — with martinez driving even though he injured his hand in the fight, tmz notes. Somewhere, there's security camera footage of all this, radar reports — and aubry tells friends that footage will show martinez actually started the fight. But people's sources confirm martinez — who used to box competitively — was the one acing in self-defense.",

In a lawsuit filed oct. 31, america's test kitchen — a media empire that includes the popular cooking show by the same name and cook's illustrated magazine — claims christopher kimball, who started and edited that magazine and co-founded and helmed the show, is guilty of \" profoundly disloyal fiduciary \" and that he and people close to him ( including his wife, an executive producer for the show ) colluded to \" literally and conceptually rip off \" atk to benefit his new company, milk street. Among the accusations ( most based on info from those email servers ) against kimball, who left atk in 2015: pilfered customer lists, using the atk name to secure resources for his new venture, and poaching atk employees. \" at least 15 former and current atk employees and freelancers now work for milk street, \" the suit states. Jack bishop, atk's chief creative officer, doesn't seem thrilled at having to go after someone he's known and worked with for close to 30 years. \" there is no joy in any of this, \" he tells the times. \" other than my siblings and parents, it is one of the longer relationships i've had in my life. \" kimball, who still retains a limited partnership in atk, scoffs that his new brand did anything that wasn't on the up and up, calling the complaint \" absurd \" and saying atk filed the suit just to drum up press for itself. \" i want to respond carefully to everything factually, \" he says, noting his legal team is working on a rebuttal to the complaint. \" if i start getting into the details, it's just going to be a pissing contest. \"",

Mr. Kimball eventually stopped coming to the office, telling people there he had been fired. It was a brutal few months of battle, especially for the kimball loyalists who would eventually leave with him to start christopher kimball's milk street, a cooking school, magazine, tv and radio enterprise that has a more global focus than america's test kitchen.

Those excerpts included cosby's admission under oath that he had obtained quaaludes, the brand name for a sedative widely abused as a recreational drug in the 1970s, with the intent of giving the pills to young women in order to have sex with them. On july 8, constand filed papers in court seeking to unseal the entire deposition and her settlement agreement with cosby, as well as to free her from any confidentiality restrictions.

Invisible obama apparently didn't seem to come up with any good answers to eastwood's grilling about afghanistan and jobs — if we could take clint at his word. The president's only imaginary contribution appeared to be an obscene suggestion about what clint — and mitt romney — should go do to themselves. \" what do you want me to tell romney? \" clint asked invisible obama. \" i can't tell him to do that. I can't tell him to do that to himself. \" viewers couldn't quite decide if the ad-libbed ramble by the 82-year-old actor/director was appalling or thrillingly crazed. The washington post's chris cillizza said the speech \" bordered on downright incoherence several times, \" and time magazine called it a \" train wreck \" by a \" rambling old dude. \" yahoo news skewered it as a \" fistful of incoherence, \" and \" every which way and loose, \" but kind of...

        "summary": "Tragedy on the hudson: a vintage world war ii plane crashed in the river friday night, killing the pilot. Witnesses say smoke came from the single-seat p-47 thunderbolt fighter as it made a u-turn before crashing into the water near the george washington bridge. It was submerged within seconds. Divers recovered the body of the pilot, 56-year-old bill gordon, around three hours later, the ap reports. The plane, which was based at long island's american airpower museum, had been taking part in a photo shoot with two other planes to promote this weekend's bethpage air show. Some witnesses say they thought the plane was performing an acrobatic stunt — until it went into the water. \" it suffered some sort of catastrophic failure and the pilot decided to put it down in the hudson, \" museum spokesman gary lewi tells the new york daily news. \" it's a tragedy. \" the museum had planned to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the p-47 this weekend. The crashed plane, known as \" jacky's revenge, \" flew periodically to air shows, lewi says. Gordon, former chief pilot of the old rhinebeck aerodrome, was an experienced pilot who had flown a variety of different vintage aircraft.",

But by the time researchers arrived at the cave known as chan hol, thieves had already absconded with the skeleton, leaving behind only fragments and a pelvic bone partially embedded in a stalagmite, nature reports. \" what would you want with a skeleton? would you take it home? \" stinnesbeck wonders. Now it appears the boosted bones comprise one of the oldest skeletons ever found in the americas. A study published wednesday in plos one states the remains are likely more than 13,000 years old. It turns out the stalagmite represented — in the words of stinnesbeck, who eventually dated the bones — a \" perfect opportunity. \" not only did it prevent the thieves from taking the pelvic bone, it allowed scientists to date the skeleton in a roundabout way. Earlier attempts to date the bones were all over the place because years of being underwater had stolen the collagen typically used to do so, cosmos reports. Instead, researchers were able to accurately date the stalagmite growing around the bone. They say the results show the skeleton — which likely belonged to a young man who died back when the cave was above water — is at least 11,300 years old but likely more than 13,000 years old.

The first humans probably arrived in north america during the late pleistocene era, and the oldest evidence of their presence can be found in sunny, tropical mexico, which then was an arid landscape. \"it looks as if the oldest osteological remains of humans in the americas are all reported from the tulum",
            "Radioactive dating of skeletal remains unearthed in a mexican cave indicates the area was settled by humans at least 13,000 years ago. Research conducted by a team led by wolfgang stinnesbeck of heidelberg university in germany set out to resolve contradictory previous results obtained using carbon-14 dating by testing the location using a different technique, known as uranium-thorium dating. This method measures the degree to which naturally occurring uranium-234 – with a half-life of 245,000 years – decays into thorium-230, with a half-life of 75,000 years. The method is accurate up to a range of half a million years recommended new evidence places humans in america 130,000 years ago palaeontology in a study published in the journal plos one,"

In the latest effort on the energy front, president nicolas maduro had the country move its clocks forward a half hour on sunday, the bbc reports. Science and technology minister jorge arreaza noted that nighttime lighting and ac use were a major drain on the national power grid and gave the \" simple \" directive a pleasant spin: it \" will allow us to enjoy more daylight, and it won't get dark so early. \" plunging global oil prices and a prolonged drought have pushed the oil-rich country, which relies heavily on hydroelectricity, to the brink. Residents in some areas have been experiencing four-hour daily blackouts since march, per vice. One man, who lives in the state of barinas says he initially thought using candles for light was romantic; now he's over it. Rain in venezuela has decreased some 40 % in recent years. Nonetheless, critics of maduro, successor to the late hugo chavez, accuse his government of mismanagement, and the bbc reports political opponents amassed almost 2 million signatures in their push to secure a referendum to oust him. In another blow, venezuela's largest brewer of beer shut down operations friday, leaving just enough beer to dull the pain of existence for one more week, the wall street journal reports.",

A gofundme campaign set up to raise $ 10,000 for daniel's memorial has raised $ 77,000 as of this writing. Silive.com reports daniel's suicide was one of three in staten island last week.

But, like antidepressants, psychotherapy's usefulness may be overstated, researchers say, per the new york times — by as much as 25 %, finds a study in plos one. \" this doesn't mean that psychotherapy doesn't work, \" says study co-author steven hollon. \" it just doesn't work as well as you would think from reading the scientific literature. \" and that scientific literature may be partly to blame, the times notes. Due to publication bias, studies that have more positive outcomes are more likely to end up published. \" it's like flipping a bunch of coins and only keeping the ones that come up heads, \" hollon says in a press release. Researchers tracked down all nih grants awarded from 1972 to 2008 for studies examining \" talk therapy \" — such as interpersonal and cognitive behavior therapies — to treat depression. Of the 55 studies found, 13 ( which mainly showed no psychotherapy benefits ) were never published. When the researchers tracked down the original data for those studies and included it in their calculations, talk therapy's effectiveness dropped by about 25 % — \" the same [ bias ] as you see in the pharma trials \" for antidepressants, co-author erick turner tells the times. That doesn't negate either drugs or therapy for treating depression, though the times writes that it's a \" difference that suggests that hundreds of thousands of patients are less likely to benefit. \" ( a recent study found a common antidepressant is unsafe for teens. )",

Some of them: among the children who survived: those who pretended they were dead, even after being shot. Bloomberg talks to syed basit naqvi, who says boys in his room were lined up one by one and systematically shot in the head. The 13-year-old ducked slightly as he was fired upon. \" the bullet slightly hit my head and i deliberately fell down, \" he says. He suspects the gunman believed he was dead and moved on. He then hid behind a chair with three other survivors, surrounded by his classmates and their blood. His mother, a teacher at the school, was killed. He learned this firsthand: he was in the same ambulance as her body. Bloomberg describes the principal's office as \" completely black. \" a military spokesman cites reports that \" the principal was burned when she tried to stop attackers from killing children. \" a number of staff shared her fate ( reports variously say nine or 10 were killed ): one student told ndtv, via the guardian, \" as soon as we hid under tables, they fired bullets at our legs and our heads and then they burned our madam. They burned our madam. \" a military source tells nbc news, \" they burnt a teacher in front of the students in a classroom. They literally set the teacher on fire with gasoline and made the kids watch. \" of another teacher: \" one of my teachers was crying, she was shot in the hand and she was crying in pain, \" a teen survivor tells reuters. \" one terrorist then walked up to her and started shooting her until she stopped making any sound. \" he was shot in both legs and managed to hide under a desk. Shahrukh khan tells afp he shoved his tie in his mouth to keep himself from screaming. \" i lay as still as i could and closed my eyes, waiting to get shot again. My body was shivering.

        "summary": "President trump has been critical of costs associated with air force one in the past, calling them \" out of control \" just before taking office, cnn reports. So it's unclear how he feels about the $ 23.6 million contract the us air force signed with boeing last month to replace two of the presidential plane's refrigerators. Experts tell defense one this isn't a case of boeing making a hefty profit off american taxpayers but rather a result of requirements placed on air force one by the air force and white house military office. The two refrigeration units being replaced came with air force one in 1990 and are different from at-home refrigerators and the \" coolboxes \" found in other planes. Air force spokesperson ann sefanek says the units ' \" reliability has decreased with failures increasing. \" air force one has five \" chillers \" with 26 total compartments for keeping food cold and frozen. Those chillers need to store enough food to feed air force one's passengers and crew for weeks without resupplying — about 3,000 meals. Stefanek says the two new units will provide \" nearly 70 cubic feet \" of refrigeration and freezing. The nearly $ 24 million bill will cover design, manufacturing, installation, and testing. Still, one former senior adviser to president obama tweets they \" would have been impeached \" if they spent $ 24 million on refrigerators. The guardian notes that money could fund about eight weekend visits to mar-a-lago by trump or two months of presidential security at trump tower in new york city. The fridge replacement project is expected to be completed by october 2019.",

Jones, 26, said she was raped in 2005 while working for kbr at camp hope, baghdad. Jones sued kbr, its former parent halliburton co., and a former kbr firefighter, charles bortz, whom she identified as one of her rapists. The houston-based companies and bortz denied her allegations. The alleged sexual assault was investigated by authorities but no criminal charges were filed. \" i was going up against a monster, \" jones, sobbing loudly, told the associated press. \" i ' m devastated. I believe i did the right thing coming forward. \" kbr applauded the jury's verdict, which in addition to rejecting jones ' claims that she was raped also denied her fraud claim against the company. \" since 2005, kbr has been subjected to a continuing series of lies perpetuated by the",
            "Jurors in a federal courtroom on friday rejected a former conroe woman's claims that she was drugged and raped by several kellogg brown &amp; root firefighters while working for the company in iraq in 2005. The jury also rejected jamie leigh jones ' claims that the former halliburton subsidiary committed fraud by \" inducing her to enter into an employment contract. \" by answering \" no \" to those two questions, the jurors rendered the other 12 questions in the jury charge moot, bringing an end to the month-long trial of jones ' lawsuit. Jones, 26, sued kbr and former kbr firefighter charles boartz, 34, in 2007, accusing the defense contractor of creating a \" sexually hostile work environment \" by neglecting its sexual harassment policies. Boartz was the only defendant identified by name in the alleged sexual assault she said occurred while working at kbr's camp hope installation in iraq in 2005. Jones said the attack was so brutal that she required two reconstructive surgeries to her chest and more than 200 visits to psychiatrists to treat post traumatic stress disorder. She also alleged employees of the houston-based company imprisoned her in a shipping container after she reported the attack, telling jurors she was denied food, water and the chance to call her family for help.

        "summary": "The supreme court says employers can prohibit their workers from banding together to complain about pay and conditions in the workplace. The justices ruled 5-4 monday, with the court's conservative members in the majority, that businesses can force employees to individually use arbitration to resolve disputes, per the ap. The outcome is an important victory for business interests. An estimated 25 million employees work under contracts that prohibit collective action by employees who want to raise claims about some aspect of their employment. As usa today notes, many don't become aware of the restriction until a workplace issue surfaces and they learn they're barred from joining a class-action suit. The trump administration backed the businesses, reversing the position the obama administration took in favor of employees. The court's task was to reconcile federal laws that seemed to point in different directions. On the one hand, new deal labor laws explicitly gave workers the right to band together. On the other, the older federal arbitration act encourages the use of arbitration, instead of the courts. Justice neil gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the contracts are valid under the arbitration law. \" as a matter of policy these questions are surely debatable. But as a matter of law the answer is clear, \" gorsuch wrote. In dissent for the court's liberals, justice ruth bader ginsburg called the decision \" egregiously wrong. \" ginsburg said that the individual complaints can be very small in dollar terms, \" scarcely of a size warranting the expense of seeking redress alone. \"",

In a statement tuesday, the band says lead singer and songwriter gord downie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in december.

        "summary": "Colin firth stands alone. A new study commissioned by the drama channel finds that the \" real \" mr. Darcy wouldn't have been anywhere near as attractive in today's world as firth's infamous, wet-shirted portrayal in a 1995 adaptation of pride and prejudice. The study was done just ahead of the 200th anniversary of jane austen's death, the new york times reports. In her famous novel, austen doesn't offer much description of darcy, only that he's meant to be supremely attractive. According to the guardian, that's resulted in actors who are \" tall, dark, and ruggedly handsome \" being tasked to play the character in modern adaptations. But it's unlikely darcy would have looked anything like that. Working with experts in the social history and fashions of the late 1700s and early 1800s, illustrator nick hardcastle produced what's being called the first historically accurate portrait of darcy. He has slender shoulders, a pointy chin, a small mouth, an undefined chest, a pale complexion, and his hair is powdered white. One of the experts behind the study tells the bbc the portrait \" reflects the male physique and common features at the time. \" it also reflects some of the men austen was romantically involved with during her life. And back in her day, someone who looked like colin firth would be seen as a laborer, not a gentleman. ( eight classic books creative people love. )",

Their class-action lawsuit attacking the company for luring clueless children with \" addictive, \" expensive game apps was recently given the go-ahead by a san jose judge. Games are \" highly addictive, designed deliberately to be so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $ 100 per purchase or more, \" according to court documents. The apps can often be downloaded for free, but kids can rack up big bills purchasing extra levels and items. \" smurfberries, \" for example, which serve as currency in the smurfs game, sell in batches costing up to $ 59, notes msnbc. Children are usually not required to provide credit card information, and the costs are automatically billed to parents ' itunes accounts. Apple was recently forced to change security settings on iphones to block such charges. In one case, a 7-year-old british boy racked up a $ 2,000 bill on an ipad buying animals for the tap zoo game, reports the daily mail. Parents say that it's all part of a devious plan, while apple has argued that it's easy for parents to block their children from making such charges.",

Owner ron shore says he had his \" maltese eagle, \" valued between $ 5 million and $ 9 million, in his backpack on sunday when he was robbed after attending a church concert in vancouver, reports ctv. He had apparently just picked it up from an art gallery where it was on display, and one person at the church concert tells ctv that shore was happily talking about having it on him. After the concert, witnesses say they saw two men beat shore on the street before grabbing his backpack, reports the national post. \" i struggled as hard as i could and yet wasn't able to prevent the robbery, \" shore tells cbc news. He was treated at a hospital and released. Police are saying little about the incident other than they are trying to \" establish exactly what happened \" and get descriptions of the assailants. Shore says he mortgaged his house to commission the statue years ago after his sister-in-law died of breast cancer. \" i thought the bulk of my life had been selfish and i had not given back to the community enough, \" he tells cnn. He wrote a book with clues to a real-life treasure hunt — the eagle was one reward — and says he hoped to raise $ 100 million for breast cancer charities, but book sales were poor. Recently, he had hoped to sell the statue and use the proceeds to fund a charity concert. But \" without the eagle, i don't have anything, \" he says. It's not clear whether the piece is insured. \" i'd hate to think it'd be melted down, \" says sculptor kevin peters, who worked on the eagle several years ago. \" that's my fear. \" ( there's $ 10 million in gold and silver hidden in utah. )",

The team also released a point-by-point rebuttal of the article, which deadspin and espn break down into highlights: based on rice's account of the elevator assault, bisciotti believed the player had \" slapped [ wife ] janay with an open hand \" and she hit her head while falling. Gm ozzie newsome also said rice downplayed the attack: \" the video was much more violent than what i had pictured, \" he said. Ravens director of security darren sanders denied espn's claim that he had received an account of the assault \" within hours \" of it happening. In fact he struggled to get a copy of the video and later heard a vague verbal account of the attack from a police officer. Bisciotti took issue with espn's interpretation of a text exchange between him and rice. In his texts, bisciotti offered the player a job when he was done playing football: \" i will help you make it a great life indeed, \" bisciotti texted. \" i give you my word. \" espn portrayed that as a reward for rice sticking \" to the story that he had misled team officials \" about the assault. Bisciotti's version: he \" felt awful about what had happened, \" believed rice was \" at heart, a good person, \" and \" wanted to tell him i would be supportive of him. \" but espn isn't budging: \" we stand by our reporting, \" a spokesperson said.

Bisciotti claims that all the anonymous sources on the ravens ' alleged mishandling on the situation are \" ray's attorney, ray's agent, and ray's friends, \" and that the story was \" manufactured. \" in their rebuttal, the ravens never really offer a good answer for why they didn't get videotape from inside the revel casino elevator. Instead, it seems like more of the same — they believed that video would show something that made it ok for rice to hit his fiancée. Bisciotti: \" [ i ] t was our understanding based on ray's account that in the course of a physical altercation between the two of them he slapped janay with an open hand, and that she hit her head against the elevator rail or wall as she fell to the ground. \" ravens director of security darren sanders: \" i did not receive an account of what happened in the elevator ' within hours ' of the incident.

            "The ravens took the weekend to marshal a response to espn's big ray rice story, and it's here — in the form of a press conference by owner steve bisciotti and an online rebuttal to points made in the espn report. Bisciotti claims that all the anonymous sources on the ravens ' alleged mishandling on the situation are \" ray's attorney, ray's agent, and ray's friends, \" and that the story was \" manufactured. \" in their rebuttal, the ravens never really offer a good answer for why they didn't get videotape from inside the revel casino elevator. Instead, it seems like more of the same — they believed that video would show something that made it ok for rice to hit his fiancée. Bisciotti: \" [ i ] t was our understanding based on ray's account that in the course of a physical altercation between the two of them he slapped janay with an open hand, and that she hit her head against the elevator rail or wall as she fell to the ground. \" ravens director of security darren sanders: \" i did not receive an account of what happened in the elevator ' within hours ' of the incident.

Investigator christopher serino's name came up again in the fbi report ( which was based on interviews with him, zimmerman's ex-fiancee, witnesses, and colleagues, among others ). Serino told the fbi that george zimmerman might have had a \" little hero complex, \" but that he didn't think racism drove him to shoot trayvon, suggesting his confronting of trayvon was more about the young man's hoodie than the color of his skin. Serino told the fbi he felt pressured to file charges against zimmerman by a sergeant and two other officers, even though he didn't believe there was sufficient evidence, the miami herald adds. Fbi interviews conducted with zimmerman's friends and acquaintances also revealed no evidence of racism; they portrayed him as a \" decent guy \" who moved easily between different races, reports the new york times. Released documents also show that zimmerman was estranged from his parents and had an especially difficult relationship with his mother, who, according to one friend, \" was known to hit him all the time. \"",

Sharok jacobi sued windsor locks and its police force in 2012 for violating free speech, privacy, and association rights, as well as targeting the hotel's predominantly african-american and hispanic clients. But a federal judge ruled this week that sex in a hotel bar, \" however creative or undisguised, \" as the guardian puts it, is simply not a form of protected free speech — much like prostitution. It all started in 2007 when neighbors began to complain about the hotel, known at times as windsor lounge or as club 91. A group called \" hot couples \" had gotten busy organizing parties that, as two undercover liquor control agents put it, involved \" men and women exposing their genitals, fondling others ' genitals, engaging in oral sex, and masturbating. \" jacobi and others were arrested and in the years to come other allegations ensued. Federal judge michael shea has now thrown out all of jacobi's complaints, saying the sex parties weren't protected as free speech because they \" involved no stage or performance aspect... And was not accompanied by any advocacy of a particular lifestyle, \" per the washington post.

        "summary": "Scientists say they have a new way of determining suicide risk, and it's based on genetics — requiring only a blood test. Researchers running postmortem genome scans of brain samples found that the brains of those who'd committed suicide had less of a gene called ska2, as well as higher levels of methylation, a chemical process that affects the gene's function, the daily beast reports. The gene may play a key role in our response to stress, a researcher says. Researchers applied their findings to blood samples from 325 participants in their study, the washington post reports. They sought to predict whether participants had experienced suicidal thoughts, and the results were 80 % to 90 % accurate. Researchers want to use the findings to help fight military suicide — which occurs at a rate some 50 % higher than that of the population as a whole, the daily beast notes ( though the military reported a decrease in suicides last year ). An outside expert points out to the post, however, that more than just one chemical indicator is needed to assess suicide risk in patients.

The johns hopkins researchers looked at how a group of chemicals known as methyls affect the gene ska2, which modifies how the brain reacts to stress hormones. If the gene's function is impaired by a chemical change, someone who is stressed won't be able to shut down the effect of the stress hormone, which would be like having a faulty brake pad in a car for the fear center of the brain, worsening the impact of even everyday stresses. Researchers studied about 150 postmortem brain samples of healthy people and those with mental illness, including some who had committed suicide.

The 24-year-old's strange condition was discovered when she went to doctors because of a monthlong bout of nausea and vomiting. The patient told the doctors she had also experienced dizziness her entire life. She didn't start walking until she was four and had never been able to walk steadily. When the doctors scanned the woman's brain, they found she had no cerebellum, a region of the brain thought to be crucial for walking and other movements.

He quotes numbers 11: 12 — \" carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child \" — as a sort of introduction to his unusual personal challenge: to see if a man can lactate. Thomsen writes that male lactation has been observed in fruit bats, goats, and guinea pigs; so why not humans? and he was irked that the assumption that men can't breastfeed has been used in the courtroom as an argument against gay marriage. So the 33-year-old, writing for slate, set out to produce some milk. First, a science lesson: a hormone called prolactin is what causes the breast tissue of both men and women to lactate. Thomsen could, in theory, take a drug to stimulate his body's production of it, but he was unsure of both the side effect and his chances of getting a doctor to prescribe it to him. So he decided to try a nipple-based method: using a manual breast pump, which \" ideally involves pumping each breast every three hours around the clock, \" while downing an \" organic lactation booster from whole foods. \" but after seven monotonous weeks in which he spent hours pumping without producing a drop, thomsen realized what he was missing: the baby. \" for all our assumptions about breastfeeding, the one abiding truth is that it exists to nourish and comfort new life. The walls of gender could be broken down, but without a child to benefit, what was the point? \"",
