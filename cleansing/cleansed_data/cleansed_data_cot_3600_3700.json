A spokesperson offered a diplomatic reason, citing the israeli elections that take place just two weeks after the march 3 address: \" as a matter of long-standing practice and principle, we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections. \" given the tensions already present with netanyahu's surprise trip — the white house previously labeled it a breach of protocol — it's a safe bet something else might have come up to scuttle a meeting. John boehner invited to netanyahu to address congress without consulting the white house, and the israeli leader is expected to challenge obama's foreign policy views, especially on iran.

        "summary": "An archaeologist a continent away from egypt made what he calls an \" unbelievably astonishing \" discovery: a 2,500-year-old coffin that had always been assumed to be empty actually wasn't. Australian scientists led by dr. Jamie fraser of the university of sydney's nicholson museum tells the bbc the \" dowdy-looking \" sarcophagus, one of four the museum's founder obtained from egypt nearly 160 years ago, had been largely ignored in favor of the other three, which contained mummies. Reuters describes it as a chance find made when scientists decided to lift the lid in june. The university's muse magazine reports the coffin hadn't been opened in 20 years, and that it was recorded as containing \" mixed debris. \" not so: inside was about 10 % of a human body, comprised of feet and other bones. The rest was likely ravaged by tomb raider. Ct scans and an excavation concluded last week, though that won't be the end of the research. As fraser explains, the bones present a unique research opportunity, in that it's not considered ethical to test fully intact mummies; a partial one skirts that limitation. \" we can't do anything to the remains that the tomb raiders haven't already done, \" fraser notes. Radiocarbon testing will confirm whether the remains are indeed from about 600bc, as hieroglyphics on the coffin suggest. Those markings say it was made for a woman named mer-neith-it-es, who was possibly a high priestess. Australia's abc quotes egyptologist connie lord as describing another \" incredible \" and \" incredibly rare \" find: the resin that was poured into the mummy's skull post-brain removal remains; she describes it as similar to the one found in king tut's coffin.

The online retailer shoebuy.com has confirmed in a nationwide survey that women really do love their shoes — in ways that are a little surprising, the oklahoman reports. The findings are from 1,000 women ages 35-44, says stylecaster: 20 % admit they're more aroused by new shoes than by their significant others. Half admit to judging someone based on their shoes ( among those, 50 % were negative ). One in four won't take heels off, no matter the pain ( even if it means popping a pill for relief ). Nearly a third of women buy four to seven pairs of shoes annually, meaning they ' ll buy 500 in all. Half are willing to lie about what they really paid for their shoes. So is this why women save far less for retirement than men — because they're buying shoes? some readers said so after jonnelle marte wrote about women's lack of savings at the washington post, and research shows that women do outspend men $ 534 to $ 205 on personal care and services ( shoes included ). But men spend more on alcohol, so women likely save less because they earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, writes marte.

Alexander travis, who runs the lab at the baker institute for animal health at cornell university's college of veterinary medicine. The seven puppies — the survivors of 19 embryos implanted in the mother, notes the guardian — are a mix of beagle, labrador, and cocker spaniel and are now healthy 5-month-olds. All were adopted except for one female who's being kept by the lab to have her own litter. The lab kept track of the puppies by painting their nails with different color polish. Travis adopted two, still known by their nail polish names, red and green. In vitro fertilization has been possible in humans since 1978, but ivf efforts with dogs repeatedly failed until now. \" the biology of the dog is really, really different than humans, \" says a reproductive physiologist for the smithsonian conservation biology institute, which works with cornell, hailing the birth as a \" huge breakthrough. \" dog pregnancies last only two months and females go into heat just once or twice a year, releasing immature eggs instead of mature eggs needed for ivf. To compensate, researchers left eggs in the dogs ' oviducts a day longer than normal, notes the guardian, allowing them to mature. The lead author of the plos one paper on the feat says that doggy ivf could prove useful in everything from conserving endangered species to removing \" deleterious traits from breeds, \" and could extend to \" models for human disease \" as well.",

But the litter of seven will go down in history for more than the colours that tell them apart. Now five months old and doing well, the dogs are the first to be born through ivf. The healthy delivery of the dogs by caesarean section on 10 july marks a success that has eluded scientists for 40 years since efforts began in the mid-1970s. The procedure could transform attempts to save endangered dog species, and potentially help prevent the genetic disorders that afflict so many breeds. Born to the same beagle mother, the puppies included two produced from a different beagle mother and a cocker spaniel father, and five from two other pairings of beagles. The seven pregnancies came after 19 ivf embryos were transferred to the mother, according to a report in plos one. Dog days: britain's endangered breeds read more \"we had people lined up, each with a towel, to grab a puppy and rub them and warm them up, \" said alex travis, a specialist in reproductive biology at cornell university, in ithaca, new york. \"when you hear that first cry and they start wriggling a bit, it's pure happiness. You're ecstatic that they're all healthy and alive",
            "Abstract development of assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) in the dog has resisted progress for decades, due to their unique reproductive physiology. This lack of progress is remarkable given the critical role art could play in conserving endangered canid species or eradicating heritable disease through gene-editing technologies — an approach that would also advance the dog as a biomedical model. Over 350 heritable disorders/traits in dogs are homologous with human conditions, almost twice the number of any other species. Here we report the first live births from in vitro fertilized embryos in the dog. Adding to the practical significance, these embryos had also been cryopreserved. Changes in handling of both gametes enabled this progress. The medium previously used to capacitate sperm excluded magnesium because it delayed spontaneous acrosome exocytosis. We found that magnesium significantly enhanced sperm hyperactivation and ability to undergo physiologically-induced acrosome exocytosis, two functions essential to fertilize an egg. Unlike other mammals, dogs ovulate a primary oocyte, which reaches metaphase ii on days 4 – 5 after the luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surge. We found that only on day 6 are oocytes consistently able to be fertilized. In vitro fertilization of day 6 oocytes with sperm capacitated in medium supplemented with magnesium resulted in high rates of embryo development ( 78.8 %, n = 146 ).

The seven pregnancies came after 19 ivf embryos were transferred to the mother, according to a report in plos one. Dog days: britain's endangered breeds read more \"we had people lined up, each with a towel, to grab a puppy and rub them and warm them up, \" said alex travis, a specialist in reproductive biology at cornell university, in ithaca, new york. \"when you hear that first cry and they start wriggling a bit, it's pure happiness. You're ecstatic that they're all healthy and alive",
            "Abstract development of assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) in the dog has resisted progress for decades, due to their unique reproductive physiology. This lack of progress is remarkable given the critical role art could play in conserving endangered canid species or eradicating heritable disease through gene-editing technologies — an approach that would also advance the dog as a biomedical model. Over 350 heritable disorders/traits in dogs are homologous with human conditions, almost twice the number of any other species. Here we report the first live births from in vitro fertilized embryos in the dog. Adding to the practical significance, these embryos had also been cryopreserved. Changes in handling of both gametes enabled this progress. The medium previously used to capacitate sperm excluded magnesium because it delayed spontaneous acrosome exocytosis. We found that magnesium significantly enhanced sperm hyperactivation and ability to undergo physiologically-induced acrosome exocytosis, two functions essential to fertilize an egg. Unlike other mammals, dogs ovulate a primary oocyte, which reaches metaphase ii on days 4 – 5 after the luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surge. We found that only on day 6 are oocytes consistently able to be fertilized. In vitro fertilization of day 6 oocytes with sperm capacitated in medium supplemented with magnesium resulted in high rates of embryo development ( 78.8 %, n = 146 ). Intra-oviductal transfer of nineteen cryopreserved, in vitro fertilization ( ivf )"

Vulture sees a double meaning: a reference to the targaryen dragon, daenerys, and the stark wolf, jon snow, and the likelihood that snow is actually a targaryen ( son of rhaegar ) and a stark ( son of lyanna ). Writing for vanity fair, joanna robinson sees what's potentially a \" third and more exciting meaning, \" that the title refers not to the offspring of the dragon and the wolf, but the dragon and the wolf themselves, who could appear in a flashback. Aisling franciosi already appeared in a season 6 flashback as lyanna; robinson digs up some evidence that a rhaegar was cast when the show was in production in the fall.",

Whatever the meaning, there's a good chance the episode will end up as the most-watched got, if this season's current rating trends are any indication.

Jay nixon's veto of the bill — which he called \" extreme and disrespectful \" toward women — was overridden by the legislature by the skin of its teeth last night in a record budget session. The gop rolled out a rarely used procedure to kill a democratic filibuster and force the bill into law, the st. Louis post-dispatch adds. It will take effect within the month and triples the waiting period from 24 to 72 hours after a doctor visit before a woman can get an abortion, the kansas city star explains. Only south dakota's abortion laws are stricter; utah's waiting period is also 72 hours, but exceptions are allowed. The wait is being called a \" reflection period \" by supporters. \" another 48 hours could very well be the difference between a life saved and a life ended. Knowing that a life is at stake, this is the least we can do for these children, \" one senator who sponsored the bill tells the star. Abortion rights activists were quick to criticize the new law, which \" represents the latest intrusion of politicians into a woman's private medical decisions, \" the state's aclu chief says. Reps with planned parenthood in st. Louis — which runs the state's only licensed abortion clinic — tell the ap that the waiting period puts unneeded financial strain on women already traveling up to 100 miles for the procedure.

        "summary": "Researchers say they've found the \" obvious candidate \" for the source of a mysterious radiation cloud that hovered over much of europe last month before dispersing, npr reports. More than 40 countries detected a radioactive isotope called ruthenium-106 in the atmosphere. Ruthenium is not found in nature, and danish researcher sven poul nielsen says the detection of it last month was \" strange \" because it's the first time it has ever been found without being accompanied by other types of radiation. Typically if ruthenium is in the atmosphere, something very bad has happened. For example, its detection was one of the first signs of the infamous 1986 meltdown at chernobyl. But this time no country has announced an accident involving ruthenium-106. Regardless, scientists now believe they know the source: the research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad, russia. French and german analysis of weather patterns and ruthenium detection point to the dimitrovgrad region. Also, one process that produces ruthenium as a byproduct is the creation of a popular medical isotope. Riar is one of the few places that makes it. Scientists admit there are other possible sources of the ruthenium cloud, but riar makes the most sense. A spokesperson at riar says the facility hasn't produced any ruthenium in the past six months. And russia is continuing to deny responsibility. \" none of the enterprise of the russian nuclear industry has recorded radiation levels that exceed the norm, \" the new york times quotes russian officials as saying.",

            "Australian troops are bracing for violent protests in afghanistan over the likely release this month of a new film mocking islam. Riots were sparked across the islamic world in september after a 14-minute trailer for the \" innocence of muslims \" video was released on youtube. Troops are now on heightened alert to the risk of another round of protests because a derivative film called \" the innocent prophet \" is slated to be released on friday. The new footage created by an ex- muslim originally from pakistan has already inflamed tensions in his former home country ahead of its release. Coalition forces are prepared for extreme reactions to the provocative video that could hamper their efforts in neighbouring afghanistan, which is already a tinder box of religious sensitivities. Defence forces are warned to be wary of inadvertently offending locals as part of their preparations for deployment to the main australian base in uruzgan province or other centres of kabul and kandahar. Cultural sensitivity training is a standard element of soldiers ' pre-deployment training in australia. But the key points are drilled into all military and civilian personnel going to work in afghanistan in another intensive four day program at the al minhad air base outside dubai. The training includes appropriate ways to handle and store the koran, which is generally wrapped in a cloth and only opened after the reader has ritually cleansed themselves. This preparation has taken on extra urgency in the aftermath of an increase in insider attacks against coalition forces. Retribution for perceived slights on islam are thought to be one possible trigger for these turncoat attacks, which claimed three out of the seven diggers ' lives lost in afghanistan this year. Coalition forces are wary of violent reactions from afghans who are upset by breaches of religious protocol. Days of rioting ensued after coalition soldiers burned copies of the koran when they were disposing of old books at the bagram air base near kabul last february.

Night shyamalan fans? well, then we have some bad news, because after earth appears to be a train wreck of epic proportions. But if you just love reading snarky movie reviews, then the news is good indeed. Here's what people are saying: \" is after earth the worst movie ever made? \" asks joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. Heck, \" it doesn't seem like a movie at all, but a sermon. \" will smith's character endlessly pontificates at his son, uttering his \" almost literally unspeakable dialogue \" very.... Very.... Slowly … for … some … reason. \" i've never seen a movie that moves so slowly, or takes itself so seriously. \" by the end \" you're actively cheering for a teenage kid to get eaten by a tiger, \" writes laremy legel at film.com. \" i didn't plan to feel this way … but you did this to me, after earth, \" by making your characters so horrifically unlikeable — one's a jerk, the other's a \" nincompoop. \" the story, meanwhile, \" stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can't even be considered a rough draft. \" lou lumenick at the new york post gives it one star, and it's only getting that much \" because smith's longtime enablers at sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie. \" even now, the movie is likely to put you to sleep. After this ( and his last decade of duds ), \" director m. Night shyamalan would be lucky to get a gig directing traffic. \" but dana stevens at slate cuts the film a tiny amount of slack. \" once you accept the elemental simplicity of after earth's plot... You can stop resenting the movie for all the things it's not ( a rollicking summer actioner, a typical shyamalan twist-based narrative ), \" she writes. And \" there's a compelling creepiness to this quasi-mythical quest tale. \" but jaden smith simply isn't ready to \" carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders. \"",

But when police arrived on the scene, the freemans'daughter, ashley, and her best friend lauria bible, both 16 and having a sleepover in the home, were nowhere to be found, reports the oklahoman. Now new leads in not just oklahoma but kansas and missouri have lauria's mother, lorene, launching her own campaign for help on facebook, and investigators asking anyone for any information they may have, reports fox23. The case had a few odd details from the get-go. Lauria's car, for instance, was parked near the charred remains of the home, her keys still in the ignition, and her purse, which contained money, was found among the ruins. Investigators also found an arsenal of weapons — danny freeman was said to have dealt marijuana — though his arrowhead collection was never recovered. Jeremy jones, a convicted rapist and killer now on death row in alabama, once confessed to killing the couple and later the girls, but his leads never played out and he has since recanted; the owner of the property was later convicted of murdering another girl, reports the miami news-record. \" there are still people scared of whoever did this, \" bible says. \" i need information that will lead to something good. \" ( this teen's disappearance finally looks solved 25 years later. )",

A sampling: pageant truthers: it didn't take long for the conspiracy theories to begin, notes the washington post. One tweet with a common sentiment: \" i generally don't buy into conspiracy theories, but this is the most attention the miss universe pageant has gotten since, well, ever. \" others speculated that host steve harvey orchestrated it to boost his syndicated talk show. Whose mistake? harvey has now taken full blame for misreading the card he was holding, but usa today reports that he initially blamed the teleprompter for giving him bogus information. Look for the big print: business insider takes a look at the card that apparently confused harvey. Trump's suggestion: donald trump, no stranger to pageant drama, suggested a solution on the today show, reports the daily news. \" i would recommend that they go have a beautiful ceremony, which is good for the brand and good for miss universe, and do a co-winner. I think something like that could work. \" but he couldn't resist, in a tweet, gloating that this kind of thing wouldn't have happened if he still owned the pageant. Classy response: \" everything happens for a reason, \" miss colombia ariadna gutierrez said after her ever-so-brief reign. \" i ' m happy....

So the us readied what it called \" stay-behind agents \" in an operation dubbed \" washtub, \" among other names. These agents would hide in bunkers packed with food and communication equipment and report to the government on russian movements, the ap notes. Officials recognized the high risk of the mission and planned for backup agents outside alaska who could be deposited in the territory by plane.

Researchers at the state university of new york tested 259 bottles of water bought in nine countries, including the us, and found that 93 % of them were contaminated with tiny plastic particles, the guardian reports. The team says they found an average 10.4 pieces of plastic at least the size of a hair per liter. An average of 314 smaller particles per liter were also believed to be plastic. Some bottles had thousands of particles. The researchers say that despite some bottled water brands being marketed as purer, contamination was around double that found in an earlier study on microplastic contamination of tap water. Researchers, who used dye to detect the particles, say there are many ways the microplastics could have entered the water, including from the plastic bottle tops. The health implications of consuming microplastics are still unclear, though researchers warn that they can absorb harmful chemicals. \" if you've ever had chili or spaghetti and you put it in tupperware, and you can't scrub the orange color out, that's a manifestation of how plastics absorb oily chemicals, \" max liboiron of the civic laboratory for environmental action research tells the cbc.

A previous study also found high levels of microplastics in tap water. In the new study, analysis of 259 bottles from 19 locations in nine countries across 11 different brands found an average of 325 plastic particles for every litre of water being sold.

When it comes to drones, the lithium-ion batteries and plastic parts might be able to damage an engine's rotating components, and the faa warned last week that \" operating drones around airplanes and helicopters is dangerous and illegal, \" and those who do so \" may be subject to stiff fines and criminal charges, including possible jail time. \" it tells nbc that it does plan to develop such engine testing in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1.",

Ean bordeaux says he awoke early friday morning to find his cart — which he runs for a living — in flames outside. He ran out to smother the fire and saw a man running away, so he called the police. Then the stranger returned, apparently to re-light the fire. \" i see a masked white man — and this is the hood, so i don't know what masked white men are doing in the ghetto, \" bordeaux told arkansas matters. Bordeaux tackled the man, who fell face-first on the pavement and later died. Bordeaux identified him right away as todd payne, a former police officer who served 20 years before being fired in 2010 for several violations, including fleeing the scene of a dui crash, intimidating witnesses, and lying to superiors. What's more, bordeaux had written about payne ( and even called him \" creepy todd \" ) on his blog. In fact, police say the two had worked in the same area and disagreed about things before, katv reports. Now authorities have released bordeaux without charges while the county prosecutor reviews the case — which bordeaux says is straightforward. \" why would i want someone to die? \" he said. \" i want justice and justice doesn't require someone to die. \"",

Thiel pre-arranged the deal when the stock was still at that level, techcrunch notes. He still has 5.6 million shares. The journal is quick to note that thiel made a bundle off his original investment, and that early investors often sell off their stakes after a company goes public. Even so, the timing is bad for facebook, considering how poorly its stock is doing. \" imagine being a facebook employee right now and seeing thiel sell the majority of his stock at what many are hoping is its low point, \" writes billy gallagher on techcrunch.

Mr. Thiel, a partner at venture-capital firm founders fund, invested $ 500,000 in facebook in 2004 as its first major investor when the company was valued at a mere $ 4.9 million.

            "Facebook shares reached a record low for the third consecutive trading session monday, falling lower than half the price commanded in the company's record-breaking initial public offering before rallying to higher than $ 20. The world's most popular social network began its most recent descent thursday, when millions of shares belonging to early investors and insiders became available for trades as the first post-ipo lockup expired. Shares continued to slide friday, briefly hitting $ 19 in intraday trading, half the $ 38 ipo price just three months after the company's public debut. Monday morning, shares dipped lower than $ 19 for the first time, touching as low as $ 18.75; the stock rebounded, however",
            "Peter dasilva for the new york times in hindsight, perhaps instagram should have cut a different deal with facebook. In april, facebook agreed to acquire instagram, the hot social media photo-sharing site, in a deal valued at the time at about $ 1 billion. The problem is that facebook did not agree to pay $ 1 billion in cash. The deal terms said instagram would receive $ 300 million in cash and about 23 million shares of facebook stock once the deal closed. Facebook stock at the time of the deal was valued by the parties at about $ 30 a share. But since that time, facebook's initial public offering has taken place — and we all know what"

And costas said that decline is not about athletes ' knees but their brains. \" unless and until there is some technology which we cannot even imagine, let alone has been developed, that would make this inherently dangerous game not marginally safer, but acceptably safe, the cracks in the foundation are there, \" the washington post quotes costas as saying. Costas said this is not some \" left-wing conspiracy, \" adding: \" the truth is the truth. \" in one of three studies on cte released by boston university since july, researchers found evidence of cte in all but one of 111 brains belonging to former nfl players, the new york daily news reports. And costas noted that multiple independent studies show tackle football is most dangerous for the brains of youths under 20. He said parents will soon make the \" common-sense \" choice, as he would, to not let their kids play tackle football at least until they're 18, eroding the talent base for college football and the nfl. Espn's tony kornheiser agreed with costas at tuesday's event, saying the nfl could go the way of boxing. \" if they don't find a way to make it safe, and we don't see how they will... The game's not going to be around, \" he said.",

        "summary": "The plague is apparently a lot older than we thought. Scientists says the disease was responsible for a massive migration of people across europe and asia during the bronze age — approximately 3,000 years earlier than it was believed to have existed, according to a study published thursday in cell. Nature reports that scientists discovered a mass exodus from what is now russia and the ukraine between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago and were looking for what caused it. To that end, they studied 89 billion dna fragments from 101 bronze age skeletons. \"plague was just a long shot, \" researcher dr. Eske willerslev tells the new york times. Dna from the plague-causing yersinia pestis bacteria was found in the teeth of seven of the bronze age skeletons, the oldest having lived nearly 5,000 years ago in what is now russia, according to nature. \"to my mind, this leaves little doubt that [ the plague ] has played a major role in those population replacements, \" willerslev tells the times. According to nature, the bronze age plague strain is similar to the infamous black death and modern bubonic plague, though it probably didn't spread as easily. That's because researchers found it lacked the gene allowing it to live inside fleas, which are helpful when transporting the disease between rodents and humans. The ancient plague was still fatal in 90 % of cases, and the times reports humans may have helped it along by hunting infected rodents for food. ( this year, the us saw a first-of-its-kind case involving an infectious dog. )",

Unusually, the \" they \" in question are five nordic prime ministers, who posed for a photo monday in which they clutched a soccer ball — a seeming restaging of the photo president trump took with the leaders of saudi arabia and egypt in which they have their hands placed on a glowing orb. The prime ministers of denmark, finland, iceland, sweden, and norway were in the latter country for a meeting, and norway pm erna solberg posted the image to facebook on tuesday in a mash-up that placed the orb image on top. Her caption pointedly compared the two: translates reuters, \" who rules the world? riyadh vs bergen. Don't know what those in the upper photo were thinking. In the lower one are the five nordic prime ministers, holding a ball with the sustainability goals. We're hoping they ' ll be a roadmap for the future. \" but a norwegian official tells the ap that teasing wasn't intended, and claims solberg didn't initially realize the photo she took with lars lokke rasmussen, juha sipila, bjarni benediktsson, and stefan lofven ( of the aforementioned countries, respectively ) happened to parallel the orb one. He says the un sustainability goals the leaders were discussing were written on the ball. ( also being furiously discussed: the president's \" covfefe tweet. \" )",

A few years ago, a portion was distributed in $ 1 coins, but they were a bit heavy to haul around — so this year, hornady manufacturing opted for $ 2 bills. Bosses handed out $ 61,000 worth of the rare bills, an increase on last year's $ 48,000, they tell the grand island independent. Why the odd system? \" two years ago, we caught a lot of flack from the city council and some people in the city of grand island for how we don't support the community... Which we disagreed with, \" explains vp jason hornady. To prove the complaints weren't true, the company chose to make its contribution clear by paying $ 2-bill bonuses. \" ( we ) asked our employees to spend that money in town, and if people look at you funny, tell them where you work, and we think that they will notice, \" hornady says. The company orders the bills about a month in advance, he notes. Fortunately, the 300 workers don't have to deal entirely in $ 2 bills: \" they also receive a nice check and a deposit into their 401( k ) s, \" he adds. Hornady isn't the first company to use the tactic: in 2009, a pharmacist made a similar move in alabama, the press-register reported.

        "summary": "The world has seen the \" massacres, humanitarian tragedies, rapes, horrific violence, \" and other atrocities that unfold when isis seizes a town — and it needs to act now to stop the same happening in the syrian border city of kobani, a un official warns. The un special envoy for syria warns that the city that kurds from around the region have fled to is about to fall and isis flags have already gone up over some neighborhoods, fox reports. \" the world, all of us, will regret deeply if isis is able to take over a city which has defended itself with courage but is close to not being able to do so, \" he says. In other developments: fighting continued around kobani overnight, with kurdish fighters assisted by more airstrikes from the us-led coalition, reports the bbc. It's not clear which side currently has the upper hand, although the isis advance appears to have been halted. Senior american officials tell cnn that kobani will probably fall soon, but that isn't a major us concern. The main us goal, they say, isn't saving syrian cities from isis but going after its leadership and resources, especially in iraq, say the officials, who would like turkey to do more about the crisis just over its border. In turkey, at least 14 people were killed and dozens more injured as kurds protesting the country's failure to act against isis clashed with police in several cities, reports the ap. In hamburg, germany, more than a dozen people were injured when kurdish protesters clashed with members of a hard-line islamist group. The us has a new partner against isis: lawmakers in canada have voted 157 to 134 to send canadian aircraft to join strikes against isis in iraq, reports the cbc. \" if left unchecked, this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly, \" prime minister stephen harper said in a statement. \" they have already voiced their local and international terrorist intentions and identified canada as a potential target. \"",

Rescue teams tracked down the elephant about 3 kilometers ( 1.8 miles ) away and tranquilized it to rescue the tourists clinging to its back, police lt. Col. Narong laksanawimol said. \" it took almost three hours for the elephant to calm down completely. We had to tie it to a tree, \" narong said by telephone. He said the animal began attacking the 60-year-old handler about 15 minutes after the start of what was supposed to be a scenic ride for the tourists near a waterfall in the city of phang nga. The handler's crushed body was found in a creek. He said the male elephant had never attacked anyone since it began working for a tourist company two years ago, adding that the animal was in musth, a state of aggressive sexual excitement.",

        "summary": "The disappearance of an australian mother more than 35 years ago is getting renewed attention thanks to the case being featured on a popular true crime podcast. Police in new south wales on wednesday began what they say will be a five-day forensic search of the former home of lynette and chris dawson, the bbc reports. Lynette disappeared in 1982 when she was 33 years old, leaving behind two young daughters, per cnn. Her husband has long been suspected in her disappearance. In august, the australian newspaper released \" teacher's pet: the unsolved murder of lyn dawson, \" a 14-episode podcast that takes a deep dive into the case. Right before lynette dawson disappeared, her husband, a former rugby player and teacher, moved one of his 16-year-old students into the family home. He was reportedly in a sexual relationship with the girl ( they later married but are now separated ). Two coronial inquests found that he had killed his wife; however, prosecutors at the time said there was not enough evidence to implicate him, 9news reports. Chris dawson denied having anything to do with his wife's disappearance, saying that she left of her own volition, possibly for a religious group.

            "In a private viewing cinema in soho last week i caught myself letting fly with a four-letter expletive at bill keller, the former executive editor of the new york times.

The man who was pretending to be me – thanking keller for \" not giving a shit \" – used to be malcolm tucker, a foul-mouthed scottish spin doctor who will soon be a 1,000-year-old time lord. And keller will correct me, but i don't remember ever swearing at him. I do remember saying something to the effect of \" we have the thumb drive, you have the first amendment \". The fictional moment occurs at the beginning of the dreamworks film about wikileaks, the fifth estate, due for release next month. Peter capaldi is, i can report, a very plausible guardian editor. This real-life exchange with keller happened just after we took possession of the first tranche of wikileaks documents in 2010. I strongly suspected that our ability to research and publish anything to do with this trove of secret material would be severely constrained in the uk. America, for all its own problems with media laws and whistleblowers, at least has press freedom enshrined in a written constitution.

Because of the substances in her system, it's still unclear whether gomez died from an overdose or from strangulation. Gomez was found with bruises on her neck, and, the prosecutor said, \" with a combination of the alcohol and the hydrocodone, \" it's possible \" the body was already so depressed that it could not recover from those choking injuries. \" herrera was charged with first-degree felony domestic violence and faced a potential life sentence. He called his mom after finding gomez dead and the two waited two hours before calling 911. In that time, his mom allegedly dressed gomez. Herrera was found guilty of aggravated assault, but his attorney plans to appeal the 25-year sentence. Gomez's cousin told the court the sentence wasn't long enough. Herrera's mother, melissa martinez, is facing charges of her own. She allegedly booked the hotel room, lied to gomez's mother, and gave her son and gomez alcohol and drugs so they would \" have a good time. \"",

        "summary": "The waco shootout that left nine men dead, 18 injured, and 170 behind bars had its roots in a decades-long rivalry and a dispute over a small piece of cloth, insiders say. The bandidos and the cossacks have been rivals since both gangs were formed in texas in the ' 60s, and former bandidos leader edward winterhalder tells the la times that the latest dispute started in 2013, when the cossacks offended the bandidos by adding the word \" texas \" to their colors. He says the bandidos — by far the bigger of the two clubs — saw the move as an attempt to claim territory and ordered the cossacks to remove the \" territory-claiming patch \" from their jackets but they refused, sparking escalating violence between the outfits before yesterday's shootout. The bandidos see texas as their state, the vice president of the international association of outlaw motorcycle gang investigators tells the new york times. \" they are the big dogs of texas, and then this other, smaller club — the cossacks — comes along in 1969 or so, and they decide that they are not going to bow down, \" he says. The reason the public violence was so shocking, a former undercover atf agent tells the ap, is that large numbers of harmless bikers have adopted a similar look to the outlaw clubs. \" i think, as a society, and to a large extent even in law enforcement, we fall into the sense that these guys are these big, rough-looking teddy bears that do blood drives and toy runs, \" he says. \" these are people that have used the motorcycle culture as camouflage. \"",

Iran is mounting new clampdowns on internet expression, including rules that will impose layers of surveillance in the country's popular internet cafes, as tehran's political establishment comes under increasing strains from economic turmoil and threats of more international sanctions. In the most sweeping move, iran issued regulations giving internet cafes 15 days to install security cameras, start collecting detailed personal information on customers and document users ' online footprints.

            "Iranian officials struck a defiant posture on thursday in response to a proposed oil embargo by the european union, calling the intensified efforts to halt iran's nuclear program, including new sanctions by united states, tantamount to \"an economic war. \" the strong words were the latest in a series of escalating military and diplomatic responses by iran in recent weeks amid growing pressure from western powers. On tuesday, iran warned the united states that it would take action if an american aircraft carrier that left the persian gulf through the strait of hormuz were to return. The united states has said that the threats would not cause it to alter military deployments. Britain added its voice to the chorus on thursday, with defense secretary philip hammond cautioning that any attempt by iran to close the strait would be \"illegal and unsuccessful. \" his comments, delivered during his first visit to the pentagon since he became the top defense minister last fall, appeared to indicate strong resolve by the west to keep the strategically important strait open for trade. \"it is in all our interests that the arteries of global trade are kept free, opening and running, \" he said, according to news reports.

Either way, they had floated 10 nautical miles and had mild hypothermia, dehydration, and jellyfish stings by the time they were rescued in what a coast guard rep calls a \" stroke of luck. \" the pair survived by staying close to shore, using the light as a guide; morris kept hold of mcgovern's feet so she wouldn't lose him in the water, and had to shake him awake during the night, their rescuers say.

Instead, the employees probably used their work cards mainly to hide the expenses from spouses, a pentagon official tells politico. \" clearly, the behavior displayed by these individuals neither comports with our values nor represents the good service of the vast majority of [ our ] service members or dod civilians, \" says another defense official to abc. It's not clear whether anyone's losing his job, but about 400 employees were receiving some kind of disciplinary action. In other federal-worker news, nearly 1,600 irs employees have been busted for either failing to pay taxes or cheating on their returns over the last decade, reports ap. Most got reprimands or suspensions, but kept their jobs enforcing tax rules on everyone else.",

It's a small percentage of the tax agency's employees — about 160 workers a year out of a workforce of 85,000. A new report by the agency's inspector general said most were not fired, even though a 1998 law calls for terminations when irs workers willfully don't pay their taxes. The penalty must be waived by the irs commissioner. Among their offenses: improperly claiming dependents, repeated failure to file timely tax returns, and claiming a tax credit for first-time homebuyers when the worker didn't buy a house. Some received promotions, raises and bonuses after they were caught willfully not paying their taxes, the report said.",

This week, researchers announced that what they found was no anomaly but rather a small canal system, reports the ap. They now think the tomb of the ancient ruler pakal was built atop a natural spring about 700 ad, with tunnels that directed water to the esplanade in front of the temple in the hope of giving pakal's spirit a way into the underworld. In fact, an engraving at the site reads that the dead gain entrance to the underworld in such a manner via the god chaac, who will \" will guide the dead toward the underworld by submerging [ them ]. \" the site previously gained fame when author erich von daniken posited in his 1968 book chariots of the gods? that pakal looked like an astronaut at the helm of a spaceship on a carved stone sarcophagus. But archaeologist arnoldo gonzalez says the dig has turned up \" nothing to do with spaceships \" and that the \" flames \" of the so-called spaceship engine in fact depict the mayan \" tree of life. \" the main underground tunnel is only two feet wide and two feet tall, and thus too small to crawl through, but the team is exploring it via robotic devices. Afp reports that water was still running through it, so the source is likely a spring, though it has not been found. Also possible is that the tunnels were part of a water-supply system built before the temple. ( mayans may have had a \" drought cult. \" )",

In a statement for police, nel noted, pistorius had said he whispered to steenkamp; in court the athlete said he used a \" lowered tone. \" \" i must have made a mistake by saying ' whispered, ' \" pistorius said. \" i was on medication.

Video shot by sky news showed that fighting was continuing in zawiya, despite government assertions that forces loyal to libyan leader moammar gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city. Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street, many of them pumping their fists in the air.

        "summary": "Militants attacked a crowded mosque during friday prayers in the sinai peninsula, settling off explosives, spraying worshipers with gunfire, and killing at least 200 people, per the ap. Reuters has the death toll at 230, calling it the deadliest attack on civilians in the nation's modern history. The attack targeted a mosque frequented by sufis, members of islam's mystical movement, in the north sinai town of bir al-abd. Islamic militants, including the local affiliate of the islamic state group, consider sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith. The isis affiliate has been waging a stepped-up campaign of violence in northern sinai for years and has claimed deadly bombings on churches in the capital, cairo, and other cities, killing dozens of christians. It also is believed to have been behind the 2016 downing of a russian passenger jet that killed 226. But this was the first major militant attack on a muslim mosque, and the startling bloodshed eclipsed any past attacks of its kind, even dating back to a previous insurgency in the 1990s. The militants opened fire from four off-road vehicles on worshipers inside the mosque during the sermon, blocking off escape routes from the area by blowing up cars and leaving the burning wrecks blocking the roads. Victims including some 130 wounded were rushed to local hospitals, said police. No one claimed responsibility immediately following the attack, but isis has targeted sufis several times in the area in the past, notably beheading a leading sufi religious figure, the blind sheikh suleiman abu heraz, last year and posting photos of the killing online.",

No group has claimed responsibility, but egyptian forces are battling a stubborn islamic state affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by u.s.-backed forces in iraq and syria. The assault on a mosque has stunned egyptians, prompting president abdel fattah al-sisi's government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in egypt's modern history.

The country's interior minister announced today that rowhani — considered the most moderate candidate in the race — has won this weekend's presidential election, gaining more than 18 million votes — just over 50 % of the 36.7 million cast, which is all he needs to avoid a runoff and secure the victory, the bbc reports. In a distant second place, tehran mayor mohammad baqer ghalibaf had six million votes. Turnout for the election was 72 % of iran's 50 million eligible voters. Rowhani has been a backer of women's rights and extending freedoms, the new york times reports. \" this outcome was not something planned by ayatollah khamenei, \" iran's supreme leader, says one iran expert; another points to \" a hidden but huge reservoir of reformist energy in iran that broke loose in a true political wave. \" but khamenei, who yesterday slammed what he called us suspicion of the election, tweeted support for the process: \" a vote for any of these candidates is a vote for the islamic republic and a vote of confidence in the system. \" despite rowhani's win, the supreme leader retains the real power, the times notes.",

Secondly, pc magazine believes virtual dealerships could help make cadillac seem a little cooler to buyers currently flocking to tesla. Virtual cadillac dealerships would let potential buyers check out models using virtual reality headsets. They may also have a few \" tester cars \" on hand for test drives. Volvo is trying something similar, letting customers use virtual reality to instantly experience their customized vehicles. Cadillac executives will spend this month trying to convince some of its smaller dealerships to switch over to virtual showrooms. That's going to he a hard sell, according to some dealers, who think this is just a way to get small dealerships that don't sell many cadillacs to close their doors. It can be expensive for automakers to force dealerships to close because of franchise agreements. The virtual showrooms are part of an overhaul of cadillac dealerships called \" project pinnacle. \" it splits dealerships into five tiers based on how many cadillacs they sell then mandates what kind of service each tier needs to provide.",

A 21-year-old man was found dead saturday at his parent's home in hooper bay, a village 530 miles west of anchorage in a region with disproportionately high suicide rates, alaska state troopers said. The death follows three others that began sept. 24 with the suicide of a 26-year-old man. A 24-year-old man despondent over his friend's death killed himself oct. 2, followed two days later by the suicide of a 20-year-old woman reportedly distraught over the 24-year-old's death. It was not immediately clear if the latest suicide was influenced by the others. Several local residents, including the village police chief and the mayor, declined to comment monday. Emma smith, a new wellness coordinator hired by sea lion corp., the village native corporation, would only say that she cannot know the personal impact on each individual in the community. Asked if the 21-year-old was close to the others who took their lives, smith said no one is a stranger to each other in the village. \" everybody in this village knows everybody, \" she said.

He was 71. He was diagnosed in february, a month after he left office, having served an unprecedented five terms. He announced a week ago that he was suspending both treatment and a planned book tour to spend time with his family, notes the ap; a spokeswoman says he died today in their company. First elected in 1993, health problems forced menino to announce in late march 2013 he would not seek a sixth term. Three weeks later, when bombs exploded at the finish line of the boston marathon, menino checked himself out of the hospital where he was being treated for a broken leg to help pull his reeling city up by the bootstraps; in what the ap calls \" a symbolic act of personal defiance, \" three days later menino literally struggled from his wheelchair to his own feet at an interfaith service. Though far from smooth and at times prone to gaffes — the ap notes he once referred to boston's terrible parking situation as \" an alcatraz, \" rather than albatross, around his neck — the globe lauds him for helping to \" shepherd boston's economy and shape the skyline and the very identity of the city he loved. \" the globe has a photo album of \" mr.
