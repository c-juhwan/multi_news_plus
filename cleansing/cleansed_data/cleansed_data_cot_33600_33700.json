The weirdest thing about halper is not that he's a retired wall street trader who used to vice chair the new york mercantile exchange, or that he's a 1-percenter. No, the weirdest thing about halper is that in addition his adbusters donation, he also donated the maximum allowed $ 2500 to the presidential campaign of corporate favorite mitt romney. \"we can only imagine what it's like to have enough money to write several-thousand-dollar checks to causes that effectively cancel each other out, \" writes max read on gawker. Halper explains his giving to the new york times as \"a little add — like me. \" he is a longtime donor to adbusters and friend of the editor in chief, and wrote the check despite \"rolling his eyes \" at the idea initially, he says. He soon found himself swept up in the excitement and now makes daily visits to zuccotti park, which he calls \"the coolest place in new york. \" \"if there's pain, \" he concludes, \"it should be shared. \"",

        "summary": "Roughly two-thirds of cancer types researchers recently studied largely appear to be the result of random mutations and not inherited genes or environmental and lifestyle factors. Reporting in the journal science, researchers at the johns hopkins university school of medicine investigated 31 common cancer types and found that 22 of them ( including leukemia, bone, testicular, ovarian, and brain cancer ) appear to mostly be attributed to just plain bad luck; the nine largely attributed to genes and lifestyle include skin, colorectal, and lung cancer. The analysis revolved around stem cells, which comprise a small number of the total cells in most tissues but tend to be where tumors form because they are constantly dividing to repair damaged tissue — and thus there is, simply mathematically, more opportunity for mutations to occur in these cells. What was reviewed: the number of stem cells in 31 tissue types, the rate of stem-cell division there, and the risk that a person would develop a cancer in that tissue. The researchers found a \" strong \" correlation between the lifetime risk of many cancers and the total number of cell divisions in the tissue, suggesting \" only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions, \" they write. As for the remainder of the risk, \" it's losing the lottery, \" researcher dr. Bert vogelstein tells reuters. An outside researcher tells the wall street journal that more research is required to understand why different stem cells divide at the varied rates they do, as those rates could still be driven by genes and the environment. Breast and prostate cancer weren't included in the study because researchers couldn't lock down their division rates. ( some scientists say we ' ll never cure cancer. )",

But don't get too excited for the aforementioned movie yet: \" it's strictly a platonic trip, \" axani tells the ap, and anyway, gallagher already has a boyfriend. In fact, gallagher, a student and former member of the canadian coast guard, originally thought the idea was \" a little bit creepy, \" she says. But after talking with axani for hours on the phone, \" it's less creepy and more awesome, \" she says. Her boyfriend, she admits, is \" not happy i ' m taking off for nearly a month at christmas with a random guy, \" but \" he understands that i've always wanted to travel so... He's smiling through it. \" the trip will be documented online, and maybe hollywood can still get a feel-good movie out of it: axani received so many emails from people who wanted to see the world ( like one 8-year-old who is going blind ) that he and his brother created a ticket forward, an organization that aims to crowdfund trips for those who can't afford them.

        "summary": "The department of homeland security is urging airline passengers to \" be patient \" with security lines during the busy summer travel season, the ap reports. But that might be easier said than done as more and more passengers miss flights while waiting in security lines for literally hours. According to cnn, a flier in atlanta reported a security wait longer than two hours on friday. Another two-hour wait was reported in san jose on tuesday. A fed-up representative from florida lashed out during a congressional hearing this week, politico reports. \"you can't get a hold of a damned person at tsa, even as a member of congress, \" said john mica, whose associates missed a flight while stuck in a security line. \"i am so disgusted with this. \" on friday, homeland security director jeh johnson announced an imminent increase in overtime hours for screeners and the hiring of 768 new security officers. Tsa hopes to have the new hires onboard by mid-june. But even that might not help wait times. Congress cut the number of tsa screeners by 4,622 — or about 10 % — over the past three years. At the same time, screening processes are getting more thorough — and time-consuming. The tsa's union president says they need about 6,000 more screeners to rein in security wait times. The question, as always, is how to balance security, the needs of travelers, and the cost. If nothing else, the $ 760,000 in loose change and other money left behind by passengers and collected by the tsa last year alone could help, the new york times reports.",

        "summary": "Anthony scaramucci, aka the mooch, had his biggest day in the spotlight yet, and the end result doesn't appear to be good news for reince priebus. The new white house communications chief had a chance to ease tensions with president trump's chief of staff in a memorable cnn interview, but instead he seems to have raised them. At one point, he compared their relationship to that of cain and abel and at another he declared, \" if reince wants to explain he's not a leaker, let him do that. \" coverage: how this began: on wednesday, scaramucci issued a tweet railing against felonious leakers after politico reported on his financial disclosure statement. And he tagged priebus, seemingly accusing him of being the source. It emerged later that the financial disclosure was, in fact, public information, and scaramucci deleted the tweet. More here. Quite an interview: scaramucci called in to cnn's new day program thursday morning and spoke for more than 30 minutes. The network's chris cillizza highlights the \" most eye-popping quotes \" here and limits himself to 35. Two big ones: scaramucci and trump have a \" very, very good idea \" of who the leakers are in the white house, and \" those are the types of leaks that are so treasonous that 150 years ago, people would have been hung. \" paterno? another getting attention, as in this huffpo list, is his quoting of the late penn state coach joe paterno on the importance of honor in the workplace. Critics think it was an odd choice because of this. Boss's approval: scaramucci tells the washington post he called in to discuss priebus and the leaks with the personal approval of trump. A separate analysis at the post thinks the new \" war on leaks \" is off to a disastrous start. Pressure: all this speaks to the growing pressure on priebus, who seems to have fewer and fewer allies in the west wing, reports politico. It notes that kellyanne conway, given a chance to exonerate him as a leaker, instead told fox, \" i will just tell you that leakers are easier to figure out than they may think. This west wing is a very small place. \" a felony? scaramucci denied his initial tweet was meant to accuse priebus of a felony, but most saw it otherwise.

        "summary": "Rangers at utah's arches national park are investigating large graffiti carved so deeply into a famous red rock arch that it might be impossible to erase, officials say. The carvings discovered earlier this month measure about 4 feet across and 3 feet high, park superintendent kate cannon says. The vandalism is part of a \" tidal wave of graffiti \" at arches and other national parks in recent years, she notes. Two years ago, at least eight national parks in the west began the delicate task of cleaning up graffiti-like paintings left on famous, picturesque landscapes, the ap reports. The damage was discovered after images were shared on social media. The arches rock formation, commonly known as frame arch, is off a popular hiking trail. Cannon says the graffiti was etched so deeply that it might have taken at least an hour for someone to carve. She says park workers can try to reduce the carving's visibility by grinding down the rock around it, but that causes further damage to the surface. They could also try to fill in the etchings with some kind of material that blends in, but it's unclear if that would be a permanent or unnoticeable treatment. Cannon says she hopes someone will come forward with information about the vandals, who left the names \" staten \" and \" andersen \" carved into the arch, the deseret news reports. ( this national park vandal signed the graffiti with her instagram handle. )",

But this actually might save the hihi — also known as the stitchbird — from extinction, phys.org reports. A zoological society of london study in evolutionary applications found that \" bachelor \" hihi birds who don't stick to one breeding territory, instead fathering chicks wherever the mood strikes, can decrease inbreeding among paired birds and boost genetic diversity within the species. Why this is important: there are only about 2,000 left in the wild, and scientists are afraid one cataclysmic disease could wipe them out. Male \" floater \" birds, as they're called, don't have as successful a breeding rate as their partnered male pals, but by hooking up with partnered females — or, as the study more elegantly puts it, through \" extra-pair copulations \" — the floaters make a \" small but significant impact \" on the birds ' population size. Floaters tend to be either really young ( about a year old and without the know-how to defend territory ) or older ( more than 5 years and too tired to defend territory ), per phys.org. The main issue with studying floaters: they're basically \" homeless \" and hard to track down, the scientists note. ( at least the floaters stab their guy friends in the back, not in the neck. )",

Among the remains were around a dozen long bones, pieces of a jawbone, and more than 25 vertebrae. Parks canada anthropologists have determined that the bones belonged to three malnourished children from europe, likely impoverished 19th-century irish migrants who died in a shipwreck while trying to find a better life, the globe and mail reports. \" they are witnesses to a tragic event, \" says one archaeologist. Researchers found that the children likely ate a plant-based diet in europe and that one child suffered from rickets, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin d, archaeology reports. In addition, a button found nearby was linked to europe in the 19th century. Officials believe they are likely victims of the wreck of the carricks, a ship that crossed the atlantic with irish migrants trying to escape their homeland's famine only to sink in a storm in 1847. About 100 bodies washed ashore. There were 48 survivors, the cbc reported in 2012; they were taken in by local families. A memorial to the tragedy is just 40 yards away from where these children's bones were found. Says one local, who had ancestors among the shipwreck victims and survivors, \" i have a link to these people — i almost consider them my family. \" thousands died on the carricks and other \" coffin ships \" of the era, and the washington post notes that the sleeping quarters in such ships look similar to concentration camps. \" most families of four would be given a platform that was about 6 feet square, \" one expert told npr last year.

            "Open-access journals hit by journalist's sting although many open-access scientific journals claim the articles they publish are subject to peer review, that doesn't always happen. Science magazine contributor john bohannon sent out bogus papers about a fictitious cancer experiment, papers that should have raised red flags. But more than 150 journals offered to publish his work. Bohannon talks to renee montagne about the implications of his sting operation. David greene, host: this is morning edition from npr news. Good morning, i ' m david greene. Renee montagne, host: and i ' m renee montagne. Publication is the coin of the realm for scientists. It's how they make their careers. Greene: traditionally, it's been hard to get research published at least until the last decade and explosion of open-access journals online. Montagne: unlike nature or the journal of the american medical association, open access journals don't charge readers. Instead, they may charge the researchers they publish - sometimes thousands of dollars. Greene: and there's another important difference. Often open-access journals don't do what's known as peer review.

That's because the hawaiian city hopes to discourage pedestrians from \" distracted walking \" altogether, notably with one piece of legislation its mayor signed into law late last week, reuters reports. Per the new mandate to combat \" smartphone zombies, \" pedestrians who check their electronic devices while crossing the street will be fined ( between $ 15 and $ 99, based on how many times a law enforcement official spots them sneaking a peek ). Mayor kirk caldwell says the law was necessary because honolulu has the \" unfortunate distinction \" of having more people be slammed into by cars than almost any other city in the us. However, critics say the law curtails personal freedom and will pull law enforcement away from more pressing problems. \" scrap this intrusive bill, provide more education to citizens about responsible electronics usage, and allow law enforcement to focus on larger issues, \" one citizen wrote to the city council, which passed the bill 7-2 last month. Honolulu may be the most major city to pass such a rule, but fox news points out that at least one other city — fort lee, nj — has a similar no-texting-while-walking law.

On the fateful day, petrosino was leaving a restaurant in palermo where he'd planned to meet an informant and was gunned down by unknown assailants. Italian police say they got an unexpected break in the case as part of a broad mob crackdown operation codenamed apocalypse.

In other words, they can say what happened in the past if it's been explained to them, but they struggle to recall their past experiences. \" they cannot re-experience the past with a vivid sense of personal reliving, \" levine notes. Yet this doesn't stop them from having healthy lives and careers; levine's research suggests they get by using a practiced knowledge of their factual histories. In his pioneering work, researchers were able to scan and study the brains of three people with sdam — two americans and one brit, who, the study notes, self-reported the condition. The scans showed some differences between their brains and others '; for instance, they had slightly smaller hippocampi. When looking at pictures, they also showed much weaker brain signaling than healthy adults do, yet they had no problem recognizing the images. It's still unclear how common sdam is, and much more research remains to be done. In the meantime, the study notes, the condition can be compared with highly superior autobiographical memory, which is pretty much the opposite condition — the science of us describes those with hsam as \" master autobiographers, \" with a powerful sense of the emotion they felt at a given time. That can mean a bad memory can be inescapable. ( but researchers have made progress toward turning bad memories into good ones. )",

        "summary": "The winner of the nobel economics prize says the most important impact of his work is \" the recognition that economic agents are humans \" and money decisions are not made strictly rationally. Richard thaler, of the university of chicago, was speaking in a phone call to a news conference immediately after the nobel committee announced he won this year's $ 1.1 million prize, reports the ap. The swedish academy of sciences said the 72-year-old's research has built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making. It says his work expanded economic analysis by considering three psychological traits: limited rationality, perceptions about fairness, and lack of self-control. A background paper from the academy offers this: \" one frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. Companies that contravene fairness norms may be punished by consumer boycotts, which may get them to maintain their prices in cases where they would otherwise have raised them. \" the economics prize is something of an outlier — the ap reports alfred nobel's will didn't call for its establishment and it honors a science that many doubt is a science at all. It was first awarded in 1969, nearly seven decades after the series of prestigious prizes that nobel called for, though it is broadly considered an equal to the other nobel and the winner attends the famed presentation banquet.",

            "Stockholm ( ap ) — the nobel economics prize has been awarded to richard thaler of the university of chicago for his contributions to behavioral economics. The 9-million-kronor ( $ 1.1-million ) prize was awarded to the academic for his \" understanding the psychology of economics, \" swedish academy of sciences secretary goeran hansson said monday. The nobel committee said thaler's work shows how human traits affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes. Thaler, 72, \" is a pioneer in behavioral economics, a research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision making, \" a background paper from the academy said. That \" incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions, \" it said. The economics prize is something of an outlier — alfred nobel's will didn't call for its establishment and it honors a science that many doubt is a science at all. The sveriges riksbank ( swedish national bank ) prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel was first awarded in 1969, nearly seven decades after the series of prestigious prizes that nobel called for. Despite its provenance and carefully laborious name, it is broadly considered an equal to the other nobel and the winner attends the famed presentation banquet.",

President obama is expected later today to call for an extension of the bush tax cuts for one more year — but only for families earning less than $ 250,000 annually.

The gop is united in demanding cuts for all. Obama's plan, to be announced in the rose garden, would tack another $ 150 billion onto the deficit.

And up to 2.5 million americans are believed to be affected by chronic fatigue syndrome. Despite symptoms ranging from pain to cognitive dysfunction to exhaustion after exercise, both disorders were long believed to be psychological in nature, according to a press release. But in a study published friday in scientific reports, researchers say they've found unique molecular patterns in the brain that hint at a physical cause for the brain disorders. And that's a first step toward figuring out a way to both diagnose and treat gulf war illness and chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers observed subjects 24 hours after riding a stationary bike for 25 minutes. They found different changes in the levels of mirnas in the brain between chronic fatigue syndrome patients, two subsets of gulf war illness sufferers, and a control group. Mirnas are responsible for turning protein production on and off. But that wasn't the only difference between the various groups. Researchers also found one subgroup of gulf war illness patients saw their heart rate increase over 30 beats while standing for up to three days after exercising; the other subgroup required additional brain regions to complete a memory test following exercise. There is no settled-on diagnosis or treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome, which was considered psychosomatic until 2015. And the exact cause of gulf war illness remains unknown.",

Not everybody was buying that explanation, and post reporter josh dawsey tweets that the president has previously brought up the supposed test in meetings. Colleague philip bump at the post digs in, suggesting that perhaps trump has morphed this nissan ad into reality. A possibly more plausible explanation he offers is that the tale stems from an actual test japan conducts in which a \" head-shaped object \" is fired at the hood of a car, the idea being to measure potential damage to a pedestrian.

The suspect eventually left, but as he drove away, surveillance video shows the trunk pop open and the woman roll out onto the ground before dashing inside. Once she told alsabah what was going on, he locked the door and called 911. At one point, which can be seen on the video, the panicked woman even held onto alsabah's shotgun, though he tried to tell her she was safe. Alsabah says that the woman had been cut during her abduction and that a relative brought her to get checked out by medical staff. The birmingham police, meanwhile, say the suspect is still at large and tweeted a photo of him to ask for the public's help in tracking him down.

So the current rim fire could \" reboot \" the system back to its historical roots, allowing for a wider variety of habitats where long-dormant plants can once again thrive. \" if you have a living forest, getting older and older, it's not something we have an option to conserve in an unchanging way, \" says an ecologist from colorado state university. \"some fires are going to be necessary if we want to sustain these old forests. \" it's not quite that simple, though, says skinner — this fire isn't natural and could be so intense that it damages seeds and tree roots to the point of no return.

Yet others may be restored to historical conditions that prevailed for thousands of years from the last ice age's end until the 19th century, when short-sighted fire management disrupted natural fire cycles and transformed the landscape. For nearly two weeks, the nation has been transfixed by wildfire spreading through yosemite national park, threatening to pollute san francisco's water supply and destroy some of america's most cherished landscapes. As terrible as the rim fire seems, though, the question of its long-term effects, and whether in some ways it could actually be ecologically beneficial, is a complicated one. Decades- and centuries-old seeds, which have remained dormant in the ground awaiting a suitable moment, will be cracked open by the heat, explained thode. Exposed to moisture, they ' ll begin to germinate and start a process of vegetative succession that results again in forests. The rim fire may offer some of both",

            "In certain areas, \"you could absolutely consider it a rebooting, getting the system back to the way it used to be, \" said fire ecologist andrea thode of northern arizona university. \"but where there's a high-severity fire in a system that wasn't used to having high-severity fires, you're creating a new system. \" some parts of yosemite may be radically altered, entering entire new ecological states. Yet others may be restored to historical conditions that prevailed for thousands of years from the last ice age's end until the 19th century, when short-sighted fire management disrupted natural fire cycles and transformed the landscape. For nearly two weeks, the nation has been transfixed by wildfire spreading through yosemite national park, threatening to pollute san francisco's water supply and destroy some of america's most cherished landscapes. As terrible as the rim fire seems, though, the question of its long-term effects, and whether in some ways it could actually be ecologically beneficial, is a complicated one. Decades- and centuries-old seeds, which have remained dormant in the ground awaiting a suitable moment, will be cracked open by the heat, explained thode. Exposed to moisture, they ' ll begin to germinate and start a process of vegetative succession that results again in forests. The rim fire may offer some of both",

        "summary": "They take their rivalries seriously in mingo county, west virginia. But even residents like the hatfields and mccoys of yore might do a double-take at the allegations against circuit court judge michael thornsbury. He is accused of having an affair with his secretary and then trying for years to frame and imprison her husband after the affair went sour in 2008, reports the charleston gazette. Some examples from yesterday's federal indictment: thornsbury allegedly plotted to have a friend plant drugs under the husband's truck, then have troopers pick him up. The friend backed out at the last minute. Thornsbury allegedly got a state trooper to arrest the husband on false grand larceny charges — claiming that he stole scrap metal from his job, even though his employer had given permission to take it — then installed a business associate as foreman of the grand jury. The case unraveled when one of the subpoenaed businesses made public the ties between the judge and the foreman, reports the wall street journal. When the husband was the victim of an armed assault outside a convenience store, prosecutors say the judge arranged to have the charges dropped against the two assailants — then had the husband charged as the perpetrator. He allegedly pressured prosecutors to try to imprison the husband for six months over the incident, but they dropped the charges, reports ap. In short, \" he corrupted the system of justice in mingo county for his own nefarious purposes, \" says a us attorney. Thornsbury's law license has been suspended as the criminal conspiracy case proceeds. ( click for another surprising bust that occurred yesterday — involving a princess. )",

But to 18-year-old ryan chester, it's easy to explain — which is exactly what he's done in a seven-minute video that's earned him $ 400,000, reports the daily dot. His intention with his video is to explain \" why traveling at a very fast speed can cause you to age more slowly relative to someone on earth. \" ( at one point, he uses a bowl of popcorn inside a moving suv to illustrate the laws of physics. ) and as cbs news puts it, \" the most amazing part? you walk away actually getting it. \" for submitting the winning entry to the breakthrough junior challenge, a new branch of the breakthrough prize ( the brainchild of the likes of mark zuckerberg, sergey brin, and jack ma, among others ) the ohio teen will get a $ 250,000 scholarship; $ 50,000 will go to his physics teacher, and $ 100,000 will fund a new science lab at his north royalton high school. How the idea came to him: \" time dilation has been in science tv shows and movies like interstellar so often that i've just accepted it without understanding why it was true. So when this challenge came around i thought this area was a great one to dig into. \" motherboard notes that his submission rose to the top of a pile of 2,000; there were 15 finalists, and chester's win was announced sunday.

The story just gets weirder from there. Over at gawker, jk trotter lays out the entire timeline of developments, including a series of tweets thompson made last year complaining about white plagiarists ( thompson is black ), his apparently exaggerated intercept bio ( the original has now been taken down ), and a bizarre, rambling letter from thompson to reed, who says thompson \" did not cooperate in the review \" of his work. In his letter — which has so far appeared in four different incarnations, with missing or added phrases, sent to gawker, a cnn reporter, re/code, and reed herself — thompson blames reed for his articles'discrepancies ( \" i ' m a cub reporter and expected a sustained and competent editor to guide me \" ); offers convoluted explanations for the discrepancies ( which he admits were \" sloppy \" ); and informs her he has testicular cancer and hopes she ' ll give him time to get his notes together. \" it's a very nefarious and ill liberal and anti humanist position to take if you do otherwise: kicking a cancer patient when he's down, \" he concludes.",

As his administration considers military action, it's well aware that a public intelligence presentation — which could occur today — would be the most important of its kind since the run-up to the iraq war, the new york times reports. Colin powell's 2003 presentation ran through intelligence that was eventually debunked; the white house hasn't forgotten, and it's tamping down expectations about what it will reveal. Britain, however, went ahead and published its own intel report, reports cnn; it concludes that a strike is legally justified and that there is a need for \" humanitarian intervention. \" london said it was \" highly likely \" the syrian government was behind the attack, and that \" it is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a [ chemical weapon ] attack on this scale, \" the guardian reports. As for the us report, there's still no \" smoking gun \" implicating bashar al-assad himself. Still, he's responsible for his military's moves, a us state department rep says. The bar has been set high for the presentation: the public is reluctant to dive into another middle eastern conflict, and members of congress fear obama could take action without their approval. To add to that, russia has already shot down a british-led effort to censure syria via the un security council, the los angeles times notes. Meanwhile: obama's not the only one struggling for support on syria. Uk lawmakers in the opposition labour party are seeking further investigation before a vote on whether to strike, reuters reports. David cameron has also faced hurdles in his own party amid memories of iraq. Un secretary-general ban ki-moon says investigators will have left syria by saturday, the bbc reports. John boehner is calling on obama to \" make the case.. For how potential military action will secure american national security interests, preserve america's credibility, deter the future use of chemical weapons, and, critically, be a part of our broader policy and strategy, \" he says in a letter, per politico. About a quarter of the house — including 18 democrats — have signed a letter pushing obama to discuss any syria action with congress. The syrian public appears concerned about a us strike. Some 6,000 fled to lebanon within 24 hours yesterday, the ap reports; that's compared to the usual 500 to 1,000. Meanwhile, israelis have been snapping up gas masks, fearing syrian retaliation.",

        "summary": "Probiotics are all the rage — the so-called \" good bacteria \" teeming naturally in foods such as yogurt and sauerkraut or worked into drinks and pills comprise a growing industry that fortune reports posted more than $ 1 billion in annual sales in the us last year. It's expected to grow a whopping 15 % this year alone. But the science of studying how billions of good and bad bacteria alike interact in our bodies is obviously complicated and slow, and critics argue that there isn't sufficient evidence to market probiotics as having any positive health benefits — some even suggest that these bacteria are killed by stomach acids before reaching the intestine. Now a meta study out of denmark published in the journal genome medicine reflects this skepticism. \" there is little, if any, evidence of an effect of probiotic treatment in circumstances where the microbiota is unperturbed, \" researchers write. There are, however, some caveats. First, all studies reviewed were extremely small, with sample sizes ranging from 21 to 81, which calls into question any results, reports the guardian. And while there doesn't appear to be any change in the fecal matter of healthy adults using probiotics, some effect was observed in people with \" perturbed \" microbiota, including \" alleviation of gastrointestinal symptoms. \" people on antibiotics, for instance, may reap some benefits from eating yogurt. But until better studies are done, the researchers conclude that if you're healthy, you shouldn't waste your money.

        "summary": "A years-old mystery in texas has been solved — at least in part. Three years after houston resident mary cerruti seemingly disappeared, authorities have confirmed it was her skeleton discovered in the wall of her former home by new tenants last march, alongside a pair of glasses that resembled those cerruti often wore, reports the houston chronicle. It isn't clear how the positive identification was made — cerruti's closest living relatives are cousins, which made dna comparisons difficult, per ktrk — nor is it clear how cerruti died and came to rest in a small space some 9 feet beneath an attic floor, perhaps not in that order. The leading theory appears to be that cerruti fell through a floorboard in the attic and became wedged in a 2-foot-wide space behind a bathroom wall, the chronicle reported last june. Part of a broken floorboard was found with cerruti's skeletal remains, which had been chewed and pulled apart by rats. A leg bone healing from a recent break suggests cerruti — believed to be 61 when she died — might've already been in pain, perhaps her balance affected, at the time of the suspected fall. A cause of death couldn't be determined from cerruti's decomposed remains, but police say foul play isn't suspected. Still, cerruti's cousin, nancy stewart stoddard, believes \" somebody put her there \" behind the wall around the time she vanished. Whatever happened, cerruti probably would've tried to figure it out because she loved mysteries, a friend tells the chronicle. \" i think she would have thought that was kind of cool that she created the mystery, \" she says.

The alleged culprit? her former business manager to the stars. In a lawsuit filed tuesday, morissette says she fired jonathan schwartz of gso business management — whose clients have reportedly included beyonce and mariah carey — in march and learned shortly after that he had taken $ 4.7 million from her accounts without permission from 2010 to 2014. Schwartz told her new manager that morissette \" spends a lot of cash so i get large amounts from the bank, and keep the money in my safe \" for when she needs it, the complaint reads. But after morissette disputed that, she says schwartz claimed she put the money into illegal marijuana grow-ops, per courthouse news. Schwartz also let morissette transfer $ 8 million out of her investment accounts and didn't tell her she \" dipped into her savings, \" the suit alleges, per the wall street journal. \" defendants concealed distributions from morissette, convincing her that she was in tremendous financial shape when, in fact, they were draining her assets. \" specifically, morissette says schwartz convinced her not to perform five shows in las vegas because she was \" set for life. \" she's seeking more than $ 15 million. Gso says it was \" shocked \" by its own investigation into schwartz, whom the firm accuses of \" burning through money to sustain a lavish lifestyle \" in a lawsuit filed monday. It maintains, however, that morissette requested large amounts of cash and often went over budget, per the bbc. ( the singer claimed her dog was also stolen. )",

        "summary": "It's been established that reuniting with long-lost relatives can and does result in \" genetic sexual attraction, \" a term coined in the 1980s. In fact, some have estimated that elements of sexual attraction occur in as many as half the cases of estranged loved ones who meet as adults. Still, it's widely considered taboo, and even more so when the attraction is between a father and daughter, reports new york magazine. As the woman who coined the phrase gsa told the guardian in 2003, \" that group tends to stay very silent. It's still regarded as dangerously close to abuse, even though it is no different from other forms of gsa. \" but one such unnamed couple living in the great lakes region is now making news after the teen daughter talked at length with the magazine about reuniting with her father — whom she hadn't seen since she was about 5 — 12 years later and finding herself instantly attracted to him. The daughter says they have been dating for nearly two years — since she lost her virginity to her father just days after reuniting with him — and that they plan to marry, if unofficially, and move to new jersey, where she says adult incest is legal. She says that she and her father, who conceived her on prom night when he was 18, plan to have a large family and that she's not worried about their kids having genetic problems because \" that happens when there's years of inbreeding, like with the royal family. \" she adds that \" incest has been around as long as humans have \" and \" everybody just needs to deal with it. \" full interview here. In 2010 wired reported on a study that found, as the lead researcher put it, \" people appear to be drawn to others who resemble their kin or themselves \"; he speculated that \" incest taboos exist to counter this primitive tendency. \" ( in august, a brazilian woman learned she had married her brother. )",

At least three properties belonging to a couple who own a concrete business were searched in bucks county beginning sunday, reports wpvi. Those included a 68-acre farm in solebury township, a home in solebury, and a home in bensalem township. It was there that 20-year-old cosmo dinardo, the son of the home owners, was arrested monday and charged with a gun violation. The charge stems from an incident in february in which dinardo was allegedly found to have a shotgun and ammo despite a history of mental illness. The charge had earlier been dismissed, per the philadelphia inquirer. Police haven't stated whether they believe dinardo is involved in the disappearance of jimi tar patrick, 19, last wednesday, followed by that of dean finocchiaro, 18; mark sturgis, 22; and tom meo, 21, all on friday. However, dinardo is friends with patrick on facebook, and finocchiaro's cellphone was tracked to the farm in solebury, the new york times reports. Sturgis ' father, whose son was last seen with meo, says meo's car was found in a garage in the solebury home near the farm, which police searched using metal detectors and a backhoe on monday. District attorney matthew weintraub says \" incredibly hot \" leads have so far proved \" very fruitful. \" but he adds foul play is suspected.

        "summary": "The survivor of a hawaii shark attack has had run-ins with some of nature's fiercest predators before. Specifically, dylan mcwilliams has previously suffered bites from both a bear and a venomous snake, according to the honolulu star-advertiser. The 20-year-old was reportedly bitten by a 6- to 8-foot tiger shark on thursday in the waters off kauai while treating himself to some much-deserved boogie boarding after days of helping out the island's victims of recent historic flooding. Just months earlier, mcwilliams had to get nine staples in his neck after he was woken up by an angry 280-pound black bear while sleeping outdoors at a colorado summer camp. That shocking encounter alone was enough to land mcwilliams in national news — he told people he had to fight off the bear as it dragged him some 12 feet. Mcwilliams said he used a similar tactic with the shark, which he gave a swift kick before swimming for his life back to shore. However, it's probably for the best that mcwilliams didn't try that with the pygmy faded rattlesnake that bit him three years ago while on a hike in utah. Mcwilliams walked away from what was luckily just a \" dry bite, \" with only enough venom to make him sick for a couple days. So what's this guy's deal with run-ins and terrifying animals? \"i ' m either really lucky or really unlucky, \" he told the star-advertiser.",

        "summary": "A woman was fatally injured when an engine blew on a southwest airlines flight with 149 people on board tuesday — but survivors say it could have been a much greater tragedy if not for pilot tammie jo shults. The 56-year-old, who was one of the first female fighter pilots in the us military, is being hailed as a hero for calmly guiding the damaged boeing 737-700 through a steep descent and an emergency landing in philadelphia after shrapnel from the engine smashed a window. \" she has nerves of steel. That lady, i applaud her. I ' m going to send her a christmas card... She was awesome, \" passenger alfred tumlinson tells the ap. Passengers say shults walked through the plane to check that they were ok after flight 1380, which had been en route to dallas from new york, landed safely. \" we have a part of the aircraft missing, so we're going to need to slow down a bit, \" shults told air traffic controllers, per reuters, adding that the plane was not on fire, but \" they said there is a hole and someone went out. \" shults, who flew f-18s in the navy, joined southwest in 1993. Fox reports that southwest ceo gary kelly praised shults and the rest of the flight crew for handling the situation \" magnificently. \" passengers say bank executive jennifer riordan, the first person to die in an accident involving a us airline since 2009, was partially sucked out of the smashed window before they pulled her back in. The national transportation safety board, which has sent a team of investigators to philadelphia, says one of the engine's fan blades was separated and there were signs of metal fatigue.",

Steenkamp, who had dated pistorius only a few months, was supposed to give a motivational speech at a johannesburg school thursday. Friends and business contacts describe steenkamp as funny, intelligent, and even inspiring. \" the girl was really going places, \" says a former editor for south africa's edition of fhm, which has had steenkamp on its cover. Hearing about her death was \" a hammer blow. … it was like, ' i know her, oh my god. ' i've been trying to process it. It's a real tragedy that such a bright girl has gone. \" steenkamp's family is \" devastated \" by her death, an uncle says, according to the telegraph. \" she loved people, she loved everybody, \" he adds.

In a conversation monday with itv's good morning britain, hawking said the us has swung \" to a right-wing, more authoritarian approach, \" including the new government's january freeze on epa hiring and information dissemination — which hawking roundly denounced, per cnbc. \" i would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists, but i fear that i may not be welcome, \" he says. He adds president trump should dump epa chief scott pruitt, noted for his skepticism toward climate change, which hawking calls \" one of the great dangers \" the world is dealing with. The 75-year-old calls the us \" a place i like and admire in many ways, \" but he isn't quite as complimentary about voters who put trump into office, calling them \" neither liberal nor that well informed. \" he also revealed what may be a bit of a feminist bent, lauding the rise of women around the world, like angela merkel and theresa may, to top political positions, calling it a \" seismic shift. \" \" i welcome these signs of women's liberation, \" he said. As for britain's upcoming break from the eu, hawking thinks the uk should resist a \" hard brexit \" and keep close ties to both europe and china.

The national hurricane center in miami said the core of the category 1 hurricane was about 245 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the mississippi river at 8am edt saturday, per the ap. Top sustained winds were clocked at 85 mph. A hurricane warning is in effect from grand isle, louisiana, to the alabama-florida border and also included metropolitan new orleans nearby lake pontchartrain. A tropical storm warning extended west of grand isle to morgan city, louisiana, and around lake maurepas and east of the alabama-florida border to the okaloosa-walton county line in the florida panhandle. States of emergency were declared in louisiana, mississippi, and alabama as nate — which has already killed at least 21 people in central america — became the latest in a succession of destructive storms this hurricane season. In new orleans, the city's pumping system remains fragile but is working. Two flash floods this summer led to revelations about personnel and equipment problems at the agency that runs the system that drains the city. New orleans mayor mitch landrieu said 109 of its 120 pumps are functioning, which is 92 % capacity. \" we are ready for whatever nate brings our way, \" he said.

Here's what's on deck, and why it's interesting: there's already been talk of cannibals: the issue expected to dominate the talks is syria, and on that front, it's g7 versus russia — the only member that supports the regime. At a news conference yesterday, vladimir putin blasted western nations for supporting syrian rebels \" who kill their enemies and eat their organs, \" cnn reports. The russian president — and alleged super bowl ring thief — was apparently referring to a video showing a rebel taking a bite from the heart of a dead syrian soldier. The pope has given david cameron's agenda the thumbs up: the guardian reports that the two have exchanged letters, with francis expressing his support for the talks ' other main focus, global economic issues. ( agenda items: promoting freer trade between europe and north america and combating global tax evasion. ) he offers a reminder: that \" the goal of economics and politics is to serve humanity, beginning with the poorest and most vulnerable. \" it begins amid spy allegations: in this case, against britain. It's another nsa-edward snowden reveal, with documents allegedly showing that britain spied on attendees of two g20 meetings in london in 2009. The bbc reports that the news could cause some strain among delegates. Cameron offered nothing when asked about the claims: \" we never comment on security or intelligence issues and i am not about to start now. \" it could be \" the most peaceful g8 summit in history \": this per the guardian, which reports that protests are expected to begin around \" tea time. \" a crowd of just 2,000 is expected, and will face a police force that numbers 8,000.

The service members were killed before dawn at a southern kandahar base, marking the third such instance since the protests over koran-burning began last week. A third us service member was wounded, reports the wall street journal. Reports on the gunmen are conflicting: coalition reports cited two men, only one dressed as a soldier; the governor of the district where the shooting occurred says a literacy teacher assisting the afghan national army took a gun from an afghan soldier and began firing. And the ap places the number of attackers at three. While those numbers are hazy, these aren't: the journal reports that not a single us or nato soldier was killed by bombs or in combat since the protests erupted; in 2012, one out of every five coalition-troop deaths can be attributed to an afghan colleague.",

        "summary": "President trump's first 100 days in office end saturday, and while the 100-day mark is arbitrary, it's true that presidents are most influential early in their terms, writes david leonhardt at the new york times. So it may be of some concern to trump and his supporters that, according to leonhardt, his first 100 days have been \" the worst on record. \" \" even if you forget about the content of his actions... And focus only on how much he accomplished, it's a poor beginning. His supporters deserve to be disappointed, and his opponents should be cheered. \" leonhardt points to failures in staffing, legislation, scandals, polling, and more, calling trump \" a weak president off to a uniquely poor start. \" here are some more of the negative reviews of the president's first 100 days: ( or click here for a roundup of positive reviews. ) daylin leach at the sun-sentinel says we should count our blessings trump has been as ineffective as he has because the small amount he has accomplished has \" ranged from the very bad to the truly horrific. \" the washington post says trump's presidency has gone well for one group — late-night comedians — and rounds up some of the best jokes from the first 100 days, including this one from stephen colbert: \" how could trump blow the honeymoon? he's had three of them. \" while \" the trump administration has engaged in a stunning display of ham-fisted, tone-deaf, and downright incomprehensible policy maneuvers \" so far, john feffer at foreign policy in focus says it could get much worse — think north korea. Philip carter at slate says trump has spent his first 100 days making america less secure by lacking a clear foreign policy or a staff to implement that policy. \" until the situation improves, we will all be consigned to living in a state of national insecurity. \" even trump's supporters should be upset with his early presidency — because it bears so much resemblance to the one that came before it, yochi dreazen at vox says. \" from north korea to china to nato, trump has talked about jettisoning the obama administration's foreign policy and replacing it with something far more aggressive.... He hasn't done so. \" despite being a weak president, \" trump has managed to wreak considerable destruction on both the stature of the american presidency, its credibility and its influence, and the course of us policy at home and abroad, \" including his one major accomplishment: putting neil gorsuch on the supreme court, the san francisco chronicle argues.",

Heterosexual couples were already required to be married for a g-4 visa, and the state department says the new rule syncs with the supreme court's 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage. But un globe, an advocacy group for lgbt un employees, calls the policy \" an unfortunate change in rules, \" as gay couples from certain nations could face persecution back home for marrying. The independent notes only about 25 countries recognize same-sex marriage, while nearly a dozen impose the death penalty for it. That means couples who choose not to marry may face the difficult choice of turning down a coveted diplomatic post or else dealing with separation, a un director writes for human rights watch. \" the us government should recognize...

Analysts say the move opens the door for a lot of wearable devices like smartwatches that, unlike google glass, the general public will be comfortable about wearing. Google says it plans to start with watch software, and lg has already announced that its lg g watch will run on the new system, reports the washington post. \" we're confident that a well-designed device has the potential to take the smart wearable market by storm, \" the company's chief executive says. Google says its new software will allow wearables that will allow consumers to do things like monitor their health and fitness and connect with other devices, features that analysts believe will help smartwatches become a lot more popular than google glass. \" it's a really cool idea, but there's something that creeps people out about it, \" a tech analyst tells reuters. Researchers predict that wearable devices will become a $ 10 billion market by 2016, making it important for google to try and get ahead of apple after entering the smartphone and tablet markets late, the new york times finds. Numerous sources say apple is working on a smart \" iwatch, \" but the company has never confirmed that one is in development.

The senate on wednesday confirmed hayden for the job, making her the 14th person to run the institution. There have been so few because the position had been a lifelong one until president obama shortened it to a 10-year term last year. In fact, her predecessor, reagan appointee james billington, left in 2015 after serving 28 years — and taking criticism for not keeping up with technology, notes the ap. That shouldn't be a problem for hayden, who at 63 has gained attention for running and modernizing baltimore's large public library system. Obama appointed hayden in february, but her confirmation got held up in dc politics. Conservatives objected to her opposition to a 2000 law called the children's internet protection act, which makes libraries install filters to block porn, reports the baltimore sun. Hayden argued the filters could block too much information. As president of the american library association in 2003 and 2004, she also criticized the scope of the patriot act, which allowed the feds to search libraries ' borrowing records, notes the atlantic. Another milestone: hayden, who has a doctorate in library sciences, is the first actual librarian to run the library of congress. The others have generally been historians or scholars.",

The librarian of congress job was once a lifetime appointment, and billington had held the title since 1987. But last year obama signed a law imposing a 10-year term limit, making hayden the first to serve on a limited term ( and only the 14th librarian since its founding in 1800 ).

            "Carla hayden made history on wednesday as the senate voted to approve her nomination as librarian of congress, making her both the first woman and the first african american to hold the post. Hayden was first nominated by president obama in february, and the senate rules committee approved her nomination in early june. In recent weeks, advocates for her appointment began to grow restless for the senate to take action and finally place her in the job, more than a year after her predecessor james billington announced his resignation. The librarian of congress job was once a lifetime appointment, and billington had held the title since 1987. But last year obama signed a law imposing a 10-year term limit, making hayden the first to serve on a limited term ( and only the 14th librarian since its founding in 1800 ). Hayden is currently the chief executive of the enoch pratt free library in baltimore,",
            "The longtime leader of baltimore's public library system was confirmed by the senate on wednesday to head the library of congress despite concerns from some conservative lawmakers about her past position on a law intended to limit children's access to pornography at schools and libraries. Carla d. Hayden, the ceo of the enoch pratt free library since 1993, will become the first woman and the first african-american to oversee the nation's largest library. Hayden was nominated by president barack obama in february and was confirmed by the senate on a 74-18 vote. \" she moved the enoch pratt into the digital age, \" said sen. Barbara a. Mikulski, a maryland democrat. \" she's a transformational leader. \" despite politically sensitive challenges facing the 216-year-old library of congress, including criticism that it has not kept pace with technology, hayden's nomination initially was uncontroversial.

Then, as his father watched in horror, the young boy took his last breath and died — and by the time paramedics arrived, it was too late to save him. Doctors say that frankie died of \" dry drowning, \" meaning he'd gotten water into his airways while swimming several days earlier, and his airways became obstructed until ultimately he could not breathe, reports khou. Now, in the hopes of warning other parents about this rare complication from swimming, the boy's parents are going public with their story. More than $ 31,000 has been donated to help with funeral costs on gofundme. \" some children will have symptoms soon after the drowning occurs, \" one doctor tells abc13. \" some children will have symptoms later on. They may seem fine. \" unlike in the movies, she adds, \" it only takes a split second. Drowning is silent. \" this type of drowning is still very rare, occurring in one to two out of every 100 drownings, another doctor tells webmd. And in most cases of dry or secondary drowning, the symptoms — vomiting, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, and trouble breathing — are mild and improve on their own. The boy's mother, tara delgado, says he'd only been in knee-high water the week before, but even so, his lungs were full of fluid. \" there was nothing else they could do for him. \" ( this toddler's mother knew about dry drowning and rushed her to the hospital. )",

Thomas, who was drafted by the seahawks in 2010 and helped them to super bowl glory in 2014, is in the final year of a four-year, $ 40 million contract and has been feuding with the team for months, demanding that they grant him either a trade or an extension.

Under the new law, alimony will be established using a new formula based on marriage length; for a 15-year union, payments would typically last up to 10½ years. But for long-term marriages, judges can still award indefinite alimony; they can also order \"reimbursement alimony \" after shorter-term marriages where one spouse covered an expense for the other, like education. Permanent spousal support has become increasingly rare in the us, and this law reflects \"the fact that both parties, more often than not, are working outside the home and there are more opportunities for people, women in particular, \" says one state senator who sponsored the bill.",

As a new study reveals, the tree leans toward the equator no matter where it grows, giving it what science alert calls a \" drunken-looking slant. \" matthew ritter of california polytechnic state university first became curious about the trees after noticing specimens in both california and hawaii were leaning southward. But when he spoke to researchers in australia, he was surprised. There, cook pines leaned in the opposite direction. A study of 256 cook pines on five continents soon after revealed more than 91 % leaned toward the equator, per science world report, with an average tilt of 8 degrees, or twice that of the leaning tower of pisa. But the farther it is from the equator, the more the tree leans: one cook pine in southern australia has a 40-degree tilt. The tree appears to be \" sensing where it is on the planet, \" ritter tells cbc news. \" that has never been seen ever in any plant, let alone trees. \" it's possible the cook pine leans toward a light source, as many plants do, but that some sort of abnormality keeps earth's gravitational pull from straightening it out, reports discover. Or as researchers write in ecology, the lean could be a response to \" annual sunlight, gravity, magnetism, or any combination of these. \" whatever the reason, it's \" a scientifically interesting thing \" and shows \" plants are responding to their environment in ways we don't understand, \" ritter says.

A 34-year-old man who failed to do so turned up alive to find his wife had killed herself and their two young children, according to police in china. The man, identified only by the surname he, allegedly purchased a $ 144,000 insurance plan naming his wife as beneficiary without her knowledge in early september, per the bbc and south china morning post. When he's body wasn't found sept. 19 alongside a borrowed vehicle that plunged into a river, she therefore assumed he was dead. Less than a month later, 31-year-old dai guihua penned an online suicide note saying she planned to \" accompany \" her husband because she \" only ever wanted our family of four to be together. \" \" thinking that my children would suffer without both their parents, i decided to take them with me, \" added dai, whose parents died when she was young, per the morning post. She and the couple's 4-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter were found drowned in a pond near the family's home in hunan province on oct. 11. He then surrendered to police after sharing a video in which he said he'd faked his death to pay for his daughter's epilepsy treatment. The morning post reports he was some $ 15,000 in debt. Noting he's unlikely to be held responsible for the deaths, a financial crimes expert tells the straits times that even an insurance fraud charge will be hard to prove since \" no claim was ever made to the insurer. \" he is also charged with intentional damage to property.

        "summary": "The man picked to be the next archbishop of canterbury has made a public plea, but it's not exactly on a churchly topic. Justin welby took to twitter to ask everyone who made money gambling that he'd be the new archbishop to donate the winnings to their local church, reports the telegraph. It seems that in the days leading up to yesterday's announcement, british bookmakers got so overwhelmed with wagers on the topic that they had to shut down betting. What's weird is that the bookmakers say people who never placed bets before opened accounts to do so, convinced that welby would be the one. That, of course, has led to speculation that church insiders were trying to cash in, notes the bbc. At least welby has a sense of humor about it: \" it's a very strange feeling when you find yourself having odds quoted on you at a bookie, \" he said. \" generally speaking i am not a horse, i think that's a really important point to get across. \"",

That changed wednesday when mohammed bin salman called khashoggi's killing a \" heinous crime that cannot be justified. \" bin salman, speaking at the future investment initiative conference in riyadh, was responding to a question from a moderator, and the guardian notes that his addressing of the issue \" lifted a subdued mood \" at the conference, which has been boycotted by many in the international business community in the wake of khashoggi's disappearance and death and where attendees were concerned bin salman would not address what one called \" the humongous elephant in the room. \" bin salman assured the audience that \" justice would prevail \" and that those responsible for the attack would be punished. Turkish authorities say four members of the prince's own security staff are among the 18 people who allegedly killed and dismembered khashoggi inside the saudi consulate in istanbul, but turkish president recep tayyip erdogan, despite accusing some of the \" highest ranked \" saudis of being involved, has not mentioned bin salman by name. One of his advisers, however, did say tuesday that bin salman has \" blood on his hands. \" the prince on wednesday distanced himself from those alleged to have been involved, and said saudi arabia is working with turkey on the matter. He cautioned against anyone trying to \" manipulate \" the situation, the ap reports: \" they will not be able to divide us as long as there is a king called king salman bin abdulaziz and a crown prince named mohammed bin salman, and a president in turkey named erdogan. \" us president trump told the wall street journal tuesday that he wants to believe bin salman did not know about the plan to kill khashoggi, but \" the prince is running things over there more so at this stage... And so if anybody were going to be in it would be him. \" ( he has also called the incident the \" worst cover-up ever. \" )",

The meal was recorded and releases signed, so don't be surprised if the video ends up as part of a mcdonald's commercial in the near future.
