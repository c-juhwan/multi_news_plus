Nidal hasan was scheduled to begin yesterday, but the defense team asked for a month to \" process some paperwork, \" finds the austin american statesman. The judge is considering the request and will rule on it today. The military hearing, known as an article 32, is the first step in a process experts expect will end in a death penalty trial for hasan, who is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more, notes the houston chronicle. Hasan, paralyzed from the chest down from bullet wounds he received during the rampage, did not speak during the hearing. Several relatives of the victims sat in the courtroom's public viewing area.",

        "summary": "Drivers in predominantly black neighborhoods in four states paid an average of 30 % more to insure their cars than those in white neighborhoods, a new study finds. While it has long been known that african americans pay more to keep their cars on the road, the analysis conducted by propublica and consumer reports questioned the insurance industry's contention that premiums for liability insurance are determined by risk of accidents. After studying premiums and claims paid out in california, illinois, texas, and missouri from 2012 to 2014, the nonprofits found that drivers in minority zip codes paid as much as 30 % more than white drivers living in areas with similar risk. Propublica says the \" disparity may amount to a subtler form of redlining, \" meaning denying services to minorities. In this case, many non-white drivers who need their cars to get to work are struggling to pay sky-high bills. One black driver, otis nash, pays $ 136 more each month than a white man living in an area of chicago deemed a higher insurance risk. \" you just bite the bullet and go with it, \" nash says. But california insurance regulators called the report \" flawed, \" and the insurance industry dismissed it as a \" weak \" oversimplification of the rate-setting process. \" there is no unfair discrimination, intentional or unintentional, \" says james lynch of the insurance information institute, per the new york times. But aclu attorney rachel goodman tells propublica the findings \" fit within a pattern that we see all too often — racial disparities allegedly result from differences in risk, but that justification falls apart when we drill down into the data. \" ( a study found walmart deliberately runs better stores in white areas. )",

Chicago area disparities in car insurance premiums some car insurers charge higher premiums in chicago's minority neighborhoods than in predominantly white neighborhoods with similar risk of accidents. See the map. Yet hedges, who is a 34-year-old advertising executive, pays only $ 54.67 a month to insure his 2015 audi q5 quattro sports utility vehicle.

That recommendation comes by way of cornell university researchers, who have modeled the statistical mechanics of, yes, zombies and will present their findings at a meeting of the american physical society on march 5 in san antonio. The researchers used a number of techniques that are used when modeling real diseases, and the abstract ends with this dismal line: \" we build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the united states, and discover that for'realistic ' parameters, we are largely doomed. \" but phys.org relays a glimmer of hope by way of alex alemi, a grad student involved in the research: he says those who want to remain safe from the undead for as long as they can should head to the northern rockies. He explains that while books and movies typically show an outbreak touching all corners of the country immediately, \" in our attempt to model zombies somewhat realistically, it doesn't seem like this is how it would actually go down. \" yes, major cities could be toast within days, but less populated areas could be unaffected for weeks, and the northern mountain time zone could be safe for months. \" given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down — there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate, \" says alemi. \" i'd love to see a fictional account where most of new york city falls in a day, but upstate new york has a month or so to prepare. \" ( of course, some people want to be trapped in a room with a zombie. )",

In soaked in bleach, a private investigator named tom grant says he was hired by love to find cobain, who had gone missing, just a few days before his death, per the consequence of sound. The movie reportedly offers up convincing evidence from grant that cobain didn't kill himself but was murdered, and that love was the mastermind, spin notes. The film also features commentary from norm stamper, who had just taken over as head of seattle's police force before cobain died. While stamper doesn't come right out and say love had her husband offed, he does think the movie's allegations warrant a new look. \" we should in fact have taken steps to study patterns involved in the behavior of key individuals who had a motive to see kurt cobain dead, \" he says in the movie, per spin. \" if in fact kurt cobain was murdered … and it was possible to learn that, shame on us for not doing that. \" and if he were still chief today, those steps would be taken, stamper adds: \" it's about right and wrong. It's about honor. It's about ethics.

It was an emotional scene at a welcome-home ceremony in nigeria's capital, abuja, with plenty of tight embraces, singing, and tears of joy, per cnn and the new york times. One woman even lifted her daughter onto her back and carried her like an infant, cnn notes. \" i felt like it was the day that i born her into this world, \" one ecstatic mother said, per the times. \" i danced and danced and danced. \" some of the freed girls held up bibles at an earlier church service as a sign they were reclaiming their christianity after being forced by their captors to convert to islam. But not all the tears at sunday's ceremony were from happiness. Some attendees at the reunion have daughters who are among the 200 or so still missing — and the stories the returned captives tell is a grim one. They say they were given the option to join up with the militants as their wives and turn to islam or else be turned into slaves responsible for cooking, cleaning, and other chores; about half chose each option. They often went hungry, and some died in the sambisa forest where they were being held. And while the nigerian government is trying to negotiate to free the other captives, there's been a disturbing development: more than 100 of them seem unwilling to return home, either because they've been radicalized or because they feel shame at marrying their captors and having babies with them, the head of the chibok development association tells the ap.",

The unwilling girls may have been radicalized by boko haram or are ashamed to return home because they were forced to marry extremists and have babies, chairman pogu bitrus of the chibok development association told the associated press in a telephone interview. Bitrus said the 21 chibok girls freed last week in the first negotiated release between nigeria's government and boko haram should be educated abroad, because they will probably face stigma in nigeria. The girls and their parents were reunited sunday and are expected to meet with nigeria's president muhammadu buhari on tuesday or wednesday, bitrus said. Buhari flew to germany on an official visit the day of the girls'release. Some 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped from a school in northeastern chibok in april 2014. Dozens escaped early on and at least half a dozen have died in captivity, according to the newly freed girls, bitrus said. All those who escaped on their own have left chibok because",

Those who refused endured more than two years of servitude, washing, fetching water and cooking for boko haram. The girls, nearly all of them christians, lived in grass huts and were forced to convert to islam. At first they ate rice and maize."

            "Abuja, nigeria ( ap ) — nigeria's government is negotiating the release of another 83 of the chibok schoolgirls taken in a mass abduction two-and-a-half years ago, but more than 100 others appear unwilling to leave their boko haram islamic extremist captors, a community leader said tuesday. The unwilling girls may have been radicalized by boko haram or are ashamed to return home because they were forced to marry extremists and have babies, chairman pogu bitrus of the chibok development association told the associated press in a telephone interview. Bitrus said the 21 chibok girls freed last week in the first negotiated release between nigeria's government and boko haram should be educated abroad, because they will probably face stigma in nigeria. The girls and their parents were reunited sunday and are expected to meet with nigeria's president muhammadu buhari on tuesday or wednesday, bitrus said. Buhari flew to germany on an official visit the day of the girls'release. Some 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped from a school in northeastern chibok in april 2014. Dozens escaped early on and at least half a dozen have died in captivity, according to the newly freed girls, bitrus said. All those who escaped on their own have left chibok because",
            "Abuja, nigeria — they were taken deep into the sambisa forest to boko haram's stronghold, where the more than 200 schoolgirls from chibok were offered a choice: join the militants or become their slaves. About half of them chose to join and marry the fighters and were taken away, never to be heard from. Those who refused endured more than two years of servitude, washing, fetching water and cooking for boko haram. The girls, nearly all of them christians, lived in grass huts and were forced to convert to islam. At first they ate rice and maize."

        "summary": "A british-australian man who claimed his american wife was lost at sea when their sailing catamaran sank off the coast of cuba has admitted to killing her. Lewis bennett, facing a second-degree murder charge, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in miami on monday, reports the bbc. Bennett, 41, had been sailing from cuba to delray beach, fla., with his wife of three months, isabella hellmann, when he sent out an sos call on may 15, 2017. Bennett said he'd been awoken by a jolt of impact to find the boat taking on water and his wife missing. After he escaped on a life raft, however, authorities noted damage to the boat appeared to have been caused from the inside and portholes below the waterline had been opened. Text messages also revealed hellmann was \" afraid to get home, \" as her husband was \" an angry person \" who did not \" respect her anymore, \" per the sun. Though the guilty plea means family members may never know how hellmann died — a body wasn't found — \" the us attorney's office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant's admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim, \" us attorney ariana fajardo orshan says, per abc australia. In a statement issued through a lawyer, however, hellmann's family says \" there is nothing that lewis can do to ease the pain he has caused them by taking isabella from them. \" bennett, who would've inherited hellmann's apartment and bank accounts, was discovered three hours after the sos call on a life raft with various belongings, including a tea set and $ 40,000 in antique coins stolen from a yacht where he'd previously worked. Now serving seven months for transporting the coins, bennett will face up to eight years in prison at his jan. 10 sentencing.",

            "New york ( ap ) — target shoppers found out this weekend that when stores make deals to carry merchandise from high-end designers for a limited time, it can be, well, really limiting. The discounter partnered with the lilly pulitzer brand to carry a collection of 250 pieces for a fraction of the price of the palm beach designer's original merchandise. But the offer, which included $ 38 pink shift dresses and $ 25 beach towels, was wrought with long lines in stores, quick sellouts online and other problems. It shows the challenges stores face when they offer limited-time collections. These lines typically consist of cheaper versions of designer pieces and are sold for a short period of time. They generate buzz from aspirational buyers who want to don upscale brands as well as avid wearers of the labels themselves. But the high demand can be a double-edged sword: often, customers encounter picked-over merchandise and website snafus. Target, which pioneered these partnerships in the 1990s and has been followed by rivals like h&m, gap and kohl's, started selling the lilly pulitzer collection on sunday online at about 4 a.m. Est and at stores at 8 a.m. Est. Demand was so heavy that target took the site offline for 20 minutes, which caused angry chatter on social media. Ultimately, the items sold out online within",

They are clothes that can be shrunk down and worn by 7-year-old girls without changing a single design element — if there were actual design elements to change. But there are not. Lilly pulitzer is preppy. It is part of a preppy uniform that announces itself from fifty paces. It is not so much a declaration of wealth as it is a perceived statement about class, lineage and attitude. Anyone can work hard and save up enough cash to go out and purchase a chanel suit or a gucci handbag. A devoted student of vogue can cobble together a personal style that speaks to its public identity. But lilly pulitzer suggests an advantage of birth. The clothes stir up scrapbook notions of ancient family trees, summer compounds, boarding school uniforms, and large, granite buildings inscribed with some great-great-grandfather's"

It shows the challenges stores face when they offer limited-time collections. These lines typically consist of cheaper versions of designer pieces and are sold for a short period of time. They generate buzz from aspirational buyers who want to don upscale brands as well as avid wearers of the labels themselves. But the high demand can be a double-edged sword: often, customers encounter picked-over merchandise and website snafus. Target, which pioneered these partnerships in the 1990s and has been followed by rivals like h&m, gap and kohl's, started selling the lilly pulitzer collection on sunday online at about 4 a.m. Est and at stores at 8 a.m. Est. Demand was so heavy that target took the site offline for 20 minutes, which caused angry chatter on social media. Ultimately, the items sold out online within",
            "The preppy clothes made by lilly pulitzer are infantilizing and unflattering, says post fashion critic robin givhan, but maybe that's part of their charm. ( tom legro/the washington post ) the debut of the lilly pulitzer collection for target was a spectacular feat of retailing that had very little to do with the quality of the fashion that the mass marketer was selling. Lilly pulitzer is not fashion. It is clothes. The classic lilly pulitzer dress comes in shrill shades of yellow and pink that are vaguely infantilizing. They are clothes that can be shrunk down and worn by 7-year-old girls without changing a single design element — if there were actual design elements to change. But there are not. Lilly pulitzer is preppy. It is part of a preppy uniform that announces itself from fifty paces. It is not so much a declaration of wealth as it is a perceived statement about class, lineage and attitude. Anyone can work hard and save up enough cash to go out and purchase a chanel suit or a gucci handbag. A devoted student of vogue can cobble together a personal style that speaks to its public identity. But lilly pulitzer suggests an advantage of birth. The clothes stir up scrapbook notions of ancient family trees, summer compounds, boarding school uniforms, and large, granite buildings inscribed with some great-great-grandfather's"

That means the logo, which has been used since 1947 but is today deemed racist by native american groups and others, will be seen on the team's uniforms for just one more season. However, the team will continue to sell merchandise adorned with chief wahoo in northeast ohio, a decision the ap says was made to keep trademark rules in place. The move came after negotiations with major league baseball, which considers the logo inappropriate, reports the new york times. The issue had come to a head in recent years as the indians turned into a powerhouse team in the league and thus drew more attention. In fact, the team had been taking steps to limit the logo's exposure in recent years, notes cleveland.com. For instance, chief wahoo is not displayed during the team's spring training camp in arizona, out of respect for the area's native american population. ( meanwhile, a similar controversy continues over the washington redskins'team name. )",

The site of his resting place had been the subject of a legal fight ever since archeologists discovered his remains underneath a parking lot in leicester in 2012. Though initial plans called for him to be reburied in the nearby leicester cathedral, a group of far-flung relatives sought to have him reburied in york instead, where he grew up. Today, judges at the royal courts of justice rejected the idea. \" we agree that it is time for richard iii to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest, \" they wrote. But they found no compelling reason to move him to york. Richard died on the battlefield in 1485, the last english king to do so, notes the guardian. By the looks of it, he then got unceremoniously dumped into a too-small grave, where he remained for nearly 530 years. The la times notes that scholars remain divided over richard himself: he's either the \" bloodthirsty tyrant \" as depicted by shakespeare or \" an enlightened ruler \" whose reputation got maligned by the tudor dynasty that succeeded him. Either way, he had a bad case of roundworms when he died.",

The highest amount of sitting-related deaths were in the western pacific and parts of europe, afp reports. Lebanon and the netherlands topped the list, while mexico and myanmar had the fewest sitting-related deaths. Researchers found that eliminating sitting could increase overall life expectancy by 0.2 years, while reducing daily sitting time by two hours could decrease an individual's mortality by 2.4 %.

Now the epa chief is under the microscope for what cnn calls an \" unprecedented level \" of protection.

Using public documents, cnn estimates the cost for the entire security team — not counting training, travel, or gear — at $ 2 million per year, prompting some members of congress to ask if this is a \" potential waste or abuse of taxpayer dollars. \" the reason, especially considering no other epa head has ever received 24/7 protection: the epa is a \" lightning rod, \" and pruitt is paying the price for it, per the agency's inspector general's office, which says it's investigated more than 70 threats against pruitt so far. That's \" at least … four to five times the number of threats against mr. Pruitt \" than gina mccarthy, his predecessor under obama, assistant ig patrick sullivan says. Sullivan adds the threats are coming from \" both sides of the spectrum \": those who think the epa isn't doing enough to protect the environment, and those who think the agency is overregulating. Pruitt is also said to be getting \" security enhancements \" at his dc office, including card readers to control access and a soundproof phone booth — which cnn says together will cost more than $ 40,000, per purchasing and contracting documents. Two democratic congress members, peter defazio and grace napolitano, have crafted a letter to the ig asking for a look at this spending, which they say is \" symptomatic of a troubling culture that appears to have swept through this administration … from the president on down. \"",

That didn't change thursday as he noted cleanup efforts are now underway and suggested 14,000 evacuated residents could return to the area as soon as friday. But werner knows well what those residents might find: his home and seven condominium buildings he owns burned to the ground. \" i really can't dwell on it that much, \" he tells the ap. \" i think of others that have lost theirs, and it keeps my mind off of our problems. \" gatlinburg's fire chief adds several firefighters also lost their homes, but are still working \" to take care of everybody else. \" a national park service rep says the fire began on a trail 10 miles south of gatlinburg and was \" human caused, \" though she offered no other details, reports cnn. As it spread, the fire destroyed more than 700 buildings in sevier county, including 300 in gatlinburg. Many other people are missing and officials fear the death toll will rise as they are now moving from house to house to survey damage. Though dollywood in neighboring pigeon forge escaped major damage, tennessee native dolly parton says her foundation will donate $ 1,000 per month for six months to survivors who lost their homes. \" we want to provide a hand up to those families who have lost everything … so that they can get back on their feet, \" parton says, per buzzfeed.",

The new york times reports that word of the bodies first emerged in 1975 by way of two 12-year-old boys who were playing at the site and reported that their look into a hole in a concrete slab revealed a space \" filled to the brim with bones. \" so why did it take four decades and a determined historian to expose what may have happened at the mother-and-baby home in tuam, county galway? locals apparently wrote off the remains as remnants from a workhouse that pre-dated the home, or even a relic of the 1840s famine. Though the washington post earlier reported an investigation was under way, the times indicates that's not the case: police yesterday said in a statement, \" there is no suggestion of any impropriety and there is no... Investigation. Also, there is no confirmation from any source that there are between 750 and 800 bodies present. \" ( nbc news reports that historian catherine corless found only a single record of one of the children in question being buried at a cemetery. ) still, the police are being urged to open an inquiry, as is the government, with politicians clamoring for an investigation, reports the irish times. The one group that could possibly shed light on the situation — the sisters of bon secours, which ran the home — has yet to issue a comment.

( as carly fiorina did in the early debate. ) in fact, trump fielded the very first question, and it was a doozy. When all the candidates were asked if anyone was unwilling to pledge support to the eventual nominee and to rule out a run as an independent, only trump raised his hand. \"i will not make the pledge at this time, \" he said. Other highlights, via cnn, the wall street journal and the washington post: christie vs paul: after paul said, \"i want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent americans.... I ' m proud of standing for the bill of rights, and i will continue to, \" christie responded, \" that's a completely ridiculous answer.... How are you supposed to know?... When you're sitting in a subcommittee blowing hot air, then you can say things like that. \" bush on political dynasties: \" i ' m going to have to earn this. \" and on the iraq war: \"knowing what we know now with faulty intelligence … it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in. \" cnn's david chalian: \" nothing about tonight's debate indicated that jeb bush is in the driver's seat of this campaign. He seemed much more like a passenger — and at times a nervous and unsure one at that. \" paul vs trump: \" he buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already hedging his bet on the clintons, \" said paul. Trump responded that he's given money to paul, too. Kasich: \"donald trump's hitting a nerve in this country, he really is.... For people to want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake. \" he also gave an impassioned answer about his support of gay marriage, here.

        "summary": "In the us, women and girls sometimes donate their hair to groups that make wigs — think locks of love — not because hair is hard to come by but because it is so expensive. But many also buy wigs and extensions made of real human hair — and chances are good that hair comes from countries like india and china, where women sell their long locks out of necessity. It's a dirty business, reports alex mayyasi for priceonomics, both literally and figuratively. In india, for instance, sites like the venkateswara temple do quite a business selling hair ( though they say they donate the proceeds to charities ) because it is customary for pilgrims who visit the temple to have their heads shaved. Most are unaware their hair is sold. The workers who then sort through the discarded locks must contend with blood from the quickly-shaved scalps, lice, and more, and the factories reek. As scott carney wrote in his 2010 report for mother jones, \" put 21 tons of the stuff in a room blooming with mildew and fungus and the stench is overpowering. \" most say hair from india is the best; mayyasi writes that indian pilgrims typically haven't performed damaging treatments on their hair, \" but its most valuable attribute is that it closely resembles caucasian hair. \" there's a dark side to the trade, and not just the flow of hair from poor women giving up their long locks for wealthy buyers. There are stories of men beating and holding down women to shave their heads for money. Wigs made of real hair can easily cost thousands of dollars, though synthetic hair — which just doesn't look as natural and can't be styled — continues to improve and is far less expensive, so it may only be a matter of time before the market for the real thing dwindles considerably.

Homo sapiens arose in africa at least 300,000 years ago and left to colonize the globe. Scientists think there were several dispersals from africa, not all equally successful. Last week's report of a human jaw showed some members of our species had reached israel by 177,000 to 194,000 years ago. Now comes a discovery in india of stone tools, showing a style that has been associated elsewhere with our species. They were fashioned from 385,000 years ago to 172,000 years ago, showing evidence of continuity and development over that time. That starting point is a lot earlier than scientists generally think homo sapiens left africa. This tool style has also been attributed to neanderthals and possibly other species. So it's impossible to say whether the tools were made by homo sapiens or some evolutionary cousin, say researchers who reported the finding wednesday in the journal nature. \" we are very cautious on this point \" because no human fossils were found with the tools, several authors added in a statement, per the ap. Michael petraglia, an archaeologist who specializes in human evolution in asia but didn't participate in the work, said he did not think the tools show that our species had left africa so long ago. \" i simply don't buy it. \" instead, he said, he believes one of our evolutionary cousins in india developed the tool style independently. \" it's a whodunit, and we don't have the answer, \" a paleoanthropologist not involved with the study tells npr.",

        "summary": "After the escalating pattern of hostilities over the previous 11 gop debates, the 12th offered what seemed like the strangest spectacle yet: four republican candidates calmly discussing the issues, with nary a mention of bodily parts or functions. Marco rubio was widely seen as having turned in the best performance, though the lack of any standout moments from rivals left the relatively subdued donald trump in the best position at the end of the night. Here's what commentators are saying about the candidates: donald trump. He pursued a strategy common to front-runners: \" play not to lose, avoid mistakes or eruptions, and force the opposition to change the dynamic, \" writes dan balz at the washington post. He didn't really seem to know what he was talking about most of the time, balz notes, but that hasn't been a problem for him before. Mark halperin at bloomberg also declares trump — \" the luckiest front-runner \" — the winner, mainly because the three underdogs largely left him alone and failed to score big moments of their own. Marco rubio. The florida senator was \" poised, confident, and knowledgeable \" on his home turf, writes chris cillizza at the washington post, who credits him for avoiding attacks on trump and for \" performing extremely well when the chips were down, \" even though it's probably too late to save his campaign. Ted cruz. This was a good but not good enough performance from cruz, according to niall stanage at the hill, who considers trump and rubio the winners. His debating \" was proficient, as it almost always is, but he delivered no moments spectacular enough to derail the trump train, \" he writes. Leon wolf at redstate, however, calls cruz the winner simply because the debate left him on course to become trump's sole opponent. Wolf gives cruz bonus points because \" on several occasions, he demonstrated that he knew what he was talking about, and that donald trump did not. \" john kasich. The ohio governor had some excellent lines and turned in a competent performance, but not one likely to catapult him to the gop nomination. Last week, kasich emerged as \" the adult in the room during a childish debate that for all intents and purposes devolved into a middle-school food fight, \" writes andrew tobias at cleveland.com, but he failed to stand out during thursday's more well-mannered affair.

The early results were quickly removed, and when actual voting commenced, the commission said aliyev had managed 85 % of the vote, compared to the runner-up's 6 %. The election was never actually expected to be free or fair, the post notes. Today, the commission apologized for the advance result, claiming it was spurred by software testing. But runner-up jamil hasanli wasn't satisfied. \" this election doesn't reflect the people's will, \" he said. Outside observers cited a deeply flawed voting process, including \" limitations on the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association that didn't guarantee a level playing field for candidates, \" the ap reports. Political activists in the country have been falsely imprisoned, says human rights watch; and an analyst says fake candidates ganged up on hasanli during debates, the bbc reports.

A grand jury on tuesday indicted former licensed nurse loyce pickquet agyeman on charges of felony murder, neglect to an elder person, and concealing a death following a police investigation triggered by 11alive's airing of hidden camera footage from inside northeast atlanta health and rehabilitation. It showed agyeman, former licensed nurse wanda nuckles, and nursing assistant mable turman inside the room of 89-year-old james dempsey, who fell unconscious and ultimately died on feb 27, 2014, after repeatedly calling for help while struggling to breathe. The footage — from a camera set up by family members who reached a settlement with the nursing home, per law &amp; crime — showed staff laughing as they tried to start an oxygen machine. It also conflicted with a video deposition in which nuckles claimed she'd given dempsey cpr continuously until paramedics arrived. Staff didn't call 911 for almost an hour, 11alive previously reported. Also indicted tuesday, nuckles is charged with depriving an elder person of essential services and concealing a death, while turman — who remains certified — is charged with neglect and concealing a death. Arrest warrants for all three have been issued, per the atlanta journal-constitution, though it's not clear if they are yet in custody. A trial date is pending.",

            "***update: politico has suspended williams. Full report here. Politico, the unofficial web-branch of msnbc, and whose staff spends more time on msnbc than chris matthews, has a so-called reporter named joseph williams who all but called mitt romney a racist on martin bashir's show today. Williams says declaratively that romney is only comfortable around white people. But if you think the video clip is disgraceful, wait till you see mr. Williams ' greatest tweets collection assembled below. \"dick \" jokes about ann romney. Really. — — the full clip is actually worse. Williams just isn't any politico reporter, by the way, he's their white house correspondent, but one who regularly shills for obama on twitter — furthering the obama campaign's talking points on race and romney's wealth. Oh, and he also makes penis jokes about ann romney. Picture of a politico white house correspondent in action … when he thinks no one is watching: – and naturally, nascar is racist, donchaknow: – this is our msm. This is politico. This is why god created andrew breitbart. Follow john nolte on twitter @noltenc",
            "Regrettably, an unacceptable number of joe williams's public statements on cable and twitter have called into question his commitment to this responsibility. His comment about governor romney earlier today on msnbc fell short of our standards for fairness and judgment in an especially unfortunate way. Joe has acknowledged that his appearance reflected a poor choice of words. This appearance came in the context of other remarks on twitter that, cumulatively, require us to make clear that our standards are serious, and so are the consequences for disregarding them. This is true for all politico journalists, including an experienced and well-respected voice like joe williams.

Infotel news reports that devon webb, angelo passerin, and about eight others were snowmobiling after lunch in mcbride on march 22, 2013, when webb's sister, sarah, became stuck in the snow, per a lawsuit filed by passerin. Passerin saw her waving for help and went to assist, when suddenly a riderless snowmobile came out of nowhere and struck him down.

Passerin, \" the suit notes. It only stopped after slamming into sarah webb's snowmobile. The crash left passerin with broken leg bones and vertebrae, a brain injury, and a limp now with him for life, the cbc reports. Webb was found liable because he wasn't wearing the tethered safety cord that should be hooked to each rider's clothing; if the rider falls off, the cord, attached to a cap on the snowmobile, yanks off the cap, which shuts the vehicle off. Supreme court justice dev dley found webb had neglected to put his tether on, bucking precautions that would've kept his friend safe. Although webb tried to argue that passerin had been drinking — the latter had a vodka cranberry with his lunch, while webb had consumed no alcohol — the judge found \" no evidence \" passerin was impaired to the point where he could've avoided being hit by the runaway snowmobile. Both passerin and sarah webb said they hadn't heard the snowmobile coming.",

Carman has reportedly been thinking about his gender, as well as what it means to be trans, since he was 12, and eyvazzadeh says she wanted to help \" from the minute \" they met. \" i could tell that he was mature, he knew exactly what he wanted and this was self-directed, \" she says. \" it's not something you do on a whim. \" ( caitlyn jenner is shocking some of her trans friends with her politics. )",

The company announced wednesday that once activated, snap map places a location bitmoji on the new map feature for anyone on a user's friends list to see.

Writer dani deahl tested out how much information she could gather via the map by observing a friend's bitmoji. Within minutes, she was able to guess her friend's address, which she hadn't previously known. \"that's so creepy! \" her friend said after deahl called to confirm the address, adding, \"i wouldn't want people to see where i am at all times. \" the map function is opt-in and users can go into a \"ghost mode \" to turn it off, but a social media expert told abc 15 that parents should make sure their children understand how it all works: \"it's ok to pretend that you don't understand, even if you might understand a little bit, get them to explain it to you to make sure they understand. \" meanwhile, the telegraph reports that police in the uk have already issued warnings to parents on the dangers of location sharing, echoed by uk safer internet centre, which cautions that the new feature \" can allow people to build up a picture of where you live, go to school, and spend your time. \" the verge writes that to opt out, new snapchat users should choose ghost mode, and those who already opted in can switch to ghost mode in the map's settings to disable the location feature.",

For a woman who started out hawking dog food on camera to one that reeled in the most viewers of any single news program ever ( that would be the almost 50 million who watched her interview monica lewinsky in 1999 ), her career has been a long and remarkable one. As the new york times puts it, \" it's hard to imagine a single newscaster again holding so much sway over the culture \" — which shows both walters ' pull as well as the changing media landscape. It may be goodbye, but we ' ll always have the interviews. Here are five of her more notable ones, courtesy of abc news. Monica lewinsky: the former white house intern broke her silence on her affair with president bill clinton in an interview that aired march 4, 1999. Fidel castro: in an interview that aired june 9, 1977, walters talked to cuban president fidel castro as the pair crossed the bay of pigs. Vladimir putin: walters sat down with putin in an interview airing november 7, 2001, marking the russian president's first chat with an american journalist since the sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Tom cruise: everyone remembers cruise's couch-jumping on the oprah winfrey show, but he explained his bizarre behavior to walters in 2005; he said he had no regrets. Bashar al-assad: in 2011 walters nabbed the syrian president's first interview with a us journalist after the syrian uprising began, in which he denied ordering a deadly crackdown on protesters.

While they simply don't know yet what caused the freefall, they're pretty sure it wasn't triggered by any single event such as those, reports marketwatch. The sec's mary schapiro and commodities trading chief gary gensler promised to provide preliminary — emphasis on the preliminary — findings next week. Schapiro said sec investigators have issued supboenas, though she didn't say to whom. One area of possible inquiry, notes bloomberg: traders who tried to take advantage of the chaos by purposely driving down stocks. Regulators also are looking at activity in something called the s&p 500 e-mini futures contract, which the new york times describes as \" by far the largest stock index futures contract \" — and sounds infinitely more complicated than fat fingers.",

At issue is the dow jones industrial average drop of nearly 1,000 points last thursday - a fall of roughly $ 1 trillion in market value -- much of it in a matter of minutes, before recovering to a 348-point loss for the session. Both mary schapiro, securities and exchange commission chairwoman, and gary gensler, commodity futures trading commission chairman, refuted speculation that a trader might have made a so-called \" fat finger \" error that contributed to the stock market plunge. \" neither our review nor reviews by the relevant exchanges and market participants have uncovered such an error [ fat-finger ] trade, \" said schapiro at a capitol hill hearing on the stock plunge and a subsequent investigations into the matter by the sec and commodity futures trading commission. The two agencies plan to provide preliminary findings on what caused the stock plunge next week. Some observers have speculated that a \" fat finger \" error may have taken place, in which a trader enters an order for billions of shares rather than an intended order for millions. Gensler also said tuesday in testimony that the agency's staff review \" produced no evidence \" indicating that a \" fat finger \" was the catalyst. The sec and the cftc have reached a preliminary agreement with securities exchanges to create a unified stock-by-stock circuit breaker for all exchanges -- including electronic exchanges -- to halt trades or slow down the pace of trading during a massive market downturn, according to people familiar with the discussions.

        "summary": "Mystery solved: scientists say they've finally figured out why old faithful erupts with super-hot water and steam about every 90 minutes, our amazing planet reports. Seismic records show that under the yellowstone geyser, a large egg-shaped chamber is connected to the mouth of old faithful by a sort of pipe. After every eruption, water levels rise in the chamber and send steam bubbles into the conduit — which creates a \" bubble trap \" that leads to the eventual steam explosion. What's the big deal? the finding helps discredit an old idea that large geysers are fed by long, narrow tubes ( our amazing planet describes old faithful's \" plumbing [ as ] more like a bagpipe than a flute \" ). Researchers made a similar finding earlier this year in russia, where geysers are also fed by caverns that create bubble traps. Another neat fact: scientists were able to map old faithful's cavern with seismic records because gas bubbles create tremors when they pop. And there's good news for those eager to visit it: sequestration forced the park to postpone its annual snow-plowing efforts, pushing the opening date to april 26; but the billings gazette reports that the road to old faithful opened friday, due to a happy combination of good weather, less snow than expected, and help from the state's department of transportation.",

Credit: dreamstime view full size image old faithful's underground plumbing looks more like a bagpipe than a flute, a new study of the yellowstone national park geyser finds. A big chamber sits about 50 feet ( 15 meters ) underground, located southwest of old faithful, researchers report in a study published online march 30 in the journal geophysical research letters. The exact size can't be determined, but they estimate the egg-shaped void is at least 50 feet ( 15 m ) tall and 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide. The cavern connects to a pipe angled about 24 degrees that feeds old faithful's maw. Tiny tremors extracted from seismic records collected in the 1990s revealed the shape of the cavern and geyser conduit. Popping gas bubbles create the tremors. Not only do the tremors map the shape of underground spaces, they can also track water.

        "summary": "Researchers in london think they have solved one of the most enduring mysteries of stonehenge: how did a bunch of prehistoric britons haul massive stones from a quarry in wales to the site of the monument more than 100 miles? \" the answer, \" per the telegraph, \" is surprisingly simple. \" by mounting a giant stone on a wooden sleigh and dragging it along a track of timbers, a team from university college london found that just 10 people were able to move a more than 2,000-pound stone at a rate of about 1mph. \"we were expecting to need at least 15 people to move the stone so to find we could do it with 10 was quite interesting, \" doctoral student barney harris tells the telegraph. The rocks in question, the ones at the center of the monument known as bluestones, were quarried in preseli hills in pembrokeshire, wales, according to a separate study last year. They were laid at stonehenge, some 140 miles away in wiltshire, around 2400 bc, according to seeker.com. The larger stones around the perimeter, called sarsens, are local sandstone and were laid during a second phase of construction about 500 years later. The sleigh-and-track method, if that's what stonehenge's architects used, is not unique, harris tells the telegraph. \"we know that pre-industrialized societies like the maram naga in india still use this kind of sledge to construct huge stone monuments, he says, adding that the japanese are known to have used similar sleighs thousands of years ago. Could oxen have been used to pull the stones along the track? \" oxen are quite belligerent and difficult to control, \" harris says. \" this experiment shows that humans could have carried out the task fairly easily. \" ( a century ago, cecil chubb bought stonehenge on a whim. )",

Researchers at rush university medical center say that feeding cinnamon to mice with a poor learning ability turned them into a bunch of brainiacs by transforming the part of the brain that controls memory. Previous research has found poor learners have less of a protein vital to memory and learning, known as creb, and more of a protein known as gabra5 in the hippocampus. However, poor-learning mice showed increased creb and decreased gabra5 after a month of daily cinnamon doses, study author kalipada pahan explains in a release. Essentially, the body converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, which promotes healthy neurons, reports the epoch times. The mice were then able to navigate a maze in half the time it took them before, even though the exit moved with each test. The ability was similar to that of so-called good-learning mice. Mice who were given cinnamon but were already good learners, however, didn't exhibit any change. \" we have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular, and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning, \" says pahan, adding \" if these results are replicated in poor learning students, it would be a remarkable advance. \" interestingly, pahan notes cinnamon is superior to straight doses of sodium benzoate because the chemical is slowly released from cinnamon but is \" quickly excreted out through the urine \" when taken on its own.

At least two fires were triggered when a diesel leak exploded at the richmond refinery, one of the largest in the nation, reports the san francisco chronicle. There were no fatalities and no one was seriously injured. The plant was evacuated after workers spotted the leak. Minutes after the explosions, plant alarms alerted nearby residents to stay indoors with doors and windows shut to avoid breathing toxins in the air. Residents in all of contra costa county in the east bay were being told to stay inside as hazmat trucks drove through streets taking air samples. Health officials, concerned about fumes from crude oil and diesel fuel, said that so far the winds seem to be carrying most of the smoke skyward. Dozens of people complaining about breathing problems headed to local emergency rooms. One patient with a burning throat and sore, itchy eyes, told the chronicle: \" they told me i ' m not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious. \" the fire was contained late last night as a crew of 60 firefighters battled the blaze with nitrogen and steam to keep it cool, but chevron officials offered no estimate as to when the fire would be extinguished, nbc reports. The 1,200-worker refinery is northern california's largest, the third biggest in the state, and is capable of processing more than 242,000 barrels of oil a day.",

According to people, reet jurvetson, 19, flew from canada to la in 1969 to see a man named jean she met in a montreal coffee shop. Weeks later, she was dead — stabbed 150 times. Jurvetson's body was found on mulholland drive, near where sharon tate and four others had been stabbed to death by the manson family a few months earlier. One manson prosecutor believes jurvetson was killed because she witnessed another killing, but no solid evidence has ever tied her death to the manson family. Jurvetson's family never filed a missing persons report, figuring she had started a new life in the us, and jurvetson wasn't even identified until last april. Earlier this summer, a friend from montreal called the lapd. She remembered seeing jurvetson with a man named jean — and a second man named jean — at a coffee shop. She helped police develop a sketch of the jeans, who may have been roommates, and now detectives are looking for the pair. One lapd investigator calls jean \" the best lead we have. \" police also got another lead recently when they discovered where jurvetson had been living in hollywood before her death, cbc reports.

The canadian woman, who would have just two weeks to live before being stabbed 157 times, added \" the people are kind \" to describe the americans she met in california. Jurvetson had left canada days earlier to visit a fellow montrealer named jean in hollywood. She had a crush on the young man who looked like jim morrison, the lead singer of the doors. A week after the fifth estate released a sketch of jean commissioned by the program, the lapd today released another sketch of him by a different artist. Critical new detail the lapd also revealed that it recently learned the address of where jurvetson had been living while in hollywood — 5311 melrose ave. — information it had been seeking for months. In an interview with the fifth estate in may, the los angeles police department's lead detective on the case, det. Louis rivera, said the address where she was staying was \" the most important \" missing clue.

        "summary": "The world's oldest known flower dating back 130 million years is an aquatic species called montsechia found fossilized in limestone deposits in spain. But it wouldn't necessarily be recognized as a flower today, given it didn't boast petals or nectar-producing structures. \" the fruit contains a single seed \" — thus making it an angiosperm, or flowering plant — \" which is borne upside down, \" says indiana university paleobotanist david dilcher, who with colleagues reports these findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The plant thrived in freshwater lakes in what are now spain's mountainous regions, and while phys.org reports that the fossils were first discovered more than 100 years ago, the ones used in this study were \" poorly understood and even misinterpreted \" when analyzed at earlier points, dilcher says. One way to spread seed — which in angiosperms is typically done by getting other animals ( think bees ) or elements ( think wind ) to carry pollen to other members of the same species — is through water currents. In fact today's descendants of montsechia, called ceratophyllum, are found in lakes on every continent, and they behave similarly. \" flowers are all about sex, \" dilcher tells newsweek. \" right at the start [ of angiosperm evolution ], this was another method that flowering plants were using for their genetic exchange. \" whether montsechia is the world's oldest flower has yet to be determined, but it is the oldest flower we have found to date, suggesting that angiosperms have their earliest roots in water instead of on land.

But not a soul was around to witness a man hit the pavement of this quiet residential street in mortlake, south-west london, early on a bright september sunday. Police say the death is being treated as unexplained.

        "summary": "North korea's first successful launch of an icbm has shocked the world — and caused some gloating in pyongyang. North korea's kcna news agency quoted kim jong un as saying \" american bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the july 4 anniversary, \" the guardian reports. The agency said kim, who has vowed not to give up the country's nuclear program, urged his nuclear scientists to \" frequently send big and small ' gift packages'to the yankees. \" according to kcna, the missile north korea launched tuesday is capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. The latest: the us and south korea responded to the launch with a joint ballistic missile exercise in the sea of japan on tuesday, reports the bbc. The two countries warned that \" self-restraint \" was \" all that separated armistice and war. \" the us vowed to take tougher measures on north korea, with secretary of state rex tillerson calling for global action, reports reuters. \" all nations should publicly demonstrate to north korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons, \" he said. The united nations security council will hold a meeting on the issue wednesday. The new york times looks at the different options president trump can proceed with, and finds that they are \" few and risky. \" one option that china and russia agree on involves pyongyang suspending its nuclear weapons program in return for the us suspending joint military exercises with south korea. The launch of an icbm has long been seen as a \" red line, \" though analysts believe pyongyang may still be years away from having long-range nuclear capability, the ap reports. Hamish de bretton-gordon, a former commanding officer of the british armed forces joint chemical biological radiological nuclear regiment, says \" in capability of missile terms and delivery, it is a major step up and they seem to be making progress week-on-week, \" but \" actually marrying the warhead to the missile is probably the biggest challenge, which they appear not to have progressed on. \" the los angeles times reports that the icbm launch wasn't a huge surprise for some analysts, who observed that north korea had two mysterious launch failures at the same facility last fall. The australian broadcasting corporation looks at just how far the north korean icbm could go.

Reaper drones deployed from the seychelles — but controlled from bases in the us — can be configured for both surveillance and strike missions, say officials, who warn that militant groups in africa are showing a new level of co-operation among themselves. \" we do not know enough about the leaders of the al-qaeda affiliates in africa, \" a senior us official tells the wall street journal. \" is there a guy out there saying, ' i am the future of al qaeda? ' who is the next osama bin laden? \"",

Officials said. One of the installations is being established in ethi­o­pia, a u.s. Ally in the fight against al-shabab, the somali militant group that controls much of that country. Another base is in the seychelles, an archipelago in the indian ocean, where a small fleet of \"hunter-killer \" drones resumed operations this month after an experimental mission demonstrated that the unmanned aircraft could effectively patrol somalia from there. The u.s. Military also has flown drones over somalia and yemen from bases in djibouti, a tiny african nation at the junction of the red sea and the gulf of aden. In addition, the cia is building a secret airstrip in the arabian peninsula so it can deploy armed drones over yemen. The rapid expansion of the undeclared drone wars is a reflection of the growing alarm with which u.s. Officials view the activities of al-qaeda affiliates in yemen and somalia, even as al-qaeda's core leadership in pakistan has been weakened by u.s. Counterterrorism operations. The u.s. Government is known to have used drones to carry out lethal attacks in at least six countries: afghanistan, iraq, libya, pakistan, somalia and yemen. The negotiations that preceded the establishment of the base in the republic of seychelles illustrate the efforts the united states is making to broaden the range of its drone weapons.

        "summary": "Around 1995, linda and robert tofolowsky noticed the walls of the basement in their connecticut home cracking. Their foundation had developed severe fissures, and they soon discovered other homes in the area with the same issue. Their insurance claim was denied, they got no help from the town or the state, and they lost their lawsuit against jj mottes, the company that installed the concrete for the foundation. In a 2001 complaint the couple filed with the consumer protection department, linda wrote that the issue needed to be made public \" so that maybe someone else will not lose their biggest investment, their home. \" the couple ended up being just the first of hundreds of homeowners in the state whose foundations are crumbling, causing their houses to slowly collapse. \" when you're told your home is now worthless and your biggest investment is now worthless, it's devastating, \" one such homeowner tells the new york times. As the times points out, state officials were warned about the problem by more than just the tofolowskys in the early 2000s, and in 2003, lawmakers met with the cpd, representatives from the attorney general's office, and homeowners about the issue — but did nothing. In july 2015, wvit did an investigative report on the foundations, prompting state officials to open an inquiry. They recently announced that the problem is at least partially caused by high levels of pyrrhotite ( a mineral that can cause swelling and cracking when mixed with water ) from aggregate in a local quarry used in jj mottes ' concrete, the hartford courant reported last month; a spokesperson for jj mottes blames contractors who improperly added water to wet concrete so it would pour faster. Officials are taking steps to help homeowners, but none of those steps do much to subsidize their costs, and wvit notes that insurance companies are only settling with some homeowners and only after \" long legal battles. \"",

        "summary": "A veteran pilot's theory about what happened to flight 370 dazzled the internet yesterday, but aviation writer jeff wise is poking holes in it today at slate. If you missed it, pilot chris goodfellow speculated at google plus that a fire aboard the missing malaysian jet caused its disappearance. The pilots went off course deliberately to reach the nearest airport — on the island of langkawi — but the smoke got to them before they could land, and the plane kept flying on its own over the ocean until it crashed. A world desperate for answers soaked it up, but wise says the theory doesn't hold up when other facts about flight 370 are considered. Specifically: \" while it's true that mh370 did turn toward langkawi and wound up overflying it, whoever was at the controls continued to maneuver after that point as well, \" writes wise. One subsequent waypoint picked up a sharp right turn and another a left turn. \" such vigorous navigating would have been impossible for unconscious men. \" a final electronic ping picked up from the plane put it on one of two paths, one over central asia as far as kazakhstan and the other out over the indian ocean. \" as mh370 flew from its original course toward langkawi, it was headed toward neither, \" writes wise. \" without human intervention — which would go against goodfellow's theory — it simply could not have reached the position we know it attained \" at 8: 11am on march 8, the time of that last ping. The bottom line is that \" goodfellow's theory falls apart, \" writes wise. Click for his full column. Or to read about how files are missing from the senior pilot's flight-simulator system.",

        "summary": "The washington post's fact checker blog does its thing with president obama's much-criticized claim that \" if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period. \" the verdict? four pinocchios, which happens to be the max. Though he might have been forgiven for such a grand proclamation while the bill was still being drafted, the president continued to make the claim even once the law had been signed and its potential impact on insurance plans was clear, writes glenn kessler. Further, the law's design purposefully quashes \" substandard \" plans that the americans on them certainly might like, in no small part because they can be cheap. So kessler amends the president's infamous line: \" if you like your health care plan, you ' ll be able to keep your health care plan — if we deem it to be adequate. \" other pundits are also weighing in: what obama \" meant was you can keep it if he likes it, \" echoes holman jenkins in the wall street journal. The bottom line, for jenkins: \" he wants you to pay for coverage you ' ll never use ( mental-health services, cancer wigs, fertility treatments, viagra ) so the money can be spent on somebody else. \" \" the gop outrage about americans supposedly ' losing ' coverage is largely just more of the same old misdirection, \" writes greg sargent in the washington post. \" it's a subset of a larger republican refusal to have an actual debate about the law's tradeoffs — one in which the law's benefits for millions of americans are also reckoned with in a serious way. \" jonah goldberg says obama's statement \" looks like the biggest lie about domestic policy ever uttered by a us president. \" the question, writes goldberg at national review online, is whether \" he was simply ' playing to win ' and therefore lying on purpose \" or whether he actually believed his own spin. \" the president's message about his signature law has always been: it gets better, i promise, \" writes john dickerson at slate. \" that was always an uphill battle. The benefits of the law were strung out over time, making it harder for people to recognize a payoff.'trust me ' claims clash with people's mistrust of politicians and government programs. \"",
