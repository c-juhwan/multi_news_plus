Using a computer formula, mit researchers discovered that just 3,000 four-person vehicles could provide for 98 % of the ride demands of manhattan residents if everyone opted to share rides, while 2,000 10-passenger vans could account for 95 %, reports cnnmoney. The model, particularly suited to self-driving cars since they would be able to automatically re-route themselves when necessary, used data from 3 million taxi rides taken over a week in manhattan in march 2013 to pose real-time requests, then grouped passengers together based on destinations and sent empty vehicles to await requests in high-traffic areas, which made the system 20 % faster, per gizmodo. The result also meant less congestion and pollution. The downside was that passengers theoretically waited 2.8 minutes for a vehicle, and spent an extra 3.5 minutes traveling because of additional stops. If adopted, such a system would also put thousands of taxi drivers out of work, but \" drivers will be able to make the same amount of money working shorter shifts, while the customers will get the same level of service, cities will have fewer cars on roads, the commute experience will be better for everyone...

            "Significance ride-sharing services can provide not only a very personalized mobility experience but also ensure efficiency and sustainability via large-scale ride pooling. Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using new york city taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles ( 15 % of the taxi fleet ) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98 % of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min.

        "summary": "The latest higher education campus to see protests over racial issues: california's occidental college, where whites make up 50.6 % of the student body and minority students say the campus climate is inhospitable. Students have been protesting over diversity issues, with a list of demands including more programming and resources for \" black and other marginalized students, \" a \" fully funded and staffed black studies program, \" and more tenured faculty of color. As of monday, students were occupying the college's administrative building, insisting that if those demands are not met, president jonathan veitch resign, the los angeles times reports. Students are upset at how the administration has handled race-related complaints, and they say that during a demonstration last week that included a march to veitch's home, veitch left when students started talking about how administrators have handled sexual assault allegations. An associate vp at the school says veitch simply \" realized his presence there was no longer being constructive. \" as for this week's occupation, \" we're not going to shut anything down, \" he says. \" they've been conscientious and respectful. They ' ll be able to stay 24 hours a day. \" school officials are reviewing the students'demands, he adds, and a chief diversity position in the administration is already planned. But, per usa today, during last week's protest, veitch told students, \" we simply can't meet every demand on that list. But i can tell you that i will honor the conversation. I do not cling to this job. I ' m happy to resign. \" one protester tells la weekly that if demands are not met by friday, \" we ' ll occupy until his [ veitch's ] resignation. \" she says as many as 400 students are taking part, eating delivery pizza and sleeping in sleeping bags. \" we're occupying all the hallways. The staff is just walking over students. \" similar protests have led to officials stepping down at mizzou and claremont mckenna, and protests are also happening at ithaca, yale, and other schools.",

        "summary": "Ouch. A study out of columbia university suggests that walmart deliberately runs much better stores in white neighborhoods than in minority neighborhoods. The study found that stores in lower-income neighborhoods have considerably lower customer service ratings than those in wealthier ones. More specifically, the higher the percentage of black or latino residents in an area, the lower the walmart rating, reports consumerist. The researchers suggest one reason is that the chain generally doesn't staff stores in low-income neighborhoods adequately because it doesn't need to do so — walmarts in such neighborhoods are often the only place people can shop, and thus competition and customer satisfaction aren't priorities. \"when walmart moves into the south side of chicago, it's not really displacing numerous other businesses, \" study author adam reich tells the atlantic. \"so it can shortchange investments in staff, and force people to work harder. Consumers don't have a choice about where they're shopping. \" the authors, who published their study in the american sociological association journal contexts, analyzed yelp reviews of 2,840 stores and found that those in predominantly black areas tend to be rated with words like \" nasty, \" \" terrible, \" and \" unorganized, \" while those in white areas tend to be described as \" friendly, \" \" clean, \" and \" pleasant. \" a walmart spokesperson tells business insider that the analysis is both \" flawed \" and \" without merit, \" and the publication notes a few \" holes, \" including that reviewer bias and outside influence can't be accounted for.

A police statement says masood also had a \" number of aliases, \" per newsweek. In a speech earlier thursday before parliament, prime minister theresa may said the attacker was born in britain ( the bbc notes masood was born in kent ) and had been on the radar of law enforcement and intelligence agencies some time ago during a probe into violent extremism, the bbc reports. \" our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by islamist ideology, \" she said, per the new york times. However, may added that masood ( whom she didn't identify by name ), who was shot dead by cops in the attack that killed three others, was a \" peripheral figure \" on the islamist extremist scene and hadn't recently been under the microscope. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, per the ap and the telegraph, with a statement by the group's propaganda outlet stating that the attacker was a \" soldier \" of the islamic state. Meanwhile, london mayor sadiq khan posted a video statement of his own in which he noted, \" londoners will never be cowed by terrorism, \" per the guardian. Khan also said, per journalist christiane amanpour's twitter feed, he won't be commenting on the diss against him by donald trump jr., noting, \" i've been doing far more important things over the last 24 hours. \"",

Case in point: researchers in sweden accidentally left their equipment running on an experiment over a weekend, and ended up creating something awesome — upsalite, the world's most efficient water absorber, reports the independent. This substance, prohibitively expensive and difficult to produce until now, can potentially do everything from controlling moisture on a hockey rink to cleaning up toxic waste and oil spills, reports science blog. This \" is expected to pave the way for new sustainable products in a number of industrial applications, \" says nanotechnology professor maria stromme. Scientists have been trying — and failing — to cheaply create a dry, powdered form of magnesium carbonate since the early 1900s, earning it the nickname the \" impossible material. \" turns out, all they needed to do was use the same process they've been attempting for more than 100 years, but at three times the atmospheric pressure. When the scientists at the university of uppsala inadvertently did this, they returned to the lab monday morning to find a gel had formed. When heated to more than 158 degrees, that gel \" solidifies and collapses into a white and coarse powder, \" they report, per phys.org. \" it became clear that we had indeed synthesized the material that previously had been claimed impossible to make, \" says stromme.

The latest report on how many americans die broke comes from an analysis by the employee benefits research institute based on data from the university of michigan's health and retirement study. Of those 85 or older who died between 2010 and 2012, roughly one in five had no assets other than a house, according to the analysis. The average home equity was about $ 140,000. Roughly one in eight of those households had no assets at all. Those who died single at 85 or older fared worse, roughly a quarter had only some equity in a house — about $ 83,000 on average. One in six had nothing, and one in 10 died with an average debt of about $ 6,000. For those who died at a younger age, the numbers were even worse. Some 30 percent of households losing a family member between ages 50 and 64 had no assets left. Those households also had lower incomes"

Now idaho hopes to be the first us state to make it onto this list, with local activists vying for nearly 20 years to keep light pollution to a minimum and achieve this esteemed star-gazing status, npr reports. \" here, in the heart of central idaho, we see things differently, \" reads the website dedicated to the in-progress central idaho dark sky reserve. \" we've come to acknowledge that this pristine night sky is part of our heritage and worth preserving for our children and future generations. \" the resort town of ketchum was made an idsa dark sky community in october, and since then efforts have ramped up to meet the ultimate goal of becoming the first us reserve. Toward that end, ketchum and other nearby communities receive guidance on upping their chances via the central idaho dark sky reserve site, which recommends residents reevaluate their existing lighting to make sure it's \" dark sky friendly \" and invite friends and neighbors to join the cause. The idsa will reportedly decide by year's end whether the idaho reserve is a go, but in the meantime, residents keep on keeping the lights out and the skies viewable. \" everybody seems to comply with it, \" says one local in ketchum. \" i think the ones who don't are people who just move here and aren't familiar with it. … when they realize how nice it is, then they're compliant. \"",

Continue reading the characterization about officer darren wilson being injured in his confrontation with michael brown emerged on the day that a grand jury was expected to begin hearing evidence in the shooting. Brown, 18, was shot and killed by wilson on aug.9, and protesters have been angrily calling for wilson's arrest and indictment since that day. St. Louis county prosecutor david mccullough cautioned wednesday that a decision on whether or not the officer would be indicted will not come quickly. He told abc news \" our target date is the middle of october \" for wrapping up the evidence and asking the jury to decide whether to charge wilson. Grand juries typically meet one day a week. A source close to wilson told abc news that during the struggle at the patrol car, wilson suffered \"a serious facial injury. \" the injury was not described, but last week ferguson police chief tom jackson said that wilson had swelling to the side of his face. The news came wednesday as protesters and police faced off again in ferguson overnight, with a thrown water bottle briefly re-igniting",

Germany's bild reports historian roland paul has uncovered the 1905 decree that banished donald trump's grandfather from germany. The guardian has the timeline: in 1885, a then 16-year-old friedrich trump left germany for the us and ended up finding a fortune among the alaska gold rush ( as bloomberg explains, it wasn't gold, but a restaurant/brothel that brought him riches ). He returned to his hometown of kallstadt in 1901, where he a year later married elisabeth christ. The couple's subsequent time in new york city was short-lived: elisabeth pined for germany, but trump found himself unable to return permanently, done in by his having not performed mandatory military service or alerted officials to his 1885 emigration. The february 1905 decree gave trump eight weeks to leave the kingdom of bavaria or else face deportation. On the 27th of that month, trump appealed to prince regent luitpold, sending the \" much-loved, noble, wise and righteous sovereign and sublime ruler \" a \" most modest plea, \" reports deutsche welle, to no avail. In the letter, trump explained he originally left for america after being unable to find work as a barber in his homeland. The wall street journal, which obtained a copy of the letter, reports that trump should have in 1885 left a security deposit behind; such deposits were meant to ensure people would return for their mandatory military service, and he would have had it returned upon doing his military duty. On july 1, 1905, a three-months-pregnant elisabeth, trump, and their daughter sailed for new york. That unborn child would be fred, donald trump's father.",

( defense department photo ) there was a time, not too long ago, when some of the world's brilliant rocket scientists didn't think of space as something to conquer, nor monetize, nor explore — but as a means to make war. During the cold war in the 1960s, they eyed outer space as a potential theater of conflict, where human-piloted space vessels would engage in gravity-free dogfights and fire missiles. The ambitions were unrealistic. But they did nonetheless give birth to a soviet anti-satellite weaponry program simply called \"istrebitel sputnikov \" — the \"satellite killer. \" it was thought the killer was retired. It was thought the soviet empire's collapse had grounded it. But now, as the financial times first reported, there are whispers of its return out there in the blackness of space. As news of the virgin galactic crash, antares explosion and rosetta exploration filled science pages, another space drama has quietly unfurled. In may, russia launched a rocket to add several satellites to its existing constellation. In the process, it deployed what was first believed to be a piece of space debris but has now become a matter of great speculation. \"i have no idea what it is! \" space security expert patricia"

        "summary": "\" this is a nuclear explosion \" is how an expert on turkey puts it to the washington post. The country's ruling party today finds itself with few options to form a new government after it was stripped of its parliamentary majority and opposition parties ruled out joining it in a coalition pact. President recep tayyip erdogan's akp party won about 41 % of the votes yesterday and was projected to take 258 seats — 18 below the minimum required to rule alone and ending its 13-year single-party rule. As the new york times reports, after more than a decade as pm, erdogan was last year elected to the somewhat \" ceremonial post \" of president, and the result was a stunning rebuke to erdogan's ambitions to expand his powers; his hopes of passing constitutional changes that would fashion more of an executive presidency, more akin to our own version, are on hold, reports the atlantic. Turkey has 45 days in which to form a new government after final official results are confirmed, but all three opposition parties have come out against a coalition with the akp. Turkey's main opposition party, chp, suggested it should be given the task of forming a government. The liberal pro-kurdish hdp party dealt the akp its biggest setback by clearing for the first time the 10 % threshold it needed to grab seats in parliament ( it ' ll take about 80 of the chamber's 550 ). The guardian frames the significance: \" the results will give the kurds — who, with 20 % of turkey's population, are the country's biggest minority — true representation in parliament.... The 10 % hurdle, dating from the military-authored constitution of 1980, had been intended in part to diminish kurdish representation in the parliament. \"",

About 23 % of the groundwater in the indo-gangetic basin to a depth of 650 feet is too salty — an issue perhaps caused by poor farmland irrigation or drainage — and another 37 % is tainted by toxic levels of arsenic, researchers say. Like salt, arsenic is present naturally, but levels can spike with mining and the use of fertilizers.

However, researchers say that \" deep tube wells \" could penetrate deeper into the basin to pull out non-contaminated water, per nature world news.

Police say biebs and five other people had a limousine pick them up at a nightclub in the city in the wee hours of dec. 30 ( bieber had earlier attended a toronto maple leafs hockey game, cnn reports ), but there was some sort of fight as they were being driven to a hotel. One of the passengers hit the limo driver in the back of the head multiple times, police say, and then left the scene before police got there. It didn't help his case that bieber failed to show up for a police interview after the incident, reports tmz, which claims that bieber, and not a member of his entourage, is the one suspected of actually assaulting the driver. His first court appearance is scheduled for march 10. The assault charge came just hours after his lawyer entered a not guilty plea for bieber in his dui-and-drag-racing case from last week ( an arraignment is set for valentine's day ), and he's still facing possible charges over the egging of his neighbor's house. Evidence was presented to the district attorney in that case this week, cnn reports, but prosecutors asked detectives to investigate further. A decision on whether to charge bieber with felony vandalism could be made by next week. ( not surprisingly, lots of americans want to see bieber deported. )",

            "Radiation from a mobile phone call can make brain regions near the device burn more energy, according to a new study. Cellphones emit ultra-high-frequency radio waves during calls and data transfers, and some researchers have suspected this radiation — albeit inconclusively — of being linked to long-term health risks like brain cancer. The new brain-scan-based work, to be published feb. 23 in the journal of the american medical association, shows radiation emitted from a cellphone's antenna during a call makes nearby brain tissue use 7 percent more energy. \"we have no idea what this means yet or how it works, \" said neuroscientist nora volkow of the national institutes of health. \"but this is the first reliable study showing the brain is activated by exposure to cellphone radio frequencies. \" more than 5 billion mobile devices may be in use worldwide today.

The bbc reports the attack began with an explosion at a gate to the 400-bed military hospital around 9am local time. At least three militants dressed as doctors are said to have then entered the building with guns and grenades. One staff member reported seeing a gunman \" wearing a white coat holding a kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors \" as people inside fled to window ledges. The attackers then gathered on the upper floors and engaged security forces in \" heavy fighting, \" per the guardian. Six hours after the first explosion, a rep for afghanistan's interior ministry reported all attackers had been killed after authorities were able to land on the roof. Isis has since claimed responsibility for the attack, the first in which militants engaged directly with afghan forces in kabul, which suggests they \" now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks, \" per the bbc. Afghan president ashraf ghani says the attack \" trampled all human values, \" noting attacking a hospital is like \" attacking the whole of afghanistan. \" ( isis has recently shifted targets. )",

According to the bbc, a co-author of the study says the act \" included about 15 sexual movements over a period of 10 seconds. \" while sex between closely related species does happen, this is only the second time a sexual act between two distantly related species has been recorded, the guardian reports.

Deer eat fruit dropped by the monkeys ( as well as their poop ), while the monkeys groom the deer and sometimes ride on their backs. In this case, however, the monkey was displaying \" clearly sexual behavior, \" including chasing other monkeys away from the deer, notes the study. Researchers are blaming \" mate deprivation, \" theorizing that the monkey — who has low social status — was suffering from \" limited access to females. \" the incident happened during snow monkey breeding season.

The macaques have previously been observed grooming the deer or riding them in a playful manner. The curious behaviour is outlined in a study published in the journal primates. The monkey seemed to be a low-status male, who guarded his \" love interests \" by chasing away other male monkeys who came near. Co-author alexandre bonnefoy commented: \" the male mounted the deer and displayed some copulation behaviours, which included about 15 sexual movements over a period of 10 seconds, before dismounting. \"",
            "Mating season has taken a strange turn for two normally platonic species on japan's yakushima island. The japanese macaque — better known as the snow monkey — has a good thing going with the island's population of sika deer. As noted by a study in primates, the monkeys groom the deer, drop food from the trees while foraging ( which the deer eat ), and poop ( which the deer also eat ). In return, the deer let themselves be ridden by the macaques — but just as friends. Until one lonely, troopless male was observed attempting to bang two of them. Advertisement things went as well as one could expect with the first deer, considering deer and monkeys are wildly different species whose respective genitalia aren't generally designed to interact. As the study notes, \"no penetration occurred... However, ejaculation seemed to occur as the",

Snow monkeys and sika deer generally have a symbiotic relationship, with the deer eating fruits dropped from the trees by the monkeys and the monkeys grooming the deer and occasionally riding on their backs. The latest paper, published in the journal primates, describes how a low-ranking male monkey was observed repeatedly performing sexual mounts on at least two different female deer. One doe was seen to bolt and run off, but another female did not appear to object,"

American astronauts peggy whitson and shane kimbrough suffered a frustrating setback during a spacewalk thursday when one of the four fabric shields they were installing on the exterior of the international space station drifted off into space, reuters reports. But mission control came up with what the ap calls a \" macgyver-like plan for a patch \" and directed the astronauts to use the cover from a relocated docking port to cover the vulnerable area. \" you guys came up with a fantastic plan — on short notice. That's amazing, \" whitson said. It's not clear why the shield, which was supposed to be tethered, ended up floating away. The lost debris shield is now an 18-pound piece of space debris itself — and at 5 feet across, it's one of the bigger objects lost by spacewalkers. \" sometimes bolts will go, \" nasa spokesman dan huot tells the washington post. \" there was one spacewalk where we lost an entire bag of tools. \" he says mission control determined that the floating shield, which will eventually burn up in earth's atmosphere, was no threat to the iss. Nasa says the seven-hour spacewalk was otherwise a success. Whitson, 57, was on her eighth spacewalk. Halfway through the mission, she broke the 50-hour, 40-minute record for accumulated time spacewalking by a female astronaut. ( this summer, the coldest spot in space will be on the iss. )",

The reason: the illinois state budget hasn't yet passed, so funds for lotto winners can't be released, tying lottery officials ' hands, notes cnnmoney. A lottery rep tells cnn that those who win $ 600 or less can cash in at a retailer, while prizes worth $ 601 to $ 25,000 can be redeemed at state lottery centers. Cash awards worth more than $ 25,000? halted for now. State rep. Jack franks says this is just another show of how mismanaged the illinois lottery system is. \" the lottery is a contract: i pay my money, and if i win, you're obligated to pay me and you have to pay me timely, \" he tells the chicago tribune. And rick isn't comforted by the assurance she and chasteen will eventually get paid. \" if we owed the state money, they'd come take it and [ not ] care whether we have a roof over our head, \" she tells the tribune. \" you can't say [ to the state ], ' can you wait until i get my budget under control?

The ana incident follows a host of other dreamliner incidents in recent weeks, including a fire and two fuel leaks. The two japanese airlines have 24 out of the 50 dreamliners currently in service.

Obviously, no film can re-create the unspeakable degradation of one human being owning another, but in making the attempt \" 12 years \" insists we feel things in"

Jennifer jaidinger, 42, arrived home early last friday morning to find lane gardner, 48, drunk and demanding to know where she had been. According to what she told police, gardner suspected she was sleeping with a firefighter because she was wearing a denver fire sweatshirt at the time, cbs denver reports. Gardner allegedly ripped the engagement ring off her finger and pushed her off the bed, knocking her unconscious. When she came to, she had a pain in her eye and thinks her fiance of 2 1/2 years hit her while she was knocked out. In her 911 call, jaidinger described her fiance as \" very unstable \" and claimed he had made earlier comments about \" shooting it out with officers. \" a swat team duly arrived friday, shouted at his door, and made phone calls that went unanswered, fox 31 reports. But swat backed away that day and gardner turned himself in monday to face a domestic-violence assault charge. Jaidinger describes him as \" a heavy drinker and usually will drink a half bottle of whiskey daily, \" according to an affidavit. She also said he told her that if she notified police, she'd \" be dead. \" gardner, a 12-year denver police veteran, is on desk duty during the investigation.",

        "summary": "A child's best friend is the family pet, a new study suggests. Not only do kids report getting more satisfaction from relationships with the dog or cat than their brothers and sisters, they also get along better with the four-legged friend. \" the fact that pets cannot understand or talk back may even be a benefit as it means they are completely non-judgmental, \" says lead author matt cassels of cambridge university. The study is the latest to suggest that pets may have a major influence on child development, aiding kids ' well-being and social skills, reports medical xpress. For the study in the journal of applied developmental psychology, researchers surveyed 77 12-year-olds with at least one sibling and pet at home. The kids reported stronger relationships and lower levels of conflict with the family animal, which is perhaps not surprising since only one party can talk. ( redorbit also notes that 12-year-olds may be reticent about publicly admitting they love a sibling. ) the team found that \" girls reported more disclosure, companionship, and conflict with their pet than did boys, perhaps indicating that girls may interact with their pets in more nuanced ways, \" says cassels. All in all, the benefits young people derive from their pets \" may well support psychological well-being later in life, \" says co-author dr. Nancy gee, who adds that more research is needed. Sorry, cat people, dogs delivered the most satisfaction in the survey. ( pope francis prefers you have kids over pets. )",

The financial times follows up a report on the two men — one using an italian passport, one austrian — who boarded the plane using stolen passports. A thai travel agent told the paper that the tickets were booked through an iranian middleman who goes by \" mr. Ali. \" she says she has booked tickets for him for the past three years, and there is no indication that \" ali \" was aware the passports were stolen; the agent says ali often booked travel for his contacts. He had asked her to arrange for the tickets march 1, and the men were originally on different airlines: qatar and ethiad ( they had different end destinations ). But the reserved tickets ultimately expired, with ali reaching out again on thursday; the men were then booked on malaysia airlines. Now malaysian authorities have given the us images of the two men, a us official tells cnn. Meanwhile: the wall street journal reports that malaysian authorities are looking into five people who checked into the flight but didn't board — a not uncommon occurrence. Their luggage was removed from the flight before it departed. The search area is now bigger, and includes a portion of the strait of malacca and more of the south china sea, per the guardian. The director general of malaysia's department of civil aviation says that's an area with a 100-nautical-mile radius, double the previous size. China is lending space satellites to the search.",

            "7.51pm gmt guardian transport correspondent gwyn topham has provided answers to three questions in constellation with the big question of what happened to mh370: how does a plane simply 'disappear off the radar '? why are the searches taking place over such vastly different areas? and what do we know about this plane? gwyn writes: how does a plane simply 'disappear off the radar '? over land, air traffic controllers can use two types of radar, primary, which detects objects by bouncing back a radio signal, and secondary, where the plane sends back an automatic response, identifying itself. Air traffic consultant doug maclean, of dkm aviation, says: \"secondary surveillance radar sends out a coded question, the interrogation message will be received and sent back; that requires a degree of co-operation between plane and the ground. In the likes of the 9/11 incident, the aircraft would have received messages but hijackers had switched off the reply. \" but over longer distances where radar coverage is limited – ie usually when planes are flying across oceans – they use another system, automatic dependent surveillance. Here the aircraft transmits its own signal and gives its position via satellites. Maclean says: \"once you go outside primary radar coverage, which would normally be about 100 miles offshore maximum, you are relying on the plane to be transponding. \" [",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - the chairman of the u.s. House of representatives intelligence committee said on tuesday he had seen no evidence to support president donald trump's allegation he was wiretapped by then-president barack obama during the 2016 presidential campaign. Republican representative devin nunes said if trump's assertion were true, the leaders of congress and chairmen of its two intelligence committees, known collectively as the \"gang of eight, \" should have been briefed. \"i have not seen that evidence, \" nunes told a news conference. \"i think the bigger question that needs to be answered is whether or not mr. Trump or any of his associates were in fact targeted by any of the intelligence agencies or law enforcement authorities. \" trump made the accusation in tweets on saturday, providing no evidence. An obama spokesman denied it. Trump has since pressed the house and senate intelligence committees to expand probes into allegations that russia meddled in the u.s. Election to look into his charge. \"we are supposed to be kept up to speed on any pertinent counterintelligence investigation, \" nunes said. \"if trump or any other political campaign, or anybody associated with trump, was under some type of investigation, that clearly should have risen to the gang of eight level. \" adam schiff, the top committee democrat, also said it did not appear that the group had",

The long island man has as of sept. 17 driven the car 3 million miles, the highest mileage in history by a single driver in one vehicle, discovery reports. He hit the milestone on the seward highway in alaska — leaving hawaii as the only state he has never visited in the car — to celebrate. Gordon says in a press release: \" i never had a goal to get to 1 million, to 2 million. I just enjoyed driving and experiencing life through my volvo, \" whether he was making his 125-mile round-trip commute or exploring europe. To put the feat in perspective: that's like driving from new york to la, and back, 537 times. That's not the only neat number attached to the car. Aol autos reports that it's also been to nine countries, stopped at 800 waffle houses, driven in 105-degree heat in kansas city, and been in 11 accidents in its 47 years. The former middle-school science teacher, who makes sure to keep his vehicle in top condition, tells myfoxphilly.com that his car has started to develop celebrity status. \" if i stop for gas some place or i stop for a cup of coffee, people will pull up next to me and ask about the car. Before you know it, you've got new friends all over the country. \" not to mention your own website at volvo, which also gave him a new vehicle for each of his 1 million and 2 million milestones.

This \" is a date movie from hell, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone, wondering how pretty woman director garry marshall persuaded \" a big name cast to stuff themselves into this box of rancid heart-shaped chocolates. \" only a couple of the story lines in this \" silly, disorganized mess \" are even close to memorable, writes bill goodykoontz at the arizona republic. \" there's far too much going on in valentine's day, \" he complains, \" and far too little of it is worth the trouble. \" \" this over-iced cake \" actually goes down pretty smoothly, argues joshua rothkopf at time out, praising the performances of jessica biel, shirley maclaine, and julia roberts.

Now, however, 24-year-old london designer ryan yasin has put his degree in aeronautical engineering to use to create origami-like pleated clothing designed to grow along with the kids, reports quartz. The result has just won him a james dyson award for students in the uk. Yasin has already established a clothing line, petit pli, inspired by what he calls \" deployed satellite panels \" that can stretch outward in multiple directions. The lightweight fabric, which is waterproof and machine washable, is designed to stretch six sizes. Yasin's concept takes advantage of a principle known as auxetics already employed in stents and biomedical devices, reports the guardian. So far, yasin has developed more than 500 prototypes and says he ' ll use his $ 2,500 prize money to help start production, as he's in talks with a major uk retailer that might help him get the clothes on shelves in months.

And more pigs will produce more poop. Smithfield — america's ( and the world's ) largest producer of pork — already produced some 4.7 billion gallons of hog manure just last year. Adding even more to the pile could result in a slurry of health and environmental risks, reports scientific american. The feces from smithfield's pigs sits in a lagoon for six to 12 months before being turned into fertilizer. Emissions from the lagoons have increased respiratory problems for people living nearby. And the more crowded the pigs ' living conditions get, the more antibiotics they need to stay disease-free. Researchers are worried that antibiotic-laced poop could seep into the air and water supplies, increasing drug resistance in nearby communities. Earlier this week, smithfield's ceo stressed to congress that the deal wouldn't affect food safety or standards. Not all were convinced, reports usa today, while others remain worried about how it will affect smithfield's valuable intellectual property. \" they will take our technology and they will integrate it into china, \" says a commissioner with the us-china economic and security review commission, per the national journal. \" once they digest all of this and they get the their industry up, they ' ll start to try to export their pork to us. \"",

That increase could also promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increase health risks for hog farm workers and the communities living around them. Under a proposed multibillion-dollar deal, hong kong – based shuanghui international holdings would buy virginia-based smithfield foods. The stated purpose of the merger, the companies say, is to efficiently increase pork production. If the deal goes as planned, smithfield will ultimately export more meat to china, where the appetite for pork continues to climb upward even as americans buy less of it. But with that expected production boost comes an uptick in hog feces left in the u.s. — and subsequent health and environmental risks.

Last year, at least 4.7 billion gallons of hog manure in the u.s. Came from one company, smithfield foods, the nation's leading pork producer. The feces load will rise if u.s. Regulators green-light a proposed merger that would bring the firm under the auspices of a china-based company. That increase could also promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increase health risks for hog farm workers and the communities living around them.

Known as \" joepa \" to his thousands of penn state fans, the beloved head coach for 46 seasons led his team to two national titles and a record-setting 409 victories. His legendary career ended abruptly in november, when he was fired after a former assistant coach, jerry sandusky, 67, was charged with sexually molesting 10 young boys, including some in the penn state athletic complex. Paterno was fired november 9 after he was criticized for not doing enough to stop sandusky.

District attorney mike mclelland, who was murdered along with his wife, and first victim assistant da mark hasse both prosecuted williams when he was arrested for stealing computer equipment from the county in 2011. Williams, known for riding to work and around town on a segway, was ultimately sentenced to two years of probation in april of last year ( he also lost his law license, his bench, and his military commission, according to his lawyer ). During the sentencing phase of the trial, witnesses testified about threats williams had made in the past, including one threat to kill an attorney and his family. Williams was mentioned as a possible suspect, but not named, earlier this month; now he's been arrested and charged with making terroristic threats ( authorities say they linked him to an anonymous threatening email to county officials sent in the wake of mclelland's death ). But the dallas morning news reports he's expected to be charged with the murders as soon as tomorrow. Williams had been questioned on several occasions and submitted to gunpowder residue tests that reportedly came back negative. Since then, investigators have had him under surveillance and have searched his home, his mother-in-law's home, and a storage space — where they found 20 weapons, including the type used in the murders, as well as a ford crown victoria that bears resemblance to a vehicle spotted in mclelland's neighborhood the day he was killed.

Economy to grow. With his speech last night to congress, the president is giving that strategy one more government try. This is not to say that mr. Obama hasn't made any intellectual progress across his 32 months in office. He now admits the damage that overregulation",

In style, the last thing it was was professorial. This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting, given their already deep reputation for obstructionism"

The ministry says the nephew, 18-year-old fedi, told police he was in contact with amri encrypted communications to avoid detection. He told police that amri had recruited him to jihad and asked him to pledge allegiance to isis, and that amri sent him money to join him in germany. The arrests occurred saturday, the day after amri was killed in a shootout with police in milan, italy. Video later surfaced of the tunisian pledging allegiance to isis.

The officer who killed amri, 29-year-old luca scata, had only been on the force for nine months. His colleague, 36-year-old cristian movio, was shot during the encounter and is recovering from non-life threatening wounds.

            "( cnn ) new light has been shed on the german terrorist network behind the berlin attack in 345 pages of german investigative files that cnn has obtained. They reveal that anis amri, the tunisian suspect in the truck attack, was part of an isis recruitment network that orbited around a radical preacher called abu walaa from al-tamim, iraq. The cleric, who styled himself as isis'representative to germany, built up a national following among islamist extremists in the european country. Analysts tracking the network tell cnn as many as 20 germans who have joined isis have ties to his network. The german jihadis, like some of their compatriots, had a penchant for bureaucratic subdivision, with leading proselytizers responsible for recruiting in particular regions. Abu walaa was the central figure in what prosecutors called a \" nationwide network of salafi-jihadi indoctrinators, which are closely interlinked and act in a work sharing manner. \" just watched truck crashes into berlin christmas market replay more videos... Must watch truck crashes into berlin christmas market 01: 10 the network even came up with a common curriculum to brainwash youngsters and persuade them to join isis.

            "Even better than looks however, is yahoo mail's new smarts. Take the new contacts card, for example. When you tap on a person's photo, you ' ll immediately see their contact details even if he or she is not in your local address book. That's because they're all automatically culled from their connected facebook, linkedin and twitter profiles, and even from their email signatures if they contain alternate email addresses or phone numbers. The contacts card also helpfully shows the history of email exchanges between the two of you and a list of what it thinks are related contacts ( perhaps mutual friends or co-workers ). The latter, delgado says, is especially helpful if you're trying to remember who the person is and how you met them.

        "summary": "We don't know which rulings will come when, but starting today through monday ( and perhaps beyond that ), the supreme court is scheduled to let the hammer fall on seven major cases that will reverberate through the nation, nbc news reports. A quick rundown of what's on the docket: the court's stance on gay marriage is perhaps the most anticipated decision, and the justices have to consider two things: whether states can ban same-sex marriages, and also whether they have to recognize such unions legally carried out in other states. The fate of obamacare is also a high-profile case in front of the bench, which could end up costing 34 states their subsidies under the affordable care act because they don't have their own health care insurance exchanges. Insurance experts warn that obamacare would go into a \" death spiral \" if the court rules against federal subsidies. The case against lethal injection, spurred by an oklahoma man's botched execution, puts the drug midazolam on the hot seat, asking if the drug does what it should — puts a prisoner into a \" coma-like state \" so two other drugs can finish the job — or if it merely paralyzes the inmate and forces them to endure the pain of their own death. How the court defines redistricting rules — and whether states must count only eligible voters or the entire population when drawing congressional districts — as well as whether or not to greenlight federal violent-crime laws that impose mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of three felonies, are being mulled. Also set to be finalized: decisions on whether to permit lawsuits under the fair housing act, even if discrimination was not intended, and a trio of cases grouped together that asks the court to make the epa consider economic costs before forcing power plants to control their emissions.",

The plaintiffs claim that redrawing electoral districts based on the population of citizens and non-citizens alike violates the constitutional requirement of one person, one vote.

There are now about 14,000 coffee plants in california — about 30 times the amount there were 13 years ago. The times reports california appears set for the first serious american attempt at homegrown coffee outside of hawaii. There is, of course, skepticism that california can produce coffee as tasty as that from the tropical highlands of brazil and indonesia. But jason mraz points out people didn't use to think you could grow wine grapes in california either. Yes, the grammy-winning singer is one of those farmers jumping on the coffee train. San diego reports mraz has been growing avocados for years and is now making the switch. Growing coffee can be labor intensive and expensive, but one expert says california growers are targeting coffee lovers \" willing to pay for something unusual. \" the kind of people who don't blanch at paying up to $ 12 for a specialty cup of coffee could provide california growers with sizable profit margins.

Astronauts haven't been able to spend more than three days on the moon — which lacks earth's atmosphere and magnetic field — because spacesuits offer minimal protection from radiation, extreme temperatures, and meteorites, according to a press release. A lava tube, on the other hand... \" it's important to know where and how big lunar lava tubes are if we're ever going to construct a lunar base, \" says a researcher at jaxa, japan's space agency. Researchers at jaxa and purdue university combined radar data from the selene spacecraft and gravitational data from grail to locate what they believe are a number of intact lava tubes — formed when flowing lava forms a crust before draining away — in the marius hills area of the moon, the houston chronicle reports. Marius hills is the moon's biggest volcanic dome field. According to phys.org, italian researchers recently presented findings that lava tubes on the moon could be massive compared to their counterparts on earth due to lower gravity, stating the \" results have important implications for habitability and human exploration of the moon. \" one model from the new study shows a lunar lava tube could be large enough to encompass the entire city of philadelphia.

Sechi lava tubes, underground caves created by volcanic activity, could provide protected habitats large enough to house streets on mars or even towns on the moon, according to research presented at the european planetary science congress ( epsc ) 2017 in riga. A further study shows how the next generation of lunar orbiters will be able to use radar to locate these structures under the moon's surface. Lava tubes can form in two ways: over-crusted tubes form when low-viscosity lava flows fairly close to the surface, developing a hard crust that thickens to create a roof above the moving lava stream. When the eruptions end, the conduit is drained leaving a tunnel a few metres beneath the surface. \" inflated'tubes are complex and deep structures that form when lava is injected into existing"

A restaurant in la canada flintridge has acknowledged that a barista wrote \"beaner \" on a latino customer's two coffee orders.

When hernandez called the store to complain, they told her the barista didn't catch pedro's name, so she wrote \"beaner \" on the cup instead. The store reportedly offered pedro a $ 50 gift card, which he declined, calling it insulting, per usa today. Hernandez and pedro have met with the store's district manager who apologized and promised to look into the incident. Starbucks also tweeted an apology. Hernandez seems angrier than pedro, who hernandez says wishes not to comment. \" out of all the names they could've put on his coffees for ' misunderstanding ' him they decide to put ' beaner, ' \" she said.
