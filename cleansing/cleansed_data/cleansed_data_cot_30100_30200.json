        "summary": "New research strengthens the case that people used the chocolate ingredient cacao in south america 5,400 years ago, underscoring the seed's radical transformation into today's twix bars and m&m candies, per the ap. Tests indicate traces of cacao on artifacts from an archaeological site in ecuador, pushing back the earliest known domestication by about 1,500 years, according to a study published monday. \" it's the earliest site now with domesticated cacao, \" said cameron mcneil of lehman college in new york, who was not involved in the research. The ancient south american civilization likely didn't use cacao to make chocolate since there's no established history of indigenous populations in the region using it that way, researchers led by the university of british columbia in canada said. But the tests indicate the civilization used the cacao seed, not just the fruity pulp. The seeds are the part of the cacao pod used to make chocolate. Indigenous populations in the upper amazon region today use cacao for fermented drinks and juices, and that's probably how it was used thousands of years ago as well. Scientists mostly agree that cacao was first domesticated in south america instead of central america as previously believed. The study in nature ecology &amp; evolution provides fresh evidence: residue from one artifact in ecuador estimated to be 5,310 to 5,440 years old tested positive for cacao. How cacao's use spread is not clear. But by the time spanish explorers arrived in central america in the late 1400s, they found people were using it to make hot and cold chocolate drinks with spices, often with a foamy top. ( there may be trouble ahead for cacao lovers. )",

        "summary": "Talk about endurance. Elephants endure 20-month gestation periods, and some deep-sea sharks carry their embryos for even longer than that, but the deep-sea octopus takes the cake. Scientists say they've observed one in california guarding her eggs for 4.5 years, the longest known brooding or gestation period of any animal anywhere in the world, an animal physiologist says. And if that isn't remarkable on its own, she apparently did it without food ( or with very little food ), and when her eggs hatched, she wasted away and died, reports the los angeles times. Octopuses typically only live a couple years, making this graneledone boreopacifica likely the longest-living type of octopus as well, reports national geographic. In shallow waters, octopuses watch their eggs for just a few months, but in deep waters, where the habitat is dark, cold, and dangerous, a longer brooding period allows for a more advanced offspring better equipped to survive. This female was found nearly a mile below sea level in the monterey canyon, and the years without food took a clear toll as she grew smaller, paler, and weaker before her 4-centimeter-long babies hatched. ( another weird octopus fact? their mating ritual can end with strangulation and cannibalism. )",

A deep-sea octopus, graneledone boreopacifica, has set a new record for brooding stamina — 53 months, the longest developmental period known for any organism, according to a study published july 30 in the journal plos one. This beats the 14 months on record for an octopus, and really any animal, including the estimated 48 months of gestation in the alpine salamander. Octopuses that live in shallow waters, which are better studied, care for their eggs for only a few months. What's more, life spans for nearly all cephalopods — a group containing squid, nautilus, octopus, and cuttlefish — are a short one to two years, which g.

Now, environmentalists fear a mojave desert population will be eradicated entirely by a plan that's apparently meant to save them, the los angeles times reports. The marine corps ' air ground combat center in the mojave will soon expand 165 square miles into the tortoises ' habitat and officials have come up with a $ 50 million plan to move the tortoises elsewhere. In what a base rep tells the desert sun is an effort \" to safeguard the animals, \" 100 biologists will capture 900 adult tortoises and transport them to three sites via helicopter over four to six weeks in the spring. Another 235 juveniles will be raised in pens, then moved once they're no longer vulnerable to predatory birds. The biologist that's heading the project ( which was approved by the us fish and wildlife service ) says the budget \" demonstrates how much we care about this species \" and will allow officials to monitor the animals for 30 years. But critics aren't so sure. The times notes tortoises become stressed when handled by humans and vulnerable to predators, dehydration, and disease when moved to unfamiliar areas. A similar project that moved 670 tortoises away from the army's national training center in 2008 was halted when 90 tortoises died. Another 9,136 were moved to a site in nevada between 2004 and 2014, yet only 370 could be found there in 2015. An environmental planner at the base counters thusly: \" we've learned a lot from past mistakes of others. We wouldn't be doing this if we felt the desert tortoise wasn't viable in the mojave. \"",

In a video uploaded in july, the california police officer was filmed lifting a 5-gallon pail of ice water and dousing a fellow cop, the los angeles times reports. Some nine months later, robison, 39, is feeling the heat. The pasadena police department officer was actually on disability for a lower back injury at the time of the video — and her ease with the bucket raised the suspicions of investigators, who have since charged her with four counts of insurance fraud. Not only do investigators believe robison exaggerated her injuries to collect disability benefits from may 31 to august 21, they say that was perhaps the officer's second offense, the san gabriel valley tribune reports. Prosecutors allege she also inflated an injury in 2012, which allowed her to collect disability pay for more than a year. She collected an estimated $ 117,000 over the two periods in question. Robison, who has been on administrative leave since september, pleaded not guilty to the charges on friday; she faces as many as six years and four months in county jail if convicted.

How long have you been working on the sixth-generation ford mustang? we started in early 2010, looking at the whole idea, about what the mustang was going to be and how much it was going to change. Around one year ago the first prototypes were running around so we could validate the suspension and other settings. Have you engineered the mustang differently because it's now being sold worldwide? we didn't decide to make a global mustang, but to take the mustang global. It's a subtle but very important difference. We weren't going to let other markets influence the mustang, even though the world was ready for the mustang before we were ready to sell it to the world.

        "summary": "A whistleblower who worked for olympus corporation of the americas for 20 years will receive $ 51 million from the company after it admitted to a scheme of bribery and kickbacks and agreed tuesday to pay $ 646 million in fines, cnnmoney reports. John slowik was named the company's compliance officer in 2009, but he soon started registering complaints about doctors and hospital administrators receiving grants, costly trips, and other entertainment — which npr says included spa treatments and hot air balloon rides — to woo them to buy olympus ' medical equipment. He was fired in 2010 and filed a lawsuit against the company, noting his complaints about the equipment ( specifically, endoscopes to check out the digestive tract ) fell on deaf ears, nbc news reports. Because he filed the suit on behalf of the federal government, which cnn notes was getting ripped off by the scheme, slowik is entitled under the false claims act to part of any recovered money. Slowik says negative reaction to his complaints came all the way from the top: per his suit, he says mark gumz, who was the olympus ceo when slowik was made compliance officer, told him to \" try to figure out how to ' work around the rules'so as to ' not impact the business. ' \" when instead slowik tried to rein in the bribery and kickbacks he discovered, he says gumz started to \" ostracize and harass \" him, to the point where he became physically ill. Such kickbacks and bribes could \" improperly influence a provider's judgment about a patient's health care needs, result in the use of inferior or overpriced equipment, and drive up health care costs for everybody, \" the doj's deputy ag says, per cnn. As for the $ 646 million in total fines olympus now has to cough up, cnn notes that about half of that is for going against the feds ' anti-kickback statute and will be the largest amount ever paid out for violating that law.

Taylor had filed a lawsuit against tulsa's apothecary shoppe that his lawyers argued was providing a compounded version of pentobarbital that could cause \" inhumane pain. \" the company opted to settle in advance of today's scheduled court hearing, agreeing not to prepare or provide the drug and acknowledging that it had not already delivered the drug to be used in taylor's execution. But the ap reports there's a big unknown: whether the agreement will prevent or delay the lethal injection. Missouri gov. Jay nixon last week suggested that the execution could be carried out regardless of whether the apothecary shoppe delivered the drug, but would not answer a straight \" yes \" or \" no \" when asked if missouri had enough drugs for the execution — though he twice stressed that the department of corrections was prepared. Things get murkier from there: the state has never announced where it gets its drugs from, maintaining that the pharmacy is part of the execution team and therefore shielded from public disclosure; the apothecary shoppe won't confirm that it is that source. St. Louis public radio reports that a top state official last month admitted that the state had a stash of midazolam, which was used in ohio last month. Taylor is on death row for raping and killing 15-year-old ann harrison after abducting her from a kansas city school bus stop in 1989; he was to be executed in 2006, but was awarded a stay by the supreme court over concerns about the state's three-drug method.",

        "summary": "The utility that delivered disgusting, toxic water to the people of flint charged them ridiculous amounts of money for the privilege, according to a report from food and water watch. The public interest group surveyed the 500 largest water systems in the country and found that flint's was the most expensive, with an annual water bill of $ 864 for a typical household, reports the detroit free press. That was nearly twice the national average and more than three times what people in nearby detroit paid. The washington post notes flint's lead-contaminated water cost more than 10 times as much as water in phoenix, \" which is literally in the middle of a desert. \" despite charging such high prices, the utility switched to corrosive flint river water in 2014 as a cost-cutting move. Flint is one of the poorest cities in the us, with a median income of $ 24,834, reports reuters. Water and sewer charges in the city worked out to around 7 % of household income, more than double united nations guidelines for affordable water, and they remained high even after a judge ordered the rollback of a 35 % price rise introduced in 2011. A lawyer who sued to reduce rates tells the free press that flint had been \" using that money improperly for years to fund the general operations of the city. \" mary grant, a lead author on the food and water watch report, tells the post that the situation in flint is \" an indictment of running water systems like a business instead of a public service \" for the common good.

Caffeine has been shown to help reduce the effects of adenosine, the chemical that causes hangover headaches. ( but don't overdo it, because caffeine can also make you even more dehydrated. ) so will that advil. Taking ibuprofen ( advil's active ingredient ) has also been scientifically proven to reduce hangovers. No advil around? take aspirin instead — but don't take acetaminophen ( the active ingredient in tylenol ), since that could hurt your liver. Lots of water and sleep will also help. A typical hangover is over after eight to 24 hours. As for the re-hydration, if water is too boring, try sports drinks, coconut water, or other beverages high in electrolytes. If you can stomach the thought of eating, try these foods. Bland foods ( toast, crackers ), chicken noodle soup, fruit and other foods high in fructose, asparagus, eggs, and bacon have all been shown to help hangover victims. But don't bother with \" hangover pills. \" researchers have found they don't work.",

A hangover is essentially a build-up of acetaldehyde, a toxin in the liver. When one overdoes it on the booze, the liver can't produce enough glutathione, a compound that contains the amino acid l-cysteine, to combat it. Cysteine breaks down acetaldehyde into water and carbon dioxide, which is then flushed out of the body as urine. While nothing has been shown scientifically to \" cure \" a hangover, dr. Richard besser, abc news ' chief medical editor, offered these tips to help nurse the pain: • drink plenty of water. Alcohol is quite dehydrating. • if you have a headache, take aspirin or ibuprofen the next morning, not acetaminophen ( tylenol ). Acetaminophen is processed by your liver that has just taken a hit from your overdrinking. • go to bed. Most hangovers are over after eight to 24 hours but before you do … • pull out your smartphone and record a video message to yourself.

The white house has also been backtracking on two previously reported details, adding to the confusion: a senior official now tells journalists that bin laden was not armed when he was killed, contrary to earlier reports that he fired a weapon in self-defense. And as for the wife-as-human-shield story, a second official says that \" a different guy's wife was killed, \" and that a bin laden wife was \" injured but not killed. \" another official seems to support that statement, reports politico, saying that one woman was killed, one was injured, and neither was used as a shield. And one new detail that wasn't given anonymously: white house counterterrorism chief john brennan today said that bin laden lived in the abbottabad compound for the past five or six years, reports reuters. \" he had virtually no interaction with others outside that compound. \" and that raises questions, he says. \" how did bin laden stay at that compound for the past six years or so and be undetected? what type of support did he have outside of that compound — in the abbottabad area or more broadly within pakistan? \" ( pakistan's president tries to clear up his country's role. )",

Washington ( reuters ) - there is no evidence pakistani officials knew osama bin laden was living at a compound deep inside the country, but the united states is not ruling out the possibility, president barack obama's counterterrorism adviser said on tuesday. The death of the al qaeda leader in monday's u.s. Raid on his compound in abbottabad, a military garrison town 38 miles from the capital islamabad, has led some u.s. Lawmakers to demand a review of u.s. Aid to nuclear-armed pakistan. \" they ( pakistani officials ) are expressing as great a surprise as we had when we first learned about this compound, so there is no indication at this point that the people we have talked to were aware of this, but we need to dig deeper into this, \" white house counterterrorism chief john brennan said in an interview with national public radio.

        "summary": "Yeah, that air you're breathing at the office? it's likely diminishing your brain power by more than half unless it's kept environmentally clean, according to a new study. Researchers came to this conclusion by placing 24 professionals — including engineers, designers, and architects — in a specialized office for six full days, ars technica reports. Really a lab at syracuse university, the office gave researchers the tools to alter levels of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) and volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) on a daily basis. Participants then took a cognition test each afternoon that rated nine kinds of mental functioning, including information usage, strategy, and crisis response. \" the results are striking, \" says lead researcher joseph allen. Participants'scores rose an average of 61 % on so-called \" green \" days ( when vocs were lower ) and 101 % on \" green+ \" days ( which had low vocs and \" a high outdoor air ventilation rate, \" the study says ). Allen says ventilation, co2, and vocs were all capable of affecting the scores. The co2 findings are \" particularly important, \" an analyst explains. \" for decades, nearly everyone had thought that carbon dioxide at the concentrations encountered in buildings had no effects on people. \" sadly, typical buildings are designed to trap conditioned air in order to save energy — which raises voc and co2 levels. That's because co2 and vocs come from everyday things like air fresheners, furniture, flooring, leaky furnaces, and paint, popular science reports.

Trump will head to the convention in july with the \" official but uneasy embrace \" of the party establishment, according to the new york times, which calls his rise an \" extraordinary moment in american political history. \" he will be the first major-party nominee never to have held elected office since dwight eisenhower — and eisenhower was a five-star general.

        "summary": "\" you just hear these booms, they're very low, you know, you almost feel them. \" that's how one resident of sonora, calif., describes a resounding noise heard in the mountain town every summer weekday between 11am and 2pm, per the inquisitr. What's going on? well, no one seems to know for sure. Perhaps the ghosts of long-lost miners are still at work in the town, once a hub of the california gold rush, though some suspect aliens are simply alerting residents that it's time to break for lunch, reports abc10. Others put the noise down to bombs and grenades. Local geologist glen white suspects the sounds are coming from an army depot, where old munitions are regularly detonated in the same hours that residents hear the booms. But it's more than a hundred miles away in nevada. An officer at the depot in hawthorne doubts whether the explosions can be heard from such a distance. \" it doesn't feel right that what we're doing here would be heard 200 miles away when there's a mountain range in between us, \" he tells abc news. \" my office is 27 miles from where they detonate the old munitions, i only hear it here maybe one time a month, and just barely. \" white admits it's odd that \" people fairly close to the source of the energy, the explosions, aren't hearing it, \" but he says that doesn't disprove his theory. In fact, he says the detonations can also be heard 75 miles north of sonora in placerville, calif. \" i can't explain all the physics involved, but the atmosphere is bouncing in response to the energy and it's reflecting and bouncing [ the sound ] back down, \" he says.

            "Welcome to sonora, california: a beautiful old mountain town that was once the center of the california gold rush, and where every day, like clockwork, residents are startled by a loud \"boom \" that occurs between the hours of 11 a.m. And 2 p.m. As abc news reports, the loud booms — lovingly given the nickname \"mother lode mystery booms \" — have puzzled residents of sonora for years, and everything from mining to earthquakes to aliens, and everything in between, has been offered up as a cause. In a july 2015 wten ( albany ) report, sonora resident kira keegan described how the booms shake her very soul. \"you just hear these booms, they're very low, you know, you almost feel them. \" as it turns out, there may be a rather mundane explanation for those booms. About a hundred miles away from sonora, across the sierra nevada mountains, is the hawthorne, nevada army depot. There, a private company disposes of old munitions — bombs, grenades, and what have you. And wouldn't you know it, the detonations take place each day between 11 a.m. And 2 p.m. Local geologist ken white has even gone to hawthorne and recorded the detonations himself. \"they go through old munitions bombs, grenades, then they destroy them. \" so, problem",
            "A mystery \"boom \" has the small town of sonora looking to the sky. ( photo: abc10 ) a mystery \"boom \" has the small town of sonora looking to the sky. The noise can often be heard weekdays during the summer months from 11 a.m. To 2 p.m. It's a big mystery. Some think the noise is part of a mining operation, logging operation or even aliens. Geologist and educator glen white believes he has the real answer. Over the weekend white took video of explosions near an army depot 100 miles away from sonora, outside hawthorne, nevada, where a private company disposes and dismantles old bombs. \"they go through old munitions bombs, grenades, then they destroy them, \" white said.

            "Welcome to sonora, california: a beautiful old mountain town that was once the center of the california gold rush, and where every day, like clockwork, residents are startled by a loud \"boom \" that occurs between the hours of 11 a.m. And 2 p.m. As abc news reports, the loud booms — lovingly given the nickname \"mother lode mystery booms \" — have puzzled residents of sonora for years, and everything from mining to earthquakes to aliens, and everything in between, has been offered up as a cause. In a july 2015 wten ( albany ) report, sonora resident kira keegan described how the booms shake her very soul. \"you just hear these booms, they're very low, you know, you almost feel them. \" as it turns out, there may be a rather mundane explanation for those booms. About a hundred miles away from sonora, across the sierra nevada mountains, is the hawthorne, nevada army depot. There, a private company disposes of old munitions — bombs, grenades, and what have you. And wouldn't you know it, the detonations take place each day between 11 a.m. And 2 p.m. Local geologist ken white has even gone to hawthorne and recorded the detonations himself. \"they go through old munitions bombs, grenades, then they destroy them. \" so, problem",

The noise can often be heard weekdays during the summer months from 11 a.m. To 2 p.m. It's a big mystery. Some think the noise is part of a mining operation, logging operation or even aliens. Geologist and educator glen white believes he has the real answer. Over the weekend white took video of explosions near an army depot 100 miles away from sonora, outside hawthorne, nevada, where a private company disposes and dismantles old bombs. \"they go through old munitions bombs, grenades, then they destroy them, \" white said. White says the noise from the explosion could be bouncing off the atmosphere where air is dense.

The dentist performed cpr until emergency officials took the eden prairie high school student to the university of minnesota masonic children's hospital. Sydney's condition went from stable to critical as she experienced seizures and severe brain swelling. Late last week, doctors told the family there was nothing they could do. \" we want to rewind to ( june 1 ) when we had our happy, healthy, funny, beautiful 17-year-old daughter, \" wrote her mom. A cause of death has not been released, although cbs minnesota reports that sydney's family thinks she may have had an undetected heart condition. An nyu college of dentistry professor cautions that any procedure involving anesthesia has risks. \" we like to think of having wisdom teeth out as a casual occurrence, but it can be an extensive surgery. \" the minneapolis star tribune notes at least two other similar deaths around the country in recent years. And it adds that members of the school lacrosse team played with blue ribbons in their friend's honor saturday as they won the state championship. \"i was pushing to win for sydney, \" says junior midfielder kelly wolfe.

Weeks into his attack on kneeling players, president trump shows no sign of stopping. \" why is the nfl getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem, flag and country? change tax law! \" the president tweeted tuesday.

While a source says \" there is no fixed proposal \" yet for requiring players to stand for the anthem, lockhart says the owners believe they can make the change without the consent of the players union.",

The sum, written as two followed by thirty-six zeros, is likely a record for a demand in a lawsuit, the new york post says. It's also more money than even exists in the world by a long shot, gothamist notes, but at least there are more than a thousand defendants to bear the brunt. They include the new york city transit authority, the entire city of nyc, au bon pain store, laguardia airport, a kmart store, a dog owner, several health care providers, and 1,000 john does. At the center of purisimia's dissatisfaction seems to be a dog bite sustained on a city bus, a \" chinese couple \" photographing him while he was being treated for it, and being overcharged for coffee at the airport. He characterizes these incidents as \" civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud, \" according to lowering the bar, which notes purisima is seeking punitive damages, too. This appears to be at least his 20th suit since 2004, according to justia.com. Purisima has sued casinos, banks, and the people's republic of china, among others.

        "summary": "This might better explain why the captain of the south korean ferry that capsized has been so reluctant to face the public: investigators say he wasn't at the helm when the ship ran into trouble, report the bbc and reuters. \" he may have been off the bridge, \" said one prosecutor, \" and the person at the helm at the time was the third officer. \" now an arrest warrant has been issued for the captain, 69-year-old lee joon-seok, who was also among the first people off the listing ferry. Arrest warrants were also issued for two other crew members, cnn reports. Another disturbing detail: the ap reports that an official on land instructed the ferry crew to begin preparing for an evacuation almost immediately after the distress call was made, but the captain didn't follow through with the order for another half-hour or so. More: the presence of a less experienced officer at the helm could end up being a huge factor in the accident because the early evidence is pointing toward human error, reports the new york times. One thing in particular investigators are looking at is whether the ferry made a \" drastic \" turn that caused it to tip. The captain and crew are also under fire for an inept rescue operation, in which only a few of the ship's life rafts were deployed. About 270 of the 450 people aboard remain missing, and the confirmed death toll of 28 was expected to rise sharply soon. Four large cranes are at the site of the sinking, with a fifth one arriving sunday, all in a bid to lift the ferry from the water — an operation that could take \" many days, or even longer, \" according to the wall street journal. But officials say they won't rush into the salvage operation too quickly if it means putting possible survivors at risk. ( also today, a high school vice principal rescued from the ferry was found hanged. )",

A study published in nature genetics notes the nek1 gene is tied to 3 % of als cases, which scientists note is a \" significant \" association, existing in both inherited and sporadic ( arising despite a lack of family history ) cases of the eventually fatal neuromuscular illness. \" it's very exciting because it shows everyone who contributed to the ice bucket challenge that their donation had an impact on the research, \" an alsa exec tells the guardian. The nek1 gene was found by examining more than 1,000 als families, then boosted through further analysis of more than 13,000 subjects with sporadic als, notes genetic engineering &amp; biotechnology news. The initiative that pinpointed the gene, project mine, was partly funded by $ 1 million from the ice bucket challenge, per the new york daily news. The project has a lofty goal of sequencing the dna of 15,000 als patients and 7,500 control subjects, hopefully providing enough specimens to compare to bring researchers closer to finding a cure. \" the sophisticated gene analysis that led to this finding was only possible because of the large number of als samples available, \" says lucie bruijn, the alsa's chief scientist, per gebn. \" the als ice bucket challenge enabled [ the alsa ] to invest in project mine's work to create large biorepositories of als biosamples...

In it, the performer uses a knife to slice into the shadow of a flower in a vase; both the shadow and the flower itself appear to be cut. Teller filed for copyright of the trick as a \" pantomime \" in 1983, so he may have a case, the independent reports. Check out a diagram here, via yahoo. Dogge's youtube video has been removed.",

Yoshinori ohsumi was announced as the recipient of this year's prize for his work involving autophagy, a process in the body that acts as a junkyard salvager of sorts: as explained by the guardian, old cells are found and any useful material \" stripped out \" to either create energy or produce new cells. Understanding kinks in this process means a greater understanding of what causes certain diseases such as cancer, parkinson's, and type 2 diabetes, among others. Not much headway had been made in autophagy — taken from the greek for \" self-eating, \" per a press release — until ohsumi got to work on it in a bunch of early- ' 90s experiments in which he used baker's yeast to identify 15 genes behind the process, per the washington post. And it's a delicate process, whereby too little of it can result in aging and related diseases, but too much of it can lead to cancerous growths. \" ohsumi's discoveries led to a new paradigm in our understanding of how the cell recycles its content, \" the nobel assembly says, per the new york times. And ohsumi, currently a professor at the tokyo institute of technology, didn't seem to mind toiling away in a field that wasn't exactly deemed the sexiest. \" i am not very competitive, so i always look for a new subject to study, even if it is not so popular, \" he told the journal of cell biology in 2012.

Five people, including a woman reportedly five months ' pregnant, were found murdered in rural citronelle on saturday afternoon after a woman who said she'd been kidnapped and held hostage escaped and alerted police, adds the ap. \" given the way the scene looks, we're going to be here a couple of days, \" a sheriff's office rep said. \" it's obviously a horrific scene. \" what officials say they know so far, also via cbs news: somewhere between midnight and 1am, residents of the home on jim platt road made a 911 call reporting a trespasser. They identified derrick dearman as the trespasser. Citronelle police responded, but found no sign. At some point later in the morning, the murders took place. Officials aren't certain if the victims were murdered in their sleep or after a lengthy standoff, but say that firearms and at least one other type of weapon were used. Dearman is in custody; it's believed he had a relationship of as-yet undetermined nature with the woman who was able to escape. A neighbor tells al.com that the occupants moved into the house four or five months ago and that traffic in the rural area had subsequently increased. He says there are two unoccupied mobile homes near the house. A man at the scene said his son, robert lee brown, 25, was among the victims. He identified another victim as shannon turner. \" if i could get my hands on him, \" he said of dearman, \" i'd kill him myself. \"",

Ferguson had been on death row for 35 years for the murder of eight people in the miami area, but his legal fight came to an end after the supreme court denied his last-minute appeal, reports the miami herald. Among other things, the 65-year-old claimed to have powers derived from the sun, and thus could control it, and he said the state wanted to kill him as part of a communist plot to keep him from ruling the world. Ferguson \" has a 40-year history of paranoid schizophrenia, \" one of his lawyers tells the guardian. \" we have more than 30 doctors diagnosing him as that over four decades. \" victims ' families say it was all an act. \"i think he got off easy compared to what he did to the victims, \" says the sister of a 17-year-old girl who was raped and shot. The state's supreme court never bought the argument that ferguson wasn't rational enough to be executed. He might think he's immortal, but millions of christians similarly believe in an afterlife, it reasoned. Ferguson's last meal, for the record: a meat and vegetable patty, white bread, stewed tomatoes, potato salad, carrots, and iced tea, reports the ap. In other words, he made no special request.",

Al franken took to the senate floor thursday for a final farewell, surrounded by some of the same colleagues who demanded his resignation just weeks before. \"even in the face of everything that is happening today, i still believe in paul [ wellstone's ] words: 'politics is about the improvement of people's lives, ' \" said franken, who will officially resign jan. 2 after more than eight years in the senate. He agreed to step down, reluctantly and only after pressure from political allies, after several women accused him of trying to grope, kiss or harass them. Franken's initial resignation announcement, which came on dec. 7, was followed by the senate version of a long minnesota goodbye. For weeks, franken continued to cast votes and tend to committee business while gov. Mark dayton selected a replacement appointee in lt. Gov. Tina smith. Again and again, franken returned to the senate floor to deliver parting speeches on a range of topics that both summed up his core political values and tried to leave",

        "summary": "It's not the completely autonomous self-driving system found in google's cars, but with tesla's new \" autopilot \" mode — included in a software update for its model s and new model x cars and available in north america starting thursday — drivers will be able to \" automatically steer down the highway, change lanes, and adjust speed in response to traffic, \" the bbc reports. The new system also scans for a parking space when it gets to its final destination, and wired reports the autopark feature allows it to parallel-park on its own. Autopilot is optimized for highway driving ( unless you're behind a vehicle, you must be going at least 18mph for it to work ), and it's not like you can completely zone out: wired points out that after a few seconds of no contact, you ' ll get an alert from the car to touch the wheel; grab the wheel, and control reverts to you. So how safe is an autopilot-equipped tesla? \" it should not hit pedestrians, hopefully, \" ceo elon musk told the media thursday, per the bbc. The car will also come to a complete stop and put its hazards on if the driver doesn't take back control when alerted. There are limitations — e.g., the system won't perform as well in heavy snow or on highways where lane markings aren't clear, and \" it doesn't know what the traffic light or the sign in front of you says, \" per jalopnik, which describes it as the \" ultimate execution of cruise control. \" after a test drive, jalopnik acknowledges the technology as both \" awesome and creepy, \" while road &amp; track says, \" as unsettling as it may have been to turn the controls over to a system that tesla still describes as being in ' beta'testing, autopilot proved itself to be up to the task of handling stop-and-go traffic without getting confused or seriously scaring anyone in the car. \" ( the model x is also ready for an \" apocalyptic scenario. \" )",

The diplomats say they've been trying to persuade trump that withdrawal could lead to confrontation with tehran, but the president, who has called the agreement a \" disaster, \" believes pulling out will bring iran back to the negotiation table. The deal, seen as one of barack obama's biggest foreign policy achievements, lifted sanctions in return for a freeze on iran's nuclear program. In a tweet monday, trump slammed john kerry's reported attempts to save the deal, saying the us doesn't need his \" possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated iran deal. He was the one that created this mess in the first place! \" over months of talks, senior officials from britain, france, and germany didn't agree to changes in the deal, and in the event of a us pullout, they could face sanctions if they continue to do business with iran, the telegraph reports.

        "summary": "While some marriages end in divorce, this one apparently essentially started with it. New york wife cristina carta villa, 59, claims that husband gabriel villa secretly divorced her right after they married 20 years ago in an effort to retain his assets, the new york post reports. Now she's suing the 90-year-old to nullify the divorce and hold onto their manhattan condo. \" i realize now that during all these years of joy and happiness, and of difficult moments we shared together, my husband lied to me, \" says cristina. She claims to have learned about the divorce in november after receiving a tax bill for their one-bedroom condo that didn't include her name. She apparently hired a lawyer who discovered that gabriel had divorced her in the dominican republic ( although they didn't live there ) four months after they married, citing \" incompatibility of temperaments. \" gabriel then allegedly tried to wipe her name from the condo deed using the dominican documentation. But she \" has no recollection of ( giving ) any authorization to anyone to proceed with a divorce, \" cristina says in court papers. The two married in new york in 1994, and no divorce was logged there. Cristina suspects her husband wants to sell the condo, which the post estimates could be worth $ 1.4 million, to his daughter from a previous relationship. It's not the first such story to feature in the post: in 2014 it had the case of james a. Ruggiero, a staten island man who claimed his wife, a divorce lawyer, not only divorced him in secret in 2009 but also tricked him into signing a post-nup that awarded her their $ 1 million home and a slew of other assets.

The nye county sheriff's department was called at about 3: 15 p.m. To love ranch in crystal, nevada about 70 miles outside of las vegas for a report of an unresponsive man needing an ambulance, sheriff sharon a. Wehrly said in a statement. The 35-year-old was stabilized and taken to desert view hospital in nearby pahrump, the statement said. Officials then tried to have him airlifted to las vegas, but the 6-foot-10-inch odom was too tall for the helicopter that was available and he was driven by ambulance to sunrise hospital and medical center. Hof, who owns the love ranch and other legal brothels in nevada, said his staff had picked up odom from a home in las vegas on saturday. \" he just wanted to get away, have a good time and relax, \" hof told the associated press in a phone interview. Hof said odom was \" happy, he was sleeping every night, \" while visiting, but two women went to check on odom tuesday afternoon after not hearing from him since early morning, and found him face down and unconscious. When they turned him on his side at the direction of a 911 operator, odom started \" throwing up all kinds of stuff. \" hof said odom had been taking herbal viagra and had drunk part of a bottle of cognac since arriving, but had no knowledge of his use of any other drugs. \" it's incredibly sad, \" said hof, who turns 69 on wednesday. Hof is known for his own onetime reality show, \" cathouse, \" on hbo. Odom's hospitalization was first reported by tmz. Odom, who won two nba championships with the lakers in 2009 and 2010, last played in the nba",
            "Odom started his career with the clippers and played for the lakers for seven seasons, where he was a franchise favorite. He was traded to the dallas mavericks in 2011 after the nba commissioner blocked a deal that would have sent him to new orleans, and went back to the clippers in 2012, where his career effectively ended the next year."

        "summary": "Alan turing hated the united states. That's one nugget revealed in a trove of old letters recently unearthed in a storeroom filing cabinet at the university of manchester. The guardian reports the collection of 148 notes, which apparently hadn't seen the light of day in at least three decades, spanned from 1949 until the british mathematician's death in 1954. The letters penned by turing — who helped helm the university's computing laboratory from 1948 on, after breaking the nazi enigma code during world war ii — were discovered by one of the college's computer science professors, who said he located them in a nondescript-looking file with the words \" alan turing \" written across it. \" i initially thought:'that can't be what i think it is, ' \" jim miles says, with engadget adding he at first thought someone had simply reused turing's folder. The letters don't get much into turing's personal life: he was convicted in 1952 of \" gross indecency \" for a homosexual relationship and chemically castrated, and he died of cyanide poisoning in june 1954 in what's widely believed to have been a suicide. Instead, the notes mainly touch on his academic work in math, computing, and artificial intelligence — in other words, \" mostly ' work stuff ' you would expect a busy academic to have piling up on his desk, \" per sciencealert. As for that slam against the united states: turing had been asked to speak at a conference there in 1953 and replied, \" i would not like the journey, and i detest america, \" without elaborating on his displeasure. Check out the descriptions of each letter here. ( a number of mathematicians have met with awful fates. )",

        "summary": "If new orleans is sinking, beijing might as well be in freefall. A new study in the journal remote sensing finds depleted groundwater is causing the chinese capital — the growing chaoyang district, in particular — to sink as much as four inches per year; a recent study found new orleans was sinking up to two inches per year. As cnn reports, beijing is the world's fifth most water-stressed city, using an estimated 3.5 billion liters per year — two-thirds of which comes from groundwater accumulated over millennia. As the water is extracted, surrounding soil dries up and compacts. Researchers, who used satellite imagery and gps data, say beijing has sunk about 14 inches in the last decade alone. The weight of new buildings and roads is also playing a role, per christian science monitor. Researchers predict the continued subsidence will produce \" a strong impact on train operations \" in the city. A separate study on subsidence effects is due out later this year, per the guardian. In the meantime, the sinking could be eased by proper enforcement of groundwater pumping regulations. \" there are some rules but the enforcement is doubtful, \" one chinese environmentalist says. Beijing could also learn from shanghai, which was sinking at about four inches per year in the 1950s and ' 60s but now falls less than half an inch annually after opting to use river water for daily use. Last year, china began building tunnels and canals to alleviate stress on aquifers. But elsewhere, concerns are greater. Mexico city and jakarta are sinking up to 11 inches per year, researchers say. ( parts of this us state are also sinking. )",

This sepia-toned shot depicts union leader and future us president ulysses s. Grant astride his mount before a camp of captured confederate soldiers. But on closer inspection, it's actually a composite of three photos — and reveals a deeper story about photography during and after the civil war. First, the three pics, all from 1864: one is a portrait of grant from which the head was taken; another was a photo of maj. Gen. Alexander mcdowell mccook, used for the horse and body; third was a shot of fisher's hill, va., where union guards oversaw a camp of confederate pows. The early \" photoshopper \" was likely levin corbin handy, who had apprenticed under his uncle, renowned photographer mathew brady. After brady's death in 1896, handy took over his archive of negatives and produced new prints for publications. He also combined new images \" to satisfy the steady demand for heroic images of the war, \" according to the book faking it: manipulated photography before photoshop. The book adds that brady had spent big bucks hiring photographers to shoot the civil war, but only in brady's final years had people found enough emotional distance from the horrors of the war to want photographs. Now, \" the composite photograph tells us something, \" writes karen graham at digital journal. \" it admonishes us to not believe everything we see and to investigate what we aren't quite sure is true. \"",

        "summary": "Incidents of \" sextortion \" — adults posing as teens to get actual teens to send nude photos, then blackmailing them — are on the rise in canada. But canadian teens have a new defender: the humble naked mole rat. Quartz reports a new campaign from the canadian center for child protection encourages teens asked to send a naked photo to send a picture of a naked mole rat instead. The nonprofit even has naked mole rat memes available on the campaign website to get teens started. The psa is aimed at teen boys in particular. The center says there's been an 89 % increase in sextortion cases victimizing teen boys over the past two years. And it's not just in canada; a minnesota man was sent to prison last year after sextorting more than 150 boys, according to the new yorker. So why a naked mole rat? besides the fact they're seriously interesting ( the new yorker has a list of naked mole rat facts — they're immune to most pain, can live 18 minutes without oxygen, etc. — that you really should read ), the psa explains: \" long, veiny, and fleshy, the naked mole rat — you can call it willy — looks a lot like that picture you were just about to send. \" the center's executive director, lianna mcdonald, says it was a \" brazen \" choice to use humor to address a serious subject, but it's the best way to reach teen boys, who can become suicidal over sextortion. \" they're so deeply humiliated about what's about to happen and what they've done, \" she tells cbc. And the idea of giving potential victims something proactive to do — confront a would-be victimizer with an ugly animal — is an appealing one.",

Brafman also threw in the terms \" nerd \" and \" mad scientist, \" per the guardian, but noted his client was \" brilliant beyond words \" and actually made investors in his two hedge funds and his pharmaceutical firm, retrophin, a lot of money. \" as lady gaga said, ' he was born this way, ' \" brafman added, with shkreli paying rapt attention from his seat as if he were \" watching a terrific movie, \" per the times. Brafman said it was the investors and retrophin board who bullied and questioned the sexuality of shkreli, who later gained notoriety for jacking up the price of a life-saving medication via his turing pharmaceuticals startup. The prosecution painted quite a different picture, with assistant us attorney karthik srinivasan saying shkreli's hedge funds were constructed with \" lies on top of lies on top of lies \" and ended up losing his investors money — which shkreli then tried to cover up by sneaking money out of retrophin to pay them back. \" in reality, he was just a con man, \" srinivasan said. The washington post notes that during srinivasan's diatribe against shkreli, shkreli simply jotted down some words and grinned. Some potential jurors agreed with srinivasan: more than 250 candidates were dismissed over three days, many due to their \" pharma bro \" views. Still, brafman didn't pass up a chance to cite lady gaga yet again. \" the government's going to stand up and give you 100 million reasons to convict, \" brafman said, per cnbc. \" i ' m going [ to ] give you one good reason to acquit him: he's not guilty. \"",

        "summary": "Romanian hackers infiltrated 65 % of outdoor surveillance cameras in washington, dc, ahead of president trump's inauguration as part of an extortion scheme only now being made public, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint, filed in dc and unsealed thursday, accuses romanians mihai alexandru isvanca, 25, and eveline cismaru, 28, of hacking 123 of the city's 187 outdoor police cameras over four days in january 2017, leaving them temporarily unable to record footage, report cnn and the washington post. All the cameras were ok by the big day. An affidavit says the individuals — believed to be part of a hacking network — took over the computer system that operated the cameras and began sending ransomware emails to about 180,000 email addresses. Authorities say they planned to lock users out of their computers until they received payment. Dc police first noticed a malfunction in the cameras on jan. 12. A secret service agent then detected the hack. Authorities fixed the problem by taking the cameras offline, wiping them clean, and rebooting them by jan. 15, five days ahead of trump's inauguration. No ransom payments were made. \" this case was of the highest priority due to its impact on the secret service's protective mission and its potential effect on the security plan for the 2017 presidential inauguration, \" a spokesman for us attorney jessie k. Liu says, per the post. Isvanca and cismaru were arrested in bucharest on dec. 15 along with three others who face charges in europe, reports the bbc. Prosecutors plan to seek extradition for the pair soon. The post notes that it's not clear the alleged hackers knew they had infiltrated a police computer system.",

And he came to me and he said, ' i have such great confidence in the administration. I don't want to be a distraction.

What may have caused trump to move on pruitt, per one source: an \" embarrassing \" story that recently came out about pruitt gunning for jeff sessions ' job as attorney general. Pruitt's resignation letter made clear his fealty to the president, but in the daily intelligencer, margaret hartmann writes that pruitt \" miscalculated \" on two fronts: one, he didn't inspire loyalty among those who worked for him, and two, he may have thought trump's constant emphasis on \" loyalty \" would shield him. But \" by now everyone should be aware that the only person trump is really loyal to is himself, \" hartmann notes. Sciencealert lists some of the reactions to pruitt's departure, with at least one person noting his \" epic \" resignation letter. Sen. Elizabeth warren says pruitt should've been shown the door \" 28 scandals ago, \" per usa today, while the executive director for dc's citizens for responsibility and ethics watchdog issued a curt one-word statement that simply read \" good, \" newsweek reports. Kristin mink, the woman who confronted pruitt earlier this week at a restaurant and asked him to resign, is also reacting. \" not in a million years did i think this would happen. You know, so quickly, \" she tells abc7, adding she started \" jumping up and down \" when she heard the news.

In what researchers say is the first study to look into how narcissism develops over time, children between the ages of 7 and 12 were interviewed over an 18-month period and the results showed that kids described by their parents as more special than others were more likely to show signs of narcissism later on, ohio state university says in a press release. But while the \" overvalued \" kids developed narcissistic tendencies, it was the ones whose parents showed more emotional warmth who developed healthy levels of self-esteem, according to the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. \" self-esteem basically means you're a person of worth equal with other people, \" study co-author brad bushman tells npr. \" narcissism means you think you're better than other people. \" children with healthy self-esteem, he says, agreed with statements like \" some kids like the kind of person they are, \" while narcissists agreed with statements like \" kids like me deserve something extra. \" bushman, a father of three, says his research has changed his own parenting style. \" i used to think my children should be treated like they were extra-special. I ' m careful not to do that now, \" he says. \" it is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self-esteem, but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism, \" which can lead to higher levels of aggression and violence.

Prejean, as you may remember, is the miss usa contestant who in 2009 voiced her disapproval of gay marriage when perez hilton questioned her about it. \" i think it's great we live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite, \" she said. \" and you know what, i think in my country, in my family, i think that i believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how i was raised. Thank you very much. \" let's see, there was also her sex tape, and the scandal over her boob job. She was eventually stripped of her miss california crown. Yeah, her. She and boller got engaged in february. The festivities will be held at the grand del mar hotel. Sounds like she's getting just what she wanted, though i can't help but wonder if she's running blindly toward those big strong arms of his in the wake of all she's been through/put herself through in the last year. Are you surprised to see prejean getting married so soon after all the scandal? image via jsr00001/flickr"

China plans to summon north korea's ambassador in beijing to the foreign ministry to lodge a strong protest, spokeswoman hua chunying told reporters at a daily briefing wednesday. China made a similar protest after the north's last nuclear test in 2013. Wednesday's reported test was performed in defiance of the international community and in contravention of its earlier denuclearization promises, hua said. \" north korea should stop taking any actions [ that ] would worsen the situation on the korean peninsula, \" she told reporters. Environment bureau technicians were monitoring conditions near the border, but air quality near the bomb site was within the normal range, hua said, adding that in the longer term, north korea should return to long-stalled six-nation denuclearization talks hosted by china. The test was also denounced by the european union and south korea, which called it a \" grave provocation, \" the bbc reports. Pyongyang, meanwhile, said the test was a complete success that has made the country an advanced nuclear nation. \" it is just to have h-bomb as self-defense against the us having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons, \" a north korean state broadcast said, per the guardian.

Managers of less-taxing departments will see their minimum raise a dollar, to $ 10.90.

Ugly christmas sweaters and sports jerseys will be allowed on special occasions.

        "summary": "As one university faces a lawsuit over its refusal to host white nationalist richard spencer, another is reluctantly conceding to the idea. The university of florida says it will allow spencer to speak on its campus on oct. 19 in what will be the alt-right leader's first college event since an august rally at the university of virginia that culminated in a deadly demonstration a day later, reports the washington post. Uf initially denied a request from spencer's national policy institute for a september event citing security concerns. Spencer then hired an attorney who threatened the school with a lawsuit, and uf announced thursday that npi would pay a standard fee of $ 10,500 to rent a space and provide security on campus on oct. 19, reports the gainesville sun. \" no one at the university of florida invited richard spencer. The racist ideas espoused by this organization and this individual conflict with the values of this institution, \" uf says in an email to students, per the independent florida alligator. But uf \" must allow the free expression of all viewpoints, \" a university rep adds, noting the school will pay some $ 500,000 for additional security on campus and in gainesville for which it is unable to bill spencer's npi. Spencer, who is concerned about violence at the event, says \" the fact that so much money is going to have to be spent on security results directly from people who want to shut down free speech \" and \" we need to fight this. \" he adds it will be an \" exciting \" event. \" i expect good intellectual push-back from the students, \" he says. \" that's part of the fun of it all. \"",

Lee — who told reporters at the time she didn't know the area she was driving in well, per cbs news — said that she saw barricades near a local road, but not blocking it, and that other people seemed to be driving across a nearby bridge just fine, the charlotte observer notes. Cathey insists the barricades were definitely up, and that \" whether someone else moved those barricades and she drove around ' em, i can't say. \" her car was soon pushed off the road by floodwaters, and although she was able to get herself and kaiden out of the car, he was ripped from her hands by the water. After an all-night search, his body was found the next day, stuck between a tree and a car. If convicted, lee could face up to 16 months in prison. She's due in court on nov. 20.

Others agree with bean herself, who appeared on fox &amp; friends thursday and said the boycott against ll bean was \" bullying. \" \" i ' m not going to back down. I never back down, if i feel i ' m right, \" she said.",

A new poll by abc and the washington post puts mitt romney up 50-47 on president obama, which is within the margin of error but marks the first time romney has hit the 50 % mark. Among the reasons for his stronger showing: race: obama continues to do well among non-white voters with about 80 % of support. But among whites, he trails romney by a sizable 59-38. That 21-point deficit is nearly three times worse than his deficit with john mccain at this point four years ago, and it sets the stage for this election \" to be more polarized along racial lines \" than any since 1988, notes the washington post. Economy: romney made big gains here, and now leads 52-43 on which candidate should be trusted to fix things. It's the first \" clear lead \" for either, notes abc. Also, obama lost his empathy advantage. Asked which candidate better understands ordinary americans'struggles, the president barely edged romney 48-46.",

            "The 2012 election is shaping up to be more polarized along racial lines than any presidential contest since 1988, with president obama lagging behind republican mitt romney among white voters by 21 percentage points, a steep drop in support from four years ago. As he did in 2008, obama gets overwhelming support from non-whites, who made up a record high proportion of the overall electorate four years ago. In that contest, 80 percent of all non-whites supported obama, including 95 percent of black voters, according to the exit poll. In the washington post-abc news national tracking poll released wednesday, obama wins 79 percent of non-whites, and support for his reelection is nearly universal among african americans. But among whites, obama is currently doing much worse than he did in 2008. At this stage four years ago, obama trailed republican john mccain by eight percentage points among white voters. Even in victory, obama ended up losing white voters by 12 percentage points. Obama's current 21-percent-deficit — he trails romney 59 to 38 percent — would be far harder to overcome, as this year may break a string of increasingly non-white electorates.

This poll, produced for abc by langer research associates, finds that likely voters now pick romney over obama in trust to handle the economy by 52-43 percent - the first time either candidate has held a clear lead over the other on this central issue. Equally important, romney has erased obama's customary advantage on which candidate better understands the economic problems of average americans. Today, 48 percent pick obama, 46 percent romney - essentially a dead heat.

Rupert murdoch's network clinched the most prime-time viewers among cable news networks, reports the wall street journal, and even increased its hold among the much-desired demographic of 25- to 45-year-olds in the latest nielsen ratings ending in june. The score surprised some media observers who expected fox to take a hit after losing star host bill o'reilly, who was replaced by tucker carlson. While his audience is smaller, carlson is beating o'reilly in the coveted 25-to-54 group, and the network gained 21 % overall in that age group over last year. The five round-table show saw a rise after replacing the kelly file, following host megyn kelly's jump to nbc. ( adweek has a scorecard by time slot. ) but it wasn't all bad news for the runners up: all three networks are clocking far more viewers than before the presidential election, though fox has watched its lead slip since november. Left-leaning msnbc is closing in with the biggest ratings growth — 72 % among 25- to 54-year-olds over the past year — thanks to rachel maddow's show, which is tops among that demographic. Last word with lawrence o'donnell saw a 97 % boost among that same group, though it still lags behind sean hannity's show on fox news, which gained 31 %. Overall, fox news racked up 472,000 prime-time viewers, with 389,000 for msnbc, and 370,000 for cnn.

The los angeles times reports the justice department's office of professional responsibility began looking into the ronald reagan appointee at the end of george h.w. Bush's tenure and uncovered a rash of ethical transgressions that were detailed in a report released in january 1993. Among them, per the times and new york times: having a $ 10,000 security fence constructed around his home that didn't actually provide security, flying free on fbi aircraft in order to meet relatives, and sidestepping taxes owed on his use of an fbi limo. Attorney general janet reno determined \" in no uncertain terms that [ sessions ] can no longer effectively lead the bureau \" and recommended clinton fire him. The washington post reports two presidents — truman and kennedy — considered firing j. Edgar hoover, who held the post for nearly 48 years and whose political clout allowed him to escape such a dismissal. Ten-year term limits were established after hoover's death.
