        "summary": "The night that omar mateen carried out the deadliest mass shooting in us history was far from his first visit to orlando's pulse nightclub, surviving customers say. The orlando sentinel spoke to at least four customers who recalled seeing mateen in the lgbt club. Ty smith says he had seen the 29-year-old there at least a dozen times and remembers him talking about his father and telling him he had a wife and child. \" sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent, \" smith says. Another customer says mateen had been coming in for years and was prone to violent outbursts. In other developments: kevin west, another pulse regular, tells the los angeles times that he had exchanged occasional messages with mateen for a year on the gay dating app jack'd but had never laid eyes on him until an hour before the shooting, when he spotted him while dropping a friend off at the club. \" he walked directly past me. I said, ' hey, ' and he turned and said, ' hey, ' and nodded his head, \" west says. \" i could tell by the eyes. \" pulse regular cord cedeno tells msnbc that he and his friends had seen mateen on gay dating apps, including grindr. \" i instantly blocked him because he was very creepy in his messages. I blocked him immediately, \" cedeno says. No profiles of mateen from such apps have surfaced yet, though cedeno says two friends that encountered mateen online have turned their phones over to the fbi. Lisa lane, a performer at pulse, tells the advocate that she knows mateen's face from her shows at the club. \" he was one of my fans, \" she says. \" always when he saw me he would talk to me. \" in a look at mateen's past, the ap finds an all-american list of early employers: publix, circuit city, chick-fil-a, walgreens, and gold's gym. He worked at a state prison for six months beginning in 2006 and was hired the following year by security firm g4s. His assignments included guard duty at the st. Lucie county courthouse in fort pierce. Up until the pulse massacre, he was working as a security guard at a gated retirement community. Former classmates at florida's martin county high school tell the miami herald that mateen was a loner who behaved very strangely on the week of the 9/11 attacks — at one point, he claimed osama bin laden was his uncle — and was expelled soon afterward",

A judge today let the 30-year-old monsegur off with 7 months'time served, even though he faced up to 26 years in prison, reports bloomberg. The reason is that the former leader of the anonymous offshoot lulzsec immediately turned into an informant upon his arrest three years ago.

That was the day that she and her husband, philip, found out that their unborn son, aiden, had only half a heart — a rare condition known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The diagnosis made at her 20-week prenatal visit meant that the left side of aiden's heart would just stop growing, and when he exited the safety of rodgers ' womb, he wouldn't get the oxygen-filled blood he needed in his body, fox news notes. \" philip and i left the doctor's office in complete shock and in fear for our unborn baby's life and future, \" she writes. But parental instinct quickly kicked in: the couple began educating themselves on the disorder, talking to medical personnel, and arranging for jenny to move from their home in benton, la., to houston for the duration of the pregnancy and the birth at texas children's. \" all of this was hard to take in. Not just hard — gut wrenching, \" she writes. \" my tiny precious baby would have his chest cut open in his first week of life.

But that amenable mood to conversing has apparently changed, as the north korean leader today dismissed a request from south korea's parliament to resume negotiations on hot-button issues such as human rights and families still separated by the korean war, reuters reports. An official from the south's ministry of unification says that the north gave no reason for turning down the request. Part of the north's sudden ( but not terribly surprising ) about-face may be that it's still peeved at south korea's major ally, the us, for sanctions after the sony hack, reuters notes. South korea's not exactly thrilled with its neighbor lately, either — and that distaste has recently been stirred up by a korean-american woman ( whom the south is now trying to deport ) who talked up the great taste of north korean beer and the country's clean rivers, reports ap.

He declined to say when she would be deported, citing privacy issues. The korean peninsula remains technically in a state of war, split along the world's most heavily fortified border, because the 1950-53 korean war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. In south korea, praising north korea can be punished by up to seven years in prison under the security law. Critics have urged that the law be scrapped, saying it violates freedom of expression. Supporters argue that it is needed because of continuing threats from north korea. Past authoritarian leaders in south korea frequently used the law to suppress political rivals.

He was still mad about losing the bet two days later when he shot crowley six times. According to nj.com, roberson and crowley ran into each other on the street. When the father of five went to shake roberson's hand, roberson opened fire. A witness to the shooting recalls hearing roberson say \" they cheated my team \" before shooting crowley. Many blamed the 49ers ' narrow loss to the ravens on the referees missing a holding penalty. The judge who sentenced roberson on friday described the crime as \" brazen and cold-blooded, \" noting roberson \" has expressed absolutely no remorse for his actions. \" in fact, roberson still denies he shot his friend, despite the testimony of multiple witnesses.

To the disappointment of poles, obama made no announcement on the ending of visas for poles traveling to the us. Poles have been critical of the fact that they are not a member of the visa waiver program even though most other european countries are. On friday evening, obama sat down for dinner with 20 central and eastern european leaders who were in warsaw to discuss how they could help the pro-democracy movements in northern africa and the middle east.

        "summary": "Two new hampshire properties finally sold at auction thursday, despite the fact that they may be booby-trapped. The christian science monitor has the backstory: a 6,000-square-foot house on a 100-acre property, plus a nearby dental office, were owned by ed and elaine brown, who were convicted of tax evasion but managed to fend off federal agents during a nine-month standoff that finally ended with their arrests in 2007. During that standoff, they amassed an arsenal of weapons and explosives and claimed their compound was booby-trapped. There was an auction last year, but federal agents couldn't guarantee the property was booby-trap-free, and no one bought either property. At that time, the compound was listed with a starting bid of $ 250,000; this time around, the minimum bid was slashed in half. A businessman, james hollander, ultimately paid $ 205,000 for it, plus $ 415,000 for the dental office. Authorities had been worried the properties might once again fail to sell; an irs liquidation specialist told wmur last week, \" they can't guarantee that they have found everything, but they have done a good-faith search over and over again. \" the station reports that investigators did actually find explosive devices, and that a warning was included in the notice of sale. But wcvb reported thursday that \" the hilltop house and the grounds up to the tree line have been... Deemed free of improvised explosive devices. \" the former presence of booby traps isn't the only interesting thing about the compound: there's a turret with a tower that offers a 360-degree view of the property; a hidden door that leads to an underground bunker and an escape route to the outside via manhole; and, as the house was built over an existing house, in one section you can see that a floor was built atop the old house's roof.

        "summary": "Mormon style might conjure up images of dark suits, thin ties, and/or mitt romney — but for young church members these days, mormonism and hipsterdom aren't antithetical, writes alex williams in the new york times. The church of jesus christ of latter-day saints does call on its members to avoid tight clothes, short skirts, and tattoos, but many young mormons find ways to uphold the guidelines and still be on fashion's cutting edge. \"there used to be a bias against being 'cool ' in the mormon world, \" says a stylist who is a mormon. At brigham young university a decade ago, \"there was absolutely zero fashion sense, myself included, \" she notes. \"now when i go back to visit, the kids there look really cool. \" men, williams writes, can wear button-down plaid shirts and rolled jeans and stay within the rules; many women opt for the \"zooey deschanel look. \" a set of current ads features an array of trendy church members, including the killers ' frontman brandon flowers.

Still, tattooed mormons have managed to find one another and form a kind of subculture. \"i was blown away by the amount of tattoos i viewed in the showers, \" said james peterson, 32, about his missionary training in provo, utah, in the late 1990s. When he went off on his mission to spain, he and other missionaries would trade issues of tattoo magazines, taking care to cut out images of topless women or devils. Not only has mr.

The rapidly growing religion counts more than six million members in the united states ( 30 percent of them in utah ), and individuals have long had to balance tradition with a desire to fit in with the culture at large.

        "summary": "There's never been a better time to buy weed in oregon, or a worse time to be a small grower or dispensary owner. Across the state, marijuana dispensaries have slashed weed prices in half to $ 700 per pound, or about $ 4 or $ 5 per gram, simply to get the stuff off shelves, and some are still struggling. The problem, reports the willamette week, is there are too many recreational cannabis growers — 963 as of this month, with another 910 awaiting approval by the oregon liquor control commission — who are too good at their jobs. Last year, oregon growers produced 1.1 million pounds of cannabis flower, three times what was consumed. As a result, a man who invested $ 250,000 in an indoor marijuana farm, dreaming of returns of $ 1,500 per pound, was forced to sell his bud at an auction. Buyer's price: $ 100 per pound. \" currently, we're operating at a $ 15,000-per-month loss, \" the man says. It's a trend seen across the state, leaving small growers with few options. They can cut their losses ( a federal ban on weed means bankruptcy is out of the question ), sell to out-of-state investors or large operations, or sell their product illegally across state lines. Two dozen people in the industry told the week that legalizing such sales would solve everything. Others believe the olcc should limit grower licenses — it says it doesn't have that authority — or crop size. A third option is to let commercialism do its thing. That's not the choice of oregon's top federal prosecutor, though. \" we have an identifiable and formidable marijuana overproduction and diversion problem \" and \" we're going to do something about it, \" us attorney billy williams said earlier this year, per the ap.",

That's because the cracker barrel visit marked not only ray's 81st birthday, but the couple's completion of \" something no one had knowingly ever done before, \" per usa today. It was a trip that carried them 5 million miles over 40 years. The goal: visit every single cracker barrel in the us.

And we thought we'd do this and it would be fun, \" says ray. \" for little farm kids, it's been very exciting for us, \" he adds, per people. The visits began accidentally in nashville decades ago, and ray, who made a living delivering rvs across the country, \" wasn't too impressed quite at first, \" he says, per usa today. But \" it didn't take long before i knew it was my home away from home. \" the couple eventually decided to visit every cracker barrel across 44 states and had been to 600 by 2015. Their mission was then halted when wilma suffered a brain aneurysm on the road.

Gulla, who was an afghan refugee of about 12 years old when war photographer steve mccurry photographed her in 1984 in a pakistan refugee camp, has been the target of a two-year investigation, the investigator says.

When it emerged last year that gulla allegedly had a fake card, the investigator says, she went into hiding and a few officials were fired for giving her the card. Mccurry had actually tracked gulla down in 2002, finding her living back in afghanistan at the time with her husband and three daughters.",

For years, millions of visitors drawn to the peculiar beauty of joshua tree national park have stayed on the straight and narrow while hiking the steep and twisty trails: picking up their trash and heeding authorities ' pleas to leave the park's granite monoliths and blooming desert floor unmolested. But in recent months the park has been hit with an unusual scourge of graffiti. This week, the escalating problem prompted park rangers to close a large area of the attraction because of widespread graffiti found in a popular canyon. That came on the heels of the closure of another part of the park after it also had been defaced. More than 300 acres are shut to visitors while officials investigate. \" people are appalled and people are wondering how it could happen here, in a national park, \" said pat pilcher, a ranger at joshua tree.

Most of the park, which sits 140 miles east of los angeles at the crossroads of the mojave and colorado deserts, is still open.

And perhaps it won't at all. Sources say the fbi's office of professional responsibility has recommended mccabe be fired over the findings of a still-unreleased inspector general's review of mccabe's actions ahead of the 2016 election, including his decision to allow fbi officials to discuss an investigation of the clinton foundation with reporters, the new york times reports. Mccabe was found to have not been forthcoming in the investigation into those actions, reports the washington post, citing people familiar with the matter, leading to the recommendation. They say attorney general jeff sessions has yet to make a decision, which mccabe could appeal. Still, doj sources expect the 21-year fbi veteran to be fired by friday, putting his pension at risk. Such a move would be controversial, not just because mccabe would be the first deputy director fired in fbi history, the times reports. The post points out that going against the recommendation for termination would be no less controversial, since some might interpret it as the justice department \" unfairly protecting mccabe. \" president trump is no fan of mccabe: in addition to suggesting donations to his wife's unsuccessful campaign for state senate in virginia by a political committee run by terry mcauliffe, an ally of hillary clinton, are evidence of bias, per politico, trump has previously called for mccabe's ouster and attacked him for \" racing the clock to retire with full benefits. \"",

But now two imperial college london researchers have proposed his vertigo and subsequent personality changes may have been the result of mini-strokes, the afp reports. The study in neurological sciences posits that even though a series of small cardiovascular failures makes more sense than the prevailing epilepsy theory, the explanation has been widely ignored \" on the grounds that until his death he was supposedly otherwise physically well during both private and stately affairs. \" in addition to caesar's reported physical symptoms — including the vertigo and headaches, as well as \" giddiness and insensibility \" — the researchers note a seemingly significant change in the roman statesman's mental state as the years went on: he apparently suffered from depression, which they believe may have been caused by stroke-induced brain damage. The scientists point out research suggesting both caesar's father and another relative died suddenly while putting their shoes on, and that \" even if caesar participated in an active lifestyle and may have benefited from a mediterranean diet, there is the added possibility of genetic predisposition toward cardiovascular disease, \" per the guardian.

Dumped the girl he initially chose, becca kufrin, and got engaged to runner-up lauren burnham — to subside. Now, however, thanks to kufrin's stint as the current bachelorette and a new profile on luyendyk in gq, \" the most hated bachelor in america \" is back in the spotlight. Rebecca nelson spent two days in scottsdale, ariz., with the 36-year-old and burnham, a \" reserved \" 26-year-old, and luyendyk insists he was made into a villain by the crew and feels \" 100 % \" betrayed. He's especially irked about the supposedly unedited footage of his breakup with kufrin, which he says was more staged than suggested. Viewers had raged that luyendyk wouldn't leave after kufrin told him to. \" it was completely edited, \" he says. \" i was told to stay on that couch. I tried to leave, and then production was like, ' you need to go back inside. ' \" still, luyendyk understands the producers ' role ( \" it's their job to make it entertaining for people \" ), and the rest of nelson's stay involved tagging along with the couple as they went house hunting, hearing about how luyendyk ended up on the show in the first place in 2011 — he was a fill-in for a last-minute dropout — and learning about luyendyk's thought process as he struggled to choose between two women. Nelson's visit with the couple didn't end on a great note: after a one-on-one with burnham in which nelson revealed to burnham ( who hadn't watched the finale ) about a comment kufrin had made about how she'd \" challenge [ luyendyk ] a lot more \" than burnham, nelson got a text from luyendyk. \" i don't know how the conversation went on your end but lauren is really upset, \" he wrote. \" i think our interview is done. \" ( read the full story here. )",

The statement, posted on islamic militant websites, suggested al-qaeda was trying to co-opt the wave of angry protests over the anti-islamic movie whose trailer surfaced this week. The statement said the killing of ambassador chris stevens was \" the best example \" for protesters. Most cities around the muslim world reported a calm day, however, after the deadly protests spread to more than 20 countries yesterday. In egypt, for example, police cleared out protesters who had been clashing with security forces for days near the us embassy, and they also cleared tahrir square. One exception to the quiet: riot police clashed with about 200 protesters at the us consulate in sydney, australia. President obama, meanwhile, said in his weekly radio address that while he respected all faiths and condemned the denigration of islam, \" there is never any justification for violence ( and ) there is no excuse for attacks on our embassies and consulates. \"",

Now comes the political dissection, as analysts ask what his unconventional campaign meant: the root of cain's popularity was his campaign's \" simplicity and unconventionality, \" says chris cillizza at the washington post. His tax plan was easy and \" seemed to make sense, \" and reinforced his unique, off-beat approach. \" the republican base, sick of politics-as-usual as practiced by both parties in washington, loved cain's i-am-not-a-politician riff, \" said cillizza. Cain's relentless focus on the economy is what fueled his brief success, writes john hinderaker at power line. His fall from grace because of personal improprieties is exactly what democrats want to do with any republican candidate because \" they know they can't win a debate on the economy or on president obama's record. \" on the other hand, jonathan martin at politico says that the lesson of cain is that even the country's deep hatred of washington is not enough for an outsider to win a party's nomination. \" gop primary voters are indicating that they'd prefer an insider who's competent than someone from outside the establishment who may not be up to the task of taking on president obama, \" writes martin.

Barring an agreement, reid is threatening to detonate a change to senate rules that would allow cabinet-level and other presidential appointees ( though not judges ) to be confirmed by a simple majority vote, not the current de facto threshold of 60 votes. Republicans are threatening to call reid the worst senate leader in history if he does it.

            "The theatrics reached a new crescendo thursday when majority leader harry m. Reid ( d-nev. ) and minority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) confronted each other over reid's effort to change the filibuster rules in ways that would strip the gop's ability to block confirmation of executive branch nominees and that could ultimately weaken the minority party's ability to slow the majority agenda. Reid's move provoked some of the most personal attacks two senate leaders have leveled against another in decades; reid described mcconnell as untrustworthy, while mcconnell countered that the nevada democrat would go down in history as the worst senate leader ever. Suddenly, the world's greatest deliberative body just isn't that much fun anymore. \"i miss it like an abscessed tooth, \" former senator christopher s. Bond ( r-mo. ), a 24-year veteran, said on a recent visit to the capitol",
            "The once-collegial relationship between harry reid and mitch mcconnell has collapsed into a free-for-all of name-calling, finger-pointing and mutual mistrust. The enmity manifested itself in a private confrontation on the senate floor last month in which mcconnell needled reid over a super pac — run by the senate majority leader's former aides — that attacked the gop leader over the kentucky airwaves.

The canadian dad of three says he's cajoled every couple of weeks to take his little ones to mcdonald's, and he figures he's forked over hundreds of dollars on happy meals. Now he's suing the fast-food empire, citing a quebec ban on marketing to kids under the age of 13, the bbc reports. It's not so much the fries and nuggets that are firing up bramante's beef with the restaurant: per ctv, it's the fact that each happy meal comes with a toy, often tied to film franchises like transformers or my little pony, and his kids are constantly haranguing him to go to mcdonald's so they can get all the toys to finish off each set. Bramante also claims the restaurant targets kids by putting the happy meal toys right in their sightline inside the restaurant. It's a practice, bramante says in his class-action suit, that's \" to the detriment of vulnerable consumers, their children, and their families. \" the quebec marketing law, not seen much elsewhere in the world, has just three exceptions: ads in kids magazines, promos for certain children's events, and ads that appear on a company's packaging and labels, and in their windows and displays. Mcdonald's says it's poring over the suit, but it adds \" we do not believe this class action has merit. \" bramante's lawyer says anyone who purchased a happy meal in quebec for a child under 13 from november 2013 onward can join the suit, which is seeking compensatory and punitive damages; it's unclear whether the consumer would need to be a canadian citizen.

        "summary": "Good news for followers of an indian guru who fought to keep his body on ice: a court on wednesday ruled that the remains of ashutosh maharaj can remain in a freezer, agence-france press reports. Punjabi followers of maharaj dispute the idea that he died of a heart attack in 2014 and instead say he is in a deep meditative state called samadhi. His well-heeled sect — divya jyoti jagriti sansthan, or divine light awakening — counts millions of followers around the globe. A man claiming to be the maharaj's son, dalip kumar jha, petitioned the high court three years ago to allow him to cremate the body according to hindi tradition. The ruling overturns a lower court that sided with jha, ordering the body removed from the commercial freezer at his heavily guarded punjabi ashram, per the bbc. Jha's lawyer tells afp it was unclear whether the court agreed maharaj was still alive, but he said they will appeal to the supreme court. Disciples of maharaj, who say he often meditated in sub-zero himalayan temperatures, are waiting for him to return to life. But jha and the guru's driver contend followers are using the body as a cover to keep control of maharaj's substantial assets. The guru founded the sect in 1983 in a quest for \" self-awakening and global peace \" and along the way built an empire with properties worth $ 120 million in india, the us, and several other countries.",

Dems are telling republicans they should follow reagan's lead in fiscal responsibility, circulating a 1987 radio address in which reagan slammed brinksmanship and stressed that the us had a \" special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations, \" the huffington post reports.

Siberia hadn't had an anthrax outbreak since 1941. But, according to nbc news, approximately 1,500 reindeer have been killed by the bacterium since sunday and 13 members of the nomadic nenet community have been hospitalized. Four of those who have been hospitalized are children. Authorities believe the new outbreak started when the carcass of an infected reindeer, frozen for decades, thawed during the yamolo-nenets region's unusually warm summer. Temperatures have risen to highs of 95 degrees this summer — nearly 20 degrees above the average. Authorities in the area ceased vaccinating reindeer against anthrax a decade ago because it had been more than 50 years since an outbreak. But scientists estimate the bacterium can survive being frozen in siberia's permafrost for more than a century. A state of emergency has been declared in the region. Dozens of people are being relocated, and the nenet community, which relies on herding reindeer, may be quarantined until september.

Remembering john f. Kennedy lane's book sparked theories that jfk was killed as part of a conspiracy — something the house committee on assassinations admitted was likely true in 1979.

While the judge recognized the woman's right to live her own life independently, \" it is lawful and in her best interests for her to be fed, forcibly if necessary. \" the woman, a former medical student, has not eaten any solid food in more than a year, and now has a body-mass index of just 11.3 ( normal is about 20, while less than 15 is considered severely underweight ), according to the telegraph.

        "summary": "A sweeping, seven-year investigation by britain into its decision to join the us in the iraq war is out, and \" scathing \" is beginning to sound like an understatement. The report by sir john chilcot faults every aspect of the decision by tony blair's government, reports the telegraph. \" it is now clear that policy on iraq was made on the basis of flawed intelligence and assessments, \" said chilcot as the report was released. \" they were not challenged, and they should have been. \" he said the uk went to war before exhausting \" peaceful options, \" adding that \" military action at that time was not a last resort. \" after that, britain bungled the post-war strategy as blair overestimated his ability to influence george w. Bush, says the report. \" i will be with you whatever, \" he had written to bush in a 2002 note. The ap points out one key aspect of the report: it will not make a finding on whether the invasion was legally justified. That's likely to disappoint critics of the war, who were hoping blair would face prosecution on war crimes. The report does accuse blair and his team of making a case against saddam \" with a certainty that was not justified, \" specifically in regard to weapons of mass destruction. Blair himself reacted on wednesday: \" whether people agree or disagree with my decision to take military action against saddam hussein, i took it in good faith and in what i believed to be the best interests of the country. \" a link to the full report can be found here. Both the new york times and the washington post point out that at more than 2 million words, it's much longer than war and peace.",

They declined to confirm reports that he shouted \" heil hitler. \" cross — who also uses the name frazier glenn miller — tried to buy radio ads denouncing jews and the federal government during a 2010 write-in campaign for the us senate from missouri. \" we've sat back and allowed the jews to take over our government, our banks, and our media, \" one ad said. In a 2010 interview with howard stern, cross accused jews of \" committing genocide against the white race \" and said adolf hitler was \" the greatest man who ever walked the earth, \" the new york times finds. Asked who he hated more, jewish people or african americans, cross responded, \" jews. A thousand times more. Compared to our jewish problem, all other problems are mere distractions. \" the anti-defamation league described the shootings as a \" cowardly, unspeakable and heinous act of violence. \" while it is too early to call the shootings a hate crime, \" the fact that two jewish institutions were targeted by the same individual just prior to the start of the passover holiday is deeply troubling and certainly gives us pause, \" the group's regional director said in a statement.

William lewis corporon, who died at the scene, and his 14-year-old grandson, reat griffin underwood, who died at the hospital, the ap reports.

Gwinnett county police department officer antwan toney was called to investigate a suspicious vehicle saturday afternoon near a middle school and was fatally shot while approaching the car. Police say maynard, 18, is believed to have fired the shot; he was with isaiah pretlow, 19, at the time. Pretlow was arrested late saturday night and charged with aggravated assault. Maynard was found hiding in a wooden shed monday morning, about one mile from where toney was shot, after police received a tip. Police say he was armed with a lawnmower blade and that he was shot and killed by police after he refused to obey their commands, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. Toney, a california native, had just turned 30 days before his death, 11 alive reports; he was just six days away from his third anniversary with the department when he was killed. \" the people that worked with him on a daily basis recalled a very jovial person who was dedicated to his job and dedicated to his community, \" police chief butch ayers said, per wsb-tv. It's not clear why shots were fired. An anonymous 911 caller reported people inside the vehicle were smoking pot; no words were exchanged before toney, who was accompanied by another officer, was shot. Pretlow allegedly crashed the vehicle and then fled on foot. ( the suspected south carolina cop killer had boasted of his gun skills. )",

Trump developed the apartment buildings in the 1990s.'trump place ' polling site irks new york city voters read more but equity residential, which owns the building, told the guardian that the trump signage would be removed – and the actual street names changed – because it would make the apartments more appealing to renters. \"we are in the process of rebranding the buildings using their street addresses as the property names, \" said marty mckenna, a spokesman for equity residential. \"the goal is to assume a more neutral building identity that will appeal to all current and future renters. \" an employee at the leasing office at 140 trump place said the work would begin on wednesday – just eight days after trump won the presidential election. The move comes after hundreds of residents signed a \"dump the trump name \" petition calling for \"trump \" to be removed from the buildings.

And since more than half committed rape as a teenager, it \" highlights the need to start working with younger boys and girls to stop the violence, \" she said. Options include changing social norms, cutting down on childhood violence, and prosecuting rapists. \" the fact that there is such variation \" by country, she says, \" highlights that it isn't inevitable and that there are things we can do to prevent it. \"",

Here's what people are saying: \" not only is this a deftly crafted and superbly acted film, but wadjda sheds a powerful light on what women face … in an oppressive regime, \" writes claudia puig at usa today. Yet it never becomes \" a sociological lecture. \" director haifaa al-mansour \" has crafted a vividly multidimensional film that sidesteps predictability. \" even once you've gotten over the novelty of the film's creation, you ' ll find \" that the pic transcends mere surprise value and delivers a winning, handsomely crafted story, \" writes jay weissberg at variety. Its pre-teen lead, waad mohammed, \" captivates with a palpable confidence: her t-shirt proudly proclaims, ' i am a great catch!, ' and she is. \" \" just seeing life in riyadh is a revelation, \" writes alan scherstuhl at the village voice. Al-mansour \" frames the city's slab-like structures … and then sets the kids loose to dash around and through them. \" wadjda is unflinching in its depiction of oppression, but its \" appreciation for the hopefulness of children keep[ s ] all this from becoming too grim to bear. \" but while the film's depictions of oppression are \" thoroughly involving, \" kenneth turan at the la times found the plot, which centers around the title character's quest to buy a bicycle, to be \" as standard as it sounds, \" and wadjda herself to be \" a cliché rebel. \" we're lucky to have the film, he writes, \" but it's hard not to wish the result was even better. \"",

        "summary": "The superheroes are back for round two in avengers: age of ultron, following 2012's well-reviewed original. If you're expecting just another action flick, you may be in for a surprise. Here's what critics are saying: \" as he did in the first avengers, writer-director joss whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book ­self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides, and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post. There are \" repetitive, too-long action sequences, \" but the \" flawlessly well-tuned ensemble \" of characters are well worth watching. Steven rea at the philadelphia inquirer agrees the best of the movie is showcased in the \" quieter moments, \" when the screenplay's humor comes alive. The theme of the flick is teamwork, but the movie is missing \" a sense of spontaneity \" because of all the filming in front of green screens and with body doubles, rea says. \" as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore. \" \" for those more concerned with what the avengers movies do best — outsize spectacle and wry comedy — age of ultron has to be declared a victory, \" john anderson writes at the wall street journal. Though its predecessor was often \" bogged down by narrative baggage, \" this flick is more \" buoyant \" and \" pretty amusing. \" a warning, though: the 3d is nothing special, anderson notes, adding that a scene of a falling manhattan skyscraper is \" beyond tasteless. \" none of that seems to bother colin covert at the minneapolis star-tribune. \" if future films are as well realized as ultron, that's fine by me, \" he writes. Viewers can laugh along with \" a remarkably good series of gags about thor's magical mallet \" as the movie \" builds to a bombastic finale, a limitless overstuffed smorgasbord of sky-high battle. It works, where michael bay's pointless transformers films and zack snyder's disappointing man of steel stumbled. \"",
