As cnn notes, trump said much the same last year, but the new assertions from him and giuliani hint at a developing legal strategy. Not that it's necessarily airtight: the network quotes legal experts who say that if collaboration with russians is eventually proven, conspiracy charges could result. As for giuliani, he now says that his long interviews monday on fox and cnn were his attempt to get out in front of a new york times story, reports the daily beast. Giuliani says reporters including maggie haberman were asking question about a supposed strategy meeting held two days before the famous trump tower meeting of 2016. Haberman isn't saying much about that: \" we don't talk about sourcing, and wouldn't now — but i have lost the thread of what the former mayor is talking about. \" ( michael cohen says trump himself knew of the trump tower meeting in advance. )",

            "Throughout monday, president donald trump's lawyer and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani went on a chaotic media tour, with each subsequent interview seeming to atone or clean up for a key element laid out in a previous appearance. In an interview with the daily beast on monday night, giuliani appeared to blame the maelstrom he kicked up on inquisitive new york times reporters who he suggested had compelled him to proactively spin a potentially damaging story that may or may not actually be real. Several veterans of the trump campaign, like much of the viewing public, were left befuddled. \"i don't know, man, \" one senior 2016 trump campaign aide simply messaged the daily beast when asked to deconstruct giuliani's performance. The day began with a morning interview with fox &amp; friends, during which giuliani insisted that \"collusion [ with russian election-meddlers ] is not a crime \" in the first place. He then headed to cnn where he proceeded to, ostensibly, break a bit of news about the infamous trump tower meeting that the president's son took with a russian lawyer reportedly tied to kremlin officials. Two days before that meeting, giuliani relayed, former trump attorney and fixer michael cohen claimed that there was a separate meeting"

Now she's seeking $ 75,000 from the state in damages, the arkansas democrat-gazette reports. Robin earnest, 46, sustained the injury in 2011 at college of the ouachitas and made her case before the arkansas claims commission on thursday. She told the commission that she's undergone years of emotional and mental distress, physical therapy, and surgeries as a result of the broken fingers. Not only that, she says, but her teacher neglected to abide by the rules of musical chairs when she had six people vie for two chairs during the \" motivation exercise. \" earnest claims she was pushed during the exercise and felt pain \" instantly \" when her hand slammed against a metal chair. The college paid earnest's medical bill at the time, and the teacher says earnest told her about two weeks later that she had injured her fingers again when a door slammed on them. But earnest and her husband — who receive federal disability and support their family with state payments — deny the door-slam story. The commission is yet to rule on her claim. On the lighter side, a youtube video of baby pygmy goats playing what looks like musical chairs on logs has gone viral, cbs news reports. And it appears no injuries were sustained during the game.",

That's the resolution on a new dark energy camera being built by fermilab just outside of chicago, reports npr. Comprised of 74 lenses up to three feet across, the dark energy camera weighs about a ton and will be installed later this year on the blanco telescope, high in the mountains of chile. \" with this camera we ' ll be able to go back about 6, 7 billion years, so about three-quarters to half-way back to the big bang, \" says brenna flaugher, one of the physicists working on the camera. The rate of our universe's expansion is speeding up, counter to einstein's theory of general relativity, and scientists think dark energy could be the reason for the strange effect. And while dark energy cannot be photographed directly, the dark energy camera can look into galaxies far, far away and long ago, gathering information about the universe's expansion. \" there's too much room for the theorists to come up with crazy ideas right now, \" said flaugher. \" and we need data. \" you can learn more about the camera and the search for dark energy at the dark energy survey website.",

Unfortunately, his greatest performance is one you ' ll likely never see, jason lynch writes for quartz. Lynch, the former tv editor for people, was one of the lucky reporters who got a sneak peak of happyish last month. That's the showtime series that was to show hoffman as a somewhat miserable nyc creative director with a much-younger ad-agency boss. \" the footage promised yet another classic hoffman performance, \" writes lynch, \" with a profane rant against social media and an uproarious hallucination involving a keebler elf. \" having seen just a glimpse, lynch pegged the performance — \" arguably his finest work yet \" — as one sure to bring hoffman emmys and golden globes. But he predicts that it's an artistic turn that will die with hoffman. Only one of the 10 episodes were shot, leaving showtime two options: air just the pilot, or move on. And in terms of moving on, lynch sees it as somewhat unlikely that showtime would find a replacement for hoffman, especially after a showtime exec previously admitted that it waited patiently for a long time to get hoffman to sign on. Lynch notes that hoffman will likely close out the last two hunger games films as head gamesmaker plutarch heavensbee, however. He had done all the shooting for mockingjay part 1 and all but seven days for part 2. Sources tell the hollywood reporter the november 2014 and 2015 release dates won't be altered.",

An international group of researchers looked at two datasets — one swedish and one american — and found that people who didn't drink coffee were 1.5 times more likely to develop ms than those who downed about four cups daily. The analysis of nearly 7,000 people echoes earlier research that mice, raised to get an ms-like illness, never developed it when given hefty doses of caffeine. Why caffeine? well, with ms, the immune system strikes nerve fibers by attacking a protective covering called myelin. And scientists believe that caffeine blocks a body chemical that allows immune cells into the central nervous system to crush myelin. Now, the caveats: the new study finds no causal link between caffeine and reducing the chances of ms, the la times notes. Further, it's based on self-reported coffee habits that date back 10 years and may be sketchy. \" i think from the ms perspective, there are too few data to support changing coffee intake at this time, \" says study leader ellen mowry. \" further research should be done... As it may lead to identifying new targets for [ ms ] treatment. \" on the bright side, she says, the two data sets came up with very similar results. Coffee has also been found to reduce the chance of skin cancer and breast cancer, yahoo reports, and a harvard study of over 130,000 volunteers found that even six cups daily led to no greater chance of dying.

And when he was online, he wrote about it. \" i always say how bullied i am, but no one listens, \" he wrote sept. 9. \" what do i have to do so people will listen to me? \" just over one week later, jamey was found dead outside his home of an apparent suicide. In the months prior, he routinely blogged about school bullying and thoughts of suicide in between upbeat posts about his pop star idol lady gaga and the ordinary types of teen rants typical for kids his age. On sept. 8, he wrote: \" no one in my school cares about preventing suicide, while you're the ones calling me [ gay slur ] and tearing me down. \" he put up a separate post that day letting everyone know it was national suicide prevention week. Then he posted the lyrics to a song by hollywood undead: i just wanna say good bye, disappear with no one knowing i don't wanna live this lie, smiling to the world unknowing i dont want you to try, you've done enough to keep me going i ' ll be fine, i ' ll be fine, i ' ll be fine for the very last time on saturday night, he posted a lyric from lady gaga's song \" the queen \" on his facebook page: \" don't forget me when i come crying to heaven's door. \" then around 1: 30 a.m. Sunday, jamey posted two final messages to his main public tumblr blog. One said he really wanted to see his great-grandmother, who had recently died, and one offered thanks to lady gaga. That was his last entry. \" he touched so many hearts, so many people, \" said his mother, tracy rodemeyer, who met with some of his grief-stricken friends at williamsville north on monday. \" i didn't realize how many people he touched. He was the sweetest, kindest kid you'd ever know. He would give all his heart to you before he gave any to himself. \" olivia rinaldo, an eighth-grader at heim middle school, said she was drawn to his outwardly upbeat and extroverted personality. He made friends of the friendless, she said. \" he was always putting people first, \""

Wade decision — and the fall appears to have a lot more to do with contraception and the economy than with state laws restricting abortion, a new study finds. Researchers say there were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2011, down a full 13 % from 2008 and only slightly higher than the rate after abortion was legalized in all 50 states 40 years ago, the washington post reports. The abortion rate has been in long-term decline from a peak of almost 30 per 1,000 women in 1981, though the fall stalled in the middle of the last decade, notes the new york times. The study's lead author says the decline is probably linked to the overall decline in pregnancy rates that happened during the recession, along with the growing use of near-foolproof long-term contraceptives like intrauterine devices. Anti-abortion activists, however, say the drop shows their lobbying efforts are working. The decline \" shows that women are rejecting the idea of abortion as the answer to an unexpected pregnancy, \" the president of the national right to life committee tells the ap.",

There were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2011, the latest year for which figures were available, according a paper published monday from the guttmacher institute, a pro-abortion-rights think tank. That is down 13 percent from 2008 and a little higher than the rate in 1973, when the supreme court handed down its landmark roe v. Wade decision. The study did not examine the reasons for the drop.

            "New york ( ap ) — the u.s. Abortion rate declined to its lowest level since 1973, and the number of abortions fell by 13 percent between 2008 and 2011, according to the latest national survey of abortion providers conducted by a prominent research institute. The guttmacher institute, which supports legal access to abortion, said in a report being issued monday that there were about 1.06 million abortions in 2011 — down from about 1.2 million in 2008. Guttmacher's figures are of interest on both sides of the abortion debate because they are more up-to-date and in some ways more comprehensive than abortion statistics compiled by the federal centers for disease control and prevention. According to the report, the abortion rate dropped to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2011, well below the peak of 29.3 in 1981 and the lowest since a rate of 16.3 in 1973. Guttmacher and other groups supporting abortion rights have been apprehensive about the recent wave of laws restricting abortion access that have been passed in republican-controlled legislatures.

        "summary": "Shaming women for breastfeeding in public is still more common than it should be, but jennifer howard likely didn't think it would happen in her own doctor's office. The salem statesman journal reports the 38-year-old oregon mom was at an appointment at salem clinic when it came time to feed her 3-month-old daughter, evelyn, and so she reached for the infant to feed her. That's when, she says, dr. Dennis barnett asked her if she had anything she could cover herself with, as the clinic had rules in place to keep staffers safe from lawsuits over inappropriate behavior. An \" embarrassed \" howard looked in her diaper bag and found a blanket, which she says the doctor helped her put in place before the feeding. \" it was humiliating and uncomfortable and i felt judged and shamed for trying to feed my baby, \" howard says, adding to koin that barnett could've left or asked for a nurse. Breastfeeding in public is legal in oregon; the american medical association does recommend doctors use a chaperone during certain exams to avoid problems. Howard says she called the clinic back later to ask about its breastfeeding policy ( she says she was told there was none ), filed a complaint with the oregon medical board, and asked the clinic if she could switch doctors. The clinic sent her a letter denying that request, and howard took her complaint to social media, which quickly went viral and ended up making national newscasts. A petition calling for barnett's firing has so far gathered more than 18,000 signatures, though howard tells the statesman journal she hadn't known about it ahead of time and doesn't endorse it. She just wants the clinic to say it's sorry and to train staff to not shame breastfeeding moms in the future.",

But re/code reports that the company isn't happy and is working on modifications ahead of next year's launch to try to extend the time between charges. \" it's a little surprising to me, \" one analyst tells the wall street journal. \" i thought they were targeting at least a couple of days of usage. \" in an otherwise positive review of the $ 349 watch at the guardian, charles arthur says that while people are used to charging their phones every night, this might be different. \" fashionable or not, a watch that needs constant recharging isn't a watch, it's a burden, \" he writes. \" on such seeming irrelevances may hang its success. \" on that fashionable note, leonid bershidsky at bloomberg writes that the watch isn't merely non-geeky, it's downright beautiful. But we're not sure how steve jobs would feel about this line from the financial writer: \" apple established itself as the world's biggest fashion company by releasing a smartwatch that is more about beauty and variety than about technology. \" ( apple pay, meanwhile, is getting rave reviews. )",

Her daughter, now almost 6, ended up being born with cystic fibrosis, and evans has filed a so-called \" wrongful birth \" lawsuit against her healthcare practitioners, claiming she's due almost $ 14.5 million in damages since the care team didn't diagnose the girl's condition and, thus, evans didn't have a chance to terminate the pregnancy, the ap reports. Evans filed the lawsuit in 2011, but a montana jury just heard opening arguments in the case wednesday. As the bozeman daily chronicle reported earlier this week, evans ' lawyer says the little girl is the \" love of [ evans ' ] life, \" and the mom is suing to \" make her child's life as happy as possible. \" of the damages evans seeks, $ 10 million is for the girl's medical and psychological care; she's said to have a \" severe form \" of the inherited disease, in which mucus-producing cells produce a thick, sticky fluid that hurts the lungs and digestive system. Nowadays, treatment has improved to the point that life expectancy for patients is nearing 40: \" it's far from the death sentence or life not worth living that some would have you believe, \" an attorney for one of the healthcare practitioners told the jury. The lawyers for the care team say evans only asked about down syndrome, and that a doctor did talk to her about cystic fibrosis, but she turned down a blood test that would have told her if she was a carrier. \" dr. Peters did not give ( the girl ) cystic fibrosis, \" another attorney told the jury. \" she was either going to be born with cystic fibrosis or ( she ) was not going to be born. \" ( here's why another couple also sued for wrongful birth. )",

( ap ) — a montana mother is suing her health care providers because they failed to diagnose her unborn daughter's cystic fibrosis, denying her a chance to have an abortion. Kerrie evans of gardiner is seeking nearly $ 14.5 million in damages from park clinic in livingston, billings clinic's bozeman ob/gyn, nurse practitioner peggy scanson and dr. William peters — including $ 10 million for her daughter's medical and psychological care. The girl, nearly 6, has a severe form of cystic fibrosis and one medication needed to treat it costs up to $ 300,000 a year, court records said. The case lays bare an emerging medical ethics struggle. Lawsuits dealing with so-called wrongful births were recently before judges in washington state and oregon, while a dozen states prohibit such legal claims. Evans filed the lawsuit in october 2011, arguing that scanson should have given evans a blood test to determine if she was a carrier of cystic fibrosis, under the recommended standard of care.

Among them: survey students anonymously on sexual assault, do a better job of keeping reported assaults confidential, and teach witnesses how to intervene. President obama, joe biden, and celebrities will appear in a psa \" to help enlist men as allies, \" the report says, per the washington post. For now, the guidelines are just recommendations, but the new york times expects the white house to call on congress to pass legislation that would make them enforceable. Biden says it's time to stop \" turning a blind eye \" to sexual assault, which the task force says 20 % of female students experience. Only 12 % of those crimes are reported, however, the report adds. In tandem with the report, the white house has launched notalone.gov, which \" will help students wade through often complicated legal definitions and concepts, and point them toward people who can give them confidential advice — and those who can't. \" ( the president of dartmouth recently confronted the \" extreme behavior \" at his institution. )",

Less than two months ago, another male died at ol pejeta, which calls the near-extinction of the species — for which poaching is largely to blame — \" a sorry testament to the greed of the human race. \" officials at the conservancy say the male rhino's sperm count is too low for there to be a chance of the species reproducing naturally again, and the only hope now is to try in vitro fertilization and to save genetic material in the hope that that future technology can resurrect the species, the ap reports.

In what gizmodo uk calls the \" corporate holy grail \" of customer-tailored service, the electronics manufacturer has come out with a clothes-cleaner that has a setting specifically for washing out curry stains, the bbc reports. The stainmaster's \" curry \" button, designed after customers pleaded for a way to wash clean from clothing all signs of the popular dish, was developed after two years of research into what the best combo of water temperature and time was for such a task. The machine runs $ 330 or so, or about 10 % more than similar units without the curry-scrubbing capability. Other cycles on the india-targeted stainmaster include ones for \" sauces, \" \" sweat, \" and \" oil \" ( the bbc notes that's for hair oil ), as well as a setting to wash one's \" daily sari. \" the independent notes the product launch is a way for panasonic to make more of a push into the indian market, where currently only 10 % of homes are said to have a washing machine. The company hints it may also be working on stain-fighting washers based on other asian countries'specific needs. The telegraph points out indian-food lovers around the globe are also clamoring for such an appliance. \" why only for the indian market? i want one of these! \" writes one twitter user.

Researchers who tested samples from six streams around the maryland city found them tainted with \" amphetamine concentrations are high enough to alter the base of the aquatic food web, \" per a press release. The drugs got there after they were flushed down the toilet by users either purposefully or, er, naturally. Limited filtering systems at wastewater treatment plants or \" leaks in the sewer \" enable the release of the drugs into the environment, researcher emma rosi-marshall tells cnn. The victims? any living presence in those streams from moss to water bugs — and the creatures that eat them like fish and birds. A 2014 study found that meds flushed into the environment could be causing a global wildlife crisis, reported the guardian. What's new about this study, explain the researchers, is that \" few [ others ] have examined the ecological effects of illicit drugs \"; they describe amphetamine, which is used to treat adhd, as a \" potentially illicit drug. \" in order to measure the impact of the drugs they detected, the researchers created an artificial stream and laced it with the same levels of drugs they found in nature. Within weeks, insects showed signs of altered development and drugs suppressed the growth of biofilms, the organisms that coat rocks, the authors write in the journal environmental science and technology. The study underscores the importance of investing in \" our aging underground water infrastructure, \" says rosi-marshall. ( microbes may be doing something wild in our sewage. )",

The more active option: conducting airstrikes against the islamic state extremists who've camped out at the base of the mountain. A decision from the oval office is expected \" imminently, \" says a second white house source, adding, \" this could be a fast-moving train. \" obama reportedly instructed the pentagon to draw up a game plan for possible military action during a meeting with his national security team today, notes nbc news. Iraqi airdrops to the refugees earlier this week fell short, with water and milk bottles smashing to bits, according to the post. \" is help coming? \" one of the trapped yazidi asked the post when contacted on his cellphone. \" i ' m standing here next to an old lady and a child lying on the ground. They are not dead, but we fear they are dying. \" unicef says it has received reports that 40 children have perished already on the mountain.",

Researchers behind a new study in the journal preventing chronic disease came up with the stat after crunching the numbers on deaths of people ages 20 to 64 from 2006 through 2010. The figure includes both direct causes — car crashes, alcohol poisoning, drunken violence — as well as longer-term health problems linked to excessive drinking, reports usa today. Binge drinking, defined as four drinks at one sitting for women and five for men, played a particularly big role in the deaths. All those lives cut short translates into 2.5 million lost years annually, reports the daily beast. The vast majority of those who die prematurely are men, at 71 %. \" we're talking about a large economic impact, people who are contributing to society, \" says the author of the cdc study. \" a lot of attention we tend to focus on is maybe college drinking or just drunk driving.

The study, published in the journal of adolescent health, surveyed 483 women in the freshman class of an unnamed college in upstate new york. Among the specifics: 9 % reported an attempted or completed forcible rape; 15.4 % reported an attempted or completed rape while incapacitated. Some women reported multiple events. 18 % had suffered an incapacitated rape or attempt since age 14 and before college; that number was 15 % for forcible rape or attempt. By sophomore year, those numbers were 26 % and 22 %, respectively. Women who were raped before college were more likely to be raped in their freshman year, notes medical news today. All told, 37 % reported at least one rape or attempted rape between age 14 and sophomore year. \" if you swap in any other physically harmful and psychologically harmful event, a prevalence of 15 % would be just unacceptably high, \" says carey. \" if 15 % of our young people were breaking their legs in their first year of school, we would expect that the community would enhance the safety of the environment. \" ( meanwhile, emma sulkowicz, who carried a mattress around columbia university this year in protest of the school's decision not to kick out her alleged rapist, took her mattress to graduation. )",

This is because those youtubers aren't creating content that is \" family friendly. \" since the content isn't \" family friendly, \" creators find their videos \" de-monetized, \" or without ads. They find themselves demontized because the companies that provide youtube with ads became upset when they found that many of their ads were being showcased on videos that promoted racism. Youtube isn't handling the problems their creators are being exposed to, and this generates conversation among youtubers. Now, many of them have lost hope in the company itself.

Kelly is not alone. Former communications director hope hicks was hacked when she was at the white house, and the obama administration was hacked as well, by russians. The white house has tried to get staff to put down their cell phones with mixed results, and they've been unable to convince president trump to stop using his phone. The president reportedly continues to use an unsecured commercial cell phone. Some of the hacking may be originating near the white house, reports the washington post: a government study found \" signs \" of sophisticated surveillance equipment near the while house grounds capable of accessing personal cell phone data.",

A department of homeland security program discovered evidence of the surveillance devices, called imsi catchers, as part of federal testing last year, according to a letter from dhs to sen. Ron wyden ( d-ore. ) on may 22. The letter didn't specify what entity operated the devices and left open the possibility that there could be alternative explanations for the suspicious cellular signals collected by the federal testing program last year. The discovery bolsters years of independent research suggesting that foreign intelligence agencies use sophisticated interception technology to spy on officials working within the hub of federal power in the nation's capital. Experts in surveillance technology say that imsi catchers — sometimes known by one popular brand name, stingray — are a standard part of the tool kit for many foreign intelligence services, including for such geopolitical rivals as russia and china. A dhs spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter to wyden but declined further comment. \" this admission from dhs bolsters my concern about stingrays and other spying devices being used to spy on americans ' phones, \" wyden said in a statement on thursday. \" given the reports of rogue spying devices being identified near the white house and other government"

Yes, it turns out there is a right and wrong way to pet a cat, per a study published in applied animal behaviour science in late 2014. As the researchers from uk's university of lincoln note in their abstract, \" as part of its role as a pet, cats are expected to not only tolerate but enjoy being touched. \" they set out to determine how one should best do that via two experiments, which zeroed in on \" handler familiarity, \" the cats ' various body regions, and the order in which they were touched. The upshot: leave the tail alone. That \" caudal \" region returned the most negative scores regardless of how familiar the petter was. The washington post explains the tail area \" is sort of a cat erogenous zone, and petting may overstimulate it. \" it further points to a 2002 study that echoes that caudal finding and says that petting in the temporal region ( between the eyes and ears ) was most preferable. As for whether you start with the ears or the back, the study showed the order of body region touched didn't really matter. One odd finding that needs further investigating, per the researchers: negative responses were higher when owners, not strangers, stroked the cats. University of lincoln researchers have examined the topic before: in a 2013 study they found that cats who dislike being petted but allow their owners to do so may be stressed out.

            "Stroking could stress out your cat a new study by an international team of animal behaviour specialists suggests that cats who reluctantly allow their owners to stroke them could be more stressed out than moggies who carefully avoid being petted.the surprise conclusion arose in a study conducted by researchers from the university of lincoln, uk, university of sao paulo, brazil, and university of veterinary medicine, austria, which aimed to better understand how cats cope with living alongside humans and other felines in a single household.although many people consider cats to be solitary creatures, the collaborative research, published in the journal physiology and behavior and presented to an international audience in portugal in september 2013, revealed that cats can live happily together in groups, and that the number of cats is not necessarily a problem.sponsored by ceva animal health, the scientists examined cats living alone, in pairs and in groups of three or four in the home, assessing levels of stress hormones on four occasions.although the number of cats in the home did not predict background stress levels, the researchers found that younger cats ( less than two years old ) living on their own were more stressed than younger ones living in the larger groups.evidence was also found to suggest that the owner's urge to pet their cat may be a stressful experience.professor daniel mills, professor of veterinary behavioural medicine at the university",

In a study published in the journal of vertebrate paleontology, scientists from the university of queensland and james cook university report on their findings along the northwestern dampier peninsula, just north of broome, with more than 400 hours of work turning up six types each of sauropods and armored dinosaur tracks, five kinds of tracks from predatory dinosaurs, and four from ornithopods. They're said to be the biggest prints ever found — abc australia notes some sauropod tracks are as long as 6 feet — and include the \" only confirmed evidence for stegosaurs \" on the continent. Ironically, because some of the prints were so huge, researchers think they may not have been recognized as tracks. Industry nearly put the discovery in peril: in 2008, the regional government picked out the area to serve as a natural gas processing site, a move that received pushback from members of the aboriginal goolarabooloo community, who say the tracks form a \" songline \" that document how a \" creator-being \" named marala once traversed the landscape. The area was eventually deemed a national heritage site in 2011 and the gas project was nixed. Steven salisbury, lead author of the study, says most dinosaur fossils have turned up on the eastern side of australia and were up to 115 million years old, a press release notes. These new prints were found in rocks dating up to 140 million years ago. ( see one of the \" saddest \" dinosaur fossils ever unearthed. )",

The mass grave is one of only a very few of the hundreds from the war that have been excavated. Only 16 of the bodies — and none of the preserved brains — from the la pedraja grave have been identified. There are a number of reasons behind the \" exceptional finding \" of the preserved brains, including the weather and manner of death. Cnn reports it was colder and more rainy than normal when the victims were executed. Bullet holes in the skulls allowed rain water to seep in, but the skulls themselves kept the acidic soil away from the brains. This aided a process called \" saponification, \" in which tissue turns soap-like. While most other body tissues decomposed, the brains were preserved. Also preserved: the heart of a single victim, which serrulla says is unprecedented.

But the deal almost certainly won't bring back the \" talking filibuster, \" which would force legislators to actually hold forth jimmy stewart-style to delay legislation — indeed, senators won't even have to be present to block a vote. And democrats will still need 60 votes to actually pass bills. But some are optimistic nonetheless. \" i think this would be a real boost towards ending the gridlock which has bedeviled us, \" says carl levin.",

Google launched a new service thursday called google shopping express that will let consumers in the san francisco area order items online from nine big retailers including target, walgreens and office depot, and schedule to have them delivered later that same day. Those living in the bay area can sign up to be one of a limited number of beta testers for the service. If accepted, you ' ll receive six months of free deliveries. Retailers can also apply now to be part of the service — those who are accepted must supply google with a daily feed of data indicating which items are currently in stock in stores. Techcrunch reported earlier this month that google was planning to launch a same-day delivery service, noting that it would cost about $ 64-$ 69 a year to sign up. However, a source familiar with google's plans tells mashable that there is no pricing plan in place yet. The company intends to price the service low enough that it becomes \" an everyday possibility \" for consumers, according to the source, but that price may depend on how users engage with the service. One thing that is set in stone, though, is that there will be no surcharge for delivery on top of the membership fee for the service."

Before the check ceremony, reddick says she confronted macinnis and asked him to admit they'd never agreed to split the winnings, but he wouldn't — so after they were presented with the giant symbolic check, a \" visibly upset \" reddick started going off on her nephew in front of the cameras, per the cape breton post. \" i ' ll never speak to him, in this lifetime or the next, \" she says, per the province. Commenters on the fundraiser's facebook page don't seem sympathetic to reddick, with many calling her \" greedy. \" meanwhile, a dalhousie university law professor tells the cbc because of the amount of the prize, any legal claim would have to go through the nova scotia supreme court, could cost both sides \" tens of thousands of dollars, \" and may take years to settle.",

The incident started with a $ 1.50 bet on the game call of duty, according to krebsonsecurity. One gamer threatened to swat another, and the second dared someone to swat him, tweeting a fake address. The first gamer tweeted thursday that \" that kids house that i swatted is on the news, \" adding: \" i didn't get anyone killed because i didn't discharge a weapon and being a swat member isn't my profession. \" the second gamer tweeted: \"someone tried to swat me and got an innocent man killed. \" the first gamer reportedly confessed to krebsonsecurity. He reportedly says that while he \" of course \" feels bad, \" he won't turn himself in because he's \" too scared. \" police are investigating the swatting angle.

How it came to be is a fascinating tale recounted by the jewish telegraphic agency roughly one year after the mazal holocaust collection found its current home at the university of colorado boulder. Harry mazal's family came to mexico city from turkey before wwii began, and he explained in a 2009 podcast that after his retirement 20 years prior he settled in san antonio, where \" i bought my first computer and learned how to go online to the famous bulletin boards. \" it's there that mazal, born to jewish parents who weren't particularly religious, encountered holocaust deniers. Dumbfounded by their stance, \" i started buying books and reading them... And responding to these idiot bulletin boards. \" the self-described \" compulsive \" mazal amassed aerial photos of the camps, nuremberg trial transcripts, and nazi newspapers, ultimately constructing a 3,000-square-foot home addition to store it all in. But as jta explains, two 2011 events shook up the collection, thought to be worth $ 1.5 million: mazal died that august at the age of 74, putting the archive in the hands of his family. Seven months prior, in january, a collection volunteer named mansal denton was arrested for stealing 17,000 pages of documents. Denton was sentenced to 8 years in prison last june, but jta sees the theft as \" [ underscoring ] the need to find a proper home for the collection \" — a home his daughter settled on after meeting david shneer, who directs the university's program in jewish studies. A sad footnote: my san antonio reported on a suit filed against denton by mazal's widow in late 2011 that noted mazal \" spent his final months in anguish \" over the theft.",

The signature, which adorns a 70-year-old leniency plea for top nazi hermann goering during the postwar nuremberg trials, is one of some 500,000 discrete items and 20,000 books donated last year to the university of colorado at boulder — nearly the entirety of one of the world's largest privately owned holocaust collections. The unusual trove includes aerial surveillance photos of the auschwitz-birkenau extermination camp, decaying copies of the nazi newspaper der sturmer, nuremberg trial transcripts, and a trove of pro-nazi and holocaust denial literature. \"we don't even know what we have, \" said david shneer, director of the jewish studies program at university of colorado at boulder and the person responsible for bringing the archive to the university. \"we have teams of students inventorying it. We hope to get through everything by the fall. \" the unlikely story of how the archive, known as the mazal holocaust collection, ended up in boulder is a tale of holocaust denial, a hidden",
            "Page 1 of 1 harry mazal is shown in 2001 with some of the 14,000 books he had collected for his personal holocaust library. Fighting cancer and reeling from the recent pilfering of his life's work, internationally known holocaust researcher harry mazal spent his last months \"devastated, despondent and consumed with stress and anxiety, \" according to court documents filed this week. The lawsuit, initiated by his widow on behalf of his estate and the mazal holocaust library — one of the largest collections of holocaust documents in the world — seeks an injunction barring further sale of missing documents, as well as financial compensation for mazal's mental anguish and items that have not been recovered. Mazal, 74, died in august, eight months after intern mansal denton, 21, was arrested and charged with stealing between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 from the hill country village-based nonprofit. Denton, who is awaiting trial, could face up to life in prison if convicted. In addition to denton, the lawsuit is aimed at new york-based bookseller dan wyman, who the suit alleges sold mazal at least nine documents before buying them back from the intern knowing they had been stolen.

Nbc news — citing stats from a safety group — reports keyless ignitions have caused at least 19 deaths and more than two-dozen \" close calls \" since 2009. A washington family of six was one of those close calls when their house filled with carbon monoxide in november. The father took his keyless ignition fob out of his van but forgot to turn the engine off. The van continued to run in the family's attached garage until its tank was empty. The president of safety research &amp; strategies, who calls keyless ignition \" an inherent design defect, \" sums up the problem: \" you need the fob to start the vehicle, but it plays absolutely no role in turning it off. \" the ability to remove the keyless ignition fob and exit the car with the engine running is especially dangerous in many newer hybrid cars, in which the engine may only come on after the hybrid battery is drained and which often feature \" very quiet, smooth-running engines, \" cnn reports. Many manufacturers are including warning systems or auto-shutoffs in new models to address complaints, but a lawsuit filed against 10 manufacturers is pushing them to recall older models to add additional safety features. The national highway traffic safety administration, which first highlighted the dangers of keyless ignition back in 2011, tells nbc it should finally have new safety requirements in place next month.",

Keyless ignition systems, available on many new cars sold in the united states today, allow drivers to start the car with the press of a button while an electronic \" key fob \" remains in their pocket or purse. The car will not start if the key fob is not detected inside the vehicle. The \" defect \" alleged in the lawsuit is that, once the car has been started, these systems allow to it continue running even after the fob itself is no longer in the car.

There have been 13 deaths in these sorts of incidents, according to the lawsuit, and many more injuries. This is especially likely in cars that have very quiet, smooth-running engines.

The strays are mainly in the poorer areas of the city, where mostly blacks and latinos live, and where the issue is exacerbated by a lack of veterinary facilities for spaying and neutering, pups abandoned by evicted residents, and people from other areas dumping their own unwanted dogs there. \" it's a huge problem, \" councilman casey thomas says. \" people walking with sticks and golf clubs? that's a quality-of-life issue. \" the boston consulting group report found loose dogs of all sizes and breeds, noting that 85 % of the dogs in south dallas aren't spayed or neutered, and that bites from strays in the city went up 23 % between 2013 and 2015.

That spurred a larger dig involving experts, who over the weekend covered 4,300 square feet on rügen island and turned up jewelry, pearls, a thor's hammer, and coins, some of which date to bluetooth's time; he ruled for just shy of 30 years beginning in roughly ad 958. The lead archaeologist calls it \" the biggest single discovery of bluetooth coins in the southern baltic sea region. \" \" we have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources, \" says an archaeologist, referring to the dates of the coins found there: between ad 714 and 983, which may indicate the loot was buried in the late 980s. That would sync with when bluetooth fled to the area once known as pomerania ( now parts of germany and poland ) after his son staged a rebellion against him. Bluetooth died there in 987, but not before making his mark by replacing norse religion with christianity in denmark, which he unified. The coins feature a christian cross, notes the local, which describes them as some of the country's first \" independent \" coins. And, yes, bluetooth technology got its name from the king. As for where the king got his name, the ap reports one of his teeth was dead and had a bluish tint. ( legendary lost gold may have been found. )",

        "summary": "Albert woodfox, the last of the famous \" angola three, \" was released from prison last february after pleading no contest to manslaughter in the 1972 killing of prison guard brent miller. In a piece for the new yorker, rachel aviv offers some insight into the \" reserved \" and \" humble \" 69-year-old now trying to adapt to the outside world since his release, after more than 40 years behind bars, most of it spent in solitary confinement. \" i get apprehensive when somebody asks me... ' what does it feel like to be free? ' \" he says. His typical reply: \" ask me in 20 years. \" aviv dives into the details leading up to his imprisonment, including a rough childhood growing up in new orleans, as well as his involvement with the black panthers in nyc and then in louisiana's angola prison, where he was sent in the mid- ' 60s after being convicted for armed robbery. It was after miller's murder and woodfox's conviction for it when he became intimately acquainted with closed cell restricted, or ccr — the unit where the 6-by-9-foot cells he'd call home for the next 40-plus years were located. Despite being described as a \" model prisoner, \" woodfox remained in solitary. He didn't see outside light for more than five years in ccr; he was permitted to walk outside of his cell for an hour a day. ( a small outdoor exercise area was added to ccr in 1978. ) \" woodfox often woke up gasping, \" aviv writes. \" he felt that the walls of the cell were squeezing him to death. \" when woodfox was transferred to a different prison in 2008, he was once more placed in solitary — making his 2016 release a huge adjustment. Once out, he found a usual day of \" moving from the kitchen to the bathroom to the living room \" took \" more steps than his entire exercise regimen in prison, \" aviv notes. Since then woodfox has found his \" street legs, \" and he's now an advocate for the black lives matter movement. \" it's the same old america, \" he notes. Yet on nights when he can't sleep, woodfox resorts to an old pacing routine he used in solitary to calm himself. \" the only thing i can do is walk it off. … and i move on, \" he says.

            "Rome ( ap ) — a pair of strong aftershocks shook central italy late wednesday, crumbling churches and buildings, knocking out power and sending panicked residents into the rain-drenched streets just two months after a powerful earthquake killed nearly 300 people. One person was injured in the epicenter of visso, where the rubble of collapsed buildings tumbled into the streets. But the civil protection agency, which initially reported two injured, had no other immediate reports of injuries or deaths. The first quake carried a magnitude of 5.4, but the second one was eight times stronger at 6.1, according to the u.s. Geological survey. Because many residents had already left their homes after the first one struck at 7: 10 p.m., with plans to spend the night in their cars or elsewhere, they weren't home when the second one hit two hours later, possibly saving lives, news reports said. \" it was an unheard-of violence.

Paul, for instance, said the syrian measure should have been a stand-alone vote so it could be fully debated, rather than tucked into a must-pass spending measure. \" here we are again, wading into a civil war, \" he said, as quoted by ap.

Marc ambinder of the atlantic goes further back, to soviet surveys from the ' 80s. So why would the times print something that isn't exactly news? ambinder notes that the story, with on-the-record quotes from the commander of centcom, smacks of a push by the obama administration to drum up good news on the longest war in american history. \" what better way to remind people about the country's potential bright future, \" ambinder asks, \" than by publicizing or re-publicizing valid — but already public — information about the region's potential wealth? \"",
