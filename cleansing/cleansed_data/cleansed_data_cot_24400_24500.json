        "summary": "Jimmy kimmel's tirade against gop sen. Bill cassidy for his new health care bill reached a second night on wednesday. Kimmel, whose son was born earlier this year with a serious heart condition, railed on cassidy for lying \" right to my face \" on his show in may about protecting pre-existing conditions and other criteria — all promises kimmel says are now at risk under the new bill. Cassidy hit back at kimmel on wednesday, noting, \" i ' m sorry he does not understand \" the legislation and insisting his promises are intact. On wednesday night, kimmel kept the cycle going, jokingly saying he didn't want this to turn into a \" kanye and taylor swift type of situation \" before laying into cassidy, per the new york times. \" he made a total about-face, \" kimmel said. \" which means he either doesn't understand his own bill or he lied to me. It's as simple as that. \" he said cassidy and bill co-sponsor lindsey graham spent wednesday morning \" defending the indefensible \" on cnn, where they \" pulled the ' all comedians are dummies ' card \" — which kimmel pushed back on with a point-by-point list of his interpretation of the bill. Kimmel also took on conservative critics, including fox &amp; friends host brian kilmeade, who labeled kimmel a \" hollywood elite, \" per the ap. \" i don't get anything out of this, brian, you phony little creep, \" kimmel said, noting his fight was for those without adequate health insurance. He also called kilmeade a sycophant who is \" dying to be a member of the hollywood elite. \" for those keeping track at home, politico and the washington post note kimmel actually has a pretty good handle on the bill.",

It instead sold for $ 275,000, but the sale price is potentially less interesting than the buyer: dr. Katsuya takasu, a man the bbc describes as an accused holocaust denier. It points to a 2015 tweet in which takasu reportedly called auschwitz a \" fabrication. \" he assigned the same descriptor to the nanjing massacre, which occurred at the hands of japanese troops in china beginning in late 1937. He tried to clarify his stance to the japan times on thursday, saying that while he is against nazism and does believe the nazis killed people, he does not think \" toxic gas \" was employed at auschwitz. In an interview with reuters, he also emphasized that he thought the death tolls in both instances were inflated, \" a stance common among japanese ultra-nationalists, \" per reuters. He says, \" what i wanted to say was that it is said that 6 million or 7 million were killed [ in the holocaust ], but was that not several tens of thousands? \" the times notes takasu is a widely known cosmetic surgeon in japan, in part because he appears in tv commercials that run almost daily. As for his motivation in buying the 173-page memoir, reportedly written at the behest of gen. Douglas macarthur, he says, \" i really wanted to see the original because the published text could have been edited.

But tech specialists tell reuters it will be hard to independently assess whether the site has reached that goal, because any issues that still remain are likely buried deeper in the site. Tellingly, administration officials said today that 90 % of users are now able to create an account, but did not say whether that same percentage would actually be able to finish enrolling. And officials are still warning that there will be times the site is overwhelmed, and are encouraging people to visit during off-peak hours ( so, not in the middle of the day ). And, as politico notes, it's possible the site will hold up just fine over the holiday weekend, only to crash again monday. An official progress report is expected tomorrow, and the washington post says administration officials will announce that they met the deadline for improvement — but, the post reports, not all of their internal repair goals have been met, and it's not yet clear how many people can use the site at once. ( an anonymous source even says the latest upgrade, completed overnight, caused error messages to increase slightly, at least at first. )",

That's the issue now faced by the federal election commission in terms of its legal counsel: next month will hit the two-year mark of the agency missing a lead attorney, nbc news reports. As first reported by the center for public integrity, the organization responsible for enforcing federal election law is down a key player right before 2016 campaigning kicks into high gear, gridlock caused mainly by infighting among the six fec commissioners: conservatives want an attorney who's not a \" bomb-thrower \" and will support \" minimal restrictions \" on campaign funds, while liberals are vying for someone who will more tightly rein in campaign spending, the cpi notes. It had appeared late last year the agency was close to making an offer to one of two candidates, but the commissioners were deadlocked on one contender, and the other one took a job somewhere else, the center reports. Other things that may be holding up filling the post: no ads on the federal government's jobs website and a salary ( promoted last year as $ 147,200 ) that some say is too modest for the role. It probably also doesn't help that, per the times, \" some commissioners are barely on speaking terms … [ and ] cross-aisle negotiations are infrequent. \" until now, the fec hadn't gone more than a year without an acting or permanent head counsel, per the cpi. \" it's extremely demoralizing not to have anyone in this position, \" chairwoman ann ravel says, while rep. Derek kilmer, who's introduced a bill proposing a five-commissioner body, tells the cpi that \" the fec today makes congress look comparatively functional. \"",

The mayor argues that dc residents ' \" rights are stolen \" because of the zip code where they live. Dc has no representation in congress, yet congress has final control over the city's budget and recently overruled the city on gun control and marijuana legalization. A poll in november found that nearly 75 % of dc residents are \" very upset \" about having no voice in the national government. Bowser points out they have no vote over how their taxes are spent, who should sit on the supreme court, and more. Muriel wants to follow the same process tennessee used to move from a federal territory to the country's 16th state. Under that process, dc residents would approve a state constitution, among other things, and congress would vote on it. However, dcist reports it's unlikely a republican-led congress would approve statehood for dc. \"some in congress say … the reason why dc residents can't have full access to the franchise is because of too many democrats, \" the post quotes bowser as saying. \"do you think access to democracy is a democratic or republican issue? no, it's an american issue. \" dc residents previously voted for statehood in 1982, but they were ignored by congress. Congress ' control of dc comes directly from the us constitution.",

        "summary": "An already critically endangered species has been driven even further to the brink after an insane population decline compounded by the fact that scientists are at a loss to explain it. Initially, scientists weren't too perturbed to hear some saigas — a type of antelope that inhabits kazakhstan, russia, and mongolia — were dying off during their calving period in may; some 12,000 died of apparent digestive issues last year after scientists speculated that there was too much greenery, reports live science. But suddenly, at least 120,000 animals, or half of kazakhstan's population, were dead by june, including a herd of 60,000 saigas felled in four days. \" i have worked in veterinary diseases all my career and i have never seen 100 % mortality, \" an expert tells nature. \" that is extraordinary. \" another adds the \" extent \" and \" speed \" of the die-off \" has not been observed for any other species... It's really unheard of. \" researchers quickly moved to identify the threat, following what little clues they had: necropsies and observations showed mothers died first, followed by their calves. But a most mysterious find came next: scientists found toxins from the usually-harmless pasteurella and possibly clostridia bacteria often found in the animals ' bodies were causing extensive bleeding in their organs, per upi. What had changed in the bacteria to make it suddenly deadly? apparently, nothing. \" there is nothing so special about it. The question is why it developed so rapidly and spread to all the animals, \" a researcher says. Experts are continuing to investigate but say the die-off may be another \" flash crash \" like the 1988 die-off of 400,000 saigas; bacteria may have spread more easily this year via standing water after a wet spring; or the pasteurella and clostridia bacteria may have suddenly sprung into unexpected action.

Researchers with the arctic research foundation say they have located the hms terror off king william island, reports the ottawa citizen. ( coincidentally, it was found in terror bay. ) the ship and its sister vessel, the hms erebus, went down in 1848 after an expedition led by british explorer john franklin to find the northwest passage got stuck in ice. None of the 129 men survived. The discovery of the terror is notable on several fronts, including its pristine condition. \" if you could lift this boat out of the water, and pump the water out, it would probably float, \" a researcher tells the guardian. Three panes of glass still guard the captain's cabin. Also of note is how it was discovered: the search vessel detoured miles away from the main group after an inuit crew member told the captain of seeing a mast sticking out of the ice years ago in this general location. The hunch paid off. And certainly not least, the location of the two ships may now change the narrative of the crews ' final days. It has been long thought that the men abandoned their ships near the north end of victoria strait and attempted to walk out of the arctic. Now it appears that at least some of the men reboarded the vessels and tried to sail south. \" this discovery changes history, \" says a foundation official. The theory is that the remaining terror crew eventually scuttled it intentionally, then boarded the erebus, which made it another 50 miles or so south. ( the erebus was found two years ago. )",

President bashar al-assad's regime and rebels have both accused the other of using chemical agents, including chlorine, in the bloody uprising that began in march 2011 and in spite of damascus promising to hand over all its chemical arms. The opcw team probing the allegations was attacked with a roadside bomb and gunfire on may 27, preventing them accessing the site of an alleged attack in the village of kafr zeyta. \" the attack on the team and the resulting denial of access prevents it from presenting definitive conclusions, \" the report added. Nevertheless, the allegations \" cannot be dismissed as unconnected, random, or of a nature attributable to purely political motives, \" the report said.

The organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons sent a fact-finding mission to the country's north last month to investigate several incidents. The inspectors ' preliminary report says information was gathered that seemed to corroborate the testimony of medics. But an attack on their convoy prevented them presenting definitive conclusions. They were travelling to the rebel-held village of kafr zaita, the scene of at least six reported chlorine gas attacks, to obtain clinical and environmental evidence when one of their vehicles was hit by a bomb. Their convoy was later ambushed and a vehicle was shot at from close range by gunmen who then detained them briefly.'denial of access'the opcw mission was tasked with investigating the alleged use of chlorine in more than a dozen attacks in hama and idlib provinces. In each case, barrel bombs were allegedly dropped from helicopters.

Several people died. The mission's report concludes that information"

Grand juries allow prosecutors to subpoena documents, have witnesses testify under oath, and pursue indictments. \"this is yet a further sign that there is a long-term, large-scale series of prosecutions being contemplated and being pursued by the special counsel, \" a university of texas law professor says. The news — a sign the investigation will likely continue for months — comes as lawmakers in both parties are seeking to make it more difficult for trump to fire mueller. Meanwhile, reuters reports mueller's grand jury has issued subpoenas tied to donald trump jr.'s 2016 meeting with a russian lawyer, who claimed to have information damaging to hillary clinton, and others. And sources familiar with the investigation tell cnn that investigators are beginning to focus on possible financial crimes committed by trump and others, some of which have nothing to do with the 2016 election. Mueller has the authority to look into anything that \" may arise directly from the investigation, \" and sources say investigators now believe financial crimes are more likely to lead to prosecutions than possible collusion with russia during the election.

Parker, born in 1960, doesn't profess to have typed his way to his immense total, a collection that includes titles like the 2007-2012 outlook for public building stacking chairs excluding bar, bowling center, cafeteria, library, restaurant, and school stacking chairs in india. After all, doing so would mean he has churned out six books a day since the moment he was born, per now i know. Rather, for about 15 years parker has owned a patent for computer software that writes books for him by employing info that's publicly available. A 2008 profile in the new york times said he generated his collection via those algorithms, six or seven programmers, and 60 to 70 computers. Most books aren't actually printed until someone buys a copy, and there are many titles to choose from: phys.org in late 2012 reported another 700,000 books on amazon are listed under parker's company, icon group international; it looks like nearly another 100,000 have been added since then. They're also essentially useless to you \" if you are good at the internet, \" he concedes. As for how much he profits from his books — which can cost as little as $ 2.23 ( for ecstasy: webster's quotations, facts and phrases ) to $ 495 for the aforementioned chairs book — he doesn't, or at least he said he didn't in a 2008 q&a. \" icon group as a whole makes no \"profit \" — all resources are plowed into r&d for new genres. \" ( this woman was amazon's most prolific book reviewer. )",

Per a study in the journal radiology, researchers from the wake forest school of medicine, among others, examined the brains of 25 boys ages 8 to 13 playing in a north carolina youth football league, both at the beginning of the season and again at the end, nbc news notes. And even though no subject logged an actual concussion, researchers found the more force a player was exposed to during the season, the more likely it was for him to have a lower fractional anisotropy ( fa ) score, an indicator of smoothly flowing water molecules in the brain that usually signifies healthy white matter. The players donned a sensor-equipped helmet that registered the type of force each boy endured; these hard hits were backed up by tape viewings of games and practices. \" they [ were ] hitting at extremely high levels, \" says a pediatric neurosurgeon involved with the study, per nbc. Scientists then compared an end-of-season mri that measured the water movement for each player along nerve fibers with one taken at the beginning of the season — and found players who'd endured more force had lower fa scores, which have been tied in other studies to brain disruptions. Study co-author christopher whitlow, head of neuroradiology at the wake forest school of medicine, concedes the sample size was small and that more research is needed, telling abc, \" there is more we don't know about these changes than we do know. \" ( brain injuries are popping up in the pro wrestling world, too. )",

As for hilton, she's stirring up some controversy of her own with her new shop in saudi arabia's holy city of mecca. She tweeted last week that her purse and accessory collections were now for sale at the mecca mall, leading to quite a bit of backlash from angry saudis, radar reports. \" historic religious sites in medina are being destroyed, while paris hilton opens a new store, \" wrote one.",

But white house officials previewing the speech on tuesday made one thing clear: don't expect policy details, reports the kansas city star. Instead, expect the president to focus on why tax reform is needed, and he ' ll be selling it in populist fashion a la huey long, reports axios. The speech is being drafted by stephen miller, notes politico, which expects to hear phrases such as \" jump-start america \" and \" win again. \" trump also is expected to hit on the theme of \" unrigging the economy, \" a phrase the gop has been testing with swing voters. The broad strokes include lowering business taxes to help us corporations compete, plus cuts for middle-income taxpayers and a simplified filing system. \"we're going to end the rigged system, \" said one white house official. \"we're going to build a tax code that really allows all americans to have access to the american dream. \" trump and the gop aim to have legislation signed by the end of the year, but as bloomberg notes, fundamental questions remain unanswered, such as \" will the changes be permanent or temporary? how will individual tax brackets be set? what rate will corporations and small businesses pay? \" the wall street journal notes that trump has a further challenge in selling reform as a benefit for the masses when previous proposals from the white house and republicans have largely benefited wealthier americans.

Nearly 150 amputees and their supporters descended on washington yesterday to protest changes they say will make it harder for them to get prostheses, the washington post reports. For example, those who sometimes use a walker or a cane would not be eligible for a high-tech prosthetic but would instead have to settle for an older, less functional one, reports the ap. Amputees with certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure and those who haven't been able to achieve a \" natural gait \" with prostheses also would be affected by the new rules. About 150,000 people with leg amputations are covered under medicare, but all 2 million us amputees could be affected, as veterans affairs and private insurers tend to follow medicare's lead. The proposal is in response to an investigation by the department of health and human services. Between 2005 and 2009, it found that the number of patients receiving artificial legs decreased, while medicare spending on the devices increased by 25 %. ( that might be because advances driven by returning vets have made the devices better but pricier, an industry exec tells the post. ) investigators also found that there was no evidence of a doctor's referral for $ 61 million worth of prostheses. Opponents to the changes say that amputees should not suffer in order for the agency to cut costs. \"arms and legs are not a luxury and shouldn't be treated as such, \" says amputee jack richmond of the amputee coalition, which includes patients and the american orthotic prosthetic association.",

At a ceremony at the museum of tolerance at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles yesterday, 94-year-old former pow james murphy shook hands with mitsubishi exec hikaru kimura after he was bowed to and offered a \" most remorseful apology \" for the firm's wartime conduct, the ap reports. Out of more than 1,000 americans who toiled in the company's mines and factories, only two survivors could be found and only murphy was fit enough to travel to the ceremony, the bbc reports. This was the first apology of its kind from a japanese company and murphy accepted it with grace, describing it as sincere and humble, the ap reports. \" this is a glorious day, \" he said. \" for 70 years, we wanted this. \" a wiesenthal center spokesman tells cnn that japanese firms enslaved 12,000 americans during the war because of labor shortages, and more than 1,100 died. Murphy — who has described his time as a slave in a copper mine as a \" complete horror \" made worse by knowing that mitsubishi built planes used against the us — says he has forgiven his captors but that the apology is still a \" big deal, \" reports the bbc, which notes that the company has not offered compensation.

What makes the case all the more unusual is that that isn't exactly its start: the two had previously been jailed for digging up bodies, which they said they ate. As the new york times explains, cannibalism isn't actually a crime in pakistan, so though the brothers confessed to eating the remains of five people in 2011, they were jailed for nearly 18 months for the exhumation.

Zachary wester, a jackson county deputy from 2016 to 2018, reportedly planted methamphetamine on unaware drivers during needless traffic stops — and that's how it appeared to at least one state official who saw this body-cam footage of wester searching a vehicle on feb. 15. Per the jackson county floridian, state attorney glenn hess wrote that stills from the video \" show deputy wester place a clear plastic baggie in a white pickup truck that he had stopped and for which he had been given permission to search. \" now officials are vacating sentences for at least eight people behind bars, dropping charges for 30-plus defendants, and investigating a total of 263 cases involving wester during his jackson county years. The florida department of law enforcement started investigating wester on aug. 1 and he was fired sept. 10, but no charges have yet been filed against the 26-year-old.

Mondays are already the worst day of the week for heart attacks, notes the lead researcher, who studied years of admissions data from michigan hospitals. \" perhaps the reason we see more heart attacks on monday mornings is a combination of factors, including the stress of starting a new work week and inherent changes in our sleep-wake cycle, \" he says in a press release. \" with daylight saving time, all of this is compounded by one less hour of sleep. \" he says that in light of the study, hospitals should aim to have extra staff on hand the monday after the clocks change.",

Study released on saturday. By contrast, heart attack risk fell 21 percent later in the year, on the tuesday after the clock was returned to standard time, and people got an extra hour's sleep. The not-so-subtle impact of moving the clock forward and backward was seen in a comparison of hospital admissions from a database of non-federal michigan hospitals. It examined admissions before the start of daylight saving time and the monday immediately after, for four consecutive years. In general, heart attacks historically occur most often on monday mornings, maybe due to the stress of starting a new work week and inherent changes in our sleep-wake cycle, said dr.

An inspection in march found the same — a hydraulic brake line was dangling close to a tire, per the albany times union — though the vehicle went on to log 1,289 miles between that inspection and the one in september. A prestige lawyer says the issues were fixed before lisinicchia got behind the wheel saturday, though the new york state department of transportation says that's \" categorically false \" and that prestige's owner \" was warned not to operate the vehicle. \" an \" excellent driver \" with experience behind the wheel of tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and cabs, lisinicchia \" trusted in what the limo company said, that the cars were all right, \" his widow says, per cbs and usa today.

Mullen, charged yesterday with official oppression and harassment after a grand jury investigation, was released on $ 75,000 unsecured bail. Current and former inmates told the grand jury mullen made inappropriate comments when they used the bathroom, ordered prisoners to touch each other, and often performed strip searches. Most said they didn't report the behavior for fear of retaliation and because the incidents were \" extremely embarrassing, \" the morning call reports.

The area is too vast. \" the dumping and subsequent health risks have been documented over the years — in fact, the us navy, which has americans stationed in naples, completed a 2008 study that determined us forces there should exclusively use bottled water — but the impetus for the story is a new government promise to crack down.

So what's the upshot? it's not \" don't drink, \" lead statement author dr. Noelle loconte tells the times. \" it's different than tobacco where we say, ' never smoke. Don't start.'this is a little more subtle \" — drink less, essentially.

The study by researchers at michigan state university found that cooperation trumps selfishness when it comes to self-preservation, reports the bbc. Or, as one of the lead researchers puts it to michigan live: \" we found evolution will punish you if you're selfish and mean. \" it may seem like common sense, but the study actually flies in the face of a long-held theory from mathematician john nash of beautiful mind fame, notes the los angeles times. In the classic game-theory scenario known as the \" prisoner's dilemma, \" two inmates in separate cells are each offered various deals. They can rat out the other or stay silent, but their freedom also hinges on guessing what the other inmate will do. The best deal is if both stay silent, but nash found that the \" rational \" prisoner would rat out his friend because it's the safest course. That conclusion, however, has a fundamental flaw, the new study suggests: the prisoners weren't able to communicate with each other. Add that real-world factor to the mix and the bottom line is this: \"for a short time and against a specific set of opponents, some selfish organisms may come out ahead, \" says the michigan researcher. \" but selfishness isn't evolutionarily sustainable. \"",

        "summary": "Worry that marijuana might kill you? then rest easy: new research says that among things people take to get high or drunk, weed is the least fatal, the washington post reports. Researchers evaluated the fatality risk of these substances by comparing lethal doses to the amount people normally consume. They say the deadliest is booze, followed by heroin, cocaine, tobacco, ecstasy, and meth. Anchoring the list is weed, which makes it 114 times less likely to kill you than alcohol, according to the study published in scientific reports. In fact marijuana is the only drug in the study \" that posed low mortality risk to its users, \" says the post. This echoes 10-year-old drug safety evaluations, so it's more confirmation than fresh news, but comes as the national debate heats up over marijuana legalization. This doesn't make marijuana safe, however. It's still addictive, dumb to smoke while pregnant, and a possible threat to cognitive functioning, according to an earlier post story. Aap news adds that marijuana seems particularly dangerous to children. And those who say marijuana is ok because it's \" natural \" and \" medicinal \" are also off-base ( rattlesnake venom is natural, too, and prescription painkillers, which kill tens of thousands annually, are certainly medicinal ). But marijuana's lack of killing power suggests \" a strict legal regulatory approach rather than the current prohibition approach, \" the researchers say. In fact, the post adds, \" it takes extraordinary chutzpah \" to complain about marijuana and have \" a glass of far more lethal stuff in the evening. \" ( another study finds stoners are safer drivers than drunks. )",

        "summary": "An 83-year-old lesbian from new york is hoping the supreme court will review her challenge to the federal ban on gay marriage while she is still alive. Edith windsor, who suffers from a heart condition, has asked the court to hear her challenge to the defense of marriage act, reuters reports. Windsor married partner thea spyer in toronto in 2007 after a 40-year engagement. But when spyer died in 2009 and left her property, windsor was forced to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes because their marriage was not recognized under federal law. A federal judge in new york last month ruled in favor of windsor, who argues that doma unconstitutionally discriminates against married same-sex couples. \" edie and thea were together for more than four decades and truly lived the words ' in sickness and in health, until death do us part, ' \" her lawyer tells the huffington post. \" solely because of doma, edie had to pay more than $ 363,000 in federal estate tax, which is one of the most significant adverse impacts of doma. Edie, who just turned 83, suffers from a chronic heart condition. The constitutional injury inflicted on edie should be remedied within her lifetime. \"",

The case against avery and dassey was built in large part by law enforcement officers on the wrong end of avery's $ 36 million wrongful conviction lawsuit against the county. While the documentary does not resolve the question of who killed teresa halbach, a photographer who stopped by the avery property",
            "Netflix's hit documentary series making a murderer is many things – a meditation on the flaws of the american justice system, a cautionary tale about power and class and a tragedy on a par with anything sophocles could have written. You'd be hard-pressed find something positive in the story of how steven avery was imprisoned for years for a rape and murder he didn't commit. However, the story has one uplifting element: defence attorney dean strang, whose commitment to justice and compassion for avery, his client, has won him fans all over the internet. He has even emerged as the show's unlikely heartthrob. The tuesday before christmas",

The true-crime documentary making a murderer is missing some important pieces of information, manitowoc county sheriff robert hermann tells the hollywood reporter. The recently released netflix series tells the story of steven avery, who served 18 years in prison for a sexual assault conviction out of that wisconsin county before he was exonerated by dna evidence in 2003. Then in 2005, avery was convicted of the murder of 25-year-old teresa halbach. Since its release last month, the series has skyrocketed in popularity. Even celebrities are weighing in on the case and discussing whether avery and his nephew, brendan dassey, also",
            "Just before christmas, netflix launched their docuseries making a murderer. Since then, some 180,000 viewers have signed online petitions pleading for the release of steven avery, the wisconsin man who appears to have been the victim of a prejudiced trial. I use \"appeared \" here judiciously, but i ' m part of a shrinking tribe. The true crime genre, which has long drawn pleasure from ambiguities, has become a prompt for punditry. Making a murderer is a show designed to raise questions about steven avery's guilt — as well as the effectiveness of the american justice system. In its wake, many viewers have taken the opportunity provided by the social web"

The news tribune reports the 51-year-old tacoma-area man woke at 4am friday to get ready for work and discovered his wife hadn't returned from taking his 77-year-old mother home the night before. He left to look for them and found the car parked several blocks away with the women unconscious inside. Also inside: four coolers of dry ice he kept in the back seat as part of his job as a dippin'dots ice cream delivery man. Police believe some of the dry ice converted to gaseous carbon dioxide and escaped the coolers; that conversion happens as dry ice heats up. Police believe it reduced the amount of oxygen in the air and asphyxiated the man's mother, whom the washington post identifies as hildegard whiting; the man's wife, also 51, was in critical condition. Det. Ed troyer with the pierce county sheriff's department says the upgraded car may have been a contributing factor, as \" the newer car probably had better sealing. \" he also noted it had been a hot day. \" this all happened due to a lot of circumstances lining up. Dry ice by itself isn't going to kill anybody, \" komo quotes him as saying. \" at this point we're just looking at this as horrific accident. \" the post recounts other carbon dioxide-related deaths and incidents, including a scare the founder of halo top creamery had in the company's early days when he was driving with dry ice and 40 pints of ice cream in his car.

Using a computer model that helps predict the spread of diseases like ebola, the argonne national laboratory has determined a zombie virus could spread through the city, turning some 2 million people into zombies, in just 60 days. \" no part of the city would be spared, \" researcher chick macal tells the chicago tribune. That's just the worst-case scenario, however. Humans would fare better if groups were trained to kill zombies or if officials told residents how to keep zombies at bay, according to the study, which will help researchers in \" finding interventions that result in better outcomes, or even optimal outcomes, \" for real diseases, macal says. Researchers accounted for the 2.9 million people in chicago as of 2000, then built simulations based on how they move about the city, per a release. They then introduced a small group of slow-moving zombies. When a zombie met a human, researchers calculated the likelihood that the person would kill the zombie ( fight the virus ) or get bitten ( become infected ). In the worst-case scenario, all humans were \" zombified \" within 60 days, with about 500,000 zombies killed before that time. But in a few simulations, \" zombies were contained, and there wasn't massive spreading beyond a small number of places where the zombie outbreak began, \" macal says. In other words, there's still \" great promise for countering the zombie apocalypse. \" ( this man claimed he shot at a zombie. )",

        "summary": "Lockheed martin announced yesterday that it has made what reuters calls a \" technological breakthrough \" in the area of compact nuclear fusion. The upshot is that reactors \" small enough to fit on the back of a truck \" could be here within 10 years. As forbes explains, nuclear fusion combines two atoms into one, creating as much as quadruple the energy as nuclear fission ( when an atom is split in two ), and it does so without producing radiation. Project head tom mcguire says lockheed has been working on its compact fusion concept secretly for four years, but it's now looking for industry and government partners. \" the smaller size will allow us to design, build, and test the compact fusion reactor in less than a year, \" says mcguire, with a prototype coming in five years. But some are skeptical: at ars technica, john timmer points out that \" details as to what the breakthrough is are missing. \" timmer writes that an original version of lockheed's press release, which has apparently since been taken down, said something along the lines of \" if everything goes well, the design could ' be developed and deployed in as little as ten years. ' \" timmer calls that \" if \" a \" big one. \" the version of the press release that's currently available drops the \" if. \" mother jones notes that the media is losing its mind over the news, using headline words like \" paradigm-shifting. \" but a researcher for the large hadron collider points out that the promise of a compact reactor is currently theoretical, and a thermonuclear plasma physicist goes even further, calling lockheed's announcement \" poppycock. \" as he explains, it's very difficult to make fusion reactors that small, because you need an extremely small space plus lots of very dense material, and \" we know of no materials that would be able to handle anywhere near that amount of heat. \" so what's going on? timmer suspects lockheed is doing a \" publicity offensive \" because lockheed needs commercial partners to help fund all the research that comes next. The reuters article and press release are joined by a technical article in aviation week, though even that acknowledges that \" many key challenges remain before a viable prototype can be built. \" timmer's take: \" by making the developments sound inevitable, the company increases its chances of attracting someone to share the risk. \"",

        "summary": "Last year, police in western new york stopped a driver who had been reported \" weaving all over \" the road. The female motorist had a flat tire and her car was producing \" a large amount of smoke and a noticeable smell of burning rubber, \" per the police report; the responding officer also said the driver smelled of alcohol, was slurring her speech, and had glassy, bloodshot eyes. She passed one sobriety test ( reciting the alphabet ) but had trouble with others, and her bac was ultimately found to be.33 %, more than four times the legal limit, via breathalyzer, police said. She was charged with dwi — but a judge dismissed the charges earlier this month, after medical evidence was presented to show that the woman suffers from \" auto-brewery syndrome, \" the buffalo news reports. Essentially, her body gets her drunk even if she doesn't drink — as happens to this man in texas. In this case, the 35-year-old did admit to having three alcoholic beverages earlier in the day, but she had not consumed enough alcohol to end up with a.33 % bac. Her condition, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, involves an excess of yeast in her digestive system, causing carbohydrates to be turned into alcohol inside her body. Indeed, the syndrome is gradually getting more attention, \" with sufferers reporting bouts of goofiness after eating french fries and false accusations of alcoholism, \" reports us news and world report. It also notes that a bbc story raised a possible connection to long-term use of antibiotics. In the buffalo-area case, the woman actually did not know she had the syndrome until her lawyer's research uncovered its existence, and tests proved she suffers from it.

Military action could throw international law out of whack, even topple the un, and paints the us \" not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, \" putin writes. \" it is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the united states, \" he writes, making the case for diplomacy — especially since western militants could bring the violence back home. As \" there is every reason to believe \" the gas attack was a move by the syrian rebels to provoke the us into action, bypassing the security council is unacceptable. \" the law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not. \" but it was his closing argument — in which he bashes american exceptionalism — that ruffled the most feathers, according to cnn.

Meet dru ( domino's robotic unit ), an autonomous 3-foot-tall delivery vehicle ( currently in prototype stage ) that's most aptly described by nbc news as \" half wall-e, half baby carriage, with a sprinkling of r2-d2. \" developed by marathon targets, dru is powered by lidar — the same technology self-driving cars employ — and scoots around with the assistance of its built-in gps system, which is hooked up with google maps. The four-wheel device can carry out a bunch of deliveries within a 20-mile radius on a single charge, zips along at a maximum 12.5mph, and can hold up to 10 pizzas in its heated compartment, the verge and lifehacker australia report. How it works: once an order is placed, dru maps out the customer's address and putters on over, using its sensors to avoid obstacles. When dru arrives curbside, the customer will be able to open the locked compartments with a special code sent via smartphone. To further deter pizza poachers, the units come equipped with cameras to record any attempts at theft. Because of its speed limitations and local transport rules, dru can currently only travel on smaller lanes and paths ( no major thoroughfares or highways ), so it will first be tested in small neighborhoods in australia and new zealand; customers should expect to see the robots take to the streets within the next six months. Due to logistical, technical, and legal hurdles, it may be at least two years before they become an everyday sight. ( another modern wonder: domino's cars with pizza ovens. )",

The players'tribune has been kind enough to give me my own column, where i will talk about any and everything football with — you guessed it — a mathematical spin. For my first column, i'd like to go back to my roots and talk college football. Rest easy, coach mora, we're not talking playoffs. Not yet, at least. More specifically, i'd like to begin by covering a topic very close to my heart: academics in college football. As a former winner of the campbell trophy ( also known as the \"academic heisman \" ) and sullivan award ( given to the nation's most outstanding amateur athlete ), i've always taken the student-athlete ideal quite seriously. It is commonly said that football players at the top universities are not student-athletes, but simply attend university to play football,"
