Now, thanks to her dedicated popaholics, she's topping 900,000 followers on instagram and 850,000 subscribers on youtube. Lee says her viewers get satisfaction out of the unpredictable payoff of a good pop. \" it's like gambling, \" she says. \"you never know when you're going to hit a big one. \" so what compels nearly 7 million people to watch lee remove a whole mess of blackheads from an 80-year-old man's nose? \" some fans reported that their mouths inexplicably watered when they saw a particularly juicy pop; others claimed that they found the videos so soothing that they used them as a sleep aid, \" new york magazine explains.

Now he's suing the teen, christal mcgee, and snapchat. The lawsuit filed this month claims mcgee was using snapchat's speed filter at the time of the crash last september. As the new york daily news explains, the filter adds a user's speed to their photo to show how fast they were moving when it was taken. Lawyers for wentworth maynard say mcgee, 18, admitted to trying to get her mercedes benz up to 100mph in order to post a photo using the speed filter, cnn reports. When she crashed into maynard's car, she was going about 107mph — nearly double the speed limit. Maynard spent five weeks in the hospital following the crash, according to the lawsuit. He lost 50 pounds, requires a wheelchair or walker to get around, can't work, and can't take care of himself. And his lawyers say mcgee wasn't done with snapchat even after the crash. They claim she took a selfie with blood dripping down her face and the caption \" lucky to be alive \" immediately after the accident ( that photo can be seen here ). Maynard is seeking unspecified damages to cover his medical bills. \" the issue really is about distracted teenage drivers, \" his lawyer tells nbc. \" it's about snapchat encouraging teenagers to drive at fast speed for social status. \" a snapchat spokesperson says it discourages people from using its speed filter while driving with an in-app warning message. ( the snapchat bob marley filter did not go over well. )",

            "( cnn ) -- three days after he was killed, cnn found a journal belonging to late u.s. Ambassador to libya chris stevens. The journal was found on the floor of the largely unsecured consulate compound where he was fatally wounded. Cnn notified stevens ' family about the journal within hours after it was discovered and at the family's request provided it to them via a third party. The journal consists of just seven pages of handwriting in a hard-bound book. For cnn, the ambassador's writings served as tips about the situation in libya, and in benghazi in particular. Cnn took the newsworthy tips and corroborated them with other sources. A source familiar with stevens'thinking told cnn earlier this week that, in the months leading up to his death, the late ambassador worried about what he called the security threats in benghazi and a rise in islamic extremism. Stevens died on september 11, along with three other americans, when the u.s. Consulate in benghazi came under attack amid a large protest about a u.s.-made film that mocked the muslim prophet mohammed. The california-born stevens joined the peace corps and attended law school before joining the foreign service, the career diplomatic corps, in 1991, according to his state department biography.

            "( cnn ) -- three days after he was killed, cnn found a journal belonging to late u.s. Ambassador to libya chris stevens. The journal was found on the floor of the largely unsecured consulate compound where he was fatally wounded. Cnn notified stevens ' family about the journal within hours after it was discovered and at the family's request provided it to them via a third party. The journal consists of just seven pages of handwriting in a hard-bound book. For cnn, the ambassador's writings served as tips about the situation in libya, and in benghazi in particular. Cnn took the newsworthy tips and corroborated them with other sources. A source familiar with stevens'thinking told cnn earlier this week that, in the months leading up to his death, the late ambassador worried about what he called the security threats in benghazi and a rise in islamic extremism. Stevens died on september 11, along with three other americans, when the u.s. Consulate in benghazi came under attack amid a large protest about a u.s.-made film that mocked the muslim prophet mohammed. The california-born stevens joined the peace corps and attended law school before joining the foreign service, the career diplomatic corps, in 1991, according to his state department biography. He spent most of his career in the middle east and north africa, including postings",

But even as her company's controversy grew, bresch did something else that's getting scrutinized: she unloaded about 100,000 shares of stock on august 9, to the tune of a $ 5 million profit. Bresch did so under a 10b5 plan, which spans a certain waiting period and are set up to avoid the appearance of insider trading, reports the guardian. \" yet, \" as the guardian writes, \" bresch did not need insider information to know that trouble lay ahead. \" the grumbling about the price of epipen goes back to at least last september, when bloomberg reported on epipen's marketing success story while noting the price had gone up 400 %. Mylan subsequently hiked epipen's price again. In june, wells fargo noted in a report that mylan had jacked prices on seven products by at least 100 %, and on 24 products by at least 20 %, hikes it said \" could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk. \" mylan shares went from $ 49.20 per share on august 19, 10 days after bresch's sale, to $ 43.11 on august 24 — a $ 3 billion loss in value, notes raw story.

How much is that, exactly? more than $ 1.6 trillion. And if you look at the richest 1 % of the global population, they have 65 times more money than the poorest 50 %. That number: $ 110 trillion, nbc news reports; that's 46 % of the world's total wealth, usa today notes. The oxfam report comes as the world economic forum starts in davos, and is meant to highlight growing income inequality, the guardian reports. Oxfam blames the growing gap on a \" power grab \" by the world's richest, who use their influence to make sure politicians promote economic policies that help them get even richer. \" widening inequality is creating a vicious circle where wealth and power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of us to fight over crumbs from the top table, \" says the oxfam executive director, who will attend the world economic forum... Which, in case you forgot, is held in an exclusive ski resort where attendees, many of whom will arrive on private jets, attend ritzy parties as well as meetings.

The big win, of course, came in virginia, where ralph northam fended off ed gillespie in the governor's race, though there's disagreement on how much that should be read as a rebuke of president trump. Here's a look at some of the sentiments out there: fear for the gop: in the new york times, frank bruni sees the results in virginia as a clear repudiation of trump and a sign that \" trump antipathy \" is not only real but on the rise. \" just when we needed a sign that his america is not all of america, virginia came to the rescue and gave us a vivid one, \" writes bruni, referring to the president. \" and i guarantee you that the republicans up for re-election in 2018 saw it, shuddered and will spend the next weeks and months trying to figure out just how much trouble their party is in and precisely how to repair it. \" hold those predictions: any pundit who uses tuesday night's results to predict a democratic surge in the 2018 election needs to have their credentials checked, writes mollie hemingway at the federalist. Yes, democrats had a good night, but those 2018 races are just too far away. As for the gop, the takeaway is clear: start fulfilling promises on tax reform and obamacare.",

Just a few years later, \" latin liturgy was irrelevant, \" poleg adds, and the bible became a \" recorder of thievery. \" hidden on a back page was a transaction between a man and a pickpocket who was hanged in 1552.

The right-wing site the daily caller reported that the recording — captioned \" ' f ------ get your camera right now ' \" — was posted and deleted by barstool sports, but a version of it was still making the rounds on youtube and twitter friday morning. But despite being shared by conservatives who regularly slam obama's dad, much of the reception to the video was positive. Writer ashley c. Ford joked that she was adding \" another thing to the list of ways malia obama is more talented than me, \" while blogger charles clymer tweeted that \" the only thing i find offensive about about malia obama blowing smoke rings is that it confirms she's so much cooler than i was at 19. \" \" let malia live, \" activist deray mckesson",

He says one officer threatened to \" blow my f ------ head off. \" tmz has video of the incident in which bennett can be heard yelling, \" i wasn't doing nothing. \" while bennett, who has gained attention this year for sitting during the national anthem, was released after police confirmed his identity, he was never given a reason \" for the officers ' abusive conduct. \" \" they apparently realized i was not a thug, common criminal or ordinary black man but michael bennett a famous professional football player, \" he says.

        "summary": "On tuesday, brian winchester took the stand and cried. He recounted looking for his missing best friend on florida's lake seminole 18 years ago. But while his father \" was searching... I was just lying, \" he testified. That's because winchester knew exactly where mike williams had ended up on dec. 16, 2000: dumped in a mudhole. Winchester was the one to pull the trigger — he said he pushed his friend overboard while the two were on the lake, but when he didn't drown he shot williams and then moved the body — but he's not the one on trial. That would be williams ' wife, denise, who prosecutors accuse of conspiring with winchester to get rid of her husband so the two could be together and collect a $ 1.75 million insurance payout. The washington post reports their affair began in 1997, when the two kissed at a sister hazel concert as their spouses parked the car. Clandestine trips followed, and winchester testified denise wanted to be with him but rejected the idea of divorce and sharing custody of her daughter. He says the two settled on \" boating accident, \" and the ap reports she's now charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory after the fact. While denise wasn't with him when the crime was committed, \" she was in my head with me, \" winchester testified, per the tallahassee democrat. \" we were best friends; bonnie and clyde. We were partners in crime. Were we obsessed with each other? you could say that. \" denise's attorney argues she had no idea about the plot, and that the only person who said she was a conspirator was winchester — whom, in an odd series of twists, she ended up marrying in 2005 and being kidnapped by in 2016. Winchester is serving 20 years for that crime, and the deal he inked means that by testifying against denise, he won't be charged in the murder.",

Meanwhile, the government has raised the official death toll to 525 and the injury count to about 3,700, reports the ap, but those figures take into account only those victims who went through hospitals. The muslim brotherhood continues to insist that the real death toll from yesterday is closer to 2,000. Dispatches from foreign journalists are bleak: \" so many dead protestors in the mosque i am visiting in cairo that my feet are wet with disinfectant and blood, \" tweeted jonathan rugman from uk's channel 4 news. \" horrific here. \" he also recounts an announcement at the mosque: \" anyone who can leave, please do. The bodies are decomposing in the heat. \" other developments: the government has extended the detention of ousted president mohamed morsi for another 30 days, according to state media. Egypt's interim pm says the decision to make yesterday's deadly crackdown \" was not easy, \" but the government had no choice in the face of failed mediation and \" anarchy, \" the bbc reports. \" we found that matters had reached a point that no self-respecting state could accept, \" says hazem el-beblawi.

France, britain, and germany have condemned the violence.

        "summary": "Health researchers have figured out how to identify whether elderly hospital patients are suffering from delirium with nearly complete accuracy in about the same amount of time as it takes to read this paragraph, according to a new study published yesterday in the journal of hospital medicine. Delirium is a serious problem for elderly patients, who may arrive at the hospital mentally sound only to develop delirium during their stay, possibly from medications or poor sleep, the philadelphia inquirer reports. \" delirium can be very costly and deadly — and with high-risk patients, time matters, \" penn state professor donna fick says in a press release. Doctors and nurses currently use a 3-minute test to diagnose delirium, but sometimes they don't even have that much time, the researchers note. That's why fick developed an \" ultra-brief \" two-question test for diagnosing delirium that takes an average of 36 seconds to administer and has a 93 % success rate, according to the press release. By asking 201 participants — 42 of whom were clinically diagnosed with delirium — what day of the week it was and asking them to recite the months of the year backward, researchers were able to identify those with delirium. The test also incorrectly identified six people with delirium, but fick says she's fine with false positives, as doctors can use the short test to decide who should get the longer delirium test. Researchers plan to conduct a larger study of the two-question test before recommending it for use. ( is police brutality just a form of delirium? )",

This finding comes from a new study whose lead author was donna m. Fick, a professor of nursing at pennsylvania state university. The goal of the research, published in the journal of hospital medicine, was to look for quicker methods for identifying patients whose mental health is going awry. Hospital delirium is a vexing problem in older patients, especially for those in the intensive care unit. People who seem mentally sound before admission may start to experience delusions and other problems once in the hospital -- perhaps due to a constellation of factors, such as poor sleep, medications, and underlying mental decline. Currently, hospitals use a three-minute diagnostic test to screen for delirium, but study authors said that in cases where time is short, a quicker initial test was needed. Fick, codirector of penn state's hartford center of geriatric nursing excellence, collaborated with researchers at harvard medical school, among other institutions. After testing a variety of questions on 201 patients",
            "Asking just two questions may be able to help nurses and doctors quickly and easily identify delirium in hospitalized older adults, according to health researchers.

Fick, distinguished professor of nursing and co-director of the hartford center of geriatric nursing excellence at penn state. \" our ultra-brief two-item bedside test for delirium takes an average of 36 seconds to perform and has a sensitivity of 93 percent. \" edward r. Marcantonio, professor of medicine, harvard medical school, recently developed the 3d-cam, a three-minute confusion assessment method, to help identify patients with delirium quickly. However, this method is more complicated than the ultra-brief screening and can still take a significant amount of time to administer. Fick and marcantonio wanted to develop something that would be easier to use at the bedside and take less time out of a busy nurse's day. \" we started by looking for one question that could detect delirium, but we could only get 83 percent sensitivity, which is not good enough, \" said fick.

Hospital delirium is a vexing problem in older patients, especially for those in the intensive care unit. People who seem mentally sound before admission may start to experience delusions and other problems once in the hospital -- perhaps due to a constellation of factors, such as poor sleep, medications, and underlying mental decline. Currently, hospitals use a three-minute diagnostic test to screen for delirium, but study authors said that in cases where time is short, a quicker initial test was needed. Fick, codirector of penn state's hartford center of geriatric nursing excellence, collaborated with researchers at harvard medical school, among other institutions. After testing a variety of questions on 201 patients",
            "Asking just two questions may be able to help nurses and doctors quickly and easily identify delirium in hospitalized older adults, according to health researchers. Delirium is a reversible cognitive condition that can be resolved if caught and treated early. \" delirium can be very costly and deadly — and with high-risk patients, time matters, \" said donna m. Fick, distinguished professor of nursing and co-director of the hartford center of geriatric nursing excellence at penn state. \" our ultra-brief two-item bedside test for delirium takes an average of 36 seconds to perform and has a sensitivity of 93 percent. \" edward r. Marcantonio, professor of medicine, harvard medical school, recently developed the 3d-cam, a three-minute confusion assessment method, to help identify patients with delirium quickly. However, this method is more complicated than the ultra-brief screening and can still take a significant amount of time to administer. Fick and marcantonio wanted to develop something that would be easier to use at the bedside and take less time out of a busy nurse's day. \" we started by looking for one question that could detect delirium, but we could only get 83 percent sensitivity, which is not good enough, \" said fick. She and her colleagues report their findings online in the journal of hospital medicine. The researchers were able to find two questions that proved to"

        "summary": "Dogs were the first domesticated animal, but they may not have been the first to mooch off humans. Scientists previously believed mice started congregating around farms to snatch grain about 12,000 years ago. But new research out of israel's university of haifa suggests mice were interacting with humans in the region that is now israel, lebanon, and syria, some 3,000 years before the dawn of agriculture and before domesticated dogs appeared, per the bbc. Researchers say fossil mouse teeth at archaeological sites of the natufian culture of hunter-gatherers suggest the number of common house mice around humans increased as once-nomadic humans started to settle in one area and build houses 15,000 years ago, reports national geographic. But the number of short-tailed mice — a species that is wilder and less tolerant of humans — dwindled. House mice were essentially out-competing the others, eating the food the newly sedentary natufian people stored. When sites were occupied by humans, the mouse population was about 80 % house mice and 20 % short-tailed mice. Only when the natufians moved on did the proportion of short-tailed mice in the area increase. The study author tells gizmodo the house mice weren't exactly \" domesticated \" as they offered no benefit to humans. However, the research shows \" we've been changing them and they've been changing us \" for a very long time. Adds a researcher, \" thanks to this relationship, house mice have colonized almost every corner of the globe to become almost as ubiquitous as humans. \" one researcher notes that the study offers a \" new, detailed window \" into the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to more sedentary societies. ( a recent study probed the origin of dogs. )",

Prosecutors concluded their case today against lee joon-seok by saying he \" supplied the cause \" that sunk the sewol, and therefore \" has the heaviest responsibility for the accident, \" reuters reports. Lee and three senior crew members were charged with \" homicide through willful negligence \" in may; 11 other crew members face lesser charges, reports afp. Prosecutors are calling only for lee's execution in a country that hasn't put anyone to death since 1997, when 23 people were hanged, adds the bbc. There are 58 people on death row there. Prosecutors say lee and his crew told passengers \" to stay in their cabins \" as the ship sunk, the ap reports. The crew members were among the first to board rescue boats and have said while on trial they considered it the coast guard's duty to get passengers off the boat, reuters adds. Lee has blamed the ferry's owners for its sinking, but he admits a new crew member was steering the ship. \" i will repent until the day i die and ask for the victims ' families ' forgiveness. I swear with my hand over my heart, i did not intend to kill anyone. I never even thought of such a thing, \" he told the court. A verdict is expected in november.

Police say a 15-year-old girl was groped and pepper-sprayed in the face outside the rally in paul ryan's hometown, usa today reports. They say that after a man in the crowd groped the girl, she pushed him during a confrontation, only to be sprayed by another man. The girl, who had been carrying a sign denouncing trump as a white supremacist, required hospital treatment, as did a 19-year-old woman who was also sprayed. \" we are currently looking for two suspects, one for the sexual assault and one for the pepper spray, \" police said in a statement. One suspect can be seen clearly in video of the clash. Janesville police chief david moore tells wkow that the rally, trump's first in the state ahead of its april 5 primary, was otherwise largely peaceful. Inside the holiday inn express, trump addressed campaign manager corey lewandowski's alleged assault of a journalist. \" i mean, maybe he touched her a little bit, but i didn't, it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me, right? \" he said. That caused the crowd to \" erupt in hatred \" toward reporter michelle fields, according to msnbc, which notes that trump seemed surprised when the crowd also booed when ryan's name was mentioned. Turning his attention to ted cruz, trump denounced him as \" not a natural-born citizen, \" but he made no mention of cruz's wife, heidi. ( at a town hall that evening, trump backed away from his gop loyalty pledge. )",

The number of homicides ( which includes three beating and stabbing deaths ) is similar to what's typically seen during the summer, when violence peaks, and the total number of people shot in january — 242, per the ap — was more than twice that of last january. The last year chicago saw more than 500 homicides was 2012, and the number of shootings this january was almost 60 % higher than that seen in january 2012. But, the chicago tribune notes, that's still a far cry from \" decades ago when homicides sometimes exceeded 900 in a year. \" even more depressing: chicago continues to see more violence than the more populous cities of new york and los angeles, and interim police superintendent john escalante concedes the city was \" literally alone \" in its high january violence even though other major us cities saw violence increase last year. He acknowledges police activity and \" street stops \" are down this year, which may be due to chicago police officers ' concerns about being criticized, particularly in the wake of the laquan mcdonald shooting: officers don't want \" to be the next viral video, \" escalante says. \" even when they're doing something right, it may not be perceived that way. \" but, as usa today reports, the police department has been \" pushing back \" against the idea that decreased police activity is the cause of the increase in homicides.

        "summary": "An arkansas man is facing felony charges after allegedly filling his free water cup with not-free soda monday at a mcdonald's in springdale, khbs/khog reports. Police say 18-year-old cody morris and two others drove through the mcdonald's drive-thru and ordered three large waters. They then parked, went into the restaurant, dumped out the water, and allegedly filled the cups with soda. Morris ' accomplices returned their ill-gotten sodas when pressed by a manager, but morris allegedly refused. That's when the manager decided to stand behind the group's car to prevent them from leaving. At this point it's worth noting that — as raw story reports — a large soda at mcdonald's costs only $ 1.49 and comes with free refills. Police say the group's car reversed into the mcdonald's manager, who was then hit by the car a second time when he reached through the window to try to pull the keys from the ignition. The car drove off, and the manager called police. Officers found the car and morris at a bowling alley, and he was arrested on suspicion of felony robbery. ( allegedly hitting the manager with the car is what presumably elevated the charges. ) this isn't the first time someone has been arrested for soda-related crimes at mcdonald's: in its coverage, wgba notes that a florida man was busted for repeatedly stealing soda from a mcdonald's in 2012. He was caught doing the same thing at a pizza hut a few months later. ( a more positive mcdonald's headline: all-you-can-eat fries. )",

The online event — dubbed by one twitter user as a \" crappy garage sale with an insane marketing budget, \" per forbes — drove complaints and unflattering hashtags such as #primedayfail and #gobacktosleep, cnnmoney reports. It was enough pushback to prompt the retailer to get \" defensive \" and issue a midday statement, per forbes. \" prime day peak order rates have already surpassed 2014 black friday, \" the statement read. \" prime members have already bought tens of thousands of fire tv sticks, 35,000 lord of the rings blu-ray sets, 28,000 rubbermaid sets, and 4,000 echo devices in 15 minutes. \" but those \" slightly interesting \" single-item sales didn't paint an accurate picture of sales overall, forbes notes. An analyst tells the magazine that even though the retailer may have doubled ( or even tripled ) its usual average july sales volume, the company could lose $ 5 to $ 10 on each significantly slashed item. And adobe, tracking customer sentiment on social media, found that 10 hours in, \" amazon prime day \" had only received 90,000 or so mentions on social media, compared with 20 times that figure during last year's black friday, forbes notes, with about half of that \" [ relating ] to sadness. \" it's not hard to see why, based on what gizmodo found as some of the \" shittiest deals \" of the day — discounts that looked like \" they fell off a truck headed to a poorly regulated flea market for sad people held in a dumpster \" — including a 47 % reduction on an adam sandler movie four-pack and a 70 % cut on two pairs of balaclavas ( both still on sale today ). The best deals, per techcrunch: amazon's own products, such as $ 79 kindles that went for $ 49 and fire hd 7 tablets cut from $ 139 to $ 79.

But abc's sources say carey thought the president was monitoring her house electronically and airing her life on tv. She also thought she could communicate with the president, and called herself the \" prophet of stamford, \" those sources say. More: police found medication for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression at carey's connecticut home, cnn reports. A dentist who says carey worked for him last year recalled her missing two or three weeks of work after she suffered a head injury after a fall. She got a handicapped parking spot at work after that injury, and cbs news reports she was eventually fired because her bosses didn't think she actually needed the space, and an argument ensued. But the dentist says he fired her because she was too rough with patients. Carey's former employer also says she was stressed after an unplanned pregnancy; her mother said earlier that carey had post-partum depression. Twice in december, carey's boyfriend told police he was afraid for their child's safety, and said carey was acting delusional and thought obama had placed the city under lockdown and started monitoring her home. But by january, a source says, the boyfriend told a social worker carey was \" 100 % back to normal. \" a source says carey left that boyfriend a letter at her apartment, which appeared to contain white powder and was being investigated.",

On friday, two more exposés on kelly were published: lengthy pieces in buzzfeed and the washington post. The post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him ( two of whom have never spoken out publicly before ); buzzfeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly \" brainwashed \" by kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: the post, for example, says kelly constantly has an entourage of young women ( sometimes minors ), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: they hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with kelly, whom they must call \" daddy. \" they aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the post's sources, and must ask permission from kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups. And buzzfeed's sources say kelly rules all aspects of the women's lives, telling them when to eat and sleep and what to wear, among other things, and punishing them if they break a rule. Parents who spoke to both publications claim kelly is keeping their children from contacting them. Read both pieces in full here and here. Kelly's team denies wrongdoing.",

Authorities in denison now add that the 18-year-old's story was only an \" insulting \" hoax. While police say her claims \" began to unravel \" almost immediately — speculation was also rife on social media — talbott herself admitted tuesday that she staged a kidnapping scene, lied to police that she'd been held down and raped, left articles of clothing in a wooded area, and scratched her own body to make it appear as though she'd been assaulted, chief jay burch says in a release. Talbott — initially reported missing by her fiance, who found personal items strewn around her car — was taken into custody wednesday and charged with making a false report to police. She could face up to six months in jail and a $ 4,000 fine if convicted, reports the herald democrat. Burch says police will also \" seek restitution for the significant costs for conducting such a major investigation \" into a false crime, which he said was damaging to the community and \" especially offensive to the african-american community. \" it was also likely offensive to the two in five women in texas who are actual sexual assault victims, a rep for a local crisis center tells kxii, and damages the chances of them reporting an assault.

        "summary": "Goldman sachs is planning a major hiring spree in singapore, even as it prepares to slash its headcount in the us to cut costs. The financial giant is so worried about criticism over the job shift that it has taken the unusual step of notifying lawmakers about its hiring plans, insiders tell fox news. The 1,000 jobs the company is adding in singapore will mostly be the same kind of high-paying investment banking positions that goldman plans to cut in the us, a source says. Goldman's shifting of jobs overseas is likely to spell bad news for more than just wall street bankers, according to daniel indiviglio at the atlantic. It looks like the firm is both aiming to escape new financial regulation and betting against the us economy, he writes — and goldman has a history of being ahead of economic trends. \" if goldman is right, then the us is going to be in for a rough time over the next decade or so. And other wall street firms moving more workers overseas will make matters worse, \" he concludes.",

The meeting was announced by us national security adviser john bolton after he met with vladimir putin on wednesday; the timing and location will be announced thursday. The one-on-one meeting — which is expected to be held while president trump is in europe for the nato summit next month — will cover syria, arms-control, and the relationship between the two countries. The primary issues in us-russia relations are russia's interventions in the ukraine and syria, the country's interference in the 2016 us election, and its alleged role in the poisoning of a former double agent and his daughter in the uk. This will be trump and putin's first official sit-down, as opposed to encounters they've had on the sidelines of larger events, the washington post reports. Nato partners are pushing for the meeting to take place after the nato summit in mid-july, due to concerns that trump and putin could agree to something that they oppose, reports cnn. Some members, for example, fear that the current efforts to sanction and isolate moscow could be undone by president trump. \" no one knows what he ' ll walk out saying, \" one western official told cnn. Us secretary of state mike pompeo and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will also meet, likely before the presidents do. \"the president's been unambiguous since he took office that there are places where russia is working against the united states, but many places where we work together, \" pompeo told msnbc last week. Putin, speaking in advance of bolton's visit, sounded optimistic about the future of us-russia relations, saying he hoped to discuss \" what both sides could do to restore full-fledged relations on the basis of equality and respect for each other's interests. \"",

A woman from shrewsbury was awoken by knocks at her door and found the 7-year-old victim standing at her door in pajamas soaking wet. \" that's how assistant district attorney cheryl riddle described the incredible end of an allegedly harrowing ordeal. Police say the sleeping child was taken from a chair in her grandparents ' home in worcester, mass., around 2: 30am sunday, driven around for an hour, choked, and thrown from a bridge into a lake, only to miraculously survive and manage to swim to shore. Joshua hubert, 35, has been charged with kidnapping and is being held without bail. Masslive reports hubert has denied all involvement; riddle alleges hubert attended a cookout at the home and passed through the room where the girl was sleeping as he exited. The telegram reports the girl was found with bruises on her wrist and leg and marks on her neck that indicate she was choked; none of the injuries are life-threatening. The telegram reports police haven't specified which lake quinsigamond bridge she was thrown from, though wcvb cites police in saying it was a bridge along interstate 290 that stands 100 feet above the water; the washington post notes a man who jumped from that bridge in 2012 died. Masslive reports the girl identified hubert as her assailant. Worcester police are seeking surveillance footage from homes and businesses in the area that have exterior cameras in place and might have captured a saturn ion near the vicinity of lincoln street between 2am and 4: 30am sunday, notes wcvb.",

The alaska man was arrested in deerfield, mass., on tuesday, and reportedly admitted to driving straight there from seattle. His ride ended at a circle k gas station, where an employee called police after witnessing erratic behavior in the parking lot, reports the recorder: after inserting his credit cards into the fuel tank and locking himself out of the vehicle, robbins was seen trying to break into the truck from the space between the trailer and front cab. Police say the 49-year-old admitted to using crystal meth, lsd, and cocaine to fuel his non-stop, cross-country ride. \" they thought he was having a medical emergency, \" a cop tells the boston herald, but his argumentative nature and dilated pupils suggested drugs were involved. On facebook, the deerfield police department wrote, \" officers had quite the struggle to get this truck driver to the baystate franklin medical center. He was clearly a danger to himself and others \" — though syracuse.com observes robbins \" amazingly \" didn't injure anyone on what it calculated was likely a 44-hour drive. Robbins ' license has been revoked; he is being charged with operating under the influence of drugs and will face \" many additional charges, \" per police. Prior to his arrest, robbins had managed to deliver his cargo of raspberry roots in a town less than 10 miles away. ( this is the fastest ny-to-la drive ever. )",

            "If you plan to record telephone calls or in-person conversations ( including by recording video that captures sound ), you should be aware that there are federal and state wiretapping laws that may limit your ability to do so. These laws not only expose you to the risk of criminal prosecution, but also potentially give an injured party a civil claim for money damages against you. From a legal standpoint, the most important question in the recording context is whether you must get consent from one or all of the parties to a phone call or conversation before recording it. Federal law and many state wiretapping statutes permit recording if one party ( including you ) to the phone call or conversation consents. Other states require that all parties to the communication consent. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to tell which law applies to a communication, especially a phone call. For example, if you and the person you are recording are in different states, then it is difficult to say in advance whether federal or state law applies, and if state law applies which of the two ( or more ) relevant state laws will control the situation. Therefore, if you record a phone call with participants in more than one state, it is best to play it safe and get the consent of all parties. However, when you and",

The zika virus, carried by the aedes aegypti mosquito — which also spreads chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever — often doesn't show symptoms and can be misdiagnosed. But it's been tied to microcephaly, a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is underdeveloped, which can even cause death. Brazil has had a sudden surge in suspected microcephaly cases, with more than 2,400 this year ( 2014 only saw 147 cases ), per a bahia state health report. When doctors noticed the spike synced up with the zika virus popping up in brazil, they started paying attention: a late-november autopsy on a baby with microcephaly found evidence of zika, and many moms of babies with microcephaly reported symptoms during pregnancy ( e.g., fever and rashes ) that were consistent with zika fever. Scientists aren't sure what's made the virus migrate from where it was originally discovered in african forest monkeys more than 70 years ago to all over the world, including the influx in brazil starting in may, but they suspect climate change may play a part, per the washington post. Others speculate 2014 world cup spectators from asia or the south pacific may have brought it, cnn notes. ( lindsay lohan contracted the virus chikungunya from the same type of mosquito. )",

A decade ago, us military intelligence said that having a close family member involved in violent militancy was the biggest predictor of whether a person would get involved. The reasons likely have to do with multiple factors, including genetics and environment. \" neurobiological, personality, social, and cultural \" factors all contribute to terrorism, one neuropsychologist explains to discovery. There are two genes that increase a person's risk of being violent, recent research found, and it's possible those genes are inherited in families. Upbringing may also play a role — a study finds that children raised in unstable or abusive families are often desensitized to violence, not emotionally affected, for example, by witnessing violent acts like beheadings; obviously, brothers would have been raised in similar home environments. \" one brother is usually a stronger character and the leader of the two, \" the neuropsychologist explains. \" the other brother is a follower and is influenced by the leader-brother. The follower wants to please the leader and obtain the respect of the leader. \" counterterrorism experts point out that whether they're brothers or just friends, terrorists tend to form tight-knit groups, helping to radicalize each other as they conspire. In the case of the brussels bombings, a set of brothers from belarus were also named as attackers in the russian media, ukraine today reports, but they say that was simply a false rumor.

( photo: ammy shriver/times-west virginian via ap ) charleston, w.va. — west virginia public school teachers launched a statewide walkout thursday that canceled classes in all 55 counties, protesting over pay hikes signed by the governor hours earlier that the teachers say don't go far enough. Thousands of teachers and support staff converged at the gold domed capitol in charleston on thursday, seeking to pressure lawmakers who are still considering other proposals for them. It was their first statewide strike since 1990 in west virginia, where teacher pay ranks 48th in the nation. The walkout is scheduled for two days, and teachers say they're willing to go longer if need be. Chants of \"do your job so i can do mine \" reverberated throughout the capitol halls, along with other slogans including \"55 strong \" – a reference to the state's 55 counties. Gov. Jim justice on wednesday night signed a 2 percent raise next year for teachers, followed by 1 percent",
