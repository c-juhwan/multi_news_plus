        "summary": "Next time a big, blue tarantula comes crawling over, just ask yourself, \" why is it blue? \" at least that's what a group of researchers did, and they realized it's a tough question, national geographic reports. The verge reports there are at least 40 tarantula species that are colored blue; in this study, researchers analyzed eight. The species ranged from the critically endangered poecilotheria metallica to the big, aggressive, singapore-blue lampropelma violaceopes, and the researchers found the coloration appeared to evolve separately eight times in tarantulas. Even more fascinating, the color's source isn't a pigment, but rather nanocrystals in the spiders ' hair that reflect blue light — and the nanostructures aren't the same in every species. This suggests the trait \" it is not related to a different trait such as an ability to repel water, \" per a press release. \" the blue color definitely has a major function, and it's very specific why they need this color, \" says study co-author bor-kai hsiung — and attracting a mate likely isn't it. Tarantulas ' eight eyes don't see very well, so hsiung and his colleagues tossed that theory. Their conclusion? the blue \" might be a signal to predators, or maybe it's a blue that's not particularly bright in a rainforest environment … and it makes it harder to … track … the spider? \" study co-author todd blackledge tells the atlantic. \" it really is a situation where we've thrown our hands up. I ' m actually waving my hands as i ' m talking to you. \" on the upside, \" tarantula blue \" isn't iridescent — meaning it doesn't change hue at different angles — so it could show us how to build better screens for phones and tvs, the verge reports.

The unicef report warns that for syria's young generation, coping mechanisms and medical care are eroding quickly, driving children into child labor, early marriage, or combat. There were more than 850 confirmed cases of children being recruited as fighters.

Exposure can cause itching and pain, and at times swelling and fluid leakage when blood vessels are affected, the daily mail reports. Claire turner, 50, admits she was \" devastated \" when she learned her son sam had the hereditary condition, too — so severely that even low-energy light bulbs can cause him issues. \" we're like a vampire family — we can't come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark, \" she says. \" if i stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me. \" claire carefully plans their lives, seating them in restaurants away from windows and avoiding holidays in hot countries. \" it's hard for sam, \" she says. \" it's something we ' ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives. \" a small positive: they've received support from the british porphyria association and give talks there about dealing with the disease. Georgina davies, another british sufferer, spoke up in the guardian about how hard life is with epp — which even forces her to avoid tvs and computer screens, which also emit uv light. \" the emotional impact is the worst, \" she writes. \" while my marriage is strong \" and none of her four children have epp, \" not going out much means it's difficult to make friends, \" and the floppy hat, sunglasses, and gloves she often wears indoors \" make people think i ' m peculiar. \" at least, she says, she has gained physical strength by taking vitamin d pills and she's met others with the condition on facebook. \" for the first time, i have friends who truly get it. \"",

Alameda county — home to oakland and berkeley — is the latest to sign on, with sheriff greg ahern planning to buy a small, unmanned drone to help with things like search-and-rescue missions, swat operations, and pot busts, reports the oakland tribune. The cost would be somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000, but the faa still must approve. The ap says four other police agencies already have gotten faa approval to train employees to operate drones — miami, seattle, arlington, and mesa county, colorado, though only the latter has the green light to use them on a regular basis. The electronic frontier foundation, the aclu, and other privacy advocates are worried about flying cameras peering down on backyards and want alameda county to provide more details on how the drone might be used. Congress, meanwhile, has ordered the faa to come up with regulations by 2015.",

            "Drones aren't something most residents worry about on a day-to-day basis. But they may be flying over the skies of alameda county soon if sheriff gregory ahern gets his way. Ahern is looking at buying a surveillance drone, an unmanned aircraft system, for search and rescue missions, bomb threats, swat operations, marijuana grows, fires and natural disasters. But the proposal has already drummed up backlash from privacy advocates worried that drone technology is outpacing safeguards. So far alameda county has only tested them. Ahern is eyeing a unit weighing four pounds with a four-foot wing span in the $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 price range. He and his deputies will have the chance to test others next week at the urban shield regional disaster-preparedness exercises. The department, however, can't buy one until they receive federal aviation administration authorization. The units can be outfitted with high-powered cameras, thermal imaging devices, license plate readers and laser radar. Police and sheriffs already use some of those tools.

            "Drones aren't something most residents worry about on a day-to-day basis. But they may be flying over the skies of alameda county soon if sheriff gregory ahern gets his way. Ahern is looking at buying a surveillance drone, an unmanned aircraft system, for search and rescue missions, bomb threats, swat operations, marijuana grows, fires and natural disasters. But the proposal has already drummed up backlash from privacy advocates worried that drone technology is outpacing safeguards. So far alameda county has only tested them. Ahern is eyeing a unit weighing four pounds with a four-foot wing span in the $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 price range. He and his deputies will have the chance to test others next week at the urban shield regional disaster-preparedness exercises. The department, however, can't buy one until they receive federal aviation administration authorization. The units can be outfitted with high-powered cameras, thermal imaging devices, license plate readers and laser radar. Police and sheriffs already use some of those tools. However, combined with a hard-to-detect drone, they offer authorities unprecedented capabilities for mass surveillance using militarized equipment. \" the law hasn't caught up with the technology, \" said trevor timm of the electronic frontier foundation, a privacy rights group. \" there are no rules of the road for how they operate these things.",

Bad news, people born before 1968! you're a whole lot more likely to die from the h7n9 strain of bird flu. In a study published friday in science, dr. Michael worobey says the year people were born is \" ridiculously predictive \" of how protected they are from different bird flu strains, according to nbc news. People born before 1968 likely were infected with the h1 or h2 flu strains as children because those strains were prominent at the time. People born after 1968 were likely infected by the h3 strain for the same reason. Researchers say whichever strain of flu people had first permanently affected their immune system going forward. Prior to this study, scientists didn't think this process of \" immunological imprinting \" affected susceptibility to flu strains with animal origins, upi reports. That turns out not to be the case thanks to proteins shared by various flu strains. The study found that people have 75 % protection against becoming seriously ill and 80 % protection against dying from either h7n9 bird flu or h5n1 bird flu depending on the year of their birth. \" we have some kick-ass protection against one or the other, \" worobey tells the telegraph. That could explain why strains of bird flu haven't become the millions-killing pandemics some experts predicted. H7n9 and h5n1 have infected a little more than 1,300 people total since 2003, killing fewer than 600 of them. ( our bodies fight off illness far better in the mornings. )",

        "summary": "The study of humans has long relied on bones to reveal human dna. The problem is that those bones are hard to come by. As the atlantic points out, scientists have only a finger bone and two teeth belonging to the denisovans, cousins of neanderthals. It's no wonder then that a harvard geneticist refers to a new technique of recovering human dna without bones, described in a study published in science thursday, as a \" real revolution in technology, \" per the new york times. German researchers took dirt samples at seven cave sites in europe and asia where neanderthals or denisovans once lived. Four returned neanderthal dna, and one of the four sites contained denisovan dna, per a release, which notes many of the sediment samples were taken from archaeological layers or sites that hadn't previously yielded bones. \" it's a bit like discovering that you can extract gold dust from the air, \" as one geneticist puts it. Researchers had previously taken animal dna from sediment, but this study describes the first successful effort involving human dna. It involved collecting samples at sites where human bones or tools had been found and using molecules that recognize mammalian mitochondrial dna to \" fish out \" the material, which sticks to minerals in sediment. The implications are huge, say scientists, and one gives this potential use: probing the soil along the routes early americans took to get here via alaska. Study co-author svante pääbo sees a future in which the technique becomes \" routine. \" ( perhaps the technique could be of use in proving or disproving this highly contested claim. )",

Looking for these genetic signposts in sediment has become possible only in the last few years, with recent developments in technology, including rapid sequencing of dna. Photo although dna sticks to minerals and decayed plants in soil, scientists did not know whether it would ever be possible to fish out gene fragments that were tens of thousands of years old and buried deep among other genetic debris. Bits of genes from ancient humans make up just a minute fraction of the dna floating around in the natural world. But the german scientists, led by matthias meyer at the max planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen, have spent years developing methods to find dna even where it seemed impossibly scarce and degraded. \"there's been a real revolution in technology invented by this lab, \" dr.

But that doesn't make up for gabriel casseus'turn as the hero tenor anton, which is \" a source of distraction, \" or the other principal, christian camargo, who \" flatlines. \" incidentally, koehler's review was written in 2003. Yuck, writes aaron hillis of time out new york. Anton is \" one of the least believable, most saccharine images of mental retardation ever put on film. \" and, amazingly, the \" inanely convoluted, wanna-be urban fable now looks like a straight-to-video knockoff of the soloist. \"",

Now tmz has obtained the graphic surveillance video footage of the actual punch, which happened in february at the revel casino hotel inside the elevator. In the video, palmer is seen fighting back before rice decks her; she then falls and hits her head on the elevator handrail. The nfl said that the \" video was not made available to us and no one in our office has seen it until today, \" as per cbs sports. The league suspended rice for two games as punishment; criticism has since led the league to change the punishment to six games for a first offense. The couple have since married. Tmz runs down some of the outraged reaction to the video, including seth rogen, who tweeted, \" i don't know much about football, but i know that ray rice is a piece of garbage who shouldn't be allowed to play it professionally anymore. @nflcommish your punishment for beating a woman is less than for smoking weed. \"",

The luce x2 touch tv vending machine has facial-recognition technology, meaning it can, apparently, identify customers and remember their snacking profiles. That means, for instance, that it could offer you your favorite chips — or perhaps deny you an unhealthy snack based on your age or medical records, the telegraph reports. A gym could set up the machine to refuse fatty foods to people on diets, while a school could ensure that kids don't get cigarettes, the paper notes. Similar technology has been debuted by other companies; a version produced by software firm sap can even link to your social media accounts so you can give gifts to friends, tom's guide reported in march. ( said friend would then be alerted that a pack of m&ms could be picked up via code at any connected vending machine. ) but jezebel fears a \" potential nightmare \": for instance, \" what if you're 30 and the machine thinks you're 40 \" and denies foods accordingly? well, this isn't a big-brother situation, says a rep for luce x2 supplier smart vend solutions. \" it's not as if it's going to spy on you, \" he says, noting that users don't have to opt in to the data tracking system. The device was recently unveiled in the uk; whether it has a future in the us isn't yet certain, the los angeles times reports. As for sap's smart vending machines, a senior director interviewed by tom's saw chips and sodas as just the beginning; he said some companies have expressed interest in using the machines to get equipment to their employees. ( meanwhile, a comedy club in barcelona has been using facial recognition technology to charge visitors for each laugh. )",

The \" comforting \" trait is rare among animals, with dogs, chimps, and we humans among the few to have it. Researchers in thailand studying asian elephants saw the pattern time after time: when one elephant showed signs of distress ( think flared nostrils and an erect tail ), others would gather around to offer support. The supportive elephants would put their trunks in the stressed elephant's mouth, make noises akin to chirps, and touch the elephant's genitals ( but not in that way ), reports scientific american. \" genital touching is a way for elephants to identify others, and in this case, it may also be a way for the elephants to identify the behavioral state of the others, \" one of the co-authors says in the la times.

On july 14, acting on a tip from a doctor's office, police say they found the body of brooke skylar richardson's baby in a backyard in carlisle, ohio, about 40 miles north of cincinnati. One week later, on july 21, the warren county prosecutor charged richardson with homicide based on evidence that her infant \" was born alive and was not a stillborn baby, \" the dayton daily news reports. Investigators believe richardson killed her baby around may 7, though they are still waiting for a final report from the coroner's office on the cause of death. Police returned to the property july 20 and arrested richardson. They also searched for additional evidence around that time, including digging near a fire pit in the yard, wdtn reports. At richardson's arraignment on friday, the judge scheduled a preliminary hearing for aug. 1. Richardson had already entered a not-guilty plea, and the judge continued her $ 15,000 bond. If convicted, the recent high school graduate faces between one to five years in prison. After the arraignment, richardson's attorney, charles m. Rittgers, called his client a \" very good person. \" \" she didn't drink. She wasn't a partier or a smoker, \" rittgers said. \" by all measures a very good girl who helped children. \"",

        "summary": "A new study provides the first evidence that ants rescue members of their own colony post-battle even when those ants aren't in imminent danger, reports the guardian. The observation came about when biologist erik frank was watching army ants march out to battle termites in highly patterned formation — \" like three ants next to each other, in a 2-meter-long column, \" he tells npr — and he noticed some of the ants returned carrying other ants. Those ants, it turns out, weren't dead but injured, missing a leg or two or weighed down by a dead termite whose jaws were clamped onto them. \" this [ is ] behavior you don't expect to see in ants; you always imagine an individual ant as having no value for the colony and that they sacrifice themselves for the good of the colony, \" says frank. What's more, 95 % survived, and many returned to battle the very next day. So frank and colleagues at the university of würzburg in germany began to study this behavior more closely, and learned that one difference between soldiers on a battlefield and ants is \" these ants are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart, \" he says, but rather in response to the chemical signals sent off by their injured comrades. Reporting in the journal science advances, they note that the behavior does not occur on the way to battle, and not when injured ants are from outside colonies. There's another matter of practicality: they calculate that a colony size is 29 % larger when ants carry back their injured than when they don't. Outside researchers agree this is a form of natural selection. \" this is an army, \" one says. \" they're going off to attack the termites. It's a battle. And the more numerous you are, the more successful you are. \" ( ants were farmers well before humans. )",

Ford announced tuesday that it will release a fully autonomous vehicle in 2021 that needs no input from the driver. In fact, it needs no driver at all. The car will instead rely on a high-definition map to get around, reports mashable. While that means driving will be impossible in areas where high-definition mapping isn't available, ford says the cars will initially be used for ride-sharing in predetermined areas, so consumers can get comfortable with them before they're made widely available at a later date, reports the los angeles times. It's not clear if that will mean partnerships with companies such as uber and lyft. \" the next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago, \" says ceo mark fields. Volvo and bmw have also set 2021 as a target date for their own self-driving cars. To help get its project in motion, ford says it has acquired artificial intelligence company saips and is investing in 3d mapping companies. Ford — which expects to have 30 self-driving fusion hybrids on us roads by the end of the year — will also expand its palo alto research facility and double the number of its engineers and scientists, per the detroit free press.",

An applied linguistics professor thinks he's deciphered 14 characters from the famous voynich manuscript, and with them 10 complete words, livescience, the bbc, and the independent report. The 600-year-old illustrated text was re-discovered in 1912, but it's written in an unknown alphabet, and in the century since no one has been able to make heads or tails of it. Some have suggested it's an untranslatable medieval hoax. \" i hit on the idea of identifying proper names in the text, \" like those of stars and planets, researcher stephen bax explains. The same technique was once used to decipher egyptian hieroglyphs. After that, he could identify other words; pictures of corriander, hellebore, and juniper turned out to be labeled as such. \" my research shows conclusively that the manuscript is not a hoax, \" bax says. It \" is probably a treatise on nature. \" last year, another study suggested the same, demonstrating that the text follows linguistic rules.",

Nailah winkfield says jahi — who was declared brain dead in california after routine tonsil surgery in december 2013, when she was 13 — died in new jersey last week from excessive bleeding and liver failure after an operation to deal with an intestinal problem. Family attorney christopher dolan says a death certificate was issued in new jersey stating that jahi had been suffering from a brain injury since the 2013 operation, cnn reports. He says he will continue his pro bono work to have jahi's original death certificate revoked. With jahi on life support, the family moved to new jersey in 2014 so she could continue receiving care. Her mother said she showed occasional signs of life, including finger movements. A california judge ruled last fall that jahi, whose family is suing the hospital for medical malpractice, might still be alive. Dolan tells the san francisco chronicle that the new jersey death certificate will be proof the first one should be annulled. \" how do you issue a death certificate on someone who is already dead? \" he says. Winkfield, who sold her house in oakland to help pay for jahi's care, tells the ap that she's \" devastated by the loss of her daughter who had showed tremendous strength and courage, \" but she's glad jahi \" forced the world to rethink the issue of brain death. \" \" these last four-and-a-half years have not been easy, \" she says. \" i can go to sleep knowing i did everything possible for my kid, and no one can take that away from me. \"",

Usa today reports that military aviation and legal experts will on wednesday begin their inquiry; today, french and malaysian investigators will meet with an investigating judge. While a determination of whether the part belonged to the missing plane appears days off, reuters is digging into a possible clue-on-a-clue: if the debris does belong to the missing malaysia airlines flight, what appear to be goose or stalk barnacles affixed to it could reveal some of the plane's secrets. An analysis of their shells and their positioning on the debris could allow scientists to make determinations about the \" temperature and chemical composition \" of the water the barnacles traveled through and how the debris moved through it ( ie, above water or submerged ); from there, their source can be pinpointed — in a general way, at least. An australia phd student whose focus is the shell chemistry of barnacles suggests the best they could do is narrow the search area to, at the least, tens of kilometers. Still, \" it's very powerful stuff, \" william newman, a professor at the scripps institution of oceanography, tells bloomberg news: indeed, barnacles have been used to study the movement patterns of whales and turtles, have given up shipwreck secrets, provided info on enemy ships in wwii, and have even factored into murder investigations.

( photo: ap ) a piece of plane wing that could be from missing malaysia airlines flight 370 arrived saturday in toulouse, france, for inspection by military aviation experts. The 6-foot-long part, wrapped in a box and shipped as cargo, was flown from the small island of reunion, near madagascar, and then transported by truck to the french military site in southwestern france. A white van, accompanied by police motorcycles and a police car, delivered the component known as a flaperon to the dga ta aeronautical testing site. The wing part was found wednesday by a cleanup crew on a beach on reunion, a french island in the indian ocean. The experts, including a legal expert, will start their inquiry on wednesday, according to the paris prosecutor's office, the associated press reported. On monday, an investigating judge will meet with",
            "Sydney ( reuters ) - barnacles encrusted on a piece of plane debris that washed up on the french island of reunion might help unravel the mystery of missing malaysia airlines mlyaf.pk flight mh370 that disappeared last year with 239 passengers and crew on board. Malaysia said on sunday the piece of debris, a 2-2.5 meter ( 6.5-8 feet ) wing surface known as flaperon, had been identified as being from a boeing ( ba.n ) 777, the same model as the missing malaysian plane. Investigators in france are expected to determine whether the piece came from mh370 or not by wednesday. Mh370 is believed to have crashed in the southern indian ocean, about 3,700 km ( 2,300 miles ) away from reunion. Based on photographs, ecologists in australia believe the crustaceans clinging to the wing piece are goose or stalk barnacles. \"barnacle shells... Can tell us valuable information about the water conditions under which they were formed, \" said ryan pearson, a phd student at australia's griffith university who is studying the shell chemistry of barnacles to determine migration patterns of endangered loggerhead turtles. The technique is also used to study the movement of whales. Experts analyze barnacle shells to determine the temperature and chemical composition of the water through which they passed to help reveal their origin. While the technique could help narrow the area of the search for mh370"

Those and basal cell carcinomas ( bccs ) are the two most common types of skin cancer but are less deadly than no. 3 on that list, per the cdc: melanoma. The intention of this study was to see if the vaccine ( whose primary role is to protect against cervical cancer ) might offer a protective role against developing new carcinomas in patients with healthy immune systems. The upshot: it looks like it. The man and woman were given three doses of the hpv vaccine in 2013, and then received full-body skin exams every three months for up to 16 months after first dose. Prior to the vaccinations, the man experienced an average 12 new sccs and 2.25 new bccs per year; the woman; 5.5 new sccs and 0.92 new bccs. Post-vaccines, neither developed new bccs, and they experienced 62.5 % and 66.5 % drops in new sccs, respectively. \" these findings highlight the possibility that cutaneous scc development, and perhaps bcc development, may be driven in part by hpv, \" the researchers write.

The company insists that its product is used only by governments to fight terrorism and crime, but dissidents and journalists in other nations, including qatar and mexico, say repressive governments are increasingly using it to rein in opposition figures. The software works by sending a link to a victim; once clicked, the person's texts become exposed. ( the prince himself sent at least 11 messages to his top security aide in the hours before and after khashoggi's murder. )",

The 19th-century serial killer, born herman webster mudgett, had fashioned a 100-plus-room house of horrors well-equipped for making people disappear: a building of soundproof, windowless rooms; gas vents controlled from holmes ' bedroom that could be used to asphyxiate guests; and a macabre basement complete with a dissecting table. As for what he allegedly did with the bodies — he confessed to killing 27 or 28 — the washington post reports many were stripped down to bone via acid or some other means and the skeletons then sold to medical schools. But it's questions about holmes ' own body that is spurring the exhumation of his remains in suburban philadelphia. Three years after the fair, holmes was hanged there after murdering his business partner. But rumors that he conned his way out of death have persisted: some said he was able to swap places with another inmate; the chicago tribune reports others believed he convinced guards to instead hang a cadaver and planned to flee to south america. Now, at the request of three great-grandchildren who have supplied their dna, those remains will be exhumed from the holy cross cemetery in yeadon and tested by the university of pennsylvania's anthropology department. One who isn't expecting a surprise: erik larson, who wrote about the killer in his 2003 best-seller the devil in the white city. \" i have absolute confidence the body in that grave is holmes, \" he tells the ap.

Qualcomm said monday that it's in a unique position to grow on its own. \" we are highly confident that the strategy ( ceo steve mollenkopf ) and his team are executing on provides far superior value to qualcomm shareholders than the proposed offer, \" said tom horton, qualcomm director. Broadcom's bid last week represented a 28 percent premium over the closing price of qualcomm shares on november 2, but analysts were expecting qualcomm to reject the $ 70-per-share bid.

The country has issued a ban on witch doctors to try to stem such murders, which officials say are carried out for black-magic purposes, reuters reports. Officials accuse witch doctors of convincing people to bring them those who suffer from albinism — an inherited disorder that decreases or eliminates the pigment melanin, affecting skin, eye, and hair color — so they can grind the body parts with herbs and other elements to make good-luck charms and spells. The going price for albino body parts in tanzania is about $ 600, while an entire body is worth about $ 75,000, the afp reports. About 1 out of every 1,400 people has albinism in tanzania, compared to 1 in 37,000 in the us, per the harvard international review. Two reasons have been cited for this high number: it's believed the albinism genetic mutation originated in this region of east africa, and albinos tend to marry each other because of ostracization, increasing their chance of having albino children, npr notes. The bbc reports that 70 albinos have been killed in tanzania in the past three years, followed by only 10 murder convictions, though reuters and afp cite un stats showing about 70 murders over the last 10 or 15 years. Either way, mathias chikawe, the country's home affairs minister, says a task force has been set up to nab persistent witch doctors, especially in five areas where albino abductions happen most.

Big difference: that jet had no passengers aboard, but the circumstances surrounding its disappearance are pretty strange nonetheless. Two mechanics — american ben charles padilla and congolese assistant john mikel mutantu — boarded the boeing 727 on a luanda airstrip to get it in shape for its next flight. Neither had a pilot's license, which is why flight controllers were stunned when the plane taxied to the runway and then took off. Was it padilla? mutantu? both? hijackers who had slipped aboard? investigators still don't know, and no sign of the plane has turned up despite an intense international hunt. Some of the theories being tossed around in regard to flight 370 — it crashed into the ocean, it landed secretly, it got shot down by some nation's military — were similarly floated back then. But \" we may never know for sure where it went, \" concluded an earlier investigation by air &amp; space magazine. It was at the time the largest aircraft to go missing, but the malaysian jet will take that distinction if it doesn't turn up.",

Abbasi davani's announcement is sure to complicate future nuclear talks between iran and western powers, the times notes. Suspension of uranium enrichment was a central demand in several united nations security council resolutions. \"we have no reason to retreat from producing the 20 % because we need 20 % uranium just as much to meet our needs, \" abbasi davani was quoted as saying.

If the talks fail, the powers are planning to tighten sanctions on iranian exports and financial dealings as early as july 1, including placing an embargo on all sales of iranian oil to europe. Iran's enrichment of uranium is at the center of those discussions, with western countries suspecting the country of stockpiling enriched uranium that could be rapidly converted into weapons-grade material. Iran says it only wants to produce civilian nuclear energy. Before the meeting in baghdad, mr. Abbasi had hinted that iran was ready to compromise on its program of enriching uranium up to 20 percent with the isotope capable of sustaining nuclear fission, which it says it needs to fuel an aging united states-designed medical reactor. Iranian negotiators were under the impression that the obama administration and its allies, in return, were willing to allow iran to continue to enrich up to a lower percentage. But during the baghdad meeting it became clear that such an offer was not on the table, at least for now. Instead, the world powers offered another proposal, which called for iran to export its stockpile",

Egypt's first freely elected leader has been held at an undisclosed location since the army removed him from power on july 3, but has not yet been charged with any crime. In recent days, washington has called for him to be freed and for the authorities to stop arresting leaders of his muslim brotherhood. The public prosecutor's office said in a statement it had received complaints against mursi, eight other named islamist figures including the brotherhood's leader, mohamed badie, and others it did not identify. The military says it deposed mursi in a justified response to popular demand after millions of people demonstrated against him. The brotherhood says it was a coup that reversed democracy. Turmoil in the most populous arab state has alarmed the united states and other western donors. Egypt straddles the suez canal and signed a u.s.-brokered peace treaty with israel in 1979. Complaints such as those against mursi are a first step in the criminal process, allowing prosecutors to begin an investigation that can lead to charges.

The us has called for his release from detention at an unknown location. Egypt's interim leader adly mansour has promised new elections early next year. Dozens of people have died in clashes during major demonstrations by pro- and anti-morsi protesters in the past few weeks.

            "Cairo egypt announced a criminal investigation on saturday against deposed islamist president mohamed mursi, with prosecutors saying they were examining complaints of spying, inciting violence and ruining the economy. Egypt's first freely elected leader has been held at an undisclosed location since the army removed him from power on july 3, but has not yet been charged with any crime. In recent days, washington has called for him to be freed and for the authorities to stop arresting leaders of his muslim brotherhood. The public prosecutor's office said in a statement it had received complaints against mursi, eight other named islamist figures including the brotherhood's leader, mohamed badie, and others it did not identify. The military says it deposed mursi in a justified response to popular demand after millions of people demonstrated against him. The brotherhood says it was a coup that reversed democracy. Turmoil in the most populous arab state has alarmed the united states and other western donors. Egypt straddles the suez canal and signed a u.s.-brokered peace treaty with israel in 1979. Complaints such as those against mursi are a first step in the criminal process, allowing prosecutors to begin an investigation that can lead to charges. Announcing the step was unusual: typically prosecutors wait until charges are filed. The prosecutors did not say who had made the complaints. Egyptian law allows",

Soon after, lomas found brown in the tub and gordon \" ran in and administered cpr, \" says tmz. \" we're told max claims nick allegedly cleaned up the home and removed blood stains. \" police have reportedly interviewed gordon and lomas, but lomas wants immunity before consenting to another interview sought by investigators. And nick gordon is said to have \" lawyered up. \" two days ago, cnn reported that father bobby brown's lawyer said, \" we are currently investigating the events that led to ( her ) hospitalization. \" what's more, police had responded to report of a fight at brown's residence on jan. 23, but nobody answered the door and police saw no signs of an altercation.

Sunny was last seen monday evening and was discovered missing by zoo staff tuesday morning. Staff started by searching the zoo, even recruiting police to use a geothermal camera to scan for the animal, but sunny may have made it into the wider world. Staff are now searching neighborhoods within a mile of the zoo and are asking residents to pitch in by scanning treetops or any other \" climbable structure. \" the zoo set up a tip line but has so far mostly received calls from people spotting raccoons, the virginian-pilot reports. Red pandas are reddish-brown and about the size of a raccoon. According to usa today, they're endangered — with fewer than 10,000 left in the world — and mostly active at night. They're also apparently really good at escaping from zoos. In fact, a different red panda escaped from the virginia zoo twice within in a month of being introduced there in 2007. It was returned both times. The zoo says it's red panda breeding season, which may have contributed to sunny's escape. Red pandas can act \" abnormal \" or \" hyperactive \" during this time.

        "summary": "President obama has called the boston marathon bombings terrorism, but apparently insurance companies aren't inclined to agree. After 9/11, congress enacted the terrorism risk insurance program to help stabilize terrorism insurance premiums, and under that federal law, treasury secretary jack lew must certify violent incidents as an \" act of terrorism, \" along with secretary of state john kerry and ag eric holder. However, no such certificate has been issued for the boston bombings, and with property damage expected to be less than the $ 5 million threshold, lew cannot certify the attack, reports the wall street journal. But while property damage may not rise above $ 5 million, medical costs could easily top $ 9 million, says nbc news. Boston's hospitals have been lauded for the amazing job they did in treating more than 180 wounded, but that sort of response costs big money, and the prosthetic devices and rehabilitation that will be needed will increase costs even more over time. Each emergency room visit costs an estimated $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 and longer-term hospitalizations can cost upward of $ 200,000. Hospitals might reduce their rates for some hardship cases or not bill entirely, but administrators say they have not begun to think about costs. \"this is going to be really expensive, \" says one health economist.",

The precise health-care price tag won't be fully known for months as some of the injured, particularly those who lost limbs, undergo extended rehabilitation ( which can cost more than $ 200 per hour ) to re-learn walking. Much also depends on whether mental-health experts begin to see witnesses or survivors who struggle with post traumatic stress disorder. \"some of these people suffered very severe injuries.

Social conservatives. On monday, the party adopted a platform that some are calling the most conservative ever, the ap reports. Christian conservatives praised it for being \" the most pro-life platform ever, \" and for opposing same-sex marriage and bathroom choice for transgender individuals.

Defense attorney bob hinton's text indicated manziel's legal team was seeking a plea deal with prosecutors, but suggested that could be tricky. \" heaven help us if one of the conditions is to pee in a bottle, \" the attorney wrote. The errant text was sent wednesday after the ap sought comment via text about monday night's crash. When asked about the text, hinton said he had meant to send it to co-counsel jim darnell and was unaware the ap had received it instead. He insisted the contents were protected by attorney-client privilege and threatened to sue if certain details were published. On friday, manziel's father, paul, told espn.com his son has refused repeated efforts to help him. \" i don't know what to say other than my son is a druggie and he needs help, \" he said. \" if i have to bury him, i ' ll bury him. That's the fact. So if not, if he calls me and needs help, i ' ll go get him. Until then, he's on his own. I've done everything i can do. \" the 23-year-old was dropped by the cleveland browns in march.",

Three survived and one remains missing in hildale — home of the warren jeffs polygamist sect. Three sisters, della johnson and naomi and josephine jessop, are among the dead and the latter two were married to the same man, joseph n. Jessop, he tells the salt lake tribune. The remaining victims of what is thought to be the deadliest single weather event in the state, all children aged 4 to perhaps their early teens, have not been identified, reports the spectrum. Elsewhere, at least four others, aged 40 to 50, were killed while canyoneering in zion national park's keyhole canyon, cnn reports. Three from the group are missing. The hildale victims had been watching the flooding from a park which sits in a canyon, the mayor says. On their way home, they came across a flooded wash — connected to the short creek wash, which serves as a drainage ditch — and exited their vehicles to get a better look. Suddenly, \" a huge flow of debris and water … came onto the street behind them and washed them into the ravine, and the dropoff there is 20, 30 feet. So the witnesses say the vehicles were just gone, \" the mayor says, per cnn. A witness adds the water rose seven feet in 30 seconds. \" it was a wall, \" he says. \" it was boom, boom, boom. \" the victims ' bodies were found two to seven miles away, some with only hands or feet sticking out of the muddy river bank.

That's because neither party is still talking about extending the 2-year-old payroll tax cut, which expires on monday, reports the new york times. As a result, the social security payroll tax will go back to 6.2 % from the current 4.2 % — meaning a household earning $ 50,000 a year will pay an additional $ 1,000 in taxes, or about 20 bucks a week.",

            "Washington — senate leaders and their aides spent saturday searching for a formula to extend tax cuts for most americans that could win bipartisan support in the senate and final approval in the fractious house by the new year, hoping to prevent large tax increases and budget cuts that could threaten the fragile economy. As part of the last-minute negotiations, the lawmakers were haggling over unemployment benefits, cuts in medicare payments to doctors, taxes on large inheritances and how to limit the impact of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel income tax system that is intended to ensure the rich pay a fair share but that is increasingly encroaching on the middle class. President obama said that if talks between the senate leaders broke down, he wanted the senate to schedule an up-or-down vote on a narrower measure that would extend only the middle-class tax breaks and unemployment benefits. The senate majority leader, harry reid of nevada, said he would schedule such a vote on monday absent a deal. If congress is unable to act before the new year, washington will effectively usher in a series of automatic tax increases and a program of drastic spending cuts that economists say could pitch the country back into recession. The president and lawmakers put those spending cuts in place this year as draconian incentives that would force them to confront the nation's growing debt. Now, lawmakers are trying to keep them from happening, though it seemed most likely on saturday that the cuts, known as sequestration, would be left for the next congress, to be sworn in this week. \"we just can't afford a politically self-inflicted wound to our economy, \" mr. Obama said saturday in his weekly address. \"the housing market is healing, but that could stall if folks are seeing smaller paychecks. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2008,",

The senate majority leader, harry reid of nevada, said he would schedule such a vote on monday absent a deal. If congress is unable to act before the new year, washington will effectively usher in a series of automatic tax increases and a program of drastic spending cuts that economists say could pitch the country back into recession. The president and lawmakers put those spending cuts in place this year as draconian incentives that would force them to confront the nation's growing debt. Now, lawmakers are trying to keep them from happening, though it seemed most likely on saturday that the cuts, known as sequestration, would be left for the next congress, to be sworn in this week. \"we just can't afford a politically self-inflicted wound to our economy, \" mr. Obama said saturday in his weekly address. \"the housing market is healing, but that could stall if folks are seeing smaller paychecks. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2008,",

A cut to the payroll-tax rate, in place for the past two years, expires on monday. And the idea of extending the tax break has dropped out of year-end negotiations between the white house and congress over how to avoid the fiscal cliff, the $ 500 billion in combined tax increases and spending cuts set to begin next week.

The company says a plant near detroit will make new jeep grand wagoneers and a plant in toledo will make new jeep pickups, cnbc reports. In a statement, the company said it is \" demonstrating its commitment to strengthening its us manufacturing base, and aligning us capacity to extend the jeep product lineup \" amid rising demand for bigger vehicles. Sources tell the detroit free press that the company is also considering shifting some production of ram pickups from michigan to mexico. Fiat says the move is the second part of a plan to reshuffle production around north america, and insiders tell reuters that the decision had nothing to do with trump's recent attacks on gm and toyota for plans to expand production in mexico, though the timing of the announcement was apparently intended to deflect criticism from the president-elect. The north american international auto show began on saturday and other automakers announcing us investments included volkswagen, which says it will start building its new atlas suv in tennessee this year, though the move isn't trump-related. \" we do not make our investment decisions based on administrative cycles. Our business is really an 8-, 12-, 14-year horizon when we look at investments, \" hinrich woebcken, the company's north america chief, tells reuters.",

        "summary": "Australia's reef hq aquarium had hoped to scale back its shark breeding program. Its female sharks had other ideas. Over the course of six years, leonie the zebra or leopard shark had produced more than two dozen offspring before she was separated from her mate in 2012. But in 2016, leonie — who hadn't been introduced to another male — laid eggs that produced hatchlings, reports new scientist. While sharks are known to store sperm for up to four years, per the guardian, these hatchlings contained dna from leonie only. In essence, she made the offspring herself, marking the first time a switch from sexual to asexual reproduction had been witnessed among sharks, researchers explain in scientific reports. Asexual reproduction itself is not unheard of, with species including snakes, rays, turkeys, komodo dragons, and, of course, sharks known to be capable of it. But it usually occurs only when the females have had no male partners. ( in fact, one of leonie's offspring who'd never shared a tank with a male also produced hatchlings. ) only two other animals, a boa constrictor and an eagle ray, have been known before leonie to have switched from sexual to asexual reproduction. That was a \" really big surprise, \" researcher christine dudgeon tells the brisbane times. It's likely a trait used only in extreme circumstances because any offspring would be at a disadvantage with only their mother's dna. \" having half of this genetic diversity means they are probably not able to continue this lineage very far into the future, \" says dudgeon.

John boehner pulled the measure from the floor at the last minute, knowing he didn't have enough votes. The speaker, however, then took the unusual step of delaying congress'summer recess, which had been scheduled to begin tomorrow. House republicans agreed to meet again in the morning to see if they could find a bill that could pass. And all of this transpired on day one for boehner's new leadership team, sans eric cantor. Conservatives such as ted cruz balked at the house plan because they say it didn't deal with the problem of kids from central america showing up at the border, reports the washington post. They're also reluctant to give president obama any money for a problem they believed to be of his own making. Politico's take: \" the political impact of this decision is not clear, but if the house doesn't vote, democrats will be able to say that the gop left washington for an entire month without passing legislation to address the influx of migrants. \" ( click for more on cantor's final address to the house. )",

            "A genetic test that can predict whether a person is likely to live long enough to see their 100th birthday has been developed by scientists. Researchers at boston university claim the test can identify those who can look forward to an exceptionally long life with 77 % accuracy. They designed the test after a major study into the genetic makeup of centenarians highlighted a host of dna variants that boost a person's chances of reaching a ripe old age. Many of the genetic markers the scientists found stave off common, and often lethal, age-related diseases, such as heart disease, dementia and high blood pressure. The us researchers investigated the genetic secrets of a longer life after studies showed that living beyond 100 often runs in families. \" these families might share healthy lifestyles, but it also suggests there is a strong genetic background to exceptional longevity, \" said professor paola sebastiani, a biostatistician at boston university school for public health. Lifespan is governed by a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment, with factors like smoking, diet, exercise and pollution all having a role, but many scientists believe that living beyond the mid-90s is largely down to having good genes. Sebastiani and colleagues scanned the genomes of 1,055 centenarians and compared them with scans from 1,267 normal, healthy people. They found 150 dna variants that were more",

Johnson globe staff leominster -- five months shy of his 100th birthday, louis charpentier still rises every day at 9 a.m. To spend hours in his basement shop, carving delicate wooden figurines. Years after most people's bodies and minds have failed, charpentier climbs stairs with ease and recalls everything from the latest episode of \" dr. Phil \" to the first train he ever saw, carrying soldiers who fought in world war i. For years, scientists have been fascinated by people like charpentier, who have not only a rich trove of experience, but are also biological outliers that scientists are studying to begin to unlock the secrets of longevity. Now, using cutting-edge genomics techniques on a group of 1,055 people born near the turn of the last century, a team of scientists from boston university has identified a genetic signature of longevity. In work published online today by the journal science, researchers reported that 150 spots in the genome are associated with extremely long life, and can be used to predict with 77 percent accuracy whether someone is likely to live to be exceptionally old. \" exceptional longevity is not this vacuous entity that no one can figure out.

            "A genetic test that can predict whether a person is likely to live long enough to see their 100th birthday has been developed by scientists. Researchers at boston university claim the test can identify those who can look forward to an exceptionally long life with 77 % accuracy. They designed the test after a major study into the genetic makeup of centenarians highlighted a host of dna variants that boost a person's chances of reaching a ripe old age. Many of the genetic markers the scientists found stave off common, and often lethal, age-related diseases, such as heart disease, dementia and high blood pressure. The us researchers investigated the genetic secrets of a longer life after studies showed that living beyond 100 often runs in families. \" these families might share healthy lifestyles, but it also suggests there is a strong genetic background to exceptional longevity, \" said professor paola sebastiani, a biostatistician at boston university school for public health. Lifespan is governed by a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment, with factors like smoking, diet, exercise and pollution all having a role, but many scientists believe that living beyond the mid-90s is largely down to having good genes. Sebastiani and colleagues scanned the genomes of 1,055 centenarians and compared them with scans from 1,267 normal, healthy people. They found 150 dna variants that were more",
            "By carolyn y. Johnson globe staff leominster -- five months shy of his 100th birthday, louis charpentier still rises every day at 9 a.m. To spend hours in his basement shop, carving delicate wooden figurines. Years after most people's bodies and minds have failed, charpentier climbs stairs with ease and recalls everything from the latest episode of \" dr. Phil \" to the first train he ever saw, carrying soldiers who fought in world war i. For years, scientists have been fascinated by people like charpentier, who have not only a rich trove of experience, but are also biological outliers that scientists are studying to begin to unlock the secrets of longevity. Now, using cutting-edge genomics techniques on a group of 1,055 people born near the turn of the last century, a team of scientists from boston university has identified a genetic signature of longevity. In work published online today by the journal science, researchers reported that 150 spots in the genome are associated with extremely long life, and can be used to predict with 77 percent accuracy whether someone is likely to live to be exceptionally old. \" exceptional longevity is not this vacuous entity that no one can figure out. I think we've made quite some inroads here in terms of demonstrating a pretty important genetic component to this wonderful trait, \" said dr. Thomas perls,"

Forensic officers examined the site for hours yesterday beneath a white tent that shielded their work from view. According to portuguese media, the area, a 5-foot by 3-foot shaft covered by an iron sheet and mounds of dirt, was once a storage box where children played; the sheet is believed to have shielded the shaft from view for years. That's not the only potential lead uncovered in the 15-acre lot in praia da luz. Detectives also found a grave-like hole, but newspaper correia da manhã reports officers said it was \" not compatible with that of a body. \" manholes some 20 feet from that site are apparently being explored as well. The search using sniffer dogs and ground-penetrating radar was expected to end this week but will probably stretch into a second. Scotland yard has requested an extra seven days and is awaiting portuguese police approval, the bbc reports, noting that could mean \" a significant find. \" officers have also been approved to check out two other sites.
