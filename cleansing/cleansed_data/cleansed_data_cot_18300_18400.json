        "summary": "On the off chance you're given to believing every sky-is-falling theory you run across on facebook, the one about a planetary alignment triggering a massive earthquake this week is absolute nonsense. Gizmodo traces the latest to a video from a guy named frank in the netherlands — under the name of ditrianum media — who claims a 9.8 magnitude earthquake will occur on north america's west coast tomorrow because he \"received an important message \" to that effect \"directly from spirit \" in august 2013. The man says recent earthquakes in tonga and the soloman islands are proof of an imminent \"big one \" that will be caused by the alignment of the sun, mercury, and saturn between earth and the moon. For one thing, earthquakes happen all the time, gizmodo notes. But more importantly, it's impossible for a planetary alignment to cause an earthquake. The idea is that the combined gravity of the planets could influence earthquakes, but even under ideal conditions, the planets would have less gravitational pull on the earth than the moon, which \"at very best has an extremely weak influence on earthquakes, \" writes phil plait at slate. And even the alignment is bogus. The software used to display the alignment in the video was adjusted to show exaggerated planet sizes. When the same software is switched to a \"realistic \" view, the alignment disappears, at least as far as its relation to earth and the moon, reports weather network. What of claims an asteroid will smash into earth on sept. 24? a single asteroid is known to be flying by earth on that date; it will be 5 million miles away.

Fulton county sheriff roy miller says james dean worley, 57, was arrested early friday, people reports. He has been charged with abduction and the sheriff believes more charges will follow. On saturday, miller announced that remains believed to be joughin's were found friday night in rural northwest ohio, the ap reports. No further details on the body were given. The toledo blade reports that worley has a chilling criminal record: in 1990, he pleaded guilty to kidnapping another female cyclist, who managed to escape after worley drove his truck into her bike, causing her to fall into a ditch, and then hit her on the head and dragged her into his vehicle. According to court records seen by the blade, worley handcuffed the 1990 victim but she managed to break free and was rescued by a passing motorcyclist. Worley served three years in prison for the abduction and was released on parole in 1993. Joughin's bike was found in a cornfield earlier this week — along with what police say were signs of a struggle. Worley has a rural property a few miles from metamora, where joughin was last seen, and investigators spent friday searching it. Earth-moving equipment was seen at the site and divers were seen searching a pond on the property. Wtvg reports that investigators say worley isn't talking.",

The advancement centers on the fact that in normal walking, the calf muscle has to do work beyond just moving us forward, a press release notes. It also works like a clutch on the achilles tendon — a process which, of course, uses precious energy. \" it's as if every time you push on the brake pedal in your car, you burn a little bit of gas, \" researcher steve collins says. The boot helps handle this work with its own mechanical clutch that engages when the wearer's foot touches the ground; it releases again when the foot is lifted. The washington post compares the process to the working of a catapult. Previous efforts have led to other devices to assist with walking, but this one is particularly remarkable because it doesn't need outside power, the verge reports. It's also extremely lightweight and fits in a running shoe. \" our study shows that walking, a highly evolved human task, can be improved by man-made technology and engineering, \" another researcher notes. More work is needed, collins tells the bbc, but \" someday soon we may have simple, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive exoskeletons to help us get around, especially if we've been slowed down by injury or aging. \" ( meanwhile, our phones could help fix vision problems. )",

Perhaps that is why hawk was so very fired up when he sacked st. Louis quarterback sam bradford early in the second quarter of the packers'demolition of the rams. As part of his sack celebration, hawk flipped his middle finger at someone. The act was caught by the cbs cameras and will surely earn the six-year veteran a fine. Seeing as how hawk was gesturing toward his own sideline it's possible that this finger wasn't flipped in anger. But that distinction probably won't make any difference to nfl commissioner roger goodell."

Novichok was first produced by the soviet union during the cold war. \"a small bottle was recovered during searches of charlie rowley's house in amesbury, \" says a police statement. \"scientists have now confirmed to us that the substance contained within the bottle is novichok. \" in order to determine if the agent that sickened the skirpals is connected to the sturgess case, experts will reportedly test for impurities left behind in the production process and see if the samples match up. Neil basu, head of uk counter terrorism policing, said in a statement that the discovery of the bottle was a \" significant and positive development. \" however, basu said he wasn't sure yet whether there was enough of the substance left to test. Officials in the uk have blamed russia for the poisoning of the skirpals, though russia has rejected the accusation. The uk nonetheless expelled 23 russian diplomats from the country in response.",

In the harshest official policy on race and land reform in a country that has been close to bankruptcy, the 90-year old autocrat said wednesday that whites may no longer own any land in zimbabwe. Whites would still be allowed to own businesses and urban apartments. Speaking to farmers in mhangura, a small mining town about 120 miles north of the capital harare, mr. Mugabe said all remaining white farmers should leave – and closed the door even on white families renting farms from black owners, as some several hundred have been doing since most were violently chased away a decade ago. \"i have been given a list of 35 white farmers in mashonaland west alone, \" mr. Mugabe told an emotional crowd in what was billed a patriotic speech. \"we say no to whites owning our land and they should go. … they can own companies and apartments … but not the soil.

            "Zimbabwe president robert mugabe has ordered the nation's remaining white farmers to be booted off their farms in order that the land be given to black zimbabweans. In the harshest official policy on race and land reform in a country that has been close to bankruptcy, the 90-year old autocrat said wednesday that whites may no longer own any land in zimbabwe. Whites would still be allowed to own businesses and urban apartments. Speaking to farmers in mhangura, a small mining town about 120 miles north of the capital harare, mr. Mugabe said all remaining white farmers should leave – and closed the door even on white families renting farms from black owners, as some several hundred have been doing since most were violently chased away a decade ago. \"i have been given a list of 35 white farmers in mashonaland west alone, \" mr. Mugabe told an emotional crowd in what was billed a patriotic speech. \"we say no to whites owning our land and they should go. … they can own companies and apartments … but not the soil. It is ours and that message should ring loud and clear in britain and the united states. \" the policy seemed chilling to many here. Barnabas thondlana, editor of \"the observer, \" a weekly, told the monitor that, \"i strongly and vigorously denounce someone who expects me to hate someone",

        "summary": "It can be tough for ex-inmates to stay out of trouble when they get out prison, but for those with drug problems or battling mental illness in massachusetts, the transition is even more of a struggle, per a piece by the boston globe's spotlight team. A department of correction study of prisoners released from state prisons in 2012 shows within three years of release, 37 % of those with mental illnesses get sent back, as do more than half of those with addictions — and if they have both issues, that number climbs. The problem starts in the state prisons themselves, which have suffered from decreased funding for mental health care in recent years ( especially since a for-profit company took over health care services in 2013 ), and it continues into the real world, where prisoners are sent with few skills or resources, leaving them hard-pressed to find decent housing and work and at risk for recidivism. One case study in the piece: that of nick lynch, diagnosed with add and bipolar disorder and first incarcerated at the age of 18. While imprisoned, lynch's illness worsened, exacerbated by long stints spent in solitude, a drug problem that wasn't treated, and little access to meds. Help came only when lynch tried to kill himself near the end of his sentence. Once released at age 26, trying to navigate his mental illness and addiction problems on his own, with his dad desperately trying to help, lynch spiraled out of control again, enjoying just 103 days of freedom before he was charged with attempted murder and started the incarceration cycle all over. \" my brain and will used to be strong, dad, \" he wrote to his father in 2014. \" but instead of growing stronger through my prison experience, i grow weaker. \" now 30, he's due out of prison sometime next year.

Now a doctor says he may have uncovered the secret to mary todd lincoln's behavior: a vitamin deficiency. Interestingly, this latest theory in perspectives in biology and medicine comes from cardiologist john g. Sotos, who helped come up with all those strange diseases decoded on the tv show house, per the new york times. In what might as well be a plot from the show, sotos was researching abraham lincoln — whom he suspects had a genetic syndrome that led to cancer — when he found an 1852 letter describing mrs. Lincoln's sore mouth and set out to discover what ailed her. His theory? she suffered from pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease \" that impairs the body's ability to absorb food efficiently, \" says sotos, per cbs news. Sufferers become b12-deficient, and a lack of b12 can cause a wide range of health problems — including a sore tongue. It can wreak havoc on the entire body over time, reports the washington post. \" you get a long list of symptoms, \" from headaches to irritability and hallucinations, sotos says. \" mary had just about all of them. \" the first lady — who spent months in a mental hospital in later life — also had \" a wide face, wide jaw, and widely separated blue eyes, \" as do many with pernicious anemia, he writes. What's more, her ancestors came from an area of scotland where the disease was once prevalent. One doctor calls sotos'study \" ingenious, \" though there's no proof he's correct. But sotos simply hopes historians cut mrs. Lincoln some slack. \" to have done as well as she did with the kind of handicaps that she had, i think that deserves admiration. \" ( someone stole abraham lincoln's hand. )",

They are dispersed efficiently in rural and exurban house districts, and reside disproportionately in small states that have more per capita voting power in the senate. All these things give the republican coalition, even as it remains unable to muster a presidential majority, unassailable control of congress. The midterm elections did not alter this bifurcated structure. Instead, they exposed a grim reality for liberals.

Though the company does not reveal a price, number of shares, or date for its offering, it does offer insight into its financials. Linkedin generated $ 120 million in revenue for 2009, and $ 161 million through the first nine months of 2010, where it also turned a profit with a net income of about $ 10 million.

Cargo flights have been operating at the airport since 2010, but that completion date likely won't occur until 2027, a roughly 10-year delay spawned by the area's financial crisis. Located in jebel ali, the dubai government-owned airport is expect to cost around $ 33 billion to construct. And the government has big hopes for it, as made plain by its airport code: dwc, for dubai world central. The first commercial plane to arrive was hungary's wizz air; gulf air, from bahrain, also touched down at the airport yesterday. Al maktoum is set to have five runways, though just one is currently operating, and only three carriers have signed up so far ( jazeera airways is the third ). Just 100 passengers were on the wizz air flight, the ap notes, but the airport will eventually be able to handle 160 million passengers each year. Some 63 % of them will be in transit, says the ceo of dubai airports, the site's operator. Last year, the leading busiest airport, hartsfield-jackson atlanta international, saw 95 million passengers. Al maktoum will also deal with 12 million tons of cargo per year, cnn reports.",

The australian writer checked the contents of that folder last week and read one that smacked of a hoax: a yale university employee had \" good news \" and needed her phone number, reports the sydney morning herald. It turned out to be the real deal, what australia's abc describes as \" one of the richest literary awards in the world. \" yale was trying to convey the good news that garner's nonfiction writing had won one of nine windham-campbell prizes that have been handed out annually since 2013 — and the $ 150,000 that goes with it. Garner's most recent book, 2014's this house of grief, tells the story of a man who drove into a dam with his three sons in the car, and the trial that followed in the wake of the boys'drownings. In describing her win, the judges observe that garner \" brings acute observations and narrative skill to bear on the conflicts and tragedies of contemporary australian life. \" in her case, tragedy averted. Fellow winner and irish playwright abbie spallen tells the irish times she similarly thought it was a scam when she received an unexpected call with the news. It's kind of understandable why: the whole process is pretty secretive, with no submission process and no announcement of a short list, so writers have no idea they're even being considered.

The conversation arose after tapper asked kasich if he supported judge roy moore, who recently won the alabama gop primary for jeff sessions ' former senate seat. Tapper pointed out moore has railed against homosexuality, helped perpetuate birtherism lies about barack obama, and voiced anti-muslim sentiments, per huffpost. \" \" i don't support that.

        "summary": "A 26-year-old high school teacher in the small mississippi river town of destrehan, la., was booked into jail thursday on charges that she had sex with a 16-year-old student. It marks the third instance of alleged teacher-student sex at the school in two years and the fourth in the last decade, leading the times-picayune to ask in a headline: \" what's with destrehan high? \" \" that's maybe a question for dr. Phil, \" the local sheriff quips to the newspaper. In the latest case, kimberly naquin — daughter of the school board president — allegedly had sexual encounters with a female student at the teacher's residence and in a high school classroom between august 2014 and september 2015, wwl 4 reports. The same year that alleged affair began, the times-picayune notes, louisiana had the third highest rate in the us of employees accused or convicted of inappropriate relationships with students, trailing only alabama and kentucky. Two of those instances came to light in october 2014, when a pair of teachers at the high school — rachel respess, 24, and shelley dufresne, 32 — were arrested on charges that they allegedly had a threesome with a 16-year-old male student. The age of consent in louisiana is 17; however, state law prohibits relationships between teachers and students who are up to 20 years old. Both former teachers are being prosecuted, per the times-picayune, and naquin is suspended without pay. Her bond was set friday at $ 75,000. The times-picayune notes that teachers in the district take a course reviewing policies, including those for sexual misconduct, each year; high school teachers undergo additional training. And a senior tells the times-picayune that \" it's just a few individuals making bad decisions. \" ( it's not the only school with this kind of reputation. )",

        "summary": "A psychedelic concoction known as yage, or ayahuasca, has been brewed in indigenous communities in the amazon region for centuries. But now it's found a relatively new audience: americans immersed in what ariel levy, writing for the new yorker, calls \" the age of kale, \" who are tapping into the mixture of banisteriopsis caapi vines and chacruna bush leaves to seek spiritual healing and consciousness expansion. In fact, the drug some have dubbed \" grandmother \" has become so ubiquitous in hipster enclaves like brooklyn and silicon valley that self-help author tim ferriss tells the magazine it's \" like having a cup of coffee here [ in san francisco ]. \" advocates of the hallucinogen shrug off health risks and say going on an ayahuasca trip is worth more than a decade of therapy or meditation. Medical daily says mri scans show the drug slows down the part of the brain linked to depression and anxiety — and advocates embrace elaborate ceremonies built around taking it. Not that the experience is all magically marvelous: most users vomit, and ferriss says one of his own early trips was \" the most painful experience i've ever had by a factor of a thousand, \" complete with grand mal seizures. It can also be dangerous to those who are already taking ssri antidepressants, allowing too much serotonin to cause a possibly fatal condition known as serotonin syndrome. Not to mention it's illegal in the us, classified as a schedule 1 drug, per popular science. The site links to a video explaining the drug's effect on the brain. ( an ayahuasca ritual went fatally wrong last year. )",

            "Lsd and shrooms are among the popular hallucinogenic drugs that allow users to be fully aware of visually hallucinating. During a trip, voices are heard and colors start to become more prismatic. A new hallucinogenic, ayahuasca, is now being used to deliver a powerful trip while also containing promising medicinal properties. In asapscience's latest video, \" your brain on ayahuasca: the hallucinogenic drug, \" hosts mitchell moffit and greggory brown take a look at how the drug actually affects parts of the brain, and how it's different from lsd and shrooms. Ayahuasca is a combination of leaves of psychotria viridis and the leaves of another banisteriopsis caapi, neither of which have any hallucinogenic power on their own. However, the leaves do contain n, n-dimethyltryptamine ( dmt ), which is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin, and to the chemical found in magic mushrooms. Normally",

Barry, 75, and honey, 70, were found dead by a real estate agent in the basement of their toronto mansion on dec. 15. The source said their bodies were in an upright seated position on the floor near an indoor pool. Police deemed the deaths \" suspicious \" but have said little else since their investigation began. The sherman family has hired a team of experts, which includes a number of former toronto homicide detectives, to conduct a separate, independent investigation. The private investigators have found evidence that both barry and honey sherman had their necks wrapped with leather belts that were then knotted around a handrail that runs adjacent to the pool, the source told cbc toronto. A coroner previously ruled that the couple had died from \" ligature neck compression, \" or strangulation. The shermans ' north york home is still blocked off by toronto police.

But that's not stopping texas officials from doubling down on efforts to block refugees, and their latest move includes a threatened lawsuit against the dallas branch of a resettlement group, the houston chronicle reports. \" we have been unable to achieve cooperation with your agency, \" the state's health commissioner wrote to the international rescue group. \" failure by your organization to cooperate with the state of texas as required by federal law may result in the termination of your contract with the state and other legal action. \" the warning, which gov. Greg abbott's office said sunday he supports, is the latest since abbott sent a letter to president obama on nov. 16 declaring texas wouldn't be opening its doors to any syrian refugees after the attacks in paris. Despite legal experts indicating otherwise, abbott contends he does have authority to keep refugees out of texas, pointing out a federal provision that says refugee resettlement groups must \" cooperate \" with state officials, per the chronicle. At least one texas-based faith organization that assists resettlement groups is taking on his strong-arming stance. Bee moorhead, the director of texas impact, has deemed abbott's anti-refugee initiative as an \" unprecedented attempt on the part of a state agency to pressure private, nonprofit organizations to violate federal law and their federal contractual obligations, \" per the san antonio express-news. Now moorhead tells the chronicle that this latest letter \" should raise serious concerns for refugees currently receiving assistance in texas, and also for legislators, \" who she notes should be checking out potential financial repercussions of the commission's \" increasingly contentious communications. \" ( ben carson made a surprising visit overseas with syrian refugees. )",

South dakota's harney peak is named for gen. William s. Harney, an army general who was \" one of the best-known military figures in america \" in the 1800s, according to his biography. But the lakota indians hold him responsible for killing dozens of their people, including women and children, in the battle of ash hollow. They've asked the federal board on geographic names to weigh in, but there is no consensus on what the mountain should be called. Some suggested the mountain be named for sioux medicine man black elk, others suggested thunder mountain, and the south dakota board on geographic names ( which gives its recommendations to the federal board ) chose \"hinhan kaga ( making of owls ), \" according to usa today. But that name wasn't received well, and the state board ultimately recommended the original, controversial name stay put. \" it's not an easy black-and-white answer, \" explained the chairwoman. \" does it offend me? no, but i ' m not of that culture. Does it offend people that i know? yes. \" two state cabinet secretaries oppose any name change, citing the cost of changing signs and maps, plus a potential tourism drop due to confusion.

Scientists also don't know for certain what causes als ( aka lou gehrig's disease ) in general and are studying genetic and environmental links, the cdc notes. But although the underlying reasons for hawking's long-term survival are unclear, researchers'thoughts on it aren't. \" he is exceptional, \" neurology professor nigel leigh told the british medical journal in 2002. \" i am not aware of anyone else who has survived with [ als ] as long. \" what also makes hawking's case unusual is that he was informed of his illness so young: the average age for diagnosis is 55, the post notes, though hawking's early onset may have helped him in the long run. \" survival in younger patients is strikingly better and is measured in many years — in some cases, more than 10, \" leigh previously noted to the bmj. Leo mccluskey, medical director of the penn als center, told scientific american in 2012 that a patient could survive als for a long time if he didn't succumb to respiratory failure or deterioration of the swallowing muscles. Meanwhile, hawking told the new york times in 2011 that he's been lucky to have top-notch medical care and a job that engages his mind, and that perhaps he just has a rare form of motor neuron disease. \" maybe my variety [ of als ] is due to bad absorption of vitamins, \" he says, per the post.

Ask prince. \" guitarist steve vai reportedly once said that, upon hearing prince cover one of his most popular songs, \" tender surrender, \" his mind was blown. \" i almost died! \" he reportedly said. Rock critic robert christgau, when reviewing prince's 1980 album dirty mind, wrote that the singer had become \" the first commercially viable artist in a decade to claim the visionary high ground of lennon and dylan and hendrix ( and jim morrison ), whose rebel turf has been ceded to such marginal heroes-by-fiat as patti smith and john rotten-lydon. Brashly lubricious where the typical love man plays the lead in ' he's so shy, ' he specializes here in full-fledged f --- book fantasies... Mick jagger should fold up his penis and go home. \" quartz points to an interview in which miles davis discussed prince: \"his father took him to see james brown when he was young, he got on the stage and danced with him. He has that, he has jimi hendrix, and marvin gaye.... He combines all that, all the time. That's what he is. And his concept on the stage is like charlie chaplin. \" davis later compared prince to brown, gaye, hendrix, and chaplin again in his 1989 autobiography, this time adding sly, little richard, and duke ellington to the mix. \" i think prince's music is pointing toward the future, \" he wrote.

Ap vancouver, british columbia ( ap ) -- shen xue beamed as she clutched the big shiny medal and husband zhao hongbo planted a kiss on her forehead. The chinese pair has stood on the podium many times in many different places. Never on a stage like this. Shen and zhao won the olympic gold medal that has driven them for nearly two decades monday night, a prize tantalizing enough to lure them out of the cozy life of a happily retired married couple. It wasn't the best skate of their career -- she tumbled onto his back during a lift -- but it was good enough to win.

The country is believed to be producing 330 pounds of highly enriched uranium per year at one or two sites — enough for six nuclear bombs — and likely has 70 to 120 pounds of plutonium, a johns hopkins university report published monday reads, per reuters. Experts add that north korea's uranium enrichment program has been around since at least 2003 and will likely carry on with little interruption from sanctions. Nonetheless, south korea's foreign minister has called for tougher sanctions and pressure on the north in the wake of its biggest nuclear test yet, per cnn. China could deliver the harshest sanctions in stopping the movement of fuel and oil into the north, but pyongyang appears unconcerned. \" the us imperialists are going reckless, taken aback by the dprk's successful nuclear test, \" state-run media said wednesday, per nbc news, after us b-1b bombers and f-16s flew over the korean peninsula with south korean jets on monday. \" they are bluffing that b-1bs are enough for fighting an all-out nuclear war. \" meanwhile, the north korean government has made a public plea for help, claiming 133 people are dead, 395 are missing, and \" tens of thousands \" are homeless as a result of flooding from typhoon lionrock, reports cnn.",

A former state department chief of staff calls it the \" single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember. \" according to cnn, the four officials are taking 150 total years of state department experience with them. The four resignations were the undersecretary for management, assistant secretary of state for administration, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, and director of the office of foreign missions. Combined with two earlier departures, the state department has essentially been left without any senior management overseeing it or its employees. While the post reports it's unclear if the four officials resigned on their own or were forced out, a state department official tells cnn it was an attempt by the trump administration to \" clean house. \" the official says the staffers didn't quit in protest and there was no attempt \" to dis the president. \" and while a state department spokesperson says this is normal with a new administration, the american foreign service association admits it's a \" large turnover in a short period of time, \" nbc news reports. It's typical to leave career officials in place until replacements are found, but that won't be the case this time.

        "summary": "France is in mourning — and on high alert — after thursday night's horrific truck attack on a crowd celebrating bastille day in the southern city of nice. The attacker who plowed into hundreds of people, killing at least 84 and injuring dozens of others over more than a mile, has been named by nice-matin as local man mohamed lahouaiej bouhlel. Sources tell cnn that the 31-year-old french-tunisian was a petty criminal who was not on authorities ' radar for jihadist activities. He was shot dead by police, apparently after opening fire on the crowd, and authorities found his identity papers inside the vehicle, along with more weapons, the bbc reports. A witness who saw the driver's face says he \" had a beard and appeared to be having fun. \" in other developments: france has declared three days of national mourning and extended a state of emergency. \" we are facing a war that terrorism has brought to us. The goal of terrorists is to instill fear and panic, \" prime minister manuel valls says. \" and france is a great country, and a great democracy that will not allow itself to be destabilized. \" regional lawmaker eric ciotti says that one person jumped onto the truck to try to stop it, the ap reports. \" it's at that moment that the police were able to neutralize this terrorist, \" he says. \" i won't forget the look of this policewoman who intercepted the killer. \" a spokeswoman for the lenval foundation children's hospital in nice says they have treated at least 50 young victims, including two who died during or after surgery. Others are in a condition that is \" still life and death, \" she says. The attack was condemned by world leaders, including pope francis, president obama, and angela merkel, who says, \" i am convinced that, despite all the difficulties, we shall win this fight, \" reports reuters. European council chief donald tusk says the world stands with france. \" it is a tragic paradox that the victims of the attack [ were ] people celebrating liberty, equality, and fraternity, \" he says. Near the scene on the seafront promenade des anglais, police have cordoned off the road, and traumatized survivors are still wandering around, the guardian reports. Residents say that after last night's horror, people had to step around bodies to flee the scene. \" i saw a mother covering her child's eyes, telling him to keep them tightly shut, \" one man says. \" the dad had a toddler in his arms and had buried his face in",

But when guests showed up to their gated neighborhood in indio, calif., they couldn't get in, and franco told them the party was off. Grant's brother called police — who by that time had already recovered grant's body. Prosecutors say franco killed the 41-year-old high school math teacher, and the desert sun now reports that an inadvertent voicemail may have captured the final desperate moments of her life. Prosecutors allege franco first cut his girlfriend's throat, then ran her over with a car and deposited her body at a nearby golf course; kesq reports a box cutter and toyota prius are listed as the weapons used in the criminal complaint. The voicemail in question is one left by franco's phone to a friend's number in an apparent butt dial, per court documents. Though the desert sun reports it's largely inaudible, grant is heard saying this: \" what if i drive the car someplace and call [ 911 ] myself and say i was attacked? would that work? but we can think of something to say like ( inaudible )... What do you want me to say? \" among the other alleged evidence against franco, who has pleaded not guilty: franco took money out of an atm using grant's card on the night of her death, and when apprehended by police reportedly told them he was trying to flee to mexico. A cell mate claims franco confessed to him, saying franco said he ran her over when she tried to get away from him. Palm desert patch reports he faces life without parole.

Approximately 125 supertankers carrying $ 7.5 billion worth of oil are currently anchored at sea while waiting in line at ports around the world. If put end-to-end, they would stretch for 25 miles. The worst waits are in the middle east, where ports can't keep up with rising oil production, and asia, where ports can't handle the increased demand for cheap oil. According to cnn, there were three times the normal amount of supertankers floating off the gulf coast back in november in what one expert called a \" supertanker traffic jam. \" one captain tells reuters he's likely to be anchored at sea for more than three weeks before he can finally dock, giving his crew a lot of time to kill. \" we have a piano, drums, crew who play guitar — they are not professional, but they are becoming good, \" he says. \" we have more than 1,000 dvds so there is no need to watch the same one 20 times. \" but not all crews are so lucky. \" we had no regular internet... Only an old tv with a couple of old dvd movies, \" one sailor says. \" the food is terrible, and while waiting to offload we did pretty hard maintenance work. \" it gets worse. According to a marine consultant: \" a lot of ships are now dry, so there's no alcohol on board. \" while supertankers still get paid to sit at sea, the wall street journal reports rates could soon take a hit with oil futures looking bleak and an influx of new tankers looming later this year.",

So-called \" floating storage \" of crude oil soared to nearly triple the normal level last week, according to clipperdata, which tracks global shipments of crude. It's a \" super tanker traffic jam, \" said matt smith, director of commodity research at clipperdata. Not enough buyers smith first noticed the maritime congestion popping up a month ago off the coast of singapore.

The most severe temblor was one that hit just after noon on saturday, and registered a 4.3 magnitude. The oklahoma quakes knocked dishes off shelves and cracked some foundations, but there were no reports of major damage or injuries, koco reports. But there is finger-pointing: at the wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing, aka \" fracking, \" particularly on the heels of this study indicating a link between the two. The wave of quakes is just bolstering stats showing that oklahoma seems to be the new california: as of june, the sooner state had surpassed the golden state's earthquake tally, recording 207 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher for the year, compared with california's 140, according to koco. Hundreds of oklahoma residents last month met with regulators and researchers to ask for bans or severe restrictions on injection wells, into which huge amounts of wastewater — a fracking byproduct — are pumped as a means to dispose of it; the ap notes that some scientists think the water could be increasing underground pressures and lubricating faults.",

            "Guthrie, okla. ( ap ) — the u.s. Geological survey has recorded seven small earthquakes shaking central oklahoma in a span of about 14 hours. The temblors are part of an increase in earthquakes across oklahoma, texas and kansas that some scientists say could be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, and especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater. Sunday's quakes ranged from magnitude 2.6 to 2.9 and were centered in the guthrie, jones and langston areas, 15 miles to 30 miles northeast of oklahoma city. The usgs said the quakes were recorded between 7: 57 p.m. Saturday and 9: 51 a.m. Sunday. No injuries or damage were reported. Those follow four other quakes, including a 4.3-magnitude temblor near langston recorded shortly after noon saturday. The other saturday morning quakes ranged in magnitude from 2.9 to 3.2. Seismologists know that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — which involves blasting water, sand and chemicals deep into underground rock formations to free oil and gas — can cause microquakes that are rarely strong enough to register on monitoring equipment. However, fracking also generates vast amounts of wastewater, which is pumped into injection wells thousands of feet underground. Scientists wonder whether they could trigger quakes by increasing underground pressures and lubricating faults. Another concern is whether injection well operators could be pumping either too much water into the ground or pumping it at exceedingly high pressures. Hundreds of central oklahoma residents met with regulators and research geologists last month in edmond, and many urged regulators to ban or severely restrict the disposal wells. Austin holland, a research seismologist with the oklahoma geological survey, said at the time that the state is experiencing unprecedented earthquake activity and his agency is closely monitoring it to determine whether the earthquakes are a natural phenomenon or are man-made. Holland also said the same drilling methods have been used in the state for years but that frequent earthquakes did not become a problem until after 2009."

        "summary": "Again and again, research on the parasite toxoplasma gondii, commonly found in cat feces, reveals just how nasty and widespread it is. It's linked to rage disorder, might boost one's risk of schizophrenia and other mental disorders, and in an odd and probably fatal twist, makes the mice it infects no longer fear cats. But new research out of dartmouth's geisel school of medicine suggests that, at least in mice, it has a major upside: the parasite secretes specific proteins that direct its immune system to attack ovarian tumors, the researchers report in the journal plos genetics. They built upon previous research to produce a vaccine that's a safe strain of t. Gondii, one that could cure mice of multiple types of solid tumors, not just ovarian. Ovarian cancer usually isn't detected until it has metastasized, meaning it has spread to other tissues and organs. As a result, it accounts for the fifth-most cancer deaths among women, claiming more than 14,000 lives a year, per the american cancer society. Researchers note in a press release that clinical trials are already underway exploring the use of the bacterium listeria monocytogenes to break the body's immune tolerance of pancreatic tumors and essentially whip the immune system into attack mode; t. Gondii could work in a strikingly similarly way. What works in mice doesn't always work in humans, but scientists are hoping to develop therapies that attack the most aggressive tumors.

But kiir's main enemy, former vice president and alleged coup architect riek machar, went on french radio to say he was ready only to \" negotiate his departure from power, \" meaning kiir, and that he'd oust him by force if necessary. The un will hold an emergency meeting today on the crisis. Right now it says about 34,000 people have taken refuge at its compounds, with 20,000 split between two compounds in the capital city of juba, and 14,000 at its compound in bor. Hundreds of oil workers are among the refugees at un compounds, fueling worries that the conflict will disrupt south sudan's oil production, the wall street journal reports. The crude is still being pumped, but china is among the many countries — including the us — seeking to evacuate its citizens, and china national petroleum corp is a big producer in the country. The drama is all unfolding right next door to the central african republic, which is in the midst of its own crisis. Samantha power is there now, in her first overseas trip as us ambassador to the un, the ap reports. She urged the principal players in that conflict to give up power as soon as elections occurred, and said they'd agreed to do so.

Speaking at cilliers ' attempted murder trial this week, prosecutors described how cilliers allegedly removed half of the clips connecting his wife's harness to the parachutes in an effort to rid her from his life. Having promised to start a new life with a woman he'd met on tinder, cilliers didn't initially plan for the botched skydive, which victoria survived with a broken pelvis, ribs, and vertebrae, prosecutors say. They argue cilliers — who was nearly $ 30,000 in debt and allegedly believed he would've received a life insurance payout of almost $ 160,000 after his wife's death — tampered with a gas pipe in the couple's kitchen a week before the skydive in the hope that it would cause an explosion. \" are you trying to kill me? \" his wife reportedly asked cilliers in jest upon discovering the leak. Cilliers later texted her, \" you want to go jump this weekend? \" per the sun. He has pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted murder.",

Department director ramón mérida said some of the bodies have been there for up to five years, and insisted they're not a health hazard as \" infected \" bodies are \" immediately incinerated. \" even so, the ap reports that mérida has since agreed to resign. Like a house of horrors, \" mummified \" corpses line shelves in the roughly 300-square-foot basement, which was kept at room temperature, reports the local; el mundo also describes unlabeled \" black feet \" on top of a garbage can. The reason behind this gross oversight is surprisingly bland — the man who spent his career incinerating the donated bodies took an early retirement in december — but there is also this ghastly detail: the incinerating oven reportedly emits poisonous gases, which is why the aforementioned staff member has not yet been replaced. But he ' ll supposedly come out of retirement to help deal with the corpses; a funeral home will also remove some of the bodies. An investigation has been launched by the university.",

What he did \" was not what i think the average person would do, \" a commander says. But determining la porte's eligibility for the award wasn't easy. \" there are various criteria associated with the award, and one of them is that it has to be justified by eyewitness statements, \" gay said.

( logan wallace/courtesy of virginia tech ) — almost eight years after virginia tech's corps of cadets marched into westview cemetery to bury their slain comrade, air force cadet matthew j. La porte, they did so once more. This time, as those in the long line of gray and white synchronized their footsteps to the rap of two lone snare drums, they came not to mourn la porte but to celebrate his heroism. On thursday, with the thousand-strong corps of cadets stretched out along the cemetery's hill, the air force posthumously awarded la porte, of dumont, n.j., the airman's medal for his actions on the morning of the massacre at virginia tech on april 16, 2007.

            "An air force ceremony thursday posthumously awarded the airman's medal to matthew la porte in recognition of heroic actions he took to protect classmates during the shooting at virginia tech in 2007. ( logan wallace/courtesy of virginia tech ) — almost eight years after virginia tech's corps of cadets marched into westview cemetery to bury their slain comrade, air force cadet matthew j. La porte, they did so once more. This time, as those in the long line of gray and white synchronized their footsteps to the rap of two lone snare drums, they came not to mourn la porte but to celebrate his heroism. On thursday, with the thousand-strong corps of cadets stretched out along the cemetery's hill, the air force posthumously awarded la porte, of dumont, n.j., the airman's medal for his actions on the morning of the massacre at virginia tech on april 16, 2007.

It's video filmed last week that shows a doctor in china pulling a cockroach from deep within a man's ear after it had burrowed in there nearly three days earlier, upi reports. The roach had apparently nestled into its new home while the 60-year-old man from chengdu in sichuan province was snoozing, and although he'd tried tweezers and toothpicks to extract it, the pest remained embedded, per the straits times. The man finally resorted to blasting insecticide into his ear, which solved the secondary problem of killing the roach, but not the primary one of getting it out. His inner ear swelled up from the effects of the pesticide and other irritation, trapping the dead roach, which turned out to be nearly a half-inch long. A doctor at the hospital where the man was treated says roaches seeking warmth during colder weather often pick human ears as their nesting place. If that happens, the doctor adds, patients should drip some olive oil, not insecticide, in the ear to asphyxiate the insect. The unlucky host may then still need a doctor to get it out.

        "summary": "As with most insurance systems, for the affordable care act to work it needs some people — specifically young, healthy people — to pay in more than they get out to make up for the people who take out more than they put in, vox reports. The problem? those young, healthy people are finding that \" remaining uninsured is a reasonably good financial option. \" according to the new york times, many people are deciding it's cheaper to pay the fine to the irs for not having insurance than to pay premiums to an insurance company. And that's one of the reasons aca premiums are going up next year. Not to mention that because the aca allows people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance, nothing is stopping people from paying the penalty and then later getting insurance if something happens. Tax and health policy experts say the penalty for remaining uninsured needs to be steeper — perhaps by hundreds of dollars — to be effective. For example, one man tells the times he may \" roll the dice next year \" and hope his family doesn't have any medical emergencies because the penalty is one-sixth the cost of his insurance. And while penalties are doubling next year — from $ 325 to $ 695 for adults, cbs new york reports — it might not be enough. It's estimated 5.6 million tax returns will include penalties for being uninsured.",

The issue was that the tyrannical and unpopular individual mandate to purchase health insurance was so tyrannical and so unpopular that congress wound up watering it down considerably. The executive branch then further watered it down with very generous special exemptions to the mandate. The result is that while the mandate stands as a legal fact, noncompliance is actually extremely widespread. There are few consequences for healthy people not buying insurance.

            "The investigative podcast that became a cultural phenomenon is finally coming back with a brand new season. Serial initially explored the 1999 murder of hae min lee and the subsequent imprisonment of her ex-boyfriend adnan syed. Its sophomore season followed american army soldier sergeant bowe bergdahl, who was held for five years by the taliban and later charged with desertion. Now, the series is set to tackle the entire criminal justice system by illustrating a year inside cleveland criminal courts for season 3. Hosted by journalist sarah koenig, the peabody award-winning serial has more than 16 million downloads per episode, making it the most popular podcast ever released. With such a wide reach, koenig chose to use the show's tremendous platform to expose shocking behind the scenes details of criminal court procedures. The radio personality and reporter emmanuel dzotsi spent a year working on the forthcoming season, for which they were given permission to record inside courtrooms, judges ' chambers, back hallways, and attorneys ' offices. The show will take listeners through the sometimes unsettling ways in which crimes are investigated and tried. \"every case emmanuel and i followed, there came a point where we thought: no, this can't be how it works, \" said koenig in a press release. \"and then we were like, oh! oh my god. This is how",
            "The team behind podcast hit \"serial \" are premiering the latest season of the investigative series — digging into the inner workings of cleveland's criminal-court system — later this month. The first two episodes of \"serial \" season 3 will debut sept. 20, with subsequent episodes to be released weekly on thursdays. Instead of telling a single story over the course of the show, as the first two seasons did, the third run will follow many different stories with some spanning two or even three episodes. When \"serial \" first launched in 2014, the spinoff of npr's \"this american life \" became an overnight podcasting success. In the first season, sarah koenig narrated an investigation into the 2000 conviction of adnan syed for the murder of his girlfriend, hae min lee, in baltimore. ( the show led to a judge's ruling granting syed a retrial, which remains pending. ) season 2 of \"serial \" documented the story of bowe bergdahl, a u.s. Soldier who was captured by the taliban.

The new law, one of the nation's loosest, treats possession of under an ounce of marijuana as an offense like littering. Smoking pot in public is still banned, but the city's police officers have been trained in new guidelines that say they can no longer take action upon merely smelling marijuana, and can no longer demand identification from people found in possession of small amounts of the drug, which the city legalized for medicinal use in 2010, reports the washington post. But tokers still need to be careful: there's a lot of federal land in the city, and since marijuana possession is still a federal crime, people caught with pot on federal land can face up to six months in jail and a $ 5,000 fine, the new york times finds. The law went into effect at the end of a period during which it could have been overruled by congress — but when a house republican from maryland added language to a bill that would have removed funding for the law, president obama threatened to veto it, roll call reports. The administration \" strongly opposes \" attempts to prevent dc \" from using its own local funds to carry out locally passed marijuana policies, \" the white house said in a statement.",

Lee, thomas \" stonewall \" jackson, and other confederate officers? the institution in rural pennsylvania is having a debate about it, the washington times reports.
