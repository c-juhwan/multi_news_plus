        "summary": "In a move that earned google a big \" huzzah! \" from wired, the company took a big step wednesday against predatory lending practices. Starting july 13, no more ads will appear on the site for what it calls \" deceptive \" payday loans, the ap reports — the first time it's instituted a restriction on an entire category of financial products, thanks to pressure from consumer protection, privacy, and civil liberties groups, per the washington post. The ban applies to any ads that call for loan repayment within 60 days, explains a blog post by david graff, google's director of global product policy. Searches will still spit out names of lenders offering these types of loans — basically short-term cash advances with often exceptionally high interest rates ( up to 650 % for lump-sum online loans ) — which critics say take advantage of recipients who may feel they have no other options. But actual ads in prime page positions will be no more. \" our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products, \" graff says on the blog. The ban will include middleman companies that auction leads to lenders, and in the us, google also won't accept ads for loans with a 36 % or higher annual interest rate. Facebook has a similar policy to google's, which the post notes \" might have as much impact as any single [ government ] regulation in restricting access to payday lenders, \" as they're two of the most popular websites in the world. Some in the payday lending industry are crying foul. \" [ they're ] making a blanket assessment about the... Industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors, \" reads a statement from trade group community financial services association of america. But the risks are real: an april report by the independent consumer financial protection bureau says half of those with an online payday loan racked up an average $ 185 in fees and penalties when they couldn't pay the money back right away, forcing account closures and sending them into a debt spiral, usa today reports.

Meanwhile, another caravan is already on the move. Per reuters, a second group of more than 1,000 hondurans was moving north through guatemala on tuesday, en route to mexico. The first wave of some 7,000 honduran migrants are holed up in huixtla, mexico, 30 miles north of the guatemalan border, since fleeing violence and poverty at home on oct. 12. That group — minus two men who've died in truck accidents — got moving early wednesday, with more than 1,000 miles to go before reaching the us. However, many members are expected to stay in mexico, which has received 1,699 requests for refugee status, reports reuters. \" we only want to work, \" says one migrant, per cbc news. \" we would do anything, except bad things. \" ( trump blames democrats. )",

The apartment was designed by renowned architect robert a. M. Stern and includes customized walls, floors and lighting. Perched on the 69th floor, the condo overlooks central park and offers views extending as far as kennedy airport in queens, according to brokers.

The seller, dr. Lawrence wiener, couldn't be reached for comment. The mandarin oriental at time warner center is considered one of the premier new developments in new york and commands some of the highest prices per square foot. The purchase price for the 1,653-square-foot apartment works out to about $ 3,800 a foot, a broker said. Tower residents have access to the five-star hotel services. The mandarin was able to sell all of the 63 units it put on the market in 2004, performing much better than other co-op or condo-hotel projects that didn't start selling units until after the market slump had begun. Re-sales at the mandarin, however, have been forced to make accommodations to market declines, and this apartment was no exception. It was originally listed in november 2007 by brown harris stevens for $ 11.3 million, according to streeteasy.com.

        "summary": "A newly deciphered clay tablet from ancient babylon has science writers buzzing because it just might \" rewrite the history of mathematics, \" as live science puts it. The tablet shows that babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of jupiter in the sky, says researcher mathieu ossendrijver of humboldt university in berlin, who deciphered the tablet and published his findings in science. What's intriguing is that these early astronomers wrote their calculations sometime between 350bc and 50bc — at least 1,400 years earlier than the european mathematicians who currently get credit for inventing the technique, reports npr. The upshot is that the babylonians were dabbling in abstract principles dealing with jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky, and they described that movement using a \" sort of precalculus, \" in the words of the new york times. \" it is an application in astronomy that was totally new, \" says ossendrijver. He calls it \" truly an astonishing find, \" and while he may be biased, others in the field seem equally wowed. \" i think it's quite a remarkable discovery, \" says a professor at the institute for the study of the ancient world. The times has a layman's explainer: \" the babylonians were calculating the distance jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took jupiter to travel half that distance. \" babylonians were known to be talented astronomers and mathematicians, but the small tablet takes them far above previous estimations, observes national geographic. \" this geometrical trick rewrites the history books. \" ( scientists are getting closer to unraveling an ancient incan technique as well. )",

Now the san are asking for something in return: respect. They've published a code of ethics as part of the trust project, asking that scientists adhere to certain conditions, such as: submit research requests in advance to san councils, not just with their universities; don't take photos of individuals without consent; and don't misrepresent the work, notes the smithsonian. They also ask that researchers share the benefits of the study, which may mean knowledge, not money, reports science. The dicey part: they want researchers to present their studies to the san prior to publication to be vetted for inaccuracies or offenses. \"we've been bombarded by researchers over the years, \" says hennie swart, director of the south african san institute. \"it's not a question of not doing the research. It's a question of doing it right. \" the code is not legally binding, though researchers who run afoul of it risk being blacklisted from further study. The san become the first indigenous group in africa to adopt such a code, though groups in australia and canada have done so previously. Nature reports that the code was developed by leaders of the! xun, khwe and! khomani groups of san, representing 8,000 people in south africa. It's not clear if san groups outside the country will follow suit.

As usual with boiled eggs, the protein-rich egg whites began unfolding, then folded back together in a firmer way — going from \" clear and mucus-like to white and rubbery, \" cnbc reports. The researchers then untangled those proteins by adding urea, a primary ingredient in urine. Finally, the now-liquid proteins went into a \" vortex fluid device, \" a machine that reconnects them so they appear uncooked. To what end, exactly? well, this process can be used to remove gummy proteins from laboratory test tubes ( a time-consuming process, apparently ). More importantly, weiss says it can quickly produce antibodies for a particular cancer treatment; the antibodies attach to cancer cells ' proteins, which enables the immune system to wipe them out. If egg-uncooking per se is your thing, the guardian reports, a french chemist did it by detaching the egg's protein molecules and adding sodium borohydride or vitamin c. But while this \" may be fun, it does not have many practical applications, \" the guardian says. ( in other food science, there's a new pill that's \" like an imaginary meal. \" )",

        "summary": "A teenage boy who was kidnapped as an infant has been reunited with his father thanks to a school official's suspicion. When sandy hatte, 60, tried to enroll the boy at a school in northern missouri, the official contacted police and discovered the boy had been abducted 13 years ago. Hatte — the boy's paternal grandmother, according to wdaf — has been charged with felony child abduction. Investigators say she had no legal rights to the child but had attempted to portray herself as his mother, the st. Joseph post reports. One day in 2000, the boy's father \" was working, came home from work, and [ hatte ] was gone with the baby, \" a police spokesman tells abc. \" he hasn't been able to find them since. \" investigators believe that hatte and the boy spent the last 13 years moving around different cities, counties, and states, and were homeless at least once over the period. When the boy met his father again, it \" was a good reunion, \" the police spokesman says. \" you could tell within the first three minutes they hit it off pretty well. Since then, i've been on the phone with the dad and from what i ' m understanding, it's going pretty well. \" ( click for the story of a 1964 kidnapping that made headlines... This summer. )",

Activists are pushing to align the country's schedule with its neighbors, an effort that would require cutting daily siestas — including lunch and a nap — to just an hour.

Last year, gawker notes, an official report showed spanish people were both more tired and less productive than their european peers. A parliamentary commission has backed the clock shift and an eight-hour workday, though no official changes have been made. As it stands, the times calls spain \" land of 10pm dinners, \" and notes that a quarter of the country is watching tv between midnight and 1am, an hour that's still considered prime time. Traditionalists are against a shortened midday break: \" it is one thing to eat. It is another thing to nourish oneself, \" says one man. But others say the current schedule creates an interminable workday, and a switch would actually mean more family time. \" these working hours are not good for families, \" says a working mom. \" spanish society is still old-fashioned.

Moreover, \" it's supposed to be the president of the united states who gives a dictator a face-saving way out, not the other way around.

Barack obama has been forced to spend about 70 percent of his presidential energies trying to repair crises foreign and domestic that these people created, and forced to do so against their iron opposition on all fronts; and now that he's achieved a diplomatic breakthrough, they have the audacity to argue that he sold america out to vladimir putin? it's staggering and sickening",

Has in a perverse way made assad its partner. The u.s. And syria will now be working together on an improbable, even fantastical project: ridding a brutal country at war with itself of chemical weapons. The agreement, reached over the weekend, to begin disarming syria represents an astonishing victory for the assad regime. It is also a victory for assad's main weapons supplier and diplomatic protector, russian president vladimir putin. Which is not to say that this isn't also a victory -- a provisional, morally ambiguous victory -- for president barack obama as well. But first, assad. Why is this agreement a victory for him? two reasons",

National security adviser susan rice, we learn, warned that \"he risked undermining his powers as commander in chief. \" senior adviser dan pfeiffer and defense secretary chuck hagel \"also raised concerns. \" but obama ignored their advice and \"took the gamble anyway. \" such loyalty.

But police say virginia paris then went to the bathroom and told a female customer she needed help upon exiting, only to be yanked from the store and shoved into a car by the man police say kidnapped her on friday in solvang, calif.: paris ' 52-year-old ex-boyfriend, joseph hetzel. Abc15 reports that as the pair drove away, paris tossed the car registration info out of the car and police collected it. The two were spotted a second time in arizona — leaving a grand canyon-area hotel on monday morning, the ap reports — before paris was able to get away. Police had said that based on witness statements, the pair were believed to be heading for las vegas, and the ap reports paris was indeed found monday night at a las vegas-area casino-hotel. Paris reportedly told security guards at the railroad pass hotel and casino in henderson, nev., that she had been kidnapped. She was taken to the hospital; hetzel remains at large. Officials say paris had been granted a restraining order against hetzel, who they also say should be considered armed and dangerous. He has previously served time on convictions including possession of items used to make explosive devices. Ktla reports those charges appear to be connected to an ex-girlfriend whose dogs hetzel poisoned and whose home he vandalized. ( the fbi says this woman's trunk \" kidnapping \" was really an elaborate suicide. )",

The new york daily news, meanwhile, notes that the premium southwest salad ( also with baby kale ) offered by mcdonald's in the us is nearly as bad at 710 calories, 43 grams of fat, and 1,330 milligrams of salt when made with buttermilk crispy chicken. \" putting kale into the menu doesn't mean you're getting a healthy choice, \" a dietitian tells the cbc. \" by eating that salad, you're getting your sodium for the day. \" a mcdonald's rep says customers can lower the calories, salt, and fat in their meals by choosing grilled over crispy chicken, omitting salad dressings, or even eating a burger without the bun. If you're turned off by the 33 grams of sugar in mcdonald's fruit and maple oatmeal, for example, you can ask that it be made without maple brown sugar.

I've had enough. \" doctors, meanwhile, have seen their income rise by an average of about $ 125,000 to $ 315,000, with more raises guaranteed until 2023. But the petition's fate is unclear, with support coming from a minority of doctors and government officials having a possible conflict of interest — after all, quebec premier philippe couillard is a neurosurgeon and health minister gaétan barrette is a radiologist. Barrette, however, says he's open to changes: \" if [ doctors ] feel they're overpaid, they can leave the money on the table, \" he tells the montreal gazette. \" i guarantee that i can make good use of it. \"",

Four were also using super absorbency tampons. \" this recent cluster is an important reminder to always review product safety information, \" says dr. Eden wells of the michigan department of health and human services. Doctors note tss often begins with flu-like symptoms and most often occurs with the improper use of high-absorbency tampons. They stress that women should use the lowest absorbency tampon needed and remove or replace it after a maximum of eight hours, per cbs detroit. While rylie was out of the hospital by the end of january, a feb. 22 facebook post shows how much her body has fought: \" i...

The obese 3-year-old was diagnosed with what used to be known as \" adult-onset \" diabetes, which has become a lot more common among children over the last few decades, reports reuters. In a press release, dr. Michael yafi, a pediatric endocrinologist at the university of texas, says the 77-pound toddler brought to his clinic had \" symptoms of excessive urination and thirst \" but her medical history was \" unremarkable \" and there was no family history of diabetes. A review of her diet, however, revealed \" poor family nutritional habits with uncontrolled counting of calories and fat, \" yafi says. The doctor, who will present his research at a global diabetes conference this week, tells reuters that he has never encountered a type 2 diabetes patient so young before, though he suspects there are more out there, and he now screens all obese children for the condition. Luckily, he was able to reverse the condition in the texas girl after catching it so early: with the use of the diabetes drug metformin, along with smaller portions of food and increased physical activity, the girl lost weight, her blood glucose levels returned to normal, and she no longer had diabetes after six months, the guardian reports.

The merger was seen as a crucial step for lee to strengthen his grip on samsung electronics after his father fell ill in may 2014. Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities, and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested feb. 17 and remains in custody, reports cnn.

And critics agree: don't see it at 48 frames per second. It just looks too real. The film \" is solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, one unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy, \" writes kenneth turan in the los angeles times. \" there is just not enough story here to prevent things from getting pokey. \" on the other hand, with such great source material, \" there is only so far wrong you can go. \" \" the comparative playfulness of the novel could have made this hobbit movie a lot of fun, \" notes ao scott in the new york times. Instead, \" tolkien's inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle. \" overscale indeed: we get six chapters of the book in three hours, writes bob mondello at npr. \" the filmmakers are reduced to detailing troll recipes and staging a hedgehog rescue. \" your opinion of the film all depends on your comparison point, asserts andrew o ' hehir at salon. \" if you arrive at the hobbit via the flatulent mediocrity of most contemporary fantasy films and fantasy fiction, it looks pretty damn good, \" he notes. But if you're comparing it to the earlier films, you see a \" sprawling, shambling, full-length prequel to ( peter ) jackson's lord of the rings, but not so much to tolkien's. \" meanwhile, slate offers a different take on 48 frames per second.",

The world's first robot-run farm will be up and running by mid-2017, kyoto-based spread has announced, and it plans to churn out 30,000 heads of lettuce a day to start, boosting that to 500,000 within five years. The lettuce, which will be grown without pesticides, will also boast more beta carotene than lettuce grown on traditional farms, the company says, and the automated process will result in significant savings: energy expenses would be cut by about a third, and personnel costs by half, company rep koji morisada tells afp. The indoor grow house — a type of farm modern farmer says is \" low-profile, easy on the environment, and can be made to produce massive quantities of food, especially quick-growing crops like lettuces, very easily \" — will take up just over 47,000 square feet, phys.org notes. Every part of the process, from transplanting to harvesting, will be carried out by the robots, except for seed planting and germination confirmation, morisada says. An august wall street journal article noted the robotic farmers ( which tech insider describes as looking \" like conveyor belts with arms \" ) will also monitor and adjust farm conditions such as temperature and humidity. \" with the introduction of plant factories and their controlled environment, we are now able to provide the ideal environment for the crops, \" another rep tells tech insider. Spread already sells factory-grown lettuce from other facilities it operates for about the same price as conventional lettuce, though it hopes to eventually bring those costs down, the journal notes.

            "Brussels ( reuters ) - the euro zone economy will contract by more than expected this year and budget deficits will decline more slowly, the european commission said on friday as it set out forecasts for the next two years. France, spain, italy and the netherlands - four of the five largest euro zone economies - will be in recession through 2013, the commission's forecasts showed, with only germany, the largest euro zone economy, managing to eke out growth. \" in view of the protracted recession, we must do whatever it takes to overcome the unemployment crisis in europe. The eu's policy mix is focused on sustainable growth and job creation, \" eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said. \" fiscal consolidation is continuing, but its pace is slowing down. In parallel, structural reforms must be intensified to unlock growth in europe. \" the commission said the euro zone economy would shrink 0.4 percent this year and grow 1.2 percent next year, revising down its projections from last february of a 0.3 percent recession and 1.4 percent growth respectively. The forecast is roughly in line with the mid-point of the -0.9 to -0.1 percent range forecast for 2013 by the ecb in march, and the 0.0 to 2.0 percent growth range seen for 2014. The expectations underline a shift of focus in the 17 countries that share the euro from sharp fiscal consolidation in the first years of the sovereign debt crisis to economic growth as earlier radical deficit cuts and european central bank action restored some market trust in euro zone finances. Economic growth will be slower than thought in all the biggest euro zone countries, with france even dipping into a recession of 0.1 percent, rather than growing 0.1 percent as forecast in february, the commission said. The only positive change against the february forecasts was greece, where the economy is now seen contracting 4.2 percent this year, rather than the previous 4.4 percent. To reduce the negative impact of fiscal consolidation on growth, the overall euro zone budget deficit reduction will be marginally slower this year and next compared with forecast from three months ago. Country differences are bigger. The aggregate euro zone deficit is to fall to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product this year and to 2.8 percent next year from 3.7 percent last year -- only 0.1 percentage point for each year less than previously envisaged.

At one point, when he was near the house of his father's girlfriend, trayvon apparently thought he had eluded zimmerman. Rachel jeantel said she told him to keep running, but \" he said, nah, he'd just walk faster. \" then jeantel heard travyon curse, and he told her that his follower was behind him, reports the orlando sentinel. Jeantel, 19, recounted an exchange between the two, with trayvon demanding to know why zimmerman was following him and the \" hard-breathing \" zimmerman demanding to know what trayvon was doing in the neighborhood. Then she heard a struggle, with trayvon shouting, \" get off, get off! \" as the phone went dead, reports the ap. Jeantel will be back on the stand tomorrow to wrap up her testimony — much to her displeasure. The sentinel notes that when defense attorney don west informed the judge that he had two hours of questioning left, she exclaimed, \" what? \" in his questioning, west tried to dent jeantel's credibility. Though 18 at the time of the killing, she admitted that she lied and said she was a minor because she hoped it would keep her out of the case, reports the huffington post.",

        "summary": "Having kids doesn't hurt a mom's performance at work; in fact, it may enhance it, a study suggests. Researchers at the federal reserve bank of st. Louis ( who are all male, the washington post reports ) found that in the span of three decades, moms were more productive than women without kids; what's more, moms of at least two kids were more productive than those with fewer, the post reports. Fatherhood was also apparently associated with productivity: dads with at least two kids were more productive than those with one or none. The study's population was, however, limited to a fairly privileged group: some 10,000 academic economists. They're a handy group to study because it's easy to determine their work output, and they have similar educational backgrounds. But they are also likely to have better access to childcare than others might, and their parenthood is \" usually planned, \" the researchers say, as today reports. Meanwhile, a causal relationship isn't clear: it's not necessarily the fact of being a parent that led to these workers'success. \" women who are more productive in the first place may be more likely to become mothers, \" notes a researcher, as vox reports. That site raises some concerns with the study, which seems to suggest limits on when a mother should have kids if she wants to maximize productivity — with the ideal age being between 30 and 34. ( in other news on work and parenting: earlier this year, a pew study found that more mothers were staying home full-time. )",

        "summary": "People around the world are meeting over tea and cakes to talk about death — in surprisingly lighthearted ways. Created by a swiss sociologist, so-called \" death cafes \" are designed to give people a positive atmosphere in which to discuss all matters surrounding human mortality, prospect magazine reports. The concept has taken off, too, with a death cafe website and more than 1,400 death cafes held in 26 countries over the past three years. \" talking about [ death ] can only be a good thing, \" a british death-cafe host tells the guardian. \" it makes for a healthier, happier community. \" in fun, even gleeful atmospheres, participants discuss issues like natural death vs assisted suicide, how we'd like to be remembered, and what happens to us when we die, san diego citybeat reports. The cafes are also arising as society changes, with fewer westerners guided by religious beliefs and most of us likely to die alone as we lose our faculties; one in three will have dementia. \" we do need to address how to deal with that, both as a society and as individuals and families, \" says a sociologist. Participants also get to discuss taboo aspects of death, like the fact that many fear grief more than death, or believe that talking about death will make it happen, the toronto star reports. Death cafes are also venues for the elderly to discuss what it means to die: \" i ' m 85 years old and looking death in the face, \" says a toronto participant as he eats a butter tart. \" it's good to talk about it. \" for once, notes san diego citybeat, death won't be \" a conversation stopper. \" ( a recent study finds that if you feel younger than your age, you ' ll live longer. )",

Police say the teens threw at least 20 rocks from an i-75 overpass near flint last wednesday, damaging four other cars and killing 32-year-old kenneth white when a 6-pound rock went through the windshield of the van he was riding in. Police say that after throwing the rocks, the teens had dinner at mcdonald's. Anger is being held in the county jail and the four younger teens are in a regional detention center. Genesee county prosecutor david leyton says the charge is second-degree murder instead of first because he doesn't believe it was a deliberate attempt to take a life. \" it was a willful and wanton act that resulted in somebody's death, \" he says. \" it's not a prank. It's second-degree murder, \" says genesee county sheriff robert pickell, per abc 12. He says the teens, all clio high school students, were arrested after a lot of \" good old-fashioned police work. \" \" at the end of the day, nobody wins, \" the sheriff says. \" the young boys are charged as criminals, a young boy lost his father, and all the families are left grieving. \" a gofundme page to help white's family has raised more than $ 47,000.",

        "summary": "Maybe all mankind needed to become more civilized was a kinder, gentler touch, suggests a study out of the university of utah and duke university. The new research now links a drop in testosterone to our ancestors'sudden jump into civilized behavior about 50,000 years ago. This is when we started making art, bone and antler tools, projectile weapons, and fishing and birding equipment, as well as using fire, the telegraph explains. In addition, \" humans are uniquely able to communicate complex thoughts and cooperate even with strangers, \" the study author says, and the research shows that \" these traits are linked... And were a driving force behind the development of complex culture, \" and also developed around the same time as the drop in testosterone levels. He believes testosterone levels waned when we started living and working together and realized cooperation was the key to survival. By examining the skulls of 1,400 modern and ancient humans, he found that the heavy ridges and oblong skulls — features linked to higher testosterone — disappeared, and the human face became more feminine and rounded. These nicer, gentler humans were better able to put their newly-rounded heads together and make a giant leap in their evolution, the study suggests. \" the key to our success is the ability to cooperate and get along and learn from one another, \" says the author.

He pretended to oblige but brought the plane down at an airport in istanbul instead. Upon landing, he announced that they had touched down in russia, and the hijacker was apparently none the wiser. After a four-hour standoff on the tarmac, the hijacker let all the passengers leave before being captured. He had no bomb. Not that the exact destination mattered all that much: authorities say the 45-year-old hijacker used his stunt to demand the release of anti-government protesters in ukraine, as well as former prime minister yulia tymoshenko, reports ap.

Hanjin shipping is seeking protection from creditors in several countries to prevent the seizure of assets and won a provisional ruling in the us on tuesday, but it still isn't clear when all cargo will be unloaded. Samsung is one of several companies impatiently waiting, with $ 38 million in goods stuck on two ships off long beach, calif. The company says it will incur \" great costs \" if it needs to fly in replacement goods to meet contract obligations, per bloomberg. \" all these costs and delays will be a loss not only to samsung, but also to major retailers in the us and, ultimately, to us consumers, \" it says.

Alex's bionic prosthetic limb was made by limbitless solutions, a nonprofit run by university of central florida students. The group's goal is to 3d-print affordable bionic limbs for kids ( its appropriate url: 3dhope.com ), and this one is their first effort, the washington post reports. Using something called surface electromyography, electrical signals from the brain are communicated to the bionic arm, causing the hand to open and close. The awesome part: while a prosthetic typically clocks in around $ 40,000, the iron man arm cost less than $ 350 in materials; the fairly substantial research and development time were donated. The arm itself was actually donated to alex, who was born without most of his right arm, with team members contributing their \" coffee money \" to cover the materials cost. \" albert has made it so affordable, \" says \" tony stark \" in the now-viral video, referring to limbitless founder albert manero. \" i ' m probably going to start farming out a lot of my tech work to albert, too.

            "When albert manero was a kid, his parents taught him the importance of making the world a better place. He's off to a great start. So far, he's built one bionic limb for a 6-year-old boy, and another for a 7-year-old girl without a left forearm. And he founded the volunteer group limbitless solutions to build affordable, bionic, 3d-printed arms, in which he makes the designs available to others for free. \"my parents always encouraged me to use my education to help others and to dream big dreams, \" says manero, a fulbright scholar and doctoral student in mechanical engineering at the university of central florida. \"now i want to inspire others to help engineer hope for the world. \" he and the limbitless team have focused on arms for children, whose small prosthetics are harder to build and quickly outgrown. The limbs use electrical muscular signals",
            "Tony stark never imagined his bionic suit would earn the superhero title of \"iron man \" ( because technically, the suit is titanium alloy ). Tyler petresky, director of resource management at limbitless solutions, also never imagined his bionic prosthetic arm would gather the attention of millions. Petresky, a sophomore at university of central florida, is one of the 40 members on the limbitless team who helped build an \"iron man \" themed arm for a 7-year-old boy named alex pring, who was born with a partially developed limb.

        "summary": "Ah, the buzzing smartphone: it's a call, a tweet, a funny photo — or an earthquake? yep, scientists say crowd-sourced data may one day relay warnings about impending quakes that have already begun elsewhere, livescience reports. In a computer-model study led by the us geological survey, researchers found that smartphones could send information about quakes of magnitude 7 or greater, giving several seconds of warning to areas the quake hadn't yet reached. The phones would automatically detect a temblor with an app using gps technology and transmit information some distance away. Information from fewer than 5,000 phones would be enough to send a helpful alert, eureka alert reports — giving people time to halt trains, stop surgeries, take cover, you name it. \" a few seconds can be enormously helpful, \" says lead author sarah minson. This could bolster early warning systems that already exist ( in japan and mexico, say ) or curb the need for such pricey projects: \" we have high hopes that this could make a huge impact, \" says minson. Scientists are currently planning a pilot project in chile with 250 smartphones, and will also work with the west coast's $ 145 million shakealert plan, which mixes seismometers with gps data. One little problem: phone manufacturers don't allow access to raw gps data, so smartphones will have to be reprogrammed down the road for the system to work. And, of course, the system will have to work in the real world for the first time, the la times reports. \" i ' m a little skeptical it will work, \" says a san diego scientist. \" i think a system like that would false-alarm more than they claim in the paper. \" ( see why the odds of a strong california earthquake have just gone up. )",

As the new york daily news notes, that wasn't the only odd revelation about cruz that emerged during the town hall. The man who once fought against masturbation also relayed how he'd once watched porn with supreme court justice sandra day o ' connor. And in what may be one of the more scandalous tidbits to arise in election 2016, cruz's daughter, caroline, who just turned 8, revealed she's got tape of her dad dolled up in granny panties and a pink feather boa at a father-daughter picnic.

In a series of frantic twitter and facebook posts sunday, waldman told the tale of how her 11-year-old son was \" tricked \" into spending $ 120 on in-game purchases in two days, even though she and her husband, fellow author michael chabon, had set up \" purchase controls \" that were supposed to cap their kids'spending at $ 20 per month. She accused the game of \" bypassing \" those controls, leading her son to \" cry hysterically. \" apple ended up refunding the family, and waldman — who implored fellow parents to delete the \" pure evil \" app and referred to the kardashians, among other things, as \" vile scumbag pigs \" — says the \" best thing about this disaster \" is that her son \" f --- ing hates the kardashians now. \" she adds, \" abe, age 11: sobbing. ' i hate those goddamn kardashians. ' also? ' i thought i was smarter than this.

Marion sims — regarded as the father of modern gynecology — came down in new york's central park because much of his breakthrough work derived from experimentation on slaves, reports the daily news. Sims operated on 11 slave women in alabama over the course of three years, over and over, without anesthesia, recounts the atlantic. He is credited, among other things, with perfecting a procedure to correct a painful condition known as vescovaginal fistula that often proved fatal in the 1800s. Sims would go on to establish the first women's hospital in the us, and while he maintained that his slave patients were volunteers, the general consensus today is that enslaved women could not possibly have given their full consent. New york's public design commission voted monday that the statue could come down, and mayor bill de blasio ordered its removal the very next day. However, sims ' critics did not win a complete victory: instead of being destroyed or warehoused, the statue will instead be moved to brooklyn's green-wood cemetery, where sims is buried. Vox notes that the move can be seen in the context of other health experiments involving african-americans, including the infamous tuskegee syphilis study and the use of henrietta lacks ' cells in cancer research.",

            "Sims, who founded the country's first women's hospital in new york in 1855, developed his method of treating vesicovaginal fistula over three years of experimental surgeries, operating on 11 slave women in alabama who suffered from the condition, from 1846 to 1849, sometimes in front of observers to whom he wished to demonstrate his methods. The condition was considered incurable at the time. \"i made this proposition to the owners of the negroes, \" sims wrote in his autobiography, the story of my life. \"if you will give me anarcha and betsey for experiment, i agree to perform no experiment or operation on either of them to endanger their lives, and will not charge a cent for keeping them, but you must pay their taxes and clothe them. \" sparing them pain was not a part of the agreement. \"lucy's agony was extreme, \" sims wrote of one patient, from whom he had to remove a sponge after failing to create a proper catheter to prevent her urine from seeping into her vagina. \"it was a very stupid thing for me to do … she was much prostrated, and i thought she was going to die. \" lucy did recover after",
            "For decades, a statue of a doctor who performed painful surgeries on enslaved black women without anesthesia stood in central park, across from the new york academy of medicine. On tuesday, that statue came down, while onlookers stood by and cheered. J. Marion sims was long known as the \"father of modern gynecology \": he's known for creating the vaginal speculum as well as a successful treatment for \"vesico-vaginal fistulas, \" a wound between a woman's bladder and vagina that often developed after childbirth. But sims conducted much of his research on slaves who were rarely given anesthesia. Three women, slaves named lucy, anarcha, and betsey, are known subjects of sims's work; other women's names have been lost to history. As debates about confederate monuments raged last year, academics and activists intensified their calls for sims's legacy to be revisited, noting that his work raises serious ethical questions about experimenting on women who could never truly consent. Those protests led to action on tuesday, when new york city mayor bill de blasio ordered the removal of sims's statue one day after new york city's public design commission voted unanimously to take"

            "Sims, who founded the country's first women's hospital in new york in 1855, developed his method of treating vesicovaginal fistula over three years of experimental surgeries, operating on 11 slave women in alabama who suffered from the condition, from 1846 to 1849, sometimes in front of observers to whom he wished to demonstrate his methods. The condition was considered incurable at the time. \"i made this proposition to the owners of the negroes, \" sims wrote in his autobiography, the story of my life. \"if you will give me anarcha and betsey for experiment, i agree to perform no experiment or operation on either of them to endanger their lives, and will not charge a cent for keeping them, but you must pay their taxes and clothe them. \" sparing them pain was not a part of the agreement. \"lucy's agony was extreme, \" sims wrote of one patient, from whom he had to remove a sponge after failing to create a proper catheter to prevent her urine from seeping into her vagina. \"it was a very stupid thing for me to do … she was much prostrated, and i thought she was going to die. \" lucy did recover after",

On tuesday, that statue came down, while onlookers stood by and cheered. J. Marion sims was long known as the \"father of modern gynecology \": he's known for creating the vaginal speculum as well as a successful treatment for \"vesico-vaginal fistulas, \" a wound between a woman's bladder and vagina that often developed after childbirth. But sims conducted much of his research on slaves who were rarely given anesthesia. Three women, slaves named lucy, anarcha, and betsey, are known subjects of sims's work; other women's names have been lost to history. As debates about confederate monuments raged last year, academics and activists intensified their calls for sims's legacy to be revisited, noting that his work raises serious ethical questions about experimenting on women who could never truly consent. Those protests led to action on tuesday, when new york city mayor bill de blasio ordered the removal of sims's statue one day after new york city's public design commission voted unanimously to take"

The cbc reports that superior court justice paul perrell ruled last monday that the woman's \" natural death is reasonably foreseeable, \" one of four criteria required for medically assisted death under bill c-14. Eligible individuals must also have a serious and incurable disease or disability, be in an irreversible state of advanced decline, and suffer from intolerable physical or psychological pain, per the globe and mail. Though the woman's condition is not terminal, perrell said it was clear \" she doesn't have long to live, given her age and health. \" perrell noted that the woman's doctor had concluded his patient's death was reasonably foreseeable but retracted his assessment out of fear that he could be charged with her murder. Perrell said the issue at the heart of the case was the doctor's \" abundance of caution and apprehensive misunderstanding, \" the toronto star reports. The law's \" reasonably foreseeable death \" criteria has long been a source of controversy, and advocates of legally assisted suicide celebrated perrell's decision for clearing up the confusion at the heart of c-14. \" we have found an inconsistent application when it comes to the eligibility criteria, \" says shanaaz gokool, ceo of dying with dignity, \" and i think this decision will go a long way to extinguish that sort of myth. \" ( here's how many californians have exercised their right to die. )",

        "summary": "Facebook has found a creative way to drastically bring down its tax bill in the uk: pay each employee who works there a million bucks, nbc news reports. As first noted in the sunday times, the company will pay out nearly $ 397 million in bonuses to uk staffers, which comes out to about $ 1.1 million each, with payments parceled out between now and the end of 2018. By doing so, facebook can count the bonuses as taxable expenses and slash a large amount off the net profit it has to pay corporation taxes on, the week explains. But while the soon-to-be wealthy staffers are likely celebrating, the british government is probably feeling a certain amount of frustration: just last week, facebook said it would revamp its tax structure in the name of more \" transparency \" amid criticism it was avoiding taxes in the uk, agreeing to stop diverting sales through ireland, the bbc notes. In 2014, facebook pulled a similar stunt, with the $ 50 million in stock awards it paid out to employees in the uk resulting in a meager $ 6,135 corporate tax bill, even though its revenue that year in the uk was close to $ 150 million, per the mirror and the ap. And apparently it's not the only company to take advantage of this loophole, with amazon and other multinational corporations working off of similar tax arrangements. Some say, however, that the company's fair share of taxes will still get paid — the plan will simply shift the tax burden to the millionaire employees, who are already said to be paid an average salary of nearly $ 300,000 each and are taxed at a 45 % rate.

Then there's her adorable family, made up of sexy husband channing tatum and 4-year-old daughter everly. On top of all that, jenna is committed to staying healthy and fit. So, how the heck did she score it all? simply put, she has worked her ass off for it. Image zoom jeff lipsky jenna's hustle started at an early age. She moved around a lot as a little girl, but one constant was dance. No matter where her family landed, she would throw herself into her art and spend hours perfecting her technique — which paid off in a big way. While attending the university of southern california, she got a job as a backup dancer for janet jackson. Gigs with *nsync and sean combs followed. But in 2006 her life really changed. That's when she starred in step up. Not only did the movie become a hit that propelled her into stardom, it's where she met and fell in love with channing. The two got married in 2009 and welcomed everly ( or \" evie \" as jenna calls her ) in 2013. Jenna's family isn't the only",

The evacuation: hundreds of members of the group were trapped near the israeli border, hemmed in by syrian forces and militants allied with the islamic state, reports the ap.

The bandages have traces of a rare, imported resin called pistacia that hasn't previously been detected in the mummification process until 600 years after this couple died.

Claire wineland suffered a stroke soon after the aug. 26 transplant, and her family took her off life support sunday. \" after a week of intensive care and various life saving procedures, it became clear that it was claire's time to go, \" says a post at the claire's place foundation — an organization she set up at age 13, notes cnn. Wineland had a big following on various social media platforms, including instagram and youtube. She even gave a tedx talk last year. \" life isn't just about being happy, \" she said. \" it's not about how you feel second to second. It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given. \" an instagram post from june was typical: it catalogued a series of setbacks she had recently suffered, including the discovery of mold in her apartment, particularly dangerous given her lung ailment. But she had no regrets, even though some had warned her of the risks of moving out on her own. \" you have to fight like hell to make sure that the life reflected back at you right now is one you want to be living, \" she wrote. \" i ' m not going to let myself live a life i ' m resentful of, \" one consumed by her health issues.

        "summary": "The robert mueller investigation just lost an important witness — and paul manafort may have lost additional years of freedom. In a court filing monday, the special counsel's team said president trump's former campaign chairman had violated a plea agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators. The team said manafort had \" committed federal crimes \" by lying about \" a variety of subject matters \" after he had pledged to cooperate \" fully and truthfully \" with investigators, the ap reports. The filing suggests mueller's team doesn't consider manafort a credible witness — and in any case, after publicly calling him a liar, \" they could hardly call him to testify, \" the new york times notes. The court filing stated that \" the nature of the defendant's crimes and lies \" will be outlined in a sentencing submission from the government, the washington post reports. Manafort's lawyers say he \" believes he provided truthful information \" to mueller's investigators. Manafort, currently being held in solitary confinement in a virginia detention center, cannot withdraw his guilty plea under the terms of the deal, though he can now be prosecuted for additional crimes — including the 10 felony charges that were dropped when he made the agreement. Prosecutors had also agreed to ask for a reduction of his sentence if he provided \" substantial assistance. \" manafort is expected to be sentenced to at least 10 years for crimes including conspiracy to obstruct justice. ( manafort looked very different at a hearing last month. )",

Mueller's team is pressuring him to plead guilty to lying to them about his communications with mr. Stone about wikileaks. Investigators are looking for links between the trump campaign and wikileaks, which distributed emails and other documents that russian agents stole from democratic computers before the 2016 election. Mr. Corsi said on monday that he refused the plea deal because he did not deliberately mislead investigators, but merely forgot about an email chain from two and a half years ago. In his most recent criticism of the special counsel, mr. Trump has suggested that prosecutors are frustrated because they cannot produce any evidence against his campaign. \"the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess, \" he wrote on twitter recently. \"they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want, \" he declared. \"they are a disgrace to our nation and don't care how many lives \" they ruin.

The independent recounts a horrific-sounding case out of mumbai, india, where a man underwent a two-hour procedure to have 50 maggots taken out of his nose and sinuses. The medical term for the condition is myiasis, which the cdc defines as \" infection with a fly larva. \" in the 55-year-old's case, a fly may have deposited its eggs in or near his nose. From there, the eggs would have hatched into maggots that ultimately grew to about a centimeter in length, fueled by the man's flesh. The insects could have ultimately eaten into the bones and soft tissues of the man's face, potentially leading to blindness or even death. Dr. Meenesh juvekar posted a rather graphic video of the procedure in late april that's just now getting notice. The independent notes that maggot hosts may not be aware that maggots are at the root of symptoms that can include sneezing, headaches, or puffy eyelids. To wit, in another recently publicized case out of india, a man suffering from buzzing in his ear ended up having hundreds of maggots removed, reports the huffington post, which has images.

More highlights from the evening: the big winners: kinky boots, best musical ( and the most wins of the night, with six ); vanya and sonia and masha and spike, best play; billy porter, kinky boots, best lead actor in a musical; patina miller, pippin, best lead actress in a musical; tracy letts, who's afraid of virginia woolf?, best lead actor in a play; cicely tyson, the trip to bountiful, best lead actress in a play ( her first tony win, after a 30-year absence from the stage, the los angeles times reports ). Click for a complete list of winners. Which means a few big names did not win: notably tom hanks, who was up for best lead actor in a play for his role in nora ephron's lucky guy. Harris teases his colleagues: nph, who of course is on the still-running how i met your mother, brought a bunch of broadway actors onstage to bemoan ( while singing, of course ) their canceled tv shows.

Support among democrats likely to vote in the party nominations fell to a little over 50 %. A separate poll for cnn, however, shows 57 % of americans would be happy with clinton in the oval office. In that poll, 51 % of respondents said clinton's email brouhaha was a problem, while 48 % said it wasn't a serious issue or a problem at all; 51 % said she acted wrongly, while 47 % said she didn't.

        "summary": "When german drugmaker bayer acquired agribusiness monsanto for $ 66 billion in june, the deal came with more than 5,000 lawsuits centered on claims that the latter's glyphosate-based weedkillers, such as roundup, cause cancer. As of the end of july, the number of lawsuits was about 8,000, reuters reports. In a thursday conference call bayer ceo werner baumann said, \" these numbers may rise or fall over time, but our view is that the number is not indicative of the merits of the plaintiff's cases \" — even after a recent $ 289 million jury award to california groundskeeper dying of cancer allegedly connected to his use of glyphosate. Baumann said the company will appeal that decision, which he called \" wrong \" and \" inconsistent with the robust science-based conclusions of regulators and health authorities worldwide, \" according to bloomberg. Still, since the aug. 10 verdict in california, bayer shares have reportedly lost more than 10 %. And analysts say that the glyphosate cases could cost the company some $ 5 billion. Nonetheless, the herbicide is still in demand, liam condon of bayer's agriculture unit tells bloomberg, saying, \" demand for glyphosate depends on the growing conditions, and not a jury decision in california. \" following the verdict, however, some california cities say they will no longer use glyphosate products. The cities of benicia and novato are going glyphosate-free, kgo-tv reports. The same goes for santa rosa, according to the press democrat.

In an interview tuesday on tmz live, west said, \" when you hear about slavery for 400 years, for 400 years, that sounds like a choice. \" he continued, \" like, you was there for 400 years and it's all of y ' all?! it's like we're mentally in prison. \" tmz's van lathan cracked back at west saying he's not a free-thinker, he's actually not thinking at all. Political commentator symone sanders tweeted she was \" disgusted \" with the remarks and called west \" a dangerous caricature. \" usa today rounds up twitter reactions to west's slavery remarks, which came after questions on the rapper's provocative posts and pictures in support of president donald trump last week. West also told tmz he became addicted to opioids that doctors prescribed after he had liposuction surgery in 2016. He was hospitalized for a week and had to cut short a tour. Also tuesday, west's interview last month with radio host charlamagne tha god was released; cnn has a recap, including west's discussion of his 2016 breakdown — or, as he calls it, a breakthrough — and why he believes his beef with taylor swift changed things for him. He also said he wishes former president obama would apologize to him for calling him a \" jackass \" after he interrupted swift at the 2009 mtv video music awards: he suggested obama should say something like, \" i ' m the leader of the free world, ye, i ' m sorry for calling you a jackass. I appreciate your honesty. I appreciate your gemini, your tupacness. I appreciate that someone is going to do it, but i ' m president and i can't do it. \"",

So long as you can foot the $ 10 million asking price, that is. The 16th-century castle's early decades weren't exactly smooth ones. Construction began on it in 1510, with the daily mail reporting the main wings were completed within 3 years. But edward stafford, the duke of buckingham, didn't reside there long: he was executed for treason in 1521, and henry viii seized it. The king and second wife anne boleyn stayed there for 10 days in 1535 during what's described as their \" honeymoon tour \" ( the two wed in 1533 ). Boleyn famously lost her head the next year. The castle remained in royal hands until the death of mary i — henry's daughter with first wife catherine of aragon — at which time the property was returned to the duke's descendants. But it passed two centuries unoccupied and fell into ruin, until it underwent a renovation in 1850, reports the telegraph. Today it is an exclusive hotel with 28 rooms featuring four-poster beds. You can dine in the dungeon, play croquet on the lawn, and engage in falconry and archery, according to its website. It also is a popular venue for weddings — hopefully ones more successful than henry's. ( henry and anne make this list of 5 infamous love scandals. )",

            "The manor of thornbury dates back to the 10th century and the time of the domesday book. In a disastrous ancient love triangle, brictric – one of the manor's earliest recorded owners – lost possession when he spurned the advances of matilda of flanders. Matilda later married william the conqueror, who seized thornbury, awarded it to his queen and imprisoned her one time love. Edward stafford, duke of buckingham, built the castle during the reign of henry viii, though he wasn't able to enjoy it for long.

The app hit the app store in september 2015, and her classmates were soon using it. The experience bolstered her confidence and gave her a \" reason to stick around, \" she said in a november 2017 tedx talk. She followed up with an app for bullied members of the lgbtq community.

Hooks performed on snl from 1986-91, the era of chris farley, phil hartman, dana carvey, and mike myers, among others. Her role as one of the two sweeney sisters ( with nora dunn ) was among her most famous, along with her impersonations of sinead o ' connor, hillary clinton, and kathie lee gifford, notes people. After her run on snl, she appeared on the show designing women for two seasons, and later, she got nominated for an emmy for her role as vicki dubcek on 3rd rock from the sun. Hooks got her start in her native atlanta on the bill tush show, then moved on to the national stage via not necessarily the news. All that is impressive, but she was actually \" at her best in what was her last role in 2010: verna, jenna maroney's mess of a mom on 30 rock, \" writes jordan kushins at gizmodo. She was in just two episodes, but they were enough to anoint her as \" the funniest dysfunctional mom on television. \" nbc news recounts this quote of hers, given to the atlanta journal-constitution in 1986 about her first episode of snl: \" when the band started, i felt i was being lifted to another level. I stared into space. I must have been catatonic. I remember the hair guy asking me, ' you with me honey? ' but deep within my heart i knew i could do it. I felt ok once i was out there. It's like a roller coaster ride. If you make it through the first trip, you can't wait to get back on. \"",
