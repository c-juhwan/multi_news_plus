        "summary": "Chris evans is back as captain america in an action-packed flick that seems better suited for a summer opening — and may in fact be better than its 2011 version. With a star-studded line-up, including scarlett johansson and robert redford, critics generally agree the winter soldier pleases. Here's what they're saying: at the minneapolis star tribune, colin covert calls the film \" a crackerjack summer blockbuster, three months early. \" it takes \" a flying leap off the basic premise of superhero movies, \" and is packed with adventure and plenty of dc-centered political intrigue. \" the film impregnates its settings with so much latent tension and unnerving evil that you expect the washington monument to start murdering everyone in sight, \" he writes. Adam nayman at the globe and mail is a big fan, too. \" this is the first marvel studios movie since the original iron man that really stands on its own. \" he applauds directors anthony and joe russo for \" tweaking this sequel to play more like a cloak-and-dagger thriller than a special-effects blowout. \" everything wrong with 2011's captain america \" has been fixed, and then some, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. The russos have ably succeeded in their goal to make a \" 1970s-style political-conspiracy thriller along the lines of three days of the condor. \" plus, \" evans makes captain america such a likable guy, as well as an old-school patriot, that he put me in mind of a very old-fashioned word to describe him. He's doughty. In a movie that deserves him. \" as for mike lasalle at the san francisco chronicle, the movie runs too long and the big action sequences fail to excite. While he concedes the film is \" watchable and reasonably entertaining... There's no getting around the fact that captain america is as dull as batman when it comes to combat. \" that, and \" somebody also might want to think about spending more than 10 minutes on the script. \"",

        "summary": "The long-awaited adaptation of orson scott card's beloved sci-fi classic ender's game has finally hit the big screen, and critics are more or less greeting it with a shrug. Reviews are mixed, and even supporters aren't over the moon for it. Here's what people are saying: \" ender's game is uneven — at times almost maddeningly so \" but \" it's never less than stunning to look at, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. But more importantly, and most refreshingly, \" it's about something. … it's nowhere as complex and involving as card's novel, but for those who prefer a little more meat on their sci-fi bones, this is an appetizing entree. \" michael o'sullivan at the washington post agrees. \" the film doesn't need added suspense, bigger action, or a better dramatic twist; it's got all of those, \" he writes. But more importantly, it treats war and genocide \" with surprising depth. \" he does warn that some deaths from the book are softened, which \" seems a little chicken-hearted of writer-director gavin hood. His audience can take it. \" much like its hero, \" ender's game is a bit of a tweener, neither triumph nor disaster, with a use-by date of nov. 22, when the new hunger games movie comes out, \" writes michael phillips at the chicago tribune. No one will mistake hood for a sci-fi visionary, but he manages to avoid \" an unwanted aura of retro-nostalgia, \" and the script does its job, \" only occasionally lapsing into trailer-speak. \" but joe morgenstern at the wall street journal despised the movie. \" the geniuses who made this soulless spectacle have mistaken training, in which little is at stake, for genuine action. \" it doesn't help that asa butterfield's ender is \" insufferably manipulative and generally dislikable, \" and \" doesn't seem all that brilliant \" either. Harrison ford plays his mentor \" with what's become his patented gloom; the actor's theme song should be ' bring in the frowns. ' \" ( for those who haven't read the book, our headline references a line you're sure to hear in the film: \" the enemy's gate is down. \" )",

In contrast to other budget showdowns of recent years, there have been no serious negotiations between president obama and john boehner — and no sign that joe biden and mitch mcconnell will come in from the sidelines with a deal to get the government running, the washington post reports. Instead, the gop is left to deal with harry reid, who has made it clear he is unwilling to budge. House republicans moved to pass bills funding the government one agency at a time, but that strategy was shot down by democratic opposition, and the white house promised to veto any bill that didn't resolve the whole shutdown. \" these piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government, \" a spokeswoman said. \" if house republicans are legitimately concerned about the impacts of a shutdown... They should do their job and pass a clean cr to reopen the government. \" as the capital braced for an extended shutdown, obama's schedule made it clear he plans to play hardball, the hill reports. He plans to hold events in the coming days to hammer republicans — especially boehner — over the shutdown. The president, who has scaled back his upcoming trip to asia, plans to meet corporate leaders today and will appear at a construction company that has benefited from federal loans tomorrow. It is becoming increasingly apparent to both parties that the budget fight is on a collision course with talks to raise the debt ceiling before the october 17 deadline, reports politico. \" this is now all together, \" warned senate majority whip dick durbin. Obama has said raising the limit is not negotiable. According to the la times, the best hope of resolving the crisis lies with an endangered species: moderate republicans. Democrats are managing to present a united front, but a growing number of gop centrists are calling for a simple, short-term spending bill. \" the most important thing for the country is to get a conclusion, \" said new jersey's rep.

But a gun rights attorney thought otherwise, and city officials agreed, forcing the zoo to take down signs at the venue's entrance that told visitors to forget about bringing their firearms inside. A complaint filed by the attorney pointed out that even though the zoo is privately owned, it's on public city land, meaning the zoo can't keep guns out if patrons have a license for them, the station notes. In fact, edwin walker isn't just aiming to keep the signs down, telling ktrk, \" i think the city of houston should apologize to [ concealed handgun license ] holders for violating their rights for the past dozen years. \" the station notes that although concealed carry was made lawful in texas more than 10 years ago, penalties for violating that right weren't spelled out until a recent bill that took effect sept. 1. Depending how many violations a venue racks up for banning guns, the fine for posting \" no guns allowed \" signs can be up to $ 10,000 per day, which some zoo visitors seem to agree with. \" if you have the right to carry, you should be able to carry, \" one tells khou. \" everyone should be safe.

Victor collins was found dead in james bates ' hot tub back in 2015, and bates has been charged in his friend's murder. Believing an amazon echo found near the scene of the crime could hold important clues, police are seeking 48 hours worth of audio recordings — both the commands of the echo user and the responses by its virtual assistant alexa — from the device. But in a 90-page motion filed last week, amazon claims those audio recordings are protected speech under the first amendment, forbes reports. Amazon argues that not only would handing over the recordings possibly give the government unconstitutional access to the user's consumption of books, music, and other content, but that alexa's responses are an extension of amazon's protected speech. A law professor says amazon has a \" surprisingly \" good case as long as alexa is viewed as an extension of the company. Amazon says police are just hoping to find something in the recordings and must prove they're necessary to the case, ars technica reports.

Being killed by a vending machine is among the things live science lists as more likely than winning the jackpot. At fivethirtyeight, walt hickey crunches the numbers to find out the odds of there being a winner on wednesday — though he notes that it is \" very hard to develop a sanity test for this number. \" the detroit free press looks at how much tax the winner will have to cough up and talks to some of the canadians crossing the border for tickets. \" jackpot fatigue? \" the los angeles times takes a look at how the jackpot came to be so enormous. The ap looks at the six states that have opted out of powerball, including two where residents can't simply pop across the state line for tickets. The winner will have a choice between a lump sum and an annuity, and the new york times explains why it makes more sense to go for the latter.

Women are now the primary or only income source for 40 % of us households with kids, according to a new pew survey. But that number might not be the cause for celebration it sounds like, because much of that 40 % is made up of struggling single moms. About 37 % of these \" breadwinner moms \" are married women who earn more than their husbands, and their families are doing quite well, with a median income of $ 80,000 — well above the national average. But the other 63 % are single mothers, with a median family income of just $ 23,000. One sociologist also tells the washington post that the trend may owe something to the disproportionate job losses suffered by men in the great recession. And the public is divided on whether working motherhood is even a good thing, with 51 % telling pew that kids are better off if mom stays home.

One of the video's boldest choices entails a koch heir sitting for his talking head interview wearing a shirt emblazoned with bags of money, as if that image alone couldn't resurrect the guillotine. \"my father said to me, 'wyatt, you can do whatever you want to in life.

        "summary": "Orangutans nurse their young for up to eight years or longer, a new study finds — a record for primates. As national geographic notes, it's difficult to study orangutans in the wild since they're so often out of sight in trees, but it's important for conservationists to know when juveniles become independent. Orangutans reproduce for the first time around age 15 and are estimated to live up to 50 years in the wild. They reproduce slowly, the new york times reports, with mothers raising one baby at a time for six to nine years before birthing another. To determine nursing length, researchers analyzed the levels of barium ( a trace element that orangutans absorb from their mother's milk ) in the teeth of four young orangutans whose bones had been kept in museums. The team found that one orangutan weaned at 8.1 years old; another was still nursing when it died at 8.8 years old. Before this research, scientists estimated orangutans might nurse for six to eight years, but it was difficult to know since field surveys are so challenging. Because the growth patterns of teeth \" resemble tree rings \" and can be easily dated, per a press release, they also revealed other interesting aspects of the nursing relationship: during periods of time when fruit was known to be abundant, barium levels were lower, and vice versa, indicating that when food was scarce, young orangutans nursed more. Researchers believe the fact that orangutans ' food supply is unpredictable is part of the reason they nurse so long — captive primates with a steady supply of food tend to mature at a faster rate than wild primates.

            "Nursing behavior is notoriously difficult to study in arboreal primates, particularly when offspring suckle inconspicuously in nests. Orangutans have the most prolonged nursing period of any mammal, with the cessation of suckling ( weaning ) estimated to occur at 6 to 8 years of age in the wild. Milk consumption is hypothesized to be relatively constant over this period, but direct evidence is limited. We previously demonstrated that trace element analysis of bioavailable elements from milk, such as barium, provides accurate estimates of early-life diet transitions and developmental stress when coupled with growth lines in the teeth of humans and nonhuman primates.

Both actors were seriously tall men who died young ( andre was 46, fingleton 36 ), and gizmodo wants to know why. The site looks into the common fate of early death shared by many vertically extreme individuals, who typically attain their height due to growth hormone issues starting at the pituitary gland, resulting in either gigantism ( which usually begins before the affected party even hits puberty ) or acromegaly, which bombards individuals with excess hormones after they think they've stopped growing. All that extra hormone action and height can lead to heart issues, which often end the patients ' lives. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in these cases, says an indiana university clinical professor, who adds, \" the heart is more stretched to supply this huge [ person ] with blood. \" insulin production can also be stymied by too much hormone, leading to diabetes. Men's health assures those on the higher end of the measuring stick they shouldn't fret too much: maintaining a healthy but low bmi, eating right, and keeping other factors like smoking in check collectively have more to do with how long you live than height alone. And in some cases, tall people even fared better when it came to lowering the risk of certain diseases. Meanwhile, scientists have recently turned their focus to the gpr101 gene, which may be linked to growth hormone disorders and could be targeted in future treatments, per medscape.

Even before it was officially announced, the reason for the stainless steel band running along the outside of the phone seemed enigmatic; many called it un-apple and decidedly atypical of seamless apple design which eschews hard edges. The black strips were written off as aesthetic curiosities, possibly even markings which denoted a fake. Then at the wwdc announcement, we learned the truth. The iphone 4's antenna is the stainless steel band that runs around the edge of the phone. The antenna for wifi, bluetooth, and gps is the smaller strip beginning in the bottom left and running to the top, and the cellular radio for voice and data is the much larger strip running around almost three quarters of the phone. It's a design nod back to some of the earliest cellular phone designs which packed external whips that one could manually extend for improving reception. Since then, designs evolved, and until recently virtually all smartphones have packed internal antennas at the bottom of the phone.

            "The real story on iphone 4's antenna \" how are you holding it? \" - brian klug \" three fingers. Like a [ redacted ] ninja turtle. \" - anand shimpi there's been a ton of discussion lately surrounding iphone 4 cellular reception. Even before it was officially announced, the reason for the stainless steel band running along the outside of the phone seemed enigmatic; many called it un-apple and decidedly atypical of seamless apple design which eschews hard edges. The black strips were written off as aesthetic curiosities, possibly even markings which denoted a fake. Then at the wwdc announcement, we learned the truth. The iphone 4's antenna is the stainless steel band that runs around the edge of the phone. The antenna for wifi, bluetooth, and gps is the smaller strip beginning in the bottom left and running to the top, and the cellular radio for voice and data is the much larger strip running around almost three quarters of the phone. It's a design nod back to some of the earliest cellular phone designs which packed external whips that one could manually extend for improving reception. Since then, designs evolved, and until recently virtually all smartphones have packed internal antennas at the bottom of the phone. The iphone 4's external antenna promises improved reception over the internal",

        "summary": "Three teens enrolled in the los angeles police department cadet program were arrested wednesday on suspicion of stealing three police vehicles, two stun guns, two radios, and a bulletproof vest, the los angeles times reports. According to ktla, officers noticed two cruisers missing around 5pm and found them driving together more than four hours later. The stolen cruisers split up, leading police on two chases that ended in crashes. Two male cadets and a female cadet — between the ages of 15 and 17 — were arrested, kabc reports. Chief charlie beck says the cadets \" may have impersonated \" actual officers and is asking the public to come forward about any \" activity being conducted by very young-appearing \" cops. Police say the cadets, who are not allowed to drive cruisers, signed the vehicles out using the names of officers. A third vehicle believed to have been stolen by the cadets may have been missing since last month. Thousands of teens have gone through the lapd cadet program, which has been touted as a success for developing life and leadership skills. Cadets get training and learn about police work before being given an opportunity to volunteer with officers at baseball games and more. Beck has ordered a review of the program in the wake of wednesday's police chases. \"these knuckleheads crippled a program that a lot of people depend on, \" one officer tells the times. \"it's sad. \"",

Jordan, obviously in need of some good press after indirectly breaking that poor woman's retainer, has announced his production company will require inclusion riders for all of its projects, mashable reports. According to the new york times, the black panther star is the first major actor to publicly adopt inclusion riders following frances mcdormand's call for them during sunday's oscars ceremony. Inclusion riders are contractual clauses that require a certain level of diversity among cast and crew for film productions. In an instagram post wednesday, jordan says his outlier society productions will use inclusion riders \" in support of the women &amp; men who are leading this fight. \" \" i've been privileged to work with powerful woman &amp; persons of color throughout my career &amp; it's outlier's mission to continue to create for talented individuals going forward, \" he says. Jordan's announcement was met with applause online, including from his creed costar. \" yes, \" tessa thompson tweets. \" this is how change happens. When we commit to making it. \" it's unclear what outlier's diversity requirements will be or if jordan will also require inclusion riders in his personal contracts, something a major movie star has yet to do. Outlier is currently producing a netflix series about the mother of a superhero in which jordan will appear, as well as a reboot of the thomas crown affair. \" this is a win on every level, \" says stacy smith, who studies gender equality in film and television. \" we're hopeful this is one of many to come. \" and, again, it's the least jordan could do after his shirtless torso broke that woman's retainer ( which, in fairness, he offered to replace ).",

One attendee writes that he found three small tents serving up slices \" smaller than my palm. \" another attendee gripes, \" all we got was warm red wine that tasted like a --! \" instagram posts show a grim scene, with a long entry line snaking along a chain-link fence. The similarly hyped new york city burger festival was set at the same time and place, npr notes, also noticeably absent of burgers. Pizza fest organizers apologized later on saturday, citing \" an incredible amount of delays \" in delivering pies. \" give us our money back, \" one woman fumes on facebook.

Maryland's portal, which was expected to experience few problems because state lawmakers got behind obamacare so early, advised residents to come back at noon. Also at that hour, president obama is holding an obamacare event in the oval office and then giving a statement in the rose garden. His administration continues to reassure people that the glitches were to be expected. At a department of health and human services briefing yesterday, kathleen sebelius had an especially snappy reply ready in advance, slate reports: \" i clearly have an ipad and i also have an iphone and about 10 days ago i got the prompt that the operating system had changed, \" so she upgraded to ios7, but a few days later she got a message saying, \" now we have a new new upgrade and why don't you re-upgrade your upgrade, \" she said.

        "summary": "Efforts to fight typhoid in some of the world's poorest countries have helped create an antibiotic-resistant \" superbug \" strain of the disease that's spreading worldwide, researchers warn. According to a study published in nature genetics, the resistant h58 strain of typhoid is now present in at least 21 countries, mainly in africa and asia, where it has displaced older and more easily treated forms of the bacteria, the bbc reports. The researchers, who looked at bacteria samples collected from 63 countries over more than 20 years, warn that h58 is \" completely transforming the genetic architecture of the disease and creating a previously under-appreciated and ongoing epidemic, \" reuters reports. The researchers say the h58 strain started to spread from south asia around 30 years ago and is making it much tougher for doctors to treat typhoid, which is spread through contaminated food and water and kills around 200,000 people a year. In countries where typhoid is endemic, vaccines aren't widely used but \" antibiotics are commonly used as a preventive measure. As a consequence, there is a rise in antibiotic resistance to many pathogens and in particular a resurgence of multidrug-resistant typhoid, \" study author vanessa wong tells cbs, which notes that while americans are at little risk from the disease at home, experts recommend they be vaccinated before traveling to at-risk areas.

But — at least until online expansion plans take hold — if you want to partake in the class that pairs yoga poses with pints of beer, screamed profanity, and metallica and black sabbath, you ' ll need to get yourself over to dickens pub in calgary, canada, on a monday or wednesday night. That's where and when lindsay-marie istace — contortionist, fire-eater, and all-around entertainer — has been practicing her unique form of the ancient spiritual discipline since january, according to vice. Istace says the idea for rage yoga came to her during the \" really painful breakup \" of a relationship. Conventional yoga classes, she tells cbc news, were \" very deadpan, serious, overly serene. \" \" and that's just not how i roll, \" she says. \" i ' m a very loud, colorful personality. \" rage yoga sessions, which typically attract five to 12 students, run $ 12 for drop-ins and $ 100 for a 10-class pass, per pop sugar. And the price of admission comes with two tickets for discounted draft pints. If a trip to canada isn't in your future, rage yoga may soon be offered online, according to sf gate. A kickstarter campaign to fund the venture collected $ 7,590 — 379 % more than the target. One day, istace tells the cbc, she hopes to bring rage yoga to brewery tours across canada. And to the traditionalists who marginalize her invention, istace says: \" that's fine. Different things work for different people and not everyone has to be on board. \" ( being told he couldn't do yoga on a commercial flight caused this passenger to rage. )",

It's a headline-worthy milestone, but the englewood, nj, woman's birthday is attracting extra attention because of an abc news interview she gave at the young age of 105. In it, she was asked about the secret to a long life, and the answer she gave was a pretty palatable one: beer and whisky. She said a doctor who treated her for a benign tumor decades ago gave her these parting words of advice: \" agnes, you must drink three miller high lifes a day. \" abc news says she went on to consume the recommended beers, plus a shot — preferably johnnie walker blue label — daily for roughly seven decades. Though her booze consumption certainly didn't shorten her life, it's not part of it now. The record notes that fenton doesn't eat very much these days, so her in-home caregivers have dropped alcohol from her diet. So what's her current long-life secret? \" ain't no secret, just keep in touch with god and do the right thing, that's all i know, \" she tells abc. In a mince-no-words interview with the record, fenton also dismissed her 110th birthday as \" just another day \" and told a reporter she felt \" lousy. \" as for whether picking up the bottle will help you make it to 110, well, not likely. Fenton's doctor of two decades had this to say: \" the few things she's had wrong with her have disappeared in ways they should not have. Her health has been phenomenal. … she's completely, thoroughly amazing. \" ( a 115-year-old woman had a less palatable secret. )",

The washington post reports president trump on wednesday boasted about the sale of f-52 fighter jets to norway. \"in november we started delivering the first f-52s and f-35 fighter jets, \" trump said during a press conference with norwegian prime minister erna solberg. \"we have a total of 52 and they've delivered a number of them already a little ahead of schedule. \" the problem: while the f-35 is real — and a bit of a boondoggle for the pentagon — the f-52 only exists in the video game call of duty: advanced warfare. The fictional jet appears during the \" throttle \" mission, which takes place in \" new baghdad \" and somehow involves kevin spacey, kotaku reports. You can watch the f-52 in action here. The post posits that trump, who was reading from a statement, likely saw the number of jets delivered — 52 — and mistakenly added an \" f \" designation to it. Press secretary sarah huckabee sanders refused to say if trump is a call of duty fan, and lockheed martin, which makes the f-35, wouldn't say if an f-52 is in the works. The plane-maker did say norway has approved money for 40 f-35s and has gotten 10 of them so far. Forbes notes the main feature of the near-future call of duty: advanced warfare is combat exosuits.

His anti-semitic rants on the site continued until moments before the attack, when he wrote, \" screw your optics, i ' m going in. \" gab co-founder and ceo andrew torba, however, a conservative and a leader of the \" alt-tech movement, \" says the site was designed to \" step up and defend free speech \" for all who joined and has denied that it seeks to attract far-right extremists.

It's not the first time russia has issued such a statement, and in the past, nato hasn't seen changes on the ground. When the troops will leave, as well as how many will depart, remains in question. If putin is easing pressure on ukraine, it may have something to do with the latter's likely next president, petro poroshenko. Polls and political insiders see the billionaire with strong odds against his closest rival, ex-pm yulia tymoshenko, the new york times reports. Poroshenko is pro-west: \" the main direction of development has to be european integration, \" he said at a recent debate. But he's also got business ties in russia, and he was economics minister under the ousted pro-russia president viktor f. Yanukovich. He's \" a dealmaker, \" says an expert. \" from that point of view, it may mean that putin is willing to give it a chance of trying to get something out of this. \"",

Attorney angela agrusa said after a hearing to set a trial date in a sex abuse lawsuit in los angeles superior court against the comedian that she \" can't imagine \" cosby's legal team would let him perform or speak publicly as representatives said he planned to do this summer. \" he doesn't take lightly these criminal charges, \" agrusa said. \" he would never do anything that undermined the importance of this issue. I don't see him speaking publicly like that. \" cosby spokesman andrew wyatt said by email that the legal team will not let him speak about sexual assault.

With this latest legal marker, one of the actor's attorneys and cosby himself now says it is highly unlikely the town hall tour cosby's pr team announced last week would go forward before any potential criminal case re-trial. In a hearing this morning, los angeles superior court judge craig kaplan pegged july 30, 2018 as the tentative start date for the civil case.

The judge did not set a schedule for how long the trial could last, if it even happens.

Attorney angela agrusa said after a hearing to set a trial date in a sex abuse lawsuit in los angeles superior court against the comedian that she \" can't imagine \" cosby's legal team would let him perform or speak publicly as representatives said he planned to do this summer. \" he doesn't take lightly these criminal charges, \" agrusa said. \" he would never do anything that undermined the importance of this issue. I don't see him speaking publicly like that. \" cosby spokesman andrew wyatt said by email that the legal team will not let him speak about sexual assault. He did not say if the public events would go forward. Talk of the forums after a jury deadlocked in pennsylvania in the criminal case sparked a backlash from groups that advocate for sexual assault victims and educate about sexual abuse. Spokespeople for cosby and his wife had said the forums",
            "( updated with cosby statement ) less than two weeks after a mistrial was declared in bill cosby's criminal case in pennsylvania for the 2004 rape of andrea constand, a california judge has put a trial date on the calendar for an alleged assault by cosby at the playboy mansion more than 42 years ago. With this latest legal marker, one of the actor's attorneys and cosby himself now says it is highly unlikely the town hall tour cosby's pr team announced last week would go forward before any potential criminal case re-trial. In a hearing this morning, los angeles superior court judge craig kaplan pegged july 30, 2018 as the tentative start date for the civil case. Although the golden state's former statute of limitations has passed on judy huth's claims of being sexually attacked at age 15 by cosby in 1974 at hugh hefner's home, she was still able to file in 2014 because she was a minor at the time of the alleged incident. The judge did not set a schedule for how long the trial could last, if it even happens. What kaplan did do is tell cosby's lawyers and huth's attorney gloria allred that they need to be back in court september 14 for a hearing on whether a second cosby deposition in the case will go forward"

Main suspect harold smith committed suicide a few weeks later as police tried to question him, and testing revealed a match between the gun he used and the gun that killed chasen. Police didn't think there was any connection between chasen and smith. The filmmaker who sued is making a movie about chasen's murder, according to the hollywood reporter.",

        "summary": "Seniors who want to gauge their own longevity might want to take a simple sniff test. Researchers at the university of chicago found that older people with a lousy sense of smell were significantly more likely to be dead in five years than those who could easily detect common scents, reports the bbc. In their study, the scientists asked about 3,000 americans ages 57 to 85 to identify five such scents: peppermint, fish, orange, rose, and leather. Researchers checked back in five years and discovered that 39 % of people who got none or only one correct had died, reports livescience. In contrast, only 10 % of those who got four or five right had died. As it turns out, a bad sense of smell was a bigger predictor of death than cancer, heart disease, or lung disease, reports webmd. \" we think loss of the sense of smell is like the canary in the coal mine, \" says lead author dr. Jayant pinto of the university of chicago at eurekalert. \" it doesn't directly cause death, but it's a harbinger — an early warning that something has gone badly wrong, that damage has been done. \" among the theories: in order to have a good sense of smell, the body needs to constantly regenerate cells in the nose. And if that healthy regeneration isn't happening in the nose, it may not be happening elsewhere in the body, either. Researchers, however, don't want people to stress out if they flunk a homemade kitchen test. They might just have a minor sinus problem.

Irma lopez, 29, says she and her husband walked for an hour to the clinic, but were turned away by a nurse who said she was \" still not ready \" to give birth. Well, lopez's water broke about 90 minutes later and she gave birth while clutching a wall next door in pain, the ap reports. And a witness snapped a photo of it that ran under screaming headlines across the country ( see the photo, with umbilical cord intact, at medical daily. ) critics say lopez was denied care because she's among the indigenous poor. \" they are not being offered quality health services, not even a humane treatment, \" said a reproductive rights advocate in mexico. The numbers bear that out: mexican states with the most indigenous people have the worst maternal-death rates, by far. As for lopez, she and her baby boy are healthy after receiving $ 30 in aid at the clinic. \" i am naming him salvador, \" she said, a name that translates as \" savior \" in english. \" he really saved himself. \"",

The new york man worked as a parking enforcement officer for five years in the village of mount kisco and stole $ 89,000 in coins over that time, police tell the journal news. Count that out: that's 356,000 quarters, 890,000 dimes, or 1.78 million nickels — enough for eight months of parking. Police say daday, 36, admitted to the theft, which was carried out between january 2009 and may 2014, after officers confronted him as he was leaving a bank. A police surveillance team began monitoring daday after local council officials realized a good chunk of change had disappeared, the daily mail reports. Authorities say they spotted the enforcement officer heading directly to people's united bank to make a deposit, rather than to the local council office, after emptying the meters. He has since pleaded guilty to grand larceny and offering a false instrument for filing and could see up to 15 years behind bars.

Among the noteworthy tidbits: fitzgerald called home to his mom frequently during their spree, and their public claim of trying to get to florida to marry may have been a sham. But the piece by william browning also ferrets out a strange connection between the two and the actual bonnie and clyde. It seems that in 1933, the outlaws stayed in joplin with a few other members of their gang for two weeks before police rousted them. The apartment they rented there is on the national register of historic places, and its owner once had a booth in the antiques store in town owned by fitzgerald's mother. The apartment owner recalls that bonnie and clyde memorabilia would turn up in the shop, and fitzgerald himself ( a \" polite, nice kid \" ) was interested in stopping by the famous apartment to check it out. \" he must have had an interest there that we didn't know about, \" says the owner. Whether deliberate or not, another parallel emerged later: the real bonnie and clyde reveled in their fame, and fitzgerald and harper seemed to do the same, posting social media updates about their escapes while on the lam.

        "summary": "Donald trump complained that his fortune was too big for disclosure forms, but he managed to squeeze it into a 92-page filing with the federal election commission that was made public yesterday. The filing doesn't show evidence of the \" ten billion dollars \" trump boasted of in a campaign release, though he's certainly wealthy, with income of $ 380 million last year and assets of at least $ 1.4 billion, reports the new york times. The paper notes that the exact size of trump's fortune is hard to pin down because a total of 23 assets are listed as \" over $ 50 million. \" a few tidbits from the filing: trump is already president of 457 entities, most of them part of the huge web of trump holdings, and is listed as director, chairman, or trustee of dozens of other companies, reports the guardian. Trump \" is a golf magnate at least as much as a real estate magnate, \" as politico puts it: the $ 176 million he raked in from golf courses in the us, ireland, and scotland accounted for more than 40 % of his income. Trump is getting a hefty union pension: he has appeared in movies like zoolander and home alone 2, as well as starred in the apprentice, which has earned him a $ 110,000 pension from the screen actors guild. He has been earning up to $ 450,000 each time he gives a speech and also makes money from a wide range of endorsement deals, including a $ 1 million arrangement with serta mattresses, though the times notes that his \" bombastic campaign style \" has killed off some of those deals. Trump made more than $ 500,000 from the central park carousel over 18 months, which is more than he made from his books: eleven of the 14 books he lists on the form brought in between nothing and $ 201 in royalties, the guardian reports, though 1987's the art of the deal made him up to $ 50,000, according to bloomberg.

Barnett was convicted in july on charges of attempted arson, possession of an unregistered destructive device, and making an unregistered destructive device. Before his sentencing wednesday, experts said barnett of ocala, fla., had assembled at least 10 explosive devices, which were hidden inside packages of stuffing mix, breakfast bars, and pasta intended for target stores in florida, virginia, and new york. Authorities said the bombs could've caused serious injury or death in addition to property damage, with 11alive noting they were meant to explode the moment the packages were picked up.

The teen's attorney argued that the penalty amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, but the judge in the case took a few days to assess things and decided that the punishment is warranted, reports kgw.com. The judge ordered the hood river juvenile department to set up a payment schedule, though he added one caveat to the ruling that might eventually give the kid a break. \" the court can grant a full or partial satisfaction of the restitution judgment after 10 years \" if certain conditions are met — mainly, if the teen doesn't get into any more trouble and faithfully makes what payments he can over the next decade. At that point, another judge will reassess and could decide that the debt is paid, even if it's nowhere near $ 37 million. On top of the financial penalty, the vancouver, wash., teen must complete about 2,000 hours of community service. He pleaded guilty earlier this year and wrote a letter of apology for his \" careless action \" that apparently did little to mitigate the sentence. The fire burned through the columbia river gorge and mt. Hood national forest, and a group of hikers required rescue. ( a witness says she saw the teen throw a \" smoke bomb \" into a ravine. )",

The judge had delayed the decision during a hearing in hood river on thursday, may 17, after the teenager's defense attorney claimed that the statute requiring full restitution is unconstitutional if imposed on a juvenile. The judge decided that the restitution requested in the case was in line with the seriousness of the offenses committed by the teen. He said, in a written ruling, that the restitution scheme meets the juvenile delinquency goals of \" personal responsibility, accountability and reformation with in the context of public safety. \" the judge said the court finds that the teen is unable to pay the judgment in full, and authorized the hood river juvenile department to establish a payment schedule. The judge said factors such as the teen's financial resources and other obligations will be taken into consideration when determining an appropriate payment plan.

A lawmaker from wisconsin says she wants wealthy americans to get the same treatment before they can enjoy generous tax deductions, yahoo news reports. Rep. Gwen moore's \" top 1 % accountability act of 2016 \" would require taxpayers with itemized deductions exceeding $ 150,000 to submit a clean drug test, according to a press release. If they refuse, they can take the lower standard deduction. \" it is my sincere hope that my bill will help eradicate the stigma associated with poverty and engage the american public in a substantive dialogue regarding the struggles of working- and middle-class families, \" moor says.

Npr calls her bill an \" implicit counterpunch \" to welfare drug testing laws backed by republicans. Some 15 states have passed laws to that require people who receive state welfare benefits to take drug tests. Among them are florida, michigan, and moore's own wisconsin, which also requires drug tests for people in the federal snap food stamp program. ( the feds have said that's a no-no. ) supporters say drug testing saves money and acts as an incentive to keep people clean. Critics say drug tests are a cure for a problem that doesn't exist, citing stats from florida that just 2 % of welfare recipients failed drug tests and 2 % declined to take the test.",

Reuters/florida dept of corrections/handout via reuters the two convicted murderers, released from the apalachicola correctional institute on forged documents that reduced their life-without-parole sentences, were recaptured on saturday at a motel in panama city beach, located on the florida panhandle. Joseph jenkins and charles walker were believed to be waiting to be transported to another state when they were found, gerald bailey, commissioner of the department of law enforcement, said at a news briefing. \"they had to have had help, and a lot of help, to get to where they were last night, \" bailey said. Walker and jenkins, both 34, had brief, routine court appearances on sunday and were being held in jail in bay county, florida, authorities said.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / updated by maggie fox congress sent president donald trump a multi-billion dollar poke in the eye monday, refusing to slash medical spending as trump proposed and instead giving the national institutes of health a $ 2 billion raise. The budget agreement, finalized in the wee hours of monday morning, also defies trump's demand for cuts to nasa's earth science program, which the administration had targeted as part of a wider promise to cut climate change research. And it provides $ 103 million to fight the opioid abuse epidemic — an area of rare bipartisan agreement that even trump supports. The new budget proposal, which needs votes in the house and senate, would keep the government running until october, when the 2018 budget is supposed to kick in. Trump had proposed slashing nih by $ 1.2 billion for the rest of 2017 to help pay for his proposed increases in defense spending. Instead, congress gave the nih an extra $ 2 billion for the next 6 months, bumping its total 2017 budget to $ 34 billion. Oklahoma rep.

Mitt romney, who is ostensibly uncaring, out-of-touch, and disdainful of poor people, gave more than 13 percent of his income ( amounting to millions and millions of dollars ) over twenty years to charity, and didn't even always take the full tax deduction. ( the bastard! ) \" harry reid: he presses the case for romney to release more returns, notes talking points memo. These show that romney \" manipulated one of the only two years of tax returns he's seen fit to show the american people — and then only to 'conform ' with his public statements. That raises the question: what else in those returns has romney manipulated? \" ezra klein, washington post: sorry, harry, but this proves you were flat-out wrong when you passed along rumors that romney paid zero taxes. That's \" shameful. \" as for romney, good for him for making $ 14 million while unemployed. The problem is \" his riches have come with lack of empathy for what it's like to be poor, or even just not-rich. \" john mccain: romney has now given \" an incredibly detailed look at his finances. \" let's move on.

        "summary": "What bernie sanders has touted as his devotion to his home state and his refusal to get negative against hillary clinton may be exactly what's hampered his campaign. That's according to more than 15 people in sanders ' camp — either professionally or personally — who tell the new york times that the vermont senator missed early opportunities to go after clinton and gain valuable momentum that could have placed him in a much better position than he is now — even in the front-runner seat. And part of the reason for these \" early missteps \" in 2015 and early 2016, as the times frames it, may seem surprising, considering the tenacity and perseverance that sanders is now showing: he didn't initially think he could win and simply wanted to spread his message about the inequities in america. Some feel he could have stepped up more aggressively, and sooner, speaking out more about clinton's email, goldman sachs speaking fees, and involvement in clinton foundation finances — topics sanders initially passed on. And some say if he had stumped more in early voting states instead of attending to his senatorial duties, as well as tried earlier to make inroads with black voters in key southern states, he may have built the momentum he needed. Not everyone agrees: a george washington university professor recently told the washington times that a tough sanders offensive would have seemed a \" selfish power grab \" that \" wouldn't [ have gone ] over well with the many idealists... In his base. \" although sanders has now dug his heels in for the long haul, clinton has what some say is an insurmountable delegate lead — 1,712 to bernie's 1,011, per bloomberg. Even his wife, jane, seems to have regrets. \" we didn't run all over the nation last year, \" she tells the new york times. \" it's something that gives you pause. \"",

A valuable 19th century gold coin emblazoned with \"in god we trust \" will help an indiana congregation secure a long-desired church building of their own as a critical financial deadline looms. The donor, a widow who wishes to remain anonymous, gave the coin to the gracepoint church in valparaiso earlier this year as \"seed money \" for the church's construction, a news release from texas-based heritage auctions says. The congregation was founded in 2009 and has been conducting sunday morning",
            "It's one thing to pass the collection plate for a few coins from parishioners. It's another when a single donated coin can help build a church. In february, ben lamb, pastor at gracepoint, approached his congregation during two services about a funding issue. The mobile church, which has been setting up shop each week at washington township elementary school, was in the midst of raising funds for a massive building project to turn a former furniture store off of u.s. 30 in valparaiso into a permanent home. Church officials needed to provide $ 300,000 to their lender before the bank would release the funds for the project. The money was due",
            "According to mint records, only 30 proof liberty double eagles were struck in 1866. Twenty five examples were delivered for inclusion in the proof sets on january 15, 1866, and five more were delivered on june 8 of that year. The number actually distributed is unknown, but the june striking might indicate the initial 25 sets had sold out. The number of coins surviving today is much smaller, as pcgs and ngc have combined to certify only 15 coins, including an unknown number of resubmissions and crossovers ( 3/17 ). Pcgs coinfacts estimates the surviving population as 14-16 examples in all grades, while our roster of known specimens lists 10 coins, with three pieces"

Miller-keyes spoke about sexual assault prevention, saying she would march for \" your body, your rights. \" the evening also touched on one of the year's biggest themes — the #metoo movement. In a video montage, the contestants talked about particular #metoo moments they had experienced and women's empowerment. The new york daily news reports that a jarring moment came when commentator carson kressley likened choosing from the final 15 to holocaust novel sophie's choice, in which a mother is forced to choose which of her children goes to the gas chamber.

        "summary": "A teen model from russia died during an assignment in china last week — and now there's a criminal probe by authorities in her home country as to why she died, and how a girl so young found herself in such a position in the first place. The inquiry into 14-year-old vlada dzyuba's death could offer insight into whether vlada — who the russian consulate in shanghai says apparently died oct. 20 of multiple organ failure spurred by a nervous system infection and sepsis — was overworked and whether her illness was exacerbated by work conditions, per the new york times. Initial media reports noted the perm teen had gone into a coma after a 13-hour fashion show in shanghai, though the times notes the sourcing on that story was iffy and that the show ended oct. 18 ( vlada didn't start feeling ill until oct. 24, per a timeline by her shanghai management company, esee model ). Johney zheng, esee's chair, says vlada worked between four and eight hours a day and also got time off while in china, per the hindu; a rep from vlada's russian agency also tells the times she wasn't overworked. There are also allegations she was underpaid, which esee denies. Another issue investigators are probing: why vlada didn't have health insurance, which some speculate may have kept her from being more vocal about being ill. Her contract with esee, which a scout tells the times was signed by herself and her mother, apparently mandated she have insurance before traveling, but it appears not to have been put in place; it's not clear who would've been responsible for doing so. Vlada died without family nearby, as her mom wasn't able to get to china in time. \" vlada was such a lovely girl, \" zheng told reporters. \" we wish that she can have no pain in heaven. \"",

Both survived with injuries that haven't been specified. Other revelations: the crew said it was relying on something called an \" autothrottle \" to maintain speed, raising questions about whether the cockpit's automated gear malfunctioned or was programmed incorrectly, reports the ap. Not only was the pilot flying the plane still in training on the 777, the instructor pilot supervising him was making his first trip as an instructor, reports cnn. It was their first time flying together. The instructor pilot told authorities he realized soon before the crash that the plane was too low, but their efforts to abort were too late, reports the la times. The four pilots aboard — three were in the cockpit and one in the cabin — were not tested for drugs or alcohol after the crash because the us doesn't have the authority to test foreign pilots. The plane did a 360-degree spin before coming to a stop. Hersman re-emphasized it's too early to blame pilot error for the crash.",

        "summary": "Fleetwood mac just kicked off its 50-city-plus north american tour without guitarist lindsey buckingham, and it wasn't because buckingham didn't want to be there. So says the 69-year-old guitarist's new lawsuit against the group, which outlines, per buckingham, how stevie nicks et al dumped him from the tour in january via his manager, just days after they'd all performed together at the musicares person of the year ceremony, us weekly reports. Buckingham claims the group had bristled at his request to push the start of the tour from august to november so he could promote a solo album, and so he put his personal plans on pause so he could make the tour happen. The news his bandmates had \" suddenly cut [ him ] off entirely \" was a shock. In an interview with rolling stone, buckingham offers a theory as to what expedited his firing: he \" smirked \" at ex-girlfriend stevie nicks as she gave a speech at that final performance. \" we have this standing joke that stevie, when she talks, goes on a long time, \" buckingham says. \" i may or may not have smirked. \" buckingham says the $ 12 million or so he estimates he would've been paid had he gone on the tour should still come his way, as he's still willing to tour and is being left out against his will, per the hollywood reporter. He's suing for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of oral contract, among other claims. \" i remain deeply surprised and saddened, as this decision ends the beautiful 43-year legacy we built together, \" buckingham says in a statement, nbc news reports.",

Others, however, take action on their own. Witness the case of teen known only as \" little wang, \" who, in an effort to end his addiction, cut his left hand off. The 19-year-old called a taxi to take him to the hospital last week, leaving a note telling his mother he'd be back soon. He left the hand behind on the nearby bench where he cut it off, the telegraph notes, but the hospital was able to reattach it. Still, he may not regain full control of it, surgeons say. \" we cannot accept what has happened. It was completely out of the blue. He was a smart boy, \" says his mother. A teacher says the boy's internet habit made him \" impetuous. \" china is one of several countries grappling with what the telegraph calls an addiction \" epidemic \"; in china, it's known as wangyin, the new yorker reported last year. Taiwan has established fining systems for parents who let their kids spend too much time on their computers. Japan, like china, has addiction-fighting camps; china now has some 250 of them, kotaku reported last year. China sees such addiction as a clinical disorder that's among the top dangers to young people, though there may be a political side to that, the new yorker noted, given that the government is concerned about people organizing online.

Cfls, which replaced the original thomas edison-inspired incandescent bulbs in the mid-1980s, did last longer, but consumers didn't like how long they took to warm up, the harsh light they emitted, or the fact that they used mercury. Leds came along and seemed to be a panacea: these energy-efficient bulbs boasted warmer, more appealing light that lasted longer than other types of bulbs: the ge release notes \" a single led bulb can light a child's bedroom desk lamp from birth through college graduation. \" but led bulbs were super-expensive — until recently, and now more people are finally starting to use them thanks to the cost reduction: per the national electrical manufacturers association, leds now make up 15 % of bulbs sold in the us — a nearly 240 % increase from 2014, the new york times notes. And the leds ' potential for use in \" smart \" technology has experts particularly excited. Gizmodo notes that, in addition to providing illumination, the circuit boards in leds can power bluetooth and wifi antennas and serve as a power source for sensors in consumers ' homes. \" we're going to make leds more accessible, and we ' ll start using light bulbs for more than just lighting, \" a ge global marketing manager says. \" we think that light bulbs will be able to sense or hear. They can be nodes throughout your house. \" ( mit researchers may have figured out how to make incandescent bulbs way more efficient. )",

Latham roldan — the trainer for jola, a belgian malinois, for three years — \" just left the kennel \" inside his vehicle in \" a case of negligence, \" a sheriff's spokesman says. For about 20 hours, the dog was trapped in the car in alice, texas, where the mercury hit 99 degrees — meaning it was much hotter than that inside the car. Sheriff oscar lopez tells kris tv that k9 handlers take their dogs home after their shifts to care for them as if they're their own pets. \" they work with him, they feed him, take him to [ the ] veterinarian, but it's their responsibility, \" he says. He adds in a televised interview with the station that, in this case, \" there's no excuses. There's no excuses. \" what makes jola's passing even more tragic: every police vehicle with a k9 kennel has a special system that's supposed to turn on the ac, roll down the windows, and emit an alarm when temps in the car reach a certain high, reuters notes, adding the system didn't appear to be activated in this case. The local prosecutor's office is investigating roldan, who's reportedly never had issues with k9 handling before, enjoyed a bond with jola, and is said be \" very remorseful \" by the police captain who fired him, nbc notes. Meanwhile, officers are also taking jola's death hard. \" it's just a sad situation when you lose a member from our department, \" an official from the sheriff's department tells reuters, while a posting on the jim wells county sheriff's department facebook page implores people to \" please watch their pets and animals, especially in these extreme temperatures. \"",

        "summary": "It seemed brilliant, so long as you're not claustrophobic: in early march, peter berkowitz armed himself with a few friends and a few tools and built a 32-square-foot wooden box, euphemistically referred to as a \" bedroom pod, \" and placed it in a friend's living room. With a negotiated $ 400 in rent, the pod, which cost $ 1,300 to construct, seemed the perfect solution for a 25-year-old who couldn't afford a whole bedroom of his own in san francisco's pricey market ( median rent for a one-bedroom, per figures cited by business insider: $ 3,460 ). Unfortunately, it was an illegal solution. Though sfgate reports a door, windows, and a skylight open it up somewhat, the city's chief housing inspector tells hoodline that berkowitz \" would have to completely open it up \" to comply with housing, building, and fire safety codes. She suggests a bed surrounded by a curtain. William strawn, with the department of building inspection, warns that a fire in the building could render berkowitz \" toast \" and says space, air, and light requirements were being breached. It seems berkowitz's ambitions, in addition to all the publicity and online photos, may have sunk him: strawn tells hoodline there was concern that berkowitz \" is going out and trying to increase the number of these, \" ostensibly in response to an earlier hoodline article that suggested he planned to sell pods to others. ( a post on his website backs that up. ) berkowitz now says he was just trying to \" gauge interest \" in the idea, which he isn't moving forward with. But he has moved — out of the pod. He tells the guardian he's \" 100 % concerned with doing this legally \" and the box has been dismantled. He's currently bunking with family.
