        "summary": "A new study suggests that when it comes to dating, women tend to pick partners who bear at least a slight resemblance to their own brothers. Reporting in the journal evolution and human behavior, the researchers write that selecting \" optimal \" breeding mates — not too closely related, but not too distantly, either — appears to be something we humans do, and though they haven't tested it yet, they suggest that men likely do the same. In the study, the researchers had women submit photos of their brothers and boyfriends, then added photos of three other men to the \" boyfriend \" mix. They had strangers choose which of the boyfriend photos most closely resembled the brother. The strangers picked the actual boyfriend 27 % of the time, which discover sees as a \" small but statistically significant \" improvement over mere chance. \" we have such a strong aversive reaction to thoughts of anything even remotely resembling incest that you might assume there would be no way that a woman's partner could resemble her brother — but the study shows this not to be the case, \" one of the researchers tells psypost. That said, she notes that the tendency is only subtle and needs to be studied further. Discover explains that there might be biological reason behind the preference: while incest carries all kinds of genetic risks, \" some amount of genetic similarity between parents can actually be evolutionarily advantageous. \" it's what the researchers call \" optimal outbreeding. \" ( this woman married her son, and later her daughter. )",

        "summary": "\" this is a senseless, senseless tragedy that did not need to be, \" says a california police chief after a gang member paroled earlier this month allegedly killed a relative and a police officer. At least two officers had responded to the scene of a vehicle accident in whittier around 8: 30am monday and were told the 26-year-old man, with tattoos on his face and neck, had rear-ended another vehicle, authorities tell ktla. Noting the man's \" gang attire, \" the officers — who were wearing bulletproof vests — ordered him out of his vehicle and were about to pat him down \" when he pulled out his gun and … started shooting, \" a rep for the los angeles county sheriff's department tells cnn. Keith boyer, a 27-year veteran of the whittier police department, died at the hospital while patrick hazel, a three-year veteran, was admitted in stable condition. Neither officer had realized the suspect — who was injured in the gunfight and is in intensive care — had been driving a car stolen from east los angeles, where he'd fatally shot his 46-year-old cousin around 5: 30am, authorities say, per the los angeles times. The gunman's identity has not been released, nor have details about his prior criminal record. Whittier's police chief says the man was released from jail early because of new laws meant to reduce prison stays, which he says actually make cities less safe. \" we need to wake up, \" he said through tears, describing boyer as \" the best of the best. \"",

This is how as many as 40 british, american, australian, dutch, and japanese warships from world war ii — which also serve as the graves of up to 4,500 crew members — have been desecrated in waters off singapore, indonesia, and malaysia, at an increasing rate and to an increasing extent. Using impressive maps and graphics, the guardian describes the efforts of salvage divers posing as researchers or fishermen in the java sea. Australia-based maritime archaeologist james hunter says he \" couldn't believe \" the shift from plucking off pieces of a ship to taking it in its entirety until he saw it with his own eyes. \" i was completely horrified, \" he says. Though some experts believe a single ship can yield $ 1 million worth of steel, even if it's in poor shape, hunter scratched his head at how the value of the corroded metal can offset the cost of the operation. The age of the steel is potentially why, and outside explained the science earlier this year: during the steel-making process, oxygen is blown into the mix, \" along with ambient atmospheric particulates. \" once we began detonating nukes in the 1940s, steel started to contain radiation. Radiation-free steel from these pre-nuclear-era ships commands very high prices. And hunter fears the deepest wrecks won't long be protected from divers. Technology \" is enabling people to find and potentially salvage wrecks in extremely deep water, \" he says. \" this threat is getting bigger. \" ( more on the salvaging here. )",

            "Last november, a team of international divers departed the indonesian island of java on a mission to survey sunken world war ii warships. The dutch government had tasked them to assess the condition of two particular dutch vessels, the hr. Ms. Java and hr. Ms. De ruyter, both sunk in 1942 during the battle of the java sea, not far from the remote island of bawean. Conditions there are notoriously dangerous: seemingly endless schools of stinging jellyfish and currents capable of sweeping away even a master diver. Those same currents also kill visibility underwater, limiting it to as little as an arm's length. Ocean depths in this area can be more than 200 feet, so the dive team knew they'd have to get pretty far down to see any sign of the ships. But as they descended deeper and deeper, the ships remained elusive. In moments like that, a good diver can't help but run through a quick mental checklist: are we using the right coordinates? did we properly set the anchor? have we begun to drift? as the seafloor came into view, answers to a few of those questions became clear. The divers had not drifted. Their anchor had held. And they were in precisely the right place. The ship, on the other hand, was"

What exactly are the s-300 systems capable of? a second israeli minister says they have a range of up to 185 miles; the ap, which puts their range at 125 miles, reports they're able to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously. What does israel have to say about all this? no statement has been issued yet.",

The pageant initially named elizabeth fechtel its winner, and the 20-year-old university of florida student basked in the glory for all of five days, until a pageant official arrived at her house thursday evening to inform her that first runner-up victoria cowen is getting the crown instead. Fechtel had already dropped her classes at the university of florida to begin preparation for the miss america pageant, her mom tells the orlando sentinel. So what happened? pageant officials told the fechtels that one judge changed his mind about who should finish first in the final seconds of his allotted time and drew lines on his ballot to reverse his vote, reports the tampa bay times. The switch got overlooked initially, but a subsequent independent audit confirmed that cowen was the rightful winner. Fechtel called to congratulate her friend, and she ' ll also have to hand over the thousands in scholarship money she won ever so briefly. In a statement, the pageant chalked it up to an \" error in the tabulation process. \" in delaware, meanwhile, the newly crowned winner got stripped of her title because she was too old at 24.",

My own experience with moles is limited to the sight of their carcasses at my doorstep, laid there by our triumphant and generous cat. Stretched out on the cold bluestone, they look like little more than eyeless pouches of fur. Ken catania of vanderbilt university has gone a long way to redeeming the mole. In the 1990s, he did some of the first studies of star-nosed moles, a species with 22 oddly finger-shaped tentacles flaring from its nostrils. He discovered that those tentacles are an exquisitely sensitive touch organ with 25,000 sense receptors. It uses this bizarre star to rapidly scan its tunnels for food, sweeping back and forth a dozen times a second. It takes a fifth of a second from encountering a piece of food for the star-nosed mole to eat it, making it the fastest eater on record in the animal kingdom.

Syria, meanwhile, has provided a perfect base for isis fighters; anbar province, which borders syria, has suffered seven major attacks in the past week alone, as fighters pass freely across the border. Maliki will ask for us help in the fight when he visits washington in three days.",

        "summary": "Hollywood is a sadder place with the loss of beloved star debbie reynolds, who died wednesday, just a day after the death of daughter carrie fisher. The 84-year-old reynolds is believed to have suffered a stroke at son todd fisher's home while planning her daughter's funeral, the bbc reports. Todd fisher said the grief and stress of carrie's death had been too much for his mother and the last thing she said was that \" she was very, very sad about losing carrie and that she would like to be with her again, \" per the guardian. Experts say that in extremely stressful events like the death of a spouse or a child, it really is possible to die from a broken heart, with a surge of hormones creating a condition the american heart association calls stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Grief expert david kessler tells usa today that dying of a broken heart is not only \" absolutely real, \" he believes it is \" extremely underdiagnosed. \" kessler, who worked with fisher several times, says the condition is more often seen among couples who were married for many decades, but reynolds and her daughter were so close that he \" would not be surprised if part of this was broken heart syndrome. \" some reactions to reynolds'death: bette midler: \" this is too hard to comprehend. Beautiful, talented, devoted to her craft, she follows carrie, dead days ago. \" debra messing, reynolds ' \" daughter \" on will &amp; grace: \" so heartsick. Debbie went to be with carrie. It's such a devastating 1,2 punch. She was my \" mom \" for years &amp; i loved her dearly. A legend. \" albert brooks, who played her son in mother: \" debbie reynolds, a legend and my movie mom.

German and swiss researchers surveyed 10,226 people in nine european countries on their marital status and body mass index — a health indicator based on a person's height and weight — as well as their eating and exercise habits. The results, which factored in socioeconomic status, age, and nationality, show marriage really does make you pack on the pounds: an extra 4.5 pounds in average-height 5-foot-11-inch men and 5-foot-5-inch women, to be precise, reports medical daily. That number is based on an average bmi of 25.7 for single men, compared to 26.3 for married men. Single women had a bmi of 25.1, while the number was 25.6 for married women, per sciencedaily. A normal bmi is 18.5 to 25; 25 to 30 is considered overweight. Though the risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes and cardiovascular disease climb with a person's bmi, the study doesn't actually show single people are healthier. Married men and women across austria, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, and the united kingdom were found to eat better than their single counterparts. Married couples reported buying more regional and unprocessed foods and less fast food, while married men were more likely to buy organic and fair-trade food than single men. \" that indicates that particularly men in long-term relationships are more likely to eat more consciously and, in turn, probably more healthily, \" the lead author says. But here's the downside: married men also skimp on physical activity, the author notes, which suggests \" couples are not healthier in every respect, as has previously been assumed. \" ( this 1970s marital trend is on the rise. )",

What's more, \" many marine mammal researchers have been killed flying in small planes while surveying whales, \" an expert says. Now, scientists have a potential solution to the problem. A team has successfully counted whales at or near the water's surface using satellite imagery, the bbc reports. They bought a single picture from the worldview2 satellite, which can spot items just 20 inches long on earth's surface. The image, showing 70 square miles, focused on a breeding area used by southern right whales off the coast of argentina. Whales made up just a few pixels in the image. When scientists counted the whales themselves, they spotted 55 likely candidates — as well as 22 that may have been whales and 13 underwater shapes that looked like the animals, the times reports. A computer program also counted the images, finding 89 % of the probable whales. \" as the resolution of the satellites increases and our image analysis improves, we should be able to monitor many more species, \" says a researcher, noting that \" total population counts \" should eventually be possible.",

Nbc news reports that some 80,000 native-born citizens were incarcerated in one of 10 hastily constructed camps along with some 40,000 immigrants. An apology was made by president ford in 1976, and reparations for the \" grave injustice \" were authorized by congress in 1988, smithsonian reports.

Last summer, npr reporter lisa morehouse traveled with riichi fuwa to what's left of tule lake camp, which sits just south of the oregon border. \" i wanted to see the place for the last time, \" the 98-year-old says. She looks at it through the lens of the forced agriculture that occurred there. In an editorial, the los angeles times looks back on what it calls its \" shameful response \" to internment, which read in part, \" the time has come to realize that the rigors of war demand proper detention of japanese and their immediate removal from the most acute danger spots. It is not a pleasant task. But it must be done and done now. There is no safe alternative. \" you likely know dorothea lange for her famed dust bowl photos ( especially this one ) from the 1930s, but the war relocation authority hired her in 1942 to photograph the incarceration of japanese americans. Her photos were embargoed by the government for three decades. Nbc news reports on her \" misgivings \" about what was happening. Read executive order 9066, which doesn't actually refer to japanese americans, at the national archives, which also offers a history of the internment.

But 15 years and $ 5 million later, the program has been deemed a failure — not a single crime was said to have been solved with the database's assistance — and the \" ballistics fingerprinting \" law was repealed on oct. 1. Parris glendening, whose administration set up the database while he was governor, is sad to see the demise of his brainchild. \" obviously, i ' m disappointed, \" he tells the sun. But a local gun-shop owner in anne arundel county describes the initiative as \" a waste, \" and gun rights advocate john lott tells fox news, \" [ the ] money … could have been better used for actual police and law-enforcement resources. \" tech issues plagued the system from the get-go. Gun manufacturers had to fire every new gun made in maryland, then send the casing to the three-room shelter nestled beneath maryland state police headquarters, the sun notes. Each casing got a unique bar code and its picture taken before it was sealed up in envelopes and filed in boxes. In theory, it should've worked, since casing scratches can be matched back to the originating firearm, but the maryland program was much larger than a successful federal program it modeled itself after, and the database software was so buggy that the sun notes it \" would sometimes spit out hundreds of matches \" for one crime-scene casing. A similar program started in new york in 2000 shut down just two years later, per breitbart. The maryland law was brought up for repeal several times over the years, but police kept insisting it had potential — until the latest hearing, when its defenders gave up.

A police report issued monday says the perpetrators used a professional harvesting machine to gather up $ 9,200 of grapes used to make riesling wine. Amazingly, the vineyard in rhineland-palatinate sits beside a supermarket parking lot, but authorities say no one raised an eyebrow. \" no one is surprised when a harvester drives through the vineyards in the fall, \" says a police source. It's nothing new, either: between 1,300 and 1,700 pounds of grapes were stolen in the surrounding bad duerkheim district last year, per the bbc, and a virginia vineyard allegedly had two and a half tons of grapes worth $ 50,000 stolen last fall. \" i can handle losing a crop to mother nature, but to come in and take my crop in the middle of the night and steal what we've worked for eight months, that's disheartening, \" the vineyard owner tells the washington post.

Commuters were frustrated and confused, as bart officials closed and reopened the powell street station four times and the civic center station three times - sometimes within minutes - fearing that roaming protesters would disrupt transit service.

Shortly before 9 p.m., san francisco police began arresting 35 people in connection with the demonstration near the san francisco main library near hyde and grove streets. Most were cited for failing to disperse or illegally blocking traffic. Police spokesman albie esparza said no vandalism was reported in connection with the demonstration, but police did confiscate a hammer from one demonstrator.

For the first time, a major freighter has crossed the northwest passage in the arctic, reports the toronto globe and mail. The 735-foot nordic orion achieved the feat this week when it entered baffin bay. Doing so shaved 1,000 nautical miles off the usual route through the panama canal and saved the freighter's danish operators about $ 80,000 worth of fuel, reports reuters. The fact that the ship burned less fuel than normal might be a small silver lining for environmentalists — until they see its cargo: coal, and lots of it, bound from british columbia to finland. And because the freighter didn't have to pass through the shallow panama canal, it was able to carry 25 % more of the stuff, reports the national post. The feat is expected to speed up international talks on shipping regulations for the passage, which until now had been mostly theoretical, notes the globe and mail.",

        "summary": "Scientists have detected previously unknown movement along the san andreas fault, although the discovery doesn't change the two most important facts: there will be a major quake along the california fault at some point, and nobody knows just when it will happen. The analysis of gps data found that large areas of land along the fault, including the los angeles basin, are rising by 2mm to 3mm a year — which nbc san francisco notes counts as major movement in seismic terms — while other areas, including santa barbara and san luis obispo counties, are sinking. The motion makes it seem like the huge 125-mile lobes of land along the fault are \" doing the wave in slow motion, \" reports live science. Lead study author sam howell of the university of hawaii tells the los angeles times that the movement is the result of a buildup of seismic energy, which will eventually be released in an earthquake. He says they happen along the fault roughly every 150 years, and while the last major one was 159 years ago, stress has been building up in some areas for centuries longer. The movement will help researchers \" understand more about how the fault is behaving and the effect it's going to have in the surrounding region, \" he says, though it won't be any help in predicting an exact date for the next quake. \" it's pretty much impossible to say when the next one will happen. \" ( the director of the southern california earthquake center says the southern part of the fault \" looks like it's locked, loaded, and ready to go. \" )",

He was treated and sent home with meds, but soon he was wheezing and feeling numbness and tingling, and he was rushed by ambulance to the er. He died at the age of 55 sunday, surrounded by his family, and doctors say the cause of death was rabies, likely from the bats. It's utah's first death from rabies in almost 75 years. On a gofundme that has raised more than $ 7,300 to help the family pay for medical and funeral costs, one of giles'daughters explains her dad was transferred to the icu on oct. 20, and the family was told he was in a coma on oct. 26. He was taken off life support sunday. A utah department of health epidemiologist tells ksl contracting rabies is rare, and that bats are the most common cause in utah, but that once symptoms pop up — and they can take three to 12 weeks to emerge — it's usually fatal. He adds people may not even feel the bat's tiny claws or teeth puncturing the skin. \" i've always thought bats were kind of cute, \" juanita giles tells ksl, adding she and her husband would sometimes \" wake up in the night and they would be walking on our bed. \" she adds: \" i had no idea the kind of risk we were at. \" ( a new jersey woman strangled a rabid fox. )",

The 1.5-inch-tall pendant, complete with gold threads and filigree pellets, features the image of an open-armed man and is almost identical to a silver crucifix found in sweden, visible here. A release speculates it was worn by a viking woman. The independent calls it \" one of the most well preserved christian artifacts found in denmark, \" but its date, ad900 to ad950, is what most intrigues experts. Christian missionaries were known to be in denmark in the eighth century, but the oldest known depiction of jesus on a cross in denmark — on what is known as the jelling stones — didn't appear until ad965. It was believed to signify the start of the conversion of the danes, most of whom were christian by 1050. But since the pendant predates the jelling stones by at least 15 years, it \" can therefore help to advance the time when one considers that the danes really were christians, \" beck says. \" the person who wore it would undoubtedly have adhered to the christian faith. \" she adds the find is so significant that the history books will need to be rewritten. \" i have not yet grasped that find's influence on denmark's history, \" holm tells tv2. \" it is hard to comprehend. \" ( last year, a man with a metal detector uncovered nazi-era treasure. )",

So when word of the incident reached alamo founder and ceo tim league, he tweeted ( below ) that madonna would no longer be welcome at the chain until she \"apologizes to movie fans. \" asked by ew if he was serious about the ban — at one point while defending his stance on twitter he had called it a joke — league replied late saturday, \"yeah, i ' m serious, but i don't think it really affects her life that much. \" league pointed out his initial tweet was an \"offhand joke, a spur of the moment 140 characters \" and was \"more of a means to get the issue out there, that it is rude to text during movies. \" \"but now that it seems to have taken hold, sure, i ' m going to enforce it, \" he added.",
            "I don't know about you, but i have a hard time confronting rude people in public. Someone decides that sneezing on the back of my head with an uncovered hand is something they must do? i grit my teeth in silence. Someone talks during a movie? i do a strategic \" half turn \" in my seat at the most. I am tragically non-confrontational. So i kind of admire whoever thought it was a good idea to confront madonna for texting during a recent screening of the new film by steve mcqueen, 12 years a slave. However, this person was clearly insane. Because, uh, they decided it was a good and reasonable thing to confront madonna? clearly they have been quietly living under a rock for many, many years. Because madonna is not someone who is going to tolerate a talking-to -- no matter how well deserved it might be! if a person is also a brand, maybe leave the etiquette lesson for another day. I ' m not saying madonna was right to text up a storm during the flick, i ' m saying i think it's naive to think that scolding her in public is going to have the desired effect. I ' m not wrong. Exhibit what happened next. Rather than just ignore her teacher in the school of manners"

She said it nearly 50 times, and that rant has now earned her a three-year prison sentence, with one year suspended. The bbc calls the south african ruling a \" landmark \" one, as it's the first time there a white person has been sentenced to prison for racism. Her conviction and sentencing arose out of an incident that happened in johannesburg in february 2016, when momberg made an emergency call to say she'd been robbed. When black cops showed up to help her, she didn't like that, and hurled the word \" kaffir \" — an offensive word often used to describe blacks during the era of apartheid — at them a total of 48 times in what the bbc deems a \" rage-filled, vitriolic assault. \" someone caught her diatribe on tape, and it soon went viral. \" i do not want a black person to assist me, \" she can be heard saying in the video ( edited version here ), per buzzfeed, before threatening to run the cops over and shoot \" everybody. \" momberg was convicted in november of crimen injuria, the use of racial or other emotionally damaging insults that \" unlawfully, intentionally, and seriously [ impair ] the dignity of another. \" momberg's lawyers argued she'd gone through an \" emotional storm \" after being robbed, per the bbc, and that she should be sent to rehab, not a jail cell. Many online celebrated momberg's sentence, though some agreed she needs help. One commenter on twitter called her a \" hateful racist \" but noted that \" paying damages to the cop she insulted &amp; community service in a black community \" would have served as a more \" restorative justice \" than prison time.

( associated press ) republican presidential candidate, ohio gov. John kasich hands a pen back to a supporter after signing his autograph during a campaign stop at hofstra university, monday, april 4, 2016, in hempstead, n.y. ( ap photo/julie jacobson ) ( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — the latest on campaign 2016 as voters in wisconsin head to the polls for the state's presidential primary ( all times eastern daylight time ): 8: 20 p.m. Wisconsin is projected to have its highest turnout in a presidential primary since 1980, but that hasn't translated into problems at the polls. The state elections board projects turnout at 40 percent of eligible voters. Board spokesman mike haas says clerks around the state had reported a busy pace but manageable lines throughout the day. The state is holding just its second election since voters were required to show photo identification, and haas says his office hadn't heard of any major issues. Neil albrecht, executive director of milwaukee's election commission, said wait times in the state's largest city didn't exceed 30 minutes even during peak voting. Albrecht estimated the city would have four to five times the same-day voter registration it had for the primary four years ago. __ 7: 25 p.m. Bernie sanders offered few details on how he would break up big financial institutions during a recent interview with the new york daily news. The vermont senator was pressed on how he would carry out his campaign pledge",

Per federal authorities, levian pacheco, who used to work for southwest key's casa kokopelli facility in mesa, has pleaded not guilty to nearly a dozen sex offenses against at least eight immigrant boys, as originally detailed in propublica. Pacheco, 25, who court documents indicate is hiv-positive, is accused of performing oral sex on two of the teen boys, one of which he tried to anally rape, as well as of groping a half-dozen other teens through their clothes. The incidents were alleged to have taken place between august 2016 and july 2017. All of the victims were unaccompanied minors, though it's not clear if they were separated from their parents or came to the us alone. Propublica goes into disturbing detail on accusations from each of pacheco's eight alleged victims; records indicate \" a couple \" of the boys have requested hiv tests. Propublica also documents other alleged instances of sexual abuse, fondling ( by workers and other children ), and runaways at sites run by southwest key, the biggest immigrant youth shelter operator in the us. The ap notes one of those cases: a former southwest key worker at a different facility than the one pacheco worked at has been accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl. The alleged incident involving fernando magaz negrete is said to have taken place june 27 in the girl's bedroom. In a statement, southwest key addresses the abuse allegations, outlining its hiring process and how it educates kids to protect themselves, noting, \" our number one priority... Is to keep the children in our care safe. \"",

        "summary": "China appears to be tired of the us and other nations blaming beijing for not reining in north korea. \" the ' china responsibility theory ' on the peninsula nuclear issue can stop, \" said foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang, per reuters. He didn't name names, but he said that \" certain people, talking about the korean peninsula nuclear issue, have been exaggerating and giving prominence \" to china's role. ( president trump has been among them. ) geng said other nations must step up, too, and the wall street journal reports that the us is preparing to do just that, but in a way that surely won't please beijing. The report says the justice department is readying its own sanctions against north korea, with the target being chinese businesses and banks thought to be bankrolling the regime. Specifically, the feds may go after a network run by a chinese national named chi yupeng, who is one of the biggest importers of north korean products into china. The justice department, citing information from north korean defectors, says chi's network funnels money to the north's military. All this is playing out in the wake of pyongyang's july 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile — north korea celebrated the feat as only north korea can — but south korea's yonhap news agency is now raising a key doubt about that launch. The south's spy agency does not believe that the north has figured out how to keep an icbm stable as it re-enters the atmosphere after launch. Without such a system, the north wouldn't be able to mount a warhead, nuclear or otherwise, and expect it to survive the re-entry process, explains cnn.",

After consuming three highly caffeinated beverages in a two-hour period, 16-year-old student davis allen cripe collapsed and died in april, reports wyff 4. Richland county coroner gary watts has now confirmed that the cause of death was a caffeine-induced cardiac event. According to the state, after davis drank a large diet mountain dew, a mcdonald's latte, and an energy drink within a two-hour period, he collapsed in class. He was pronounced dead at the hospital just over an hour later. Cripe's father sean says his son was healthy at the time of his death, and davis ' autopsy revealed no pre-existing heart conditions. \" it was so much caffeine at the time of his death, that it caused his arrhythmia, \" watts says. \"davis, like so many other kids and so many other people out there today, was doing something [ he ] thought was totally harmless, and that was ingesting lots of caffeine, \" watts says, adding that because caffeinated drinks affect people differently, it's difficult to gauge an exact limit. Consumer affairs reported in 2015 that the issue is especially relevant to teens, with nearly 31 % of 12- to 19-year-olds consuming energy drinks regularly. Of 5,448 caffeine overdoses in 2007, 46 % occurred in people under 19, and those with underlying heart problems are especially vulnerable. In a tearful press conference monday ( see video above ), sean cripes urged parents and teens to learn from what happened to his son, who was known for loving music and giving out hugs. \"it wasn't a car crash that took his life, \" sean says. \"instead, it was an energy drink. \" ( another teen died after drinking three energy drinks within a 24-hour period. )",

            "Cbs most americans believe the massive federal budget deficit is a very serious problem that will create hardships for future generations, according to a new cbs news/new york times poll. Sixty-four percent say they are very concerned the deficit will create hardship in the future, and another 26 percent are somewhat concerned. Just eight percent say they are not concerned. Fifty-six percent say the deficit needs immediate action, while 38 percent say efforts to address the deficit can wait until the economy has improved. Republicans and independents were more likely to push to deal with the deficit now, while democrats were more likely to say it can wait. So how do americans propose to address the deficit? by cutting programs, not raising taxes. Sixty-two percent would prefer to cut programs from which they benefit, including 81 percent of republicans. Just 29 percent want taxes raised, including 42 percent of democrats. Pollsters asked americans which of three programs - the military, medicare and social security - they would be willing to change to cut government spending. The military was by far the top choice, cited by 55 percent. Twenty-one percent cited medicare, and 13 percent social security. Asked specifically which of four options they would prefer to reduce military spending, the top choice ( cited by 55 percent ) was reducing troops in europe and asia. Nineteen",
            "On thursday, a large group of house conservatives called for cutting $ 2.5 trillion in mostly unspecified spending over the next decade and house republican leaders have vowed to make spending cuts a priority in coming months after winning a majority on that promise in november's midterm elections. President obama is expected to make fiscal responsibility a central theme of his state of the union address on tuesday night, and of the budget he will send congress next month for the 2012 fiscal year, which starts oct. 1. The antitax sentiment reflected in the poll is in line with republicans ' mantra that spending, not taxes, is the problem for the federal budget. Yet that assessment contradicts the conclusions of several bipartisan and academic panels that proposed debt-reduction plans over the past year. Those groups — including, in november, a bipartisan majority of mr. Obama's fiscal commission — each concluded that the growth in the nation's debt could not be reined in with spending cuts alone. They said the required reductions, including for medicare and social security, would be deeper than anything the public would accept.

            "Cbs most americans believe the massive federal budget deficit is a very serious problem that will create hardships for future generations, according to a new cbs news/new york times poll. Sixty-four percent say they are very concerned the deficit will create hardship in the future, and another 26 percent are somewhat concerned. Just eight percent say they are not concerned. Fifty-six percent say the deficit needs immediate action, while 38 percent say efforts to address the deficit can wait until the economy has improved. Republicans and independents were more likely to push to deal with the deficit now, while democrats were more likely to say it can wait. So how do americans propose to address the deficit? by cutting programs, not raising taxes. Sixty-two percent would prefer to cut programs from which they benefit, including 81 percent of republicans. Just 29 percent want taxes raised, including 42 percent of democrats. Pollsters asked americans which of three programs - the military, medicare and social security - they would be willing to change to cut government spending. The military was by far the top choice, cited by 55 percent. Twenty-one percent cited medicare, and 13 percent social security. Asked specifically which of four options they would prefer to reduce military spending, the top choice ( cited by 55 percent ) was reducing troops in europe and asia. Nineteen",
            "On thursday, a large group of house conservatives called for cutting $ 2.5 trillion in mostly unspecified spending over the next decade and house republican leaders have vowed to make spending cuts a priority in coming months after winning a majority on that promise in november's midterm elections. President obama is expected to make fiscal responsibility a central theme of his state of the union address on tuesday night, and of the budget he will send congress next month for the 2012 fiscal year, which starts oct. 1. The antitax sentiment reflected in the poll is in line with republicans ' mantra that spending, not taxes, is the problem for the federal budget. Yet that assessment contradicts the conclusions of several bipartisan and academic panels that proposed debt-reduction plans over the past year. Those groups — including, in november, a bipartisan majority of mr. Obama's fiscal commission — each concluded that the growth in the nation's debt could not be reined in with spending cuts alone. They said the required reductions, including for medicare and social security, would be deeper than anything the public would accept. The poll of 1,036 adults nationwide, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, was conducted jan. 15 through 19 — in the days after mr. Obama gave a widely praised address at a tucson memorial"

Yes, that's a \" b \" as in billion, making this the largest data breach ever, notes cnet. The company is blaming \" state-sponsored \" hackers for the 2014 breach, without offering specifics. Related coverage: what should users do? in addition to changing passwords and security questions, they might consider enabling two-step authentication. See recode and usa today for advice. The danger of the hack? the data \" could be useful ammunition for any hacker attempting to break into yahoo accounts, or interested in exploring whether users might have used the same security questions/answers to protect themselves elsewhere on the web, \" writes security expert graham cluley on his blog. Yahoo got wind of the breach when it heard in july of this year that someone was trying to sell account credentials for 280 million users on the black market. It looked into the allegation and found that the truth was actually much worse. See bloomberg. Might this screw up verizon's deal to buy yahoo for $ 4.8 billion? in short, maybe. Yahoo isn't saying whether it learned of the hack before announcing the verizon deal in july. For now, verizon is saying only that it has \" limited information and understanding of the impact. \" see the washington post.

        "summary": "Reddit's ex-talent director is speaking out for the first time since she was unceremoniously fired last week. In a post on reddit ( obviously ), victoria taylor, who ran \" ask me anything \" interviews, writes that her weekend was \" interesting, to say the least \" but gives no details on why she was let go. Instead, she says she's figuring out what's next for her and thanks the reddit community for its support and for showing that \" your voices matter. \" in a since-deleted post on quora — gawker has a screenshot — the site's business and community leader marc bodnick did probe the reasons behind her departure. After speaking to \" someone close to reddit, \" he wrote that taylor was hesitant to experiment with new ama formats, including video, which management wanted. Bodnick also confirmed reddit fired taylor without notifying moderators, who were peeved. In a new york times op-ed, two moderators explain exactly why they were upset and shut down the ama subreddit. First, reddit removed taylor \" without warning or providing alternative resources, \" they write. They say they first learned of her termination when an ama guest turned up at reddit's new york office to find \" a canceled appointment and no backup support. Our team got a panicked message — and we had no real idea what was going on. \" while interim ceo ellen pao has put the issue down to miscommunication, the moderators say there was no communication at all. \" moderators and ama guests were left stranded \" by a move that shows \" a reckless disregard for the company's own business and for the work the moderators and users put into the site, \" they write. \" dismissing victoria taylor was part of a long pattern of insisting the community and the moderators do more with less. \" ( many redditors are unhappy with pao. )",

        "summary": "The la school district is taking flak for going after one of its own middle-school girls in court over a sexual abuse case. Attorneys for the district argued that the 14-year-old should be held responsible for a sexual relationship with a teacher and thus deserved no money for emotional trauma. They also presented the girl's sexual history in court — and won the case. Consider this quote from one of those attorneys, keith wyatt, to kpcc: \" she lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher. She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that? \" critics contend that the answer is obvious: an eighth-grader can't consent to a sexual relationship with a 28-year-old teacher. Or as a non-district attorney puts it in the los angeles times: \" the belief that middle-school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates, not the second-largest school district in the us. \" the issue was a no-brainer in criminal court, where teacher elkis hermida was convicted of lewd acts against a child and sentenced to three years in prison. But as kpcc points out, the age of consent isn't as clear cut in civil cases. Critics of the los angeles unified school district just wish it weren't a school district that exploited the discrepancy. Meanwhile, wyatt's quote has caused so much outrage that the district says it will no longer use him for legal matters, reports ap.",

When notified, officials said, the district immediately removed the teacher, elkis hermida, from the classroom; he was subsequently convicted on criminal charges of lewd acts against a child and sentenced to three years in prison in 2011.",

The district's attorneys also introduced the girl's sexual history into the trial as part of their defense strategy. Two legal experts sharply criticized the school district for using those tactics. They also said the case highlights a little-known conflict in california law: while the age of consent is firmly set at 18 in criminal cases, at least two appellate court rulings have found that in civil cases, it is possible to argue that a minor can consent to sex with an adult. Last november's case involved a math teacher at thomas edison middle school in southeast los angeles who in december 2010 began a six-month sexual relationship with a girl who went to the school.

She says kristen visits them often at her ranch in santa monica, california – where they have the run of the house. Jules, a patron of charity wolfconnection.org, said: \"i live up in the mountain with my mutts. I moved there for them, it's a getaway. \"kristen loves the wolves. She grew up with them, the animals are family to her. \" jules first fell for the animals when she was 17 and given a wolf cub by her zoo keeper boyfriend. She said: \"there were no rules about owning wild animals. I got a little white wolf cub for my birthday, had him till he was 15. \" ( image: getty ) she then adopted four more later in life. She said: \"they chew my shoes and open the fridge and help themselves. They start howling and jumping around when they see me. \"the neighbours are ok – but friends usually don't"

The bbc reports german carmakers funded research that involved having humans and monkeys inhale diesel exhaust fumes to gauge the health impact. The research was done at the behest of the european research group on environment and health in the transport sector ( aka eugt ), which was exclusively funded by volkswagen, daimler, and bmw until they did away with the group in 2017. In a lengthy article published thursday, the new york times dug into the monkey side of things, reporting on a 2014 experiment in an albuquerque, nm, lab in which 10 monkeys sat in airtight chambers for four hours as fumes from a diesel volkswagen beetle were piped in, all as cartoons played for entertainment. It was supposed to provide ammunition against a 2012 classification by the who that diesel exhaust is a carcinogen, but the results were both \" deliberately manipulated \" and inconclusive. Over the weekend came the news that the tests didn't stop at monkeys. German newspapers reported 25 adults were exposed to fumes over a number of hours as part of a look at \" short-term nitrogen dioxide inhalation by healthy people, \" per deutsche welle, which reports the subjects were examined by germany's aachen university hospital. Daimler on sunday said it is \" appalled, \" per the bbc, and a rep for angela merkel said the tests \" cannot be justified ethically in any way. \" the hospital noted in a statement that the study \" served to optimize job security, for example for truck drivers, vehicle mechanics, and welders, \" deutsche welle reports.",

Here are two of the other hot topics from sunday morning: nunes memo: mccarthy said on meet the press that a memo regarding the investigation into russian election interference and trump campaign collusion compiled by rep.

But according to abc news, graham told this week someone \" without a political bias \" needs to look at the memo first, and gowdy downplayed its significance to fox news sunday. Immigration: manchin discussed the white house's recent immigration plan on both meet the press and state of the union, reuters reports. Despite house minority leader nancy pelosi decrying the plan as a way to \" make america white again, \" manchin said it's a \" good starting point \" and thinks congress can use it to \" find a pathway forward. \"",

According to officials, redrick allegedly walked out of the union square subway station and began shouting racist threats before he hit babbit and two others. Babbit went to bellevue hospital, where officials say he eventually slipped into a coma. His neighbors say they're in shock. \" very peaceful, very friendly, very helpful for example, like a neighbor. Very, very good people, \" said one neighbor. \" he was really kind-hearted, and it's really unfortunate that happened, \" said another",
            "For more than a decade, jeffrey babbitt traveled two or three times a week from his home in sheepshead bay, brooklyn, to a comic book store called forbidden planet just below union square in manhattan. There, he bought the latest copies of \"x-men \" or \"doctor who, \" or sometimes just chatted up the employees, who over the years had become good friends. For mr. Babbitt, 62, who friends said was a retired train conductor, the store offered an escape into fantasy and a bit of a respite from home, where he cared for his 94-year-old mother, lucille babbitt. \"he was just a really, really, really sweet guy, \" said jeff ayers, a manager at the store who has known mr. Babbit for years. \"one of our staff just had a baby and he was dying to see pictures. \" mr. Babbitt was walking through union square near forbidden planet last wednesday when he was punched in the face seemingly at random by an assailant who, the police said, declared his intention to \"punch the first white man i see. \" after he was hit, mr. Babbitt fell to the ground, striking his head on the pavement, the police said. The attacker, whom the police identified as lashawn marten, then struck two men who came to mr. Babbitt's aid, they"

The new yorker rolled into the golden state at the city of blythe last week after riding 2,700 miles across 17 states — mostly along historic route 66 — on a distinctive blue citi bike he checked out in manhattan on aug. 6. Citi bike is a fee-based bicycle sharing system. Speaking to new york magazine from albuquerque this month, tanenhaus said his job as a corporate event planner ( to which he used to commute on a citi bike ) and his apartment lease were both ending, and he \" couldn't stomach \" getting \" just another job. I was out of options in new york, and i thought of the great american road trip. \" but, he tells new york, \" i didn't expect to get very far — down the jersey shore at the most. \" along the way to california, tanenhaus saw the washington, dc, sights; the grand canyon; and the gravesite of col. Harland sanders ( think kfc ), among other things. In the southwest, wind and frigid temperatures were a challenge. Gusts up to 40mph forced him to sometimes push the bike, the new york post reports. Strangers helped out, providing rides and allowing tanenhaus to couch-surf or bunk in rvs. In october, tanenhaus had to detour to a hospital after an angry oklahoma driver punched him in the face. And he took a break in november, flying back to new york for thanksgiving. Tanenhaus tells the post that he plans to knock around joshua tree national park for a while, and then reach santa monica, the end of route 66, by mid-january. As for the bike, tanenhaus has been billed $ 1,200 by citi bike ( \" which i thought was fair \" ). He tells new york he wants to get it back to the \" ecosystem from where it came, \" which means disassembling it and taking it back to nyc on a train.

With the help of parents and caregivers, researchers assigned autism \" scores \" to 44 males with the disorder, ages 13 to 27; higher numbers on two different scales were linked to more severe symptoms. Twenty-six subjects received the chemical, called sulforaphane, for 18 weeks, while others got a placebo. The scores of who took sulforaphane dropped by 34 % or 17 %, depending on which scale was used, livescience reports. They showed, for instance, less irritability and less trouble communicating. In 17 of the participants, changes were noticeable enough that family and medical workers were able to guess that they were on the real treatment rather than the placebo. Approximately a third of subjects showed no improvement. \" this is by no means a ' cure, ' but sulforaphane may ameliorate symptoms of autism, \" a researcher says. The study follows reports that kids with autism show fewer symptoms when they have a fever, he says; sulforaphane can have an effect on cells that mimics what's seen in a fever. In addition to broccoli, sulforaphane is found in cabbage and cauliflower, a press release notes. But just eating tons of the vegetables wouldn't likely produce the same results, researchers say. Studies have shown a 30 % increase in the disorder in just two years.",

For 18 weeks, 26 of the participants received between 9 and 27 milligrams of sulforaphane daily ( depending on their weight ), while the remaining 14 participants received a placebo. \" we believe that this may be preliminary evidence for the first treatment for autism that improves symptoms by apparently correcting some of the underlying cellular problems, \" study author dr.

These participants showed improvements in behavior, such as having fewer bouts of irritability, a decrease in repetitive movements, and fewer problems with communication and motivation.

        "summary": "By at least one measure, the great recession that started in december 2007 was officially recovered from by the time president obama left office, the new york times reports. According to census bureau figures released tuesday, the median household income in america in 2016 was $ 59,039 — an increase of 3.2 %. That puts the median household income above where it was in 2007 before the recession hit. \" real median household income has finally completed its nine-year slog of digging out of the ditch, \" one economist tells usa today. And the washington post reports last year's median household income was the highest on record — beating out the previous high set in 1999. However, the census bureau changed its methodology in 2014, so the record isn't definitive. Median household income is one of the most important signs of how the middle class is doing, and the census report shows good progress by low- and middle-income americans in the final two years of the obama administration. The census attributes the gains in 2016 to a lot of americans finding full-time or better-paying jobs. Also in 2016, the number of americans living in poverty dropped from 43.1 million in 2015 to 40.6 million. However, inequality remains a problem. The median income for white households in 2016 was about $ 65,000; it was $ 39,500 for black households. Meanwhile, asian households had a median income of $ 81,400 and hispanic households of $ 47,700.",

The report, which analyzed homicides since 2010, reveals that deadly force by police accounted for the second-highest number of homicides in utah — 45 deaths, or 15 % of all homicides — with only domestic violence responsible for more. This review comes on the heels of a south jordan man being shot to death by police over the weekend in a horse corral, the tribune reports. This year alone there have been 13 homicides involving cops. Of the deadly encounters between police and citizens over the period of the report, county prosecutors considered only one to be \" unjustified \" — and manslaughter charges against that detective were dismissed in october, the tribune notes. While the training manual for utah recruits states, \" officers may use any force available provided they can justify the reasonableness of force used, \" the ex-chief of police in omaha notes the nuances, telling the tribune, \" sometimes the line between ' is it legal and is it necessary ' becomes difficult to distinguish. \" ( deadly force was used in the weekend shooting of a 12-year-old cleveland boy. )",

The big talking point out of the bipartisan deal is one summed up by david kirp in an op-ed at the new york times: the new act \" shifts, for the first time since the reagan years, the balance of power in education away from washington and back to the states. \" and \" that's a welcome about-face \" in kirp's view. He rounds up a litany of teach-to-the-test criticisms about the original bush-era law, arguing that it's done more harm than good and was long overdue for the scrap heap. \" good riddance. \" this end-of-an era sentiment is common in coverage, writes alia wong at the atlantic, who cautions that the reform isn't as sweeping as headlines suggest. \" for all the breathless hype, the legislation seems unlikely to produce many changes that are actually visible on the ground, \" writes wong. For one thing, 42 states already have waivers from the no child left behind requirements deemed the most odious. And while the new act does have promising new elements, including funding to expand access to preschool, wong thinks that \" all the applause and whoops and back-patting \" are a little much. The piece concludes with a link to another op-ed by conor williams, who calls the new act a \" brilliant piece of political posturing \" at the74million.org. \" it takes a relatively simple federal accountability system, removes the teeth, and layers on a bunch of vague responsibilities for states, \" he writes. \" just because something is a compromise doesn't mean that it will do good things for children. \" click for the full posts from kirp, wong, or williams.",

Gingrich has the most to lose, with the washington post noting that he's the fifth contender to top the polls this year. He has performed well in previous debates — in fact, debate performance is largely what resurrected his campaign — but he ' ll have to live up to a higher standard now that he's seen as a serious candidate. Longtime observers expect him to do well, since foreign policy is one of his strengths. Mitt romney has focused on his ability to create jobs; tonight he will have to prove that he is strong enough to compete with a president who oversaw osama bin laden's death, moammar gadhafi's ouster, the afghanistan surge, and the iraq draw-down. After his embarrassing libya gaffe, herman cain will have another shot to explain his position — and if he wants to recover, he ' ll have to prove he actually knows something about foreign policy. Jon huntsman, the only candidate with foreign policy experience, could get a chance to shine — but his positions so far haven't resonated with voters. Will his message — opposition to us foreign entanglements — finally break through tonight? previous debates have not showcased many policy clashes between candidates — but this time, look for quite a few differences when it comes to how we should deal with iran's nuclear program, pakistan, an afghanistan withdrawal, waterboarding, and more.

Braun also reportedly said she may have been a \" little flattered by figaro's attentions — he noted figaro \" looks good, \" is well-mannered, and wears brand-name cologne — and mused on the different levels of consent required for kissing versus grabbing someone's buttocks. However, braun conceded that even if the teen, who he stated in his ruling had a \" voluptuous \" figure, had initially been flirty, she'd also shown she didn't offer consent for figaro to do much of what he did. Justice minister stephanie vallee filed a complaint against braun to the local magistrates council and told reporters wednesday his comments were \" unacceptable. \" figaro, who denies sexual contact happened, is appealing.
