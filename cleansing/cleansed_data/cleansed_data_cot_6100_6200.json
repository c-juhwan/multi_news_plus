Billionaire venture capitalist tim draper says he has gathered enough signatures for his \" six californias \" plan to go ahead and he plans to file them with state authorities today, reports reuters. His plan would split america's most populous state into silicon valley around the san francisco bay area; central california, including cities like bakersfield; west california, which would include la; south california, including san diego; north california, encompassing the sacramento area; and the state of jefferson in the northernmost part of the current state. \" california needs a reboot, \" his campaign said in a press release. \" six californias is our opportunity to solve the many problems we face today... Six states that are more representative and accountable. \" draper has poured $ 4.9 million of his own money into the campaign to split up the state, but few believe it has any chance of succeeding at the ballot box, or winning congressional approval even if californians do decide to break up the state, the contra costa times reports. \" this is a colossal and divisive waste of time, energy, and money that will hurt the california brand, our ability to attract business and jobs and move our state forward together, \" says a spokesman for the onecalifornia team created to oppose draper's plan. According to nonpartisan state analysts, if the state is split into six, silicon valley will be america's richest state and central california will be its poorest.",

A federal grand jury on friday indicted adam w. Purinton, 51, on two counts of hate crimes and a firearms charge in connection with the february attack in a bar in olathe. Purinton allegedly shouted racial slurs when he shot srinivas kuchibhotla, 32, who later died, and alok madasani, 32, both of whom worked for the tech firm garmin. A third man who stepped in was wounded. Local authorities charged purington with first-degree murder and other charges, but federal prosecutors were under pressure to act at a time when president trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was being blamed for sparking violence, the new york times reports. Local media reported purinton thought he had shot two iranians. Justice department officials said they had not decided whether to seek the death penalty for purinton or life in prison, per reuters. Kuchibhotla's widow, sunayana dumala, tells the times that although the indictment was \" a reminder to me that srinivas is not here with us … the federal charges will give us national visibility to help spread the message of reducing hate crimes. \" effects of the attack reverberated far beyond kansas, with the father of one of the injured men in india warning parents there \" not to send their children \" to the us, per the post.

A judge handed down an indictment today, and trial is set to begin in early april, reports msnbc. The case threatens to finally topple the scandal-plagued leader. Belusconi, 74, said yesterday he has no intention, however, of relinquishing his office even after hundreds of thousands of italian women protested the aging leader over the weekend. Berlusconi is charged with paying to have sex with a 17-year-old moroccan girl, then using his influence to get her out of police custody when she was detained in a suspected theft. Critics say belusconi used his power to help the girl, fearing exposure of the affair could ruin him. Though the prime minister has stood trial on several business-related corruption charges, this is the first to address his sexual behavior, which has reportedly involved mansion orgies and \" pay-off \" appointments of models and showgirls to political office. \" every woman that has had the opportunity to know me knows my regard for them.

Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles.

Südhof share this: english swedish press release 2013-10-07 the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet has today decided to award the 2013 nobel prize in physiology or medicine jointly to james e. Rothman, randy w. Schekman and thomas c. Südhof for their discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a major transport system in our cells summary the 2013 nobel prize honours three scientists who have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system. Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three nobel laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place",

        "summary": "It's not quite bush v. Gore, but the supreme court might very well decide the 2016 presidential race this month, writes dahlia lithwick at slate. It's all about how the justices rule on the obamacare challenge and on gay marriage, but perhaps not in the way you might think. For example, lithwick cites a consensus in both parties that a ruling against obamacare would be disastrous for the gop. It would create a mess, forcing millions of people, republicans included, to lose their health care as their state-created exchanges vanish. Gop senators and governors in the 34 potentially affected states would be on shaky ground in particular, but it would also pressure republicans in general into finding a remedy for these people. And that would put them in the position of \" propping up obamacare, \" angering the conservative base. A similar political calculus applies on gay marriage. A ruling against it makes it a key issue in 2016, and republicans would then be staking out a position opposed by the majority of americans. Justices aren't supposed to take these kinds of calculations into consideration, of course, but remember that four of the justices are over the age of 75, writes lithwick. \" even justices who don't think about politics in terms of stark wins and losses might be tempted to do so when it could mean that the president who will someday fill their seats can either dismantle their judicial legacies or bolster them. \" as lithwick puts it, a justice might wonder, \" ' oh my god. Am i helping to seat the next justice goodwin liu? ' \" click for lithwick's full column.",

In whitney, half-brother gary garland says he was abused when he was young by cousin dee dee warwick, sister of dionne warwick, and he believes whitney was as well, reports vanity fair, which describes kevin macdonald's film as \" heart-wrenching. \" mary jones — houston's aunt, and the person who found her body after her death in 2012 — confirmed to macdonald that the singer told her she had been abused by warwick, who died in 2008, the telegraph reports. Jones said she thought whitney never told mother cissy houston because she was \" ashamed \" and afraid of the repercussions. Macdonald tells deadline that after watching footage of houston, he began to suspect she had been abused. \" there was something preventing her, in some way, from expressing her real self. She felt uncomfortable in her own skin in almost every interview there was with her, \" he says. \" and i thought that was a very strange thing, and it kind of reminded me of people i'd seen who had suffered from abuse, just in their body language and their sense of holding something back. \" he says he believes houston's self-destructive behavior, including drug use, was linked to the abuse. The person you see in the film, he says, is somebody \" who doesn't know who they are and who is in pain because they can't talk about the central problem in their life, which i think came from the abuse. \"",

            "Oscar-winning filmmaker kevin macdonald ( one day in september, the last king of scotland ) did not set out to break news with whitney, his heart-wrenching documentary about whitney houston that premiered at the cannes film festival wednesday. He wanted to scrub off the sad, tabloid narrative that debased the singer's reputation in her final, drug-addicted years, to show how one of the greatest vocal talents of the 20th century — a sweet girl from newark, new jersey — self-destructed and died in 2012 at the age of 48 under tragic circumstances. But after watching hundreds of hours of private houston footage — taken at home, on tour, and backstage — macdonald began to be haunted by a sad suspicion. \"there was something very disturbed about her, because she was never comfortable in her own skin, \" macdonald told vanity fair on wednesday. \"she seemed kind of asexual in a strange way.

She was taken to southern regional medical center and then moved to grady memorial hospital in atlanta; it was there that doctors noticed something else: a gunshot wound in her neck, one police believe quayle suffered before the crash occurred. She was removed from life support and died wednesday. Her sister tells nbc news they're stumped as to who could have shot quayle, or why. Kayleigh martin says her sister had just moved to atlanta two months ago to pursue a modeling career, \" didn't know anybody, \" and didn't mention having issues with anyone. Police are hoping other drivers who were near quayle's car as the incident occurred might have some insight. \" we would especially like to speak with the driver of the white suv and the driver of the gray sedan that is seen passing kelsey's vehicle, \" the clayton county police department wrote on facebook friday as they released surveillance video from the scene.

A running total of how well they are doing shows that the re-creation is 99.990 % complete. The first single work to be completed was the poem a lover's complaint. Set up by us programmer jesse anderson the project co-ordinates the virtual monkeys sitting on amazon's ec2 cloud computing system via a home pc. Mr anderson said he started the project as a way to get to know the hadoop programming tool better and to put amazon's web services to the test. It is also a practical test of the thought experiment that wonders whether an infinite number of monkeys pounding on an infinite number of typewriters would be able to produce shakespeare's works by accident. Mr anderson's virtual monkeys are small computer programs uploaded to amazon servers. These coded apes regularly pump out random sequences of text. Each sequence is nine characters long and each is checked to see if that string of characters appears anywhere in the works of shakespeare. If not, it is discarded. If it does match then progress has been made towards re-creating the works of the bard. To get a sense of the scale of the project, there are about"

Lawyers say the company uses technology designed to accurately measure alcohol content to dilute its beers just before bottling, making the beer 3 % to 8 % weaker than what it says on the label, bloomberg reports. Lead lawyer josh boxer says the case is based on information from former employees at the company's 13 us breweries, the ap reports. The watering down is \" a simple cost-saving measure and it's very significant, \" boxer says. The suits — which the company describes as \" groundless \" — allege that the diluting began soon after anheuser-busch merged with belgium firm inbev in 2008 to create the world's biggest brewer. \" i think it's wrong for huge corporations to lie to their loyal customers, \" says one plaintiff who bought a six-pack of bud every week for years. \" i really feel cheated.

The winners are james allison of the university of texas and tasuku honjo of japan's kyoto university, reports the ap. The two researchers did not work together, but both made independent breakthroughs in the same field: figuring out ways to help the body's own immune system fight cancer. Emerging field: both men \" discovered methods of removing the brakes on cells that fight invaders, paving the way for cancer immunotherapy, which has joined surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as a major weapon in the battle against cancer, \" per the washington post. Allison: he talks about his own work here. Honjo: listen to honjo in an interview here. Nobel panel, on allison: he \" studied a protein that functions as a brake on the immune system, \" the organization tweets. He ( realized ) the potential of releasing the brake and unleashing our immune cells to attack ( tumors ). He developed this concept into a new approach for treating patients. \" nobel panel, on honjo: he \" discovered a protein on immune cells and revealed that it also operates as a brake, but with a different mechanism of action, \" the group tweets. \" therapies based on his discovery proved to be strikingly effective in the fight against cancer. \"",

( the ap's death toll is at 27. ) it could have been far worse: officials estimate that 200 of the 250 migrants on board have been rescued by an italian navy vessel and a maltese ship. The tragedy — the second migrant-boat disaster there in 8 days — apparently started when migrants moved around on their boat to signal maltese military aircraft about a problem on board. That caused the boat to capsize. Today's disaster provides \" dramatic confirmation of the emergency situation \" faced in italy with migrants, said premier enrico letta. Last week, up to 363 people died when a migrant boat capsized in the same waters. European commission president jose barroso responded by promising that the eu would help italy handle its migrant crisis. The island of lampedusa is the main entry point for migrants trying to enter europe; thousands make the scary trip across the mediterranean each year, usually in creaky and overcrowded boats.",

A government accountability office decision released last week determined that federal agencies cannot supply \"disposable cups, plates, and cutlery \" for employee use because they are for personal benefit and not a specific government purpose. The issue was brought to light in a dispute between the commerce department and the national weather service employees. In 2009, commerce had allowed the weather offices to supply hand sanitizer, paper goods and plasticware in response to the h1n1 flu outbreak. In 2013, commerce determined that those offices could no longer provide \"disposable plates, cups, and cutlery. \" the nws employees organization objected and the subject went to arbitration. The arbitrator at the time sided with the employees that providing the disposable items could lead to a healthier, and thus more productive, workplace.

            "Federal agencies cannot use department funds to buy disposable flatware for employee use, as those items don't directly support an agency's mission, according to a recent decision from the government accountability office. The department of commerce instituted a policy in 2009 to provide disposable cups, plates and utensils, along with hand sanitizer and disinfectants to employees at the national weather service offices in response to concerns over an outbreak of the h1n1 virus, colloquially called \" swine flu. \" in 2013, commerce announced that it would no longer provide disposable flatware to the regional offices, stating that the \" purchase was for the primary benefit of the employees \" and not the agency's mission. \" because commerce has not demonstrated that the provision of items that would otherwise constitute a personal expense directly advances its statutory mission … commerce may not use appropriated funds to purchase these items, \" gao wrote, concurring with commerce's decision. \" here, the disposable cups, plates and cutlery are primarily for the convenience of agency employees and thus constitute a personal expense. \" federal regulations allow agencies to purchase office supplies and other goods needed for day-to-day operations, however they cannot provide items for the personal use of their employees unless those items can be tied directly to the agency's mission.

A government accountability office decision released last week determined that federal agencies cannot supply \"disposable cups, plates, and cutlery \" for employee use because they are for personal benefit and not a specific government purpose. The issue was brought to light in a dispute between the commerce department and the national weather service employees. In 2009, commerce had allowed the weather offices to supply hand sanitizer, paper goods and plasticware in response to the h1n1 flu outbreak. In 2013, commerce determined that those offices could no longer provide \"disposable plates, cups, and cutlery. \" the nws employees organization objected and the subject went to arbitration. The arbitrator at the time sided with the employees that providing the disposable items could lead to a healthier, and thus more productive, workplace.

If rural iowans ever drive on the highway ( not much reason to do so, really ), they welcome other vehicles accelerating on the entrance ramp, smiling, often motioning with their hand to move on over, as though gently patting the butt of a newborn. The only smog comes from a late-autumn bonfire. Crime isn't way rampant in these rural towns, but it's edging upwards, particularly in towns adjacent to slaughterhouses. On summer nights, you can still keep your keys in the ignition and run into the local casey's for an icey or to get a cherry-dipped cone at the dq one town over. Rural iowa is still the kind of place where parents drop off their kids at the municipal pool to swim all day long.

        "summary": "Colonoscopies are a rite of passage for 50-year-olds — could that one day be true for 30-year-olds? we're not there yet, but we may be on our way. Researchers from the american cancer society have identified a sharp rise in colon and rectal cancer rates among millennials and genxers after reviewing some 500,000 cases dating to 1974. How sharp? their study, published tuesday in the journal of the national cancer institute, finds people born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer as someone born in 1950. And here's the longer view: \" colorectal cancer risk among millennials has escalated back to the level of those born \" circa 1890, says lead study author rebecca siegel in a statement picked up by live science. About 135,000 americans are diagnosed annually with the cancers ( and 50,000 die each year, reports usa today ), but those 55 and younger now make up an appreciable number of diagnoses: 29 % of rectal cancer and 17 % of colon cancer cases. \" colorectal cancer had been thought a success story, \" as increased screening tamped down overall rates, says siegel. But what researchers found is a dichotomy between the younger and older groups. For instance, rectal cancer rates were down over the 1974 to 2013 study period for those 55 and up, but grew 3.2 % annually for those ages 20 to 29. And \" anything more than about 1 % a year is a big change, \" says siegel. The researchers didn't identify a cause, but point out a trio of risk factors: obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and a low-fiber diet.",

        "summary": "Yesterday barack obama officially broke george w. Bush's record for the longest scandal-free streak by a president in the post-watergate era — at least by one political scientist's criteria. Dartmouth professor brendan nyhan ran a study earlier this year on presidential scandals, which he defines as \" widespread elite perception of wrongdoing. \" nyhan figured the washington post is a good indicator of elite opinion, so to qualify as a scandal, the s-word had to be used in the writer's own voice on a front-page post story. Well, elspeth reeve of the atlantic has been keeping track, and despite operation fast and furious and solyndra, obama has dodged the s-word for 34 solid months — though he had a close call yesterday when a post headline referenced the \" solyndra controversy. \" on his blog, nyhan theorizes that obama has come so far because his presidency \" has been consumed by major exogenous news events \" like the arab spring or deepwater horizon disaster. Of course, if jon stewart was a part of nyhan's study, obama's streak would already be over.",

            "Back in may, i wrote an article drawing on my research into presidential scandal ( pdf ) which noted that obama had managed to avoid a major scandal for more than two years: one of the least remarked upon aspects of the obama presidency has been the lack of scandals. Since watergate, presidential and executive branch scandal has been an inescapable feature of the american presidency, but the current administration has not yet suffered a major scandal, which i define as a widespread elite perception of wrongdoing. What happened, and what are the odds that the administration's streak will continue? obama has been extremely fortunate: my research ( pdf ) on presidential scandals shows that few presidents avoid scandal for as long as he has. In the 1977-2008 period, the longest that a president has gone without having a scandal featured in a front-page washington post article is 34 months – the period between when president bush took office in january 2001 and the valerie plame scandal in october 2003. Obama has already made it almost as long despite the lack of a comparable event to the september 11 terrorist attacks.

        "summary": "It looks like the fighting will stop in ukraine today, at least for a while. The government signed a ceasefire deal with pro-russia rebels at talks in minsk, reports the bbc. The deal was struck after vladimir putin, perhaps hoping to avoid new penalties from an ongoing nato summit, floated a peace plan amid skepticism — and without admitting that moscow is providing support to the rebels. The ceasefire was to go into effect at 11am edt today, and fighting seemed on track to continue right up until that hour. Reuters reports that the rebels were trying to capture the key port city of mariupol. If they were able to take the city before the ceasefire went into effect, the ap explains why that would be a huge deal: it \" would give the rebels a strong foothold on the sea of azov and raise the threat that they carve out a land corridor between russia and crimea. If that happens, ukraine would lose another huge chunk of its coast and access to the rich hydrocarbon resources the sea of azov is believed to hold. \"",

He alerted the la paz county sheriff's office, and authorities discovered the skeletons were plastic. \" skeleton tea party, \" sholl says. \" it was funny. The next day when my friend called and told me that the chaos i created was on every morning show in the country, i was shocked.... I found out they didn't mention me at all. \" instead, sholl says the media focused on la paz county deputy curt bagby, who led the recovery of the skeletons and investigated how they ended up in the river. When sholl called a news outlet, he was told that bagby wasn't sure he would want to speak. Since the skeletons were discovered, they have become an attraction to recreational divers. But sholl says he pulled them from the river friday and put them on his balcony in parker. He says he ' ll return the skeletons after halloween. The sheriff's office says it wasn't illegal for sholl to take the skeletons. \" why did i [ take them ]? \" writes sholl in a comment on parkerliveonline. \" basically, just to piss off #### bagby....

Sound familiar? in the wake of recent secret service scandals, vanity fair reports that six agents were out drinking late at a dallas coffee house ( that allowed illegal drinking ) in the wee hours of november 22, 1963, and at least four of them protected kennedy the next day. None took action to save kennedy between the first bullet and second, fatal, one; the only one who acted pushed the first lady back into her seat. \" i told those playboys that someone was going to get the president killed if they kept acting like they did, \" an agent reportedly cried out in chicago after jfk was shot. \" now it's happened. \" but the service has long been an organization for tough, overworked guys who shrug off sleep and prove their mettle with hard drinking. Some say kennedy's risk-taking, womanizing ways made things worse by setting a poor example. Either way, the service admitted to their outing but pretty much denied any negative effect: \" that's a tough one, \" says paul landis, who followed behind jfk's car. \" i don't think that affected me. That's an arguable point. \" but when the dallas cafe manager fessed up 20 years later, he described a night worthy of a hangover, saying the agents downed drinks spiked with 151- or 190-proof booze: \" those guys were bombed, \" he says. One of the agents who was at the cafe, clint hill, says he's disappointed with the latest agency lapses — and tells the ap that agents today should \" change their attitude, be more observant and pay more attention to detail. \"",

            "A superbug that's resistant to the absolutely last-ditch antibiotic colistin has been reported in seagulls on two continents — pinpointing one way, though almost certainly not the only way, that this dangerous drug resistance is moving around the world. Since last november, when researchers in england and china announced the discovery of bacteria able to survive colistin, there has been an explosion of people looking for that resistance, and finding it. Scientists have published almost 100 reports of colistin resistance — known as mcr and conferred by a gene that's been dubbed mcr-1 — in almost two dozen countries. It has been found in human patients, including a woman in the united states in may; in livestock, which get the drug on intensive farms, and are probably the original source of the problem; and even in pets.

Sir richard branson's company launched a spacecraft more than 50 miles into the air thursday, not reaching orbit but successfully meeting the federal aviation administration's definition of space, the washington post reports. It was the first spacecraft with humans aboard to be launched from us soil and reach space since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, and it marked a milestone for the commercial space industry, which also includes companies like elon musk's spacex, jeff bezos ' blue origin, and boeing. The mojave, calif., launch was the fourth test flight of the spaceshiptwo unity, reports space.com, which has photos. Two pilots were in the cockpit as the spaceplane, unveiled in 2016, was ferried to around 43,000 feet by a mothership and then released into a freefall. The pilots then ignited the engine and the spacecraft accelerated to faster than the speed of sound ( hitting a top speed of mach 2.9 ), eventually pointing nearly straight up as it traveled to a height of 51.4 miles before returning to earth to land at virgin galactic's mojave space port. Branson has for years been aiming to create \" the world's first commercial spaceline, \" and founded virgin galactic in 2004. Space.com notes that branson eventually plans to ferry passengers to space on vss unity for $ 250,000 per ticket for a brief period of weightlessness and a view of the earth's curvature.

Kansas city royals pitcher gil meche is walking away from a guaranteed $ 12 million paycheck, opting to retire because he doesn't think he'd earn the money, reports the new york times. Meche's production began tailing off in 2009 and worsened last season. Still, he had another year of big money left on his contract, which he would have collected with, at most, light bullpen duty. \"this isn't about being a hero — that's not even close to what it's about, \" says meche. \"it's just me getting back to a point in my life where i ' m comfortable. Making that amount of money from a team that's already given me over $ 40 million for my life and for my kids, it just wasn't the right thing to do. \" writes phil rogers in the chicago tribune: \" what a refreshingly noble concept. \"",

        "summary": "The closing of a hospital in rural north carolina may not seem like a huge deal — on its own. But the shuttering of pungo hospital in the largely black town of belhaven is just another example of a us rural hospital closing up shop, al jazeera reports. Last year, 14 rural hospitals closed across the country, cutting off emergency services and curbing economic growth to entire communities. In pungo's case, the hospital was belhaven's biggest employer, so local officials are contemplating boosting property taxes by 10 % to compensate for the revenue shortfall. Why the closures? experts are debating whether it's changing demographics, fewer federal reimbursement dollars, fewer insured patients, or health care's shift to a pay-for-performance model. But pungo's closing was caused partly by north carolina's decision not to expand medicaid under obamacare, says the hospital's non-profit owner. Other states that rejected the expansion — like tennessee, georgia, and alabama — have seen at least 11 hospitals close or cut back over the past two years, but republican governors say the expansion would prove too costly over time. Meanwhile, a survey shows that the uninsured rate among poor people has fallen 11 % in states expanding medicaid, but only 2 % in states that aren't, huffington post reports.",

        "summary": "Uk intelligence had previously investigated the men accused of hacking a soldier to death in the streets of london yesterday, and determined that they weren't a threat requiring \" immediate intervention, \" sky news reports. Bbc sources, however, said that while the men were known to security services, reports that they'd been involved in \" several investigations \" were not true. While authorities haven't officially ided either suspect, or detailed their conditions, multiple reports are naming one of them as 28-year-old michael adebolajo. Here's what's being reported: adebolajo was born in britain, and is of nigerian descent, the bbc reports. He was actually raised christian, but converted to islam sometime after leaving college in 2001. \" he was a pleasant, quiet guy, \" says the former leader of the banned islamist group al muhajiroun. \" he was just a completely normal guy. He was interested in islam, in memorizing the koran. He disappeared about two years ago. \" a caller to a bbc radio show said he'd seen adebolajo address a crowd outside a london community center two weeks ago, telling them at first to go fight in syria, but then adding, \" we may not have to go there, because their soldiers are here. \" police are reportedly searching his father's home in lincolnshire. Officers also raided a flat in greenwich that is believed to belong to one of the attackers. An eyewitness tells the bbc more about how the suspects were shot, saying that police \" didn't even get a chance to get out of their car. \" as soon as they pulled up one of the men rushed them. \" and then the other one, with the handgun, lifted it up, and obviously they shot him. \" according to the ap, both were shot in the legs. London seems to be taking all this in stride, the ap adds. \" it doesn't seem to have made much of a difference, \" one resident says. \" londoners are used to living in a city where life is complicated. \"",

But lucas says jerika's sma is progressive, not \" acutely terminal, \" and adds it's a situation that affects the entire disabled community, which wants to make sure kids with disabilities are protected from decisions perhaps not made in their best interests. And when the decision is to die, \" it's never in the child's best interests, \" lucas notes, adding jerika needs mental health services to help her through. Mom jen bolen said previously that detractors just don't get the intricacies of jerika's condition and that she \" never thought i'd be on this side of things. \" but in a july article featuring adults with sma who think jerika should stay alive, a 42-year-old with the condition told new mobility that \" i use a ventilator most of the day, a wheelchair, and a lot of services, and my life [ even with pain ] is pretty fantastic. \" the bolens are asking for privacy.

And while the electric car segment is showing growth, with pure evs up 35 % and plug-in hybrids up 44 %, they still sell in such small numbers that \" it's like a rounding error in the whole electric drive vehicle market, \" an edmunds analyst tells the los angeles times. While nissan reported a monthly record 3,200 leaf evs sold in august, up 34 % from the first eight months of 2013, the gains don't begin to make up for a range of losses elsewhere, including by tesla's luxury model s electric sedan and the plug-in hybrid chevy volt, which are flat or falling. Time reports that flat gas prices, better fuel efficiency in gas vehicles, and the diminishing novelty of hybrid and plug-in vehicles all contribute to the lower-than-expected sales. \" the whole automobile market has grown, \" says the edmunds analyst. \" we're not seeing electric vehicles as part of that growth. \" ( while consumer reports named toyota prius the best green car of 2014, it named the pricey tesla model s the best overall car of the year. )",

The king wrote to the foreign secretary in early 1939 that he was \"glad to think that steps are being taken to prevent these people leaving their country of origin, \" the email charges. A leading historian said george vi was simply backing british government policy at the time, \" however short-sighted it was, \" reports the telegraph. The anonymous email is being circulated to members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences, who vote on the oscars. Jewish ancestors of a number of academy members emigrated to the us from nazi-occupied europe. The email is based on a new york magazine mention last month apparently linked to documents uncovered by the guardian years ago. \"when it came to actively working to stymie jews fleeing hitler's germany, george actually communicated quite eloquently, \" zinged reporter claude brodesser-akner.

The 36-year-old egyptian, who weighed an estimated 1,100 pounds when she arrived at india's saifee hospital a month ago in order to undergo life-saving weight loss surgery, surprised doctors by losing 210 pounds with diet changes — double the amount doctors had hoped she would lose — before undergoing a successful laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on tuesday, per india today. That puts her current weight at about 900 pounds, but doctors expect her to drop another 200 pounds in six to eight months. The gastrectomy reduced abd el aty's stomach to 15 % of its original size, meaning food intake will be severely limited from now on, reports the hindustan times. \" she is now on oral fluids and accepting them well, \" says the hospital, where doctors also removed some of abd el aty's stomach fat. The next goal is \" to correct all her associated medical problems to get her fit enough to fly back to egypt as soon as possible. \" doctors are also hoping to better understand how abd el aty came to be so heavy, reports the bbc. Born weighing 11 pounds, she was as a child diagnosed with elephantiasis, which refers to the swelling of body parts, and has essentially been bedridden since age 11. However, her surgeon suspects abd el aty may actually suffer from lymphoedema, an obesity-related condition that causes fluid retention and tissue swelling, usually in the arms and legs.

Instead of the paved floors and circular column bases that divers initially thought they had discovered, mineral and chemical tests by a joint team of university of athens and university of east anglia scientists show those formations were actually created by mother nature during the pliocene era, some 2.6 million to 5 million years ago. \" the suggestion that they were archaeological remains was brought about by tourists who were swimming around and saw these things and thought they were stonework, \" andrews tells cnn. Oddly, there were no coins, pottery, or \" other flotsam and jetsam of everyday existence, \" as the new york times puts it. After more complete testing was carried out, the researchers theorized that a sub-surface fault allowed gases — chief among them methane — to leak out into the sediment. Microbes in the sediment then fed off the gas and the sediment was chemically altered in a way that created a mineral called dolomite; erosion ultimately exposed the structures. Smithsonian.com explains that a big methane leak typically produces slab-like structures, but when the leak is small and the microbes are forced to concentrate around it, they may \" make column-like and doughnut-shaped formations \" as seen here. Andrews says one of the reasons scientists were duped at first is that this type of natural event doesn't often happen in such shallow waters. \" most similar discoveries tend to be many hundreds and often thousands of meters deep underwater. \" ( this sunken find looks like it's the real deal. )",

She continued to lob objects, including a laptop, at the man, a cambridge university student she met on tinder, reports the bbc.

The 24-year-old student is studying to be a heart surgeon, and christ church will allow her to return in october because she \" is that bright \" and has a record publishing in medical journals. Her defense lawyer played up her intelligence, claiming it would be \" almost impossible \" for her to find work as a surgeon if it's discovered she has a conviction. The judge cited woodward's drug addiction and past abuse from a partner as reasons to give her a second chance. She was given a restraining order, must undergo drug counseling, and cannot reoffend before her new sentencing date on september 25.",

Li, who owns 80 % of the company, lost about half of his $ 30 billion fortune before trading in the solar panel firm was halted. The company's shares had soared 664 % in the year before this week's crash, causing li to briefly overtake property tycoon wang jianlin and alibaba chairman jack ma as china's richest man, reports the south china morning post.

Li was absent from the company's annual shareholder meeting, which began just as shares started to fall, reports cnnmoney, which notes that another mysterious stock crash in hong kong yesterday wiped out 40 % of the share price of two companies controlled by billionaire pan sutong.

Dayna goldfine and dan geller were visiting for a film project when they read about a german philosopher and his mistress leaving their spouses and sailing to the islands in 1929 for a life of idyllic isolation. But when their life was publicized, \" copycat pioneers \" showed up, tempers flared, people clashed, and within two years four of them were dead. So goldfine and geller made a new film, galapagos affair: satan came to eden, and discovered much more than a far-flung murder mystery. \" the film's themes suddenly expanded to include layers of cultural history and humanity's broader search for paradise, \" geller says. \" what is it? does it exist? and can it be a kind of eden when you're a kid and not when you grow up? \" they would chronicle some 20 characters — including a german family living in a cave and a gun-toting baroness trying to build a high-class hotel — but ended up delving into deeper philosophical questions about happiness. \" it is such a profound drive we each have to seek out that which will make us most happy — and maybe that is all paradise is, \" says goldfine.

A solar-powered buoy placed near new zealand's campbell island in the southern ocean on tuesday recorded an eight-story wave that measured 78 feet in height, beating out the 72-foot wave recorded south of tasmania in 2012. Tom durrant, an oceanographer with the meteorological service of new zealand, tells the bbc the southern ocean is \" the engine room for generating swell waves that then propagate throughout the planet. Indeed surfers in california can expect energy from this storm to arrive at their shores in about a week's time. \" and as far as the southern ocean goes, it's \" definitely the most under-observed ocean in the world, \" he tells the sydney morning herald. The buoy has been in place since march in order to observe the extreme conditions that can occur there, and durrant notes that to preserve its battery life it only keeps records for one 20-minute span out of every three hours. That, combined with the fact the buoy wasn't perfectly positioned during the storm, means it's \" probable \" a bigger wave actually occurred, reports the south china morning post.

( she calls out democratic national committee chief tom perez and sen. Kirsten gillibrand on this, and notes rep. Maxine waters'description of cabinet members as a \" bunch of scumbags. \" ) wasn't trump \" supposed to be the loudmouth vulgarian, \" wonders noonan. \" they are aping what they profess to hate. They excoriated him for lowering the bar. Now look at them. \" noonan also takes issue with what's happening on campuses, \" that most entrenched bastion of the progressive left, \" where those with opposing views aren't even allowed to speak. \" it is a hysteria — a screeching, ignorant wave of sometimes violent intolerance for free speech. \" perez displayed a similar lack of tolerance when, speaking about a democratic mayoral candidate who had supported pro-life bills, he declared that such views had no place in the party. It all smacks of desperation, writes noonan. Democrats have no coherent strategy, short of hoping trump \" blows up \" before their own party does. Trump \" may not be lucky in all of his decisions or staffers, or in his own immaturities and dramas, \" writes noonan. \" but hand it to him a hundred days in: he's lucky in his main foes. \" read the full column.",

It certainly wasn't the fastest escape ever. Authorities say 46-year-old stephen houk refused to pull over in los angeles around 3pm tuesday. He then led california highway patrol officers over freeways for hours, heading north with his two young children at speeds of about 55mph, before his motor home got stuck in an almond orchard north of bakersfield, reports the los angeles times. As officers were deciding how to proceed through dust and heavy brush while keeping an eye on a heat signature in the driver's seat, houk is believed to have slid out an rv door hidden from view. Houk's 3-year-old son, who'd been in the driver's seat, then emerged from the rv, telling police his father had left him and his 11-month-old sister behind, police say. \" turns out ( the heat signature ) was actually the little boy, \" says a chp rep. The two children, unharmed, were reunited with their mother, who police say had been on the phone with houk as he drove, trying to convince him to pull over. Nbc los angeles reports there had been an earlier dispute between the couple, with police receiving a call mentioning \" criminal threats. \" houk is now wanted for evading, child abduction, child endangerment, and weapons violations. A registered sex offender in oregon, houk was previously convicted of sex with a child under 14. A sheriff's deputy says the circumstances of that case are \" too egregious to discuss, \" per nbc.",

Meanwhile, to70 estimates that the fatal accident rate for large commercial aircraft stands at just one fatal accident per every 16 million flights ( the bbc notes this figure was arrived at before a new year's eve crash in costa rica that killed 12 ). The last commercial passenger jet crash with fatalities happened in november 2016 in colombia, killing 71, while the last commercial passenger airline to kill more than 100 took place in october 2015 in egypt, with 224 deaths.

        "summary": "Mortality for all cancers combined has gone down for us adults — but between 2000 and 2016, death rates from liver cancer went up 43 %, according to a new cdc report. The cancer itself isn't getting any deadlier — the increase in mortality rates is due to more people developing the disease, cnn reports. Liver cancer is caused by underlying liver disease more than 70 % of the time, and factors including obesity, smoking, and excessive drinking increase one's risk for liver disease. So do hepatitis b and c infections, and one cancer researcher believes the prevalence of hepatitis c in the baby boomer community, as well as a rise in excess body weight, is behind the increase in people dying from liver cancer. As the author of the report explains, blood transfusions and organ transplants were not screened for hepatitis c until 1992, and it often takes years for someone infected with hepatitis c to develop liver cancer. So it makes sense that older people who got blood transfusions or an organ transplant prior to 1992 are now experiencing more cases of liver cancer; mortality was greatest in those 75 or older. But the opioid epidemic could also be contributing, according to one oncologist, since hepatitis c can be spread by sharing needles. Liver cancer is now the sixth-leading cause of cancer death, up from the ninth, livescience reports.",

A 16-year-old participant was killed by a black bear while descending the bird ridge mountain trail. The alaska dispatch news reports the unidentified teen had made it to the turnaround point and was on his way back to the trailhead when a bear apparently began chasing him. He alerted his mother to his situation via text at 12: 37pm local time, reports ktuu; ktva adds that he also called his brother. A \" very shaken \" relative — it's unclear who — told race director brad precosky what was going on. A search started immediately, bolstered by searchers ' ability to track the teen's phone, but was then thwarted. \" the bear was remaining in the area where the young man was laying, \" says a park ranger. The roughly 250-pound bear was then shot in the face but fled; rangers are trying to track it down and kill it. As for the runner, his body was found about a quarter-mile off the trail in a very steep area heavily populated with trees. It's not known if the bear chased him there or if he arrived at the spot in some other way. The ranger says bears aren't often seen on bird ridge, but precosky tells a different story. \" i've been running in the mountains for 30 years \" — this was the 29th year the race was held — and \" people come down off the trail and say they've run into a bear. Sometimes that means nothing; other times, it's really serious. Like this. \" ( this forest cop died after surprising a bear. )",
