As the paper notes, hundreds of uc santa cruz students gather each year for the event, and each year campus police confiscate things like bongs and dime bags. But gennady tsarinsky took things to a whole new level: what police say was a four-foot-long, two-pound joint. The 25-year-old was arrested and charged with possessing more than an ounce of pot — which happens to be california's limit for medical marijuana users. A video of the bust posted by liveleak shows a cop carrying the joint ( which is bigger than a loaf of french bread ) and a seemingly incredulous tsarinsky: \" dude, you're a liar. You're a liar, \" he's recorded as saying. \" i can't wait to see you in court. I can show how you're harassing me. \"",

One was more than enough when it was roughly 4 feet long and weighed more than two pounds. That's what uc santa cruz police officers were confronted with when they descended on a rally last saturday. The young man was not happy when his cartoonishly large joint was hauled away, according to video footage capturing the incident. \"dude, you're a liar. You're a liar, \" the young man complained as he walked beside a police officer carrying the torch-like joint. \"i can't wait to see you in court. I can show how you're harassing me. \" every year, hundreds of students and others gather at the campus on april 20 to smoke pot.

One was more than enough when it was roughly 4 feet long and weighed more than two pounds. That's what uc santa cruz police officers were confronted with when they descended on a rally last saturday. The young man was not happy when his cartoonishly large joint was hauled away, according to video footage capturing the incident. \"dude, you're a liar. You're a liar, \" the young man complained as he walked beside a police officer carrying the torch-like joint. \"i can't wait to see you in court. I can show how you're harassing me. \" every year, hundreds of students and others gather at the campus on april 20 to smoke pot.

The great bull run, a new us-based event, will allow thrillseekers to experience pamplona's favorite pastime stateside, reports the ap. The first run will be held near richmond, virginia, on august 24, with about 5,000 people already signed up to sprint through a fenced-in course set up on a drag-racing strip. A second event is scheduled for october in atlanta, with more planned for texas, florida, california, minnesota, illinois, and pennsylvania sometime in the future. The organizers of the great bull run say their event will be safer than the famous spanish festival that inspired them, where many runners are brutally gored every year, and even sometimes killed. The course will have built-in \" coves \" that allow the participants to quickly get out of a bull's path, while the bulls used will be locally bred and less aggressive than spanish fighting bulls, they say. And unlike pamplona, the organizers say their bulls will not be killed or deliberately mistreated. Still, the humane society is predictably unimpressed. \" these events are a shameful example of cruelty for the sake of nothing more than entertainment and profit, \" says a spokesperson, per usa today. \" we call on the usda to investigate these entities immediately. \"",

About a third were quickly recaptured, and of the rest, just 47 survived the war. Waispapir was both among their ranks and a leader of the rebellion, which the nazis responded to by killing those prisoners who remained and demolishing the camp. The memorial to the murdered jews of europe said monday that waispapir died jan. 11 in kiev, ukraine, the country of his birth. He was captured by german forces while serving in the soviet army and transported to sobibor because he was jewish. The war wiped out his entire family; he ultimately married and had two sons.

The weather channel laid into the conservative site tuesday for using one of its videos in what it says was a misleading article, which claimed the \" last three years may eventually come to be seen as the final death rattle of the global warming scare. \" the channel says the breitbart story is a \" prime example of cherry picking, or pulling a single item out of context to build a misleading case, \" noting that \" thousands of researchers and scientific societies are in agreement that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are warming the planet's climate and will keep doing so \" and rebutting the scientific claims made in the article; the piece was retweeted by the house committee on space, science, and technology. Weather channel scientist kait parker rips the breitbart story apart in a video retort, reports gizmodo, which notes that the site has been publishing \" skewed \" climate change stories for years. Breitbart published a story claiming \" global warming is nothing but a scare, and global temperatures were actually falling, \" parker says. \" the problem is, they used a completely unrelated video about la niña with my face in it to attempt to back their point. \" she goes on to say: \" cherry picking and changing the facts will not change the future, not the fact — note: fact, not opinion — that the earth is warming. \" the weather channel says breitbart should get in touch the next time it needs help fact-checking a climate change article, because \" this topic is too important to get wrong. \"",

But that when they fall even more precipitously it's just a case of \"nothing to see here \". The cause of the fall is a la nina event following in the wake of an unusual strong el nino.

Two of 130 women instructed to wear \" skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels \" while serving 360 powerful male guests, they describe groping, lewd comments, and propositions for sex at the black-tie event at the dorchester hotel. Some hostesses said men repeatedly put hands up their skirts. One hostess said a guest exposed his penis to her, the times reports. A single hostess said she was invited to an upstairs room; fondled on her butt, hips, stomach, and legs; and had to escape an unwanted kiss. Several hostesses — many of whom were students — also described men insisting on holding their hands. During an after-party, which hostesses were required to attend, one guest reportedly told a woman to \" rip off your knickers and dance on that table. \" this came in stark contrast to an event pamphlet carrying \" a full-page warning that no attendees or staff should be sexually harassed, \" per the times. Event organizers now say they're looking into the \" totally unacceptable \" allegations.

        "summary": "A first-of-its-kind study of dogs suggests that their brains are wired to key in on vocal sounds from humans and process our emotional states, reports wired. The mutts then respond accordingly. Hungarian researchers used brain scans to show that a certain area of the dogs ' brains light up when they hear sounds made by humans or other dogs. In fact, their brains show more activity for these types of sounds — especially \" emotionally positive \" ones — than for non-vocal sounds such as breaking glass, reports smithsonian. It sums things up thusly: \" it's unclear what's exactly going on in the dogs ' minds when they hear these noises, but this suggests that dogs can distinguish a happy voice from a sad one. \" it's especially intriguing because the area of the brain that fires up is the same as that in human brains when processing vocal sounds, reports the bbc. This is the first time such a similarity has been found in a non-primate species, raising the possibility that it's common among all mammals. If so, it could partly explain why mammals have been evolutionary rock stars, relatively speaking. At the very least, it sheds light on why people and their pooches bond so well. \" it appears that there is a similar mechanism that processes social information in both dogs and humans, \" says the study's lead author. \" we think this might be able to explain what makes vocal communication between the two species so effortless and successful. \" ( click to read about a separate study that suggests dogs and cats can see things invisible to the human eye. )",

        "summary": "A bbc documentary that aired last weekend about queen elizabeth had all kinds of interesting royal nuggets, but one revelation in particular was news to the queen herself. The makers of the coronation were able to tell elizabeth where her father hid the most precious of the crown jewels during world war ii, reports the bbc. The answer: inside a cookie tin. Specifically, a tin of bath oliver cookies, per the washington post. King george vi then ordered the tin itself buried under what was essentially an escape tunnel within windsor castle, just in case the nazis invaded. The revelation came to light thanks to letters from the royal librarian to queen mary, the mother of george vi. Vanity fair highlights other points from the documentary, including one from elizabeth's childhood. It seems her father instructed her to write a report about his coronation, in order to help prepare her for her own in the future. Here's a snippet: \" at the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers, \" she wrote. \" grannie and i were looking to see how many more pages to the end, and we turned one more and then i pointed to the word at the bottom of the page and it said ' finis.

Authorities have not publicly made any announcement, but cnn and the british news agency the press association ( here via the bbc ) are each reporting the development. Investigators pored over surveillance video from airports and from the town of salisbury around the time that former russian spy sergei skripal and daughter yulia were poisoned there with the nerve agent novichok in march, according to the reports. \" investigators believe they have identified the suspected perpetrators of the novichok attack through cctv and have cross-checked this with records of people who entered the country, \" a source tells the press association. The investigators are sure the suspects are russian, the source adds. The news agency cites \" several \" suspects, while the cnn report mentions just two. Investigators reportedly used facial-recognition technology to identify the suspects, who are believed to have used aliases on their flight. Russia's ambassador to the uk says he has not been notified of any such development. The skripals survived the attack, but a second incident believed to be related turned out to be deadly. Last month, a british couple also were poisoned by novichok, and the woman in that case has died. Investigators don't think the latter couple were deliberately targeted. Instead, they may have picked up a discarded perfume bottle used in the original attack and inadvertently poisoned themselves, reports the guardian. ( investigators found the bottle in the home of one of the latest victims. )",

That list includes the mentally \" defective, \" illegals, drug users, felons, and domestic abusers. For example, the social security administration would tell the fbi when it was sending a check to someone because that person is mentally unwell.

Two of the afghans have died — one from suicide and one from a heart attack — since a task force produced the list in 2010, so there are now 46 indefinite detainees among guantanamo's 166 inmates. The men, many of whom are among the more than 100 guantanamo hunger strikers, are being held under the authorized use of military force signed by george w. Bush in 2001. Officials have given a variety of reasons why they cannot stand trial, including tainted evidence, the ap reports. An amnesty international spokesman says the notion of keeping captives as \" indefinite detainees \" is \" fundamentally flawed. \" under international human rights law, \" all of the detainees should either be charged and fairly tried in federal court, or released, \" he says.",

        "summary": "Social media is going wild for the \" black moon \" coming up on friday, but it turns out it's not much of a big deal. ( despite some \" end of days \" headlines, like so. ) first off, you won't be able to see much of anything in the night sky, explains national geographic. The \" black moon \" is merely a new moon, the distinction being that it's the second new moon in a single calendar month. That is a somewhat rare event that occurs about once every 32 months, reports space.com. The problem is that the side of a new moon facing the earth is in full shadow, meaning it's virtually undetectable at night. The lunar cycle is 29.5 days, so if a new moon falls on one of the first days of a month, a \" black moon \" can occur at the end. In a sense, it's the \" evil twin \" of a blue moon — the phenomenon in which two full moons occur in a single calendar month, notes national geographic. \" black moon \" isn't even a technical term and is unrecognized by nasa, and scientists say hype around the event has been generated mostly by social media. Despite those sensational headlines, the sad truth of a black moon is that it's \" a bit boring, \" astrophysicist ian o ' neill tells the los angeles times.

        "summary": "Within days of joaquin \" el chapo \" guzman's arrival at a maximum security prison in mexico — and perhaps even earlier — work began on the mile-long tunnel he would eventually use to escape, a former drug enforcement official tells the los angeles times. At 5 feet 6 inches high, the tunnel appears to have been made for the 5-foot-5 guzman, who likely spent $ 5 million on mining experts and the best equipment for its construction, the ex-official says. But the tunnel could hardly have gone unnoticed, particularly as work began on the 30-foot shaft beneath guzman's prison shower, from which he would disappear. Officials have the unsurprising suspicion that he had inside help. More: officials have questioned 49 people, including 34 prison workers regarding the escape. Three have been fired, including the prison director, the ap reports. Dea documents show us agents were aware of a possible escape plan back in march 2014, the ap notes. Officials say they informed mexican authorities, who argue they were never told of a possible breakout. Officials say guzman escaped down a 20-by-20-inch hole in his shower, off-limits to prison cameras, then fled down the tunnel, coming out at a nearby home which had been under construction for five to six months, a local says, per abc news. An ap reporter notes dirt in the yard reached 2 to 3 feet higher than in other nearby areas, suggesting dirt from the tunnel was spread around the property. Once out of the prison, guzman's tracking bracelet would have been useless. So where is he now? according to taunting photos posted on el blog del narco, purportedly leaked by guzman's son, the drug lord is enjoying life on the outside. They show guzman drinking a beer and in the cockpit of a plane, reports the new york daily news. At least one official, however, believes they could be part of a hoax. Meanwhile, ozy reports about a cartel boss it describes as \" worse than el chapo. \"",

It can be accessed here ( but expect delays, at least today ). He hopes that the database, which covers cases between 1965 and 1985, will help some victims discover if their abuser was caught. Clark himself sees lessons, and patterns: \" if you see the same thing happening year in, year out, you can't just sit there and make a list. If your program isn't working, you make changes. \" two other lawyers in the state were set to make public their own files as well. Updated files from recent years are still sealed, but courts in other states are fighting to make those public soon. Clark's files illuminate a different era, before strict protocol on the reporting of sexual abuse had been developed within the scouts. \" they held their nose, closed their eyes, and made these guys go away — sometimes reporting to police, sometimes not, sometimes telling the parents, sometimes not, \" said one journalist who has reviewed the files.

On jan. 26, deputy jose marquez was visiting his girlfriend's apartment in aurora when he was approached by two men in the parking lot who tried to rob him. The men started shooting and marquez fired back. One of the bullets marquez fired traveled down the barrel of the suspect's gun, disabling it. So, was the miraculous shot",

It's not my time yet, \" deputy jose ramon marquez told investigators about a jan. 26 shooting in which two masked men attacked him. On wednesday, rich orman, the chief deputy district attorney for the 18th judicial district, cleared marquez in the shooting. Marquez was off duty at the time and visiting his girlfriend. He was cooking dinner for her and her children. In an exchange of gunfire that left him seriously wounded, marquez hit one suspect in the leg, and another of his.45-caliber bullets made a \"one in a billion \" shot, according to a letter orman wrote to jefferson county sheriff jeff shrader and aurora police chief nick metz.

        "summary": "A texas woman identified only as jenny survived a rape, but she says that was only the start of an ordeal she endured at the hands of harris county officials, who jailed the woman for a month. Click 2 houston describes the 25-year-old, who suffers from bipolar disorder, as the \" star witness \" in the trial of serial rapist keith hendricks. The woman began to testify against him on dec. 8, 2015, but suffered a breakdown, with the court transcript showing she became incoherent and vowed not to return as she fled. The chronicle reports she entered the traffic outside the harris county criminal courthouse and was then involuntarily committed to a hospital. From there, a handcuffed jenny was taken to the harris county jail on dec. 18; she was placed with the general population until her release on jan. 14 ( she finished testifying against hendricks on jan. 11 ). Click 2 houston reports that texas judges may issue what are called \" attachment orders, \" which stipulate that a witness be held ( or, in some cases, have to post bail ) in order to secure their testimony. Jenny's attorney, sean buckley, says it was inappropriate in this case, as jenny did originally show up as requested, committed no crime, and jail is \" not an environment for a rape victim. \" on wednesday, he filed a suit against harris county, its sheriff, a jail guard accused of hitting her, and the prosecutor who requested the attachment order. Jenny is seeking unspecified damages; hendricks was handed two life sentences. The da's office called the orders \" a common tool \" and said \" in this case the judge and family agreed with the decision to obtain \" one. Buckley contends jenny's mother thought she was being given mental health treatment in a non-jail facility. ( the victim in the stanford rape case was grilled about her \" partying \" while on the stand. )",

Now they need saving, specifically from a volcano rumbling to life beneath their feet. Enter owen ( chris pratt ) and claire ( bryce dallas howard ) in jurassic world: fallen kingdom, a ja bayona film that has critics split with a 53 % favorable rating at rotten tomatoes. Finding fallen kingdom \" lazier and less inspired than its predecessor, \" adam graham has seen enough dinosaurs for a while. \" a routine sense of tedium \" means it's time to \" close the park for good already, \" he writes at the detroit news, noting \" only a dizzying one-take underwater sequence, with two characters trapped inside a sinking gyrosphere, has any real pizzazz, let alone suspense. \" and \" even pratt's star has cooled. \" matthew rozsa is on the opposite end of the spectrum. \" this is without question the best jurassic park sequel — smart, scary, and even emotionally powerful, \" he writes at salon, describing one scene as \" so heart-wrenchingly beautiful \" it brought him to tears. There's more to love, as the film poses big questions regarding animal rights and, in a \" refreshing twist, \" takes the dinosaurs outside of a jungle setting. \" they've been brought to the screen this time around through elegant puppetry more often than computer-generated imagery, with impressive results, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. He was also impressed with pratt, \" delicate in his approach to physical comedy and touching in his faithful friendship with the raptor blue. \" by the end, though, \" it's as if all concerned on the creative side threw up their hands, then tossed in anything that might lead to a setup for film number six. \" \" if you're thinking, ' i've seen this movie before, ' just wait, it ( gets ) so much more derivative than you would ever imagine possible, \" is lindsey bahr's take at the ap.

Nikolas cruz, who has admitted to gunning down 17 at florida's marjory stoneman douglas high school last month, attended an alternative school before being mainstreamed into stoneman douglas; the washington post notes he had disciplinary issues at middle school and left in eighth grade. Many of the files deal with his weekly meetings with his therapist at cross creek school, whose students have emotional or behavioral problems, from the time he was 15 to 17 years old. In 2014, for example, he told that therapist he'd had a dream about killing people and being covered in blood; administrators, in response, came up with a \" safety plan \" for him over the summer that involved removing \" all sharp objects from the home. \" cruz, formally charged last week with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder, also told his therapist he went on youtube to \" research wars, military material, and terrorist topics, \" and he wrote a paper about his fantasy of a \" perfect summer \" that would involve him buying a gun and target-shooting until he got bored or ran out of ammo. The therapist and school psychiatrist describe troubling behavior from cruz in the files, including aggressive and destructive behavior at home, threatening behavior at school, an obsession with guns and the military, and paranoia. The school therapist advised against cruz being given the pellet gun he desired, and it was recommended he not be allowed to become an rotc cadet. Toward the end of the file, \" tremendous progress \" is noted, and he was allowed to move to stoneman douglas by january 2016. See the herald for more.",

Having had two c-sections — and two healthy baby boys — dray, 35, changed doctors and hired a doula to help her give birth naturally. But she says the doctor at staten island university hospital immediately pressured her to have a c-section, and despite her \" begging \" for more time, said, \" i ' m not bargaining here. \" by her account, she was begging on the operating table when he told her, \" don't speak. \" her third boy came out healthy — and so did she, for the most part — but she filed suit for medical malpractice, violating a new york state law that allows people to refuse treatment, and cutting her bladder during the c-section, the legal examiner reports. Her story highlights the shockingly high rate of us c-sections ( nearly 33 % of all childbirths ) and the possible danger that vaginal births after c-sections cause uterine rupture ( this kevinmd blog rails against vbacs, but the american pregnancy association says the risk-rate is low ).

Authorities recovered four firearms including an m-4 carbine rifle ( akin to what us troops in afghanistan are armed with ), two handguns, and a bb gun; they also determined that the tsarnaev brothers made at least five pipe bombs.

Beach patrol said it's important visitors take steps to prevent their umbrellas from getting swept up in the wind. That means rocking the whole umbrella pole back and forth until 18 to 24 inches of the pole are beneath the sand, as well as making sure the umbrella is tilted into the wind.",
            "Ocean city, md. - a 46-year-old pennsylvania woman was flown out after officials say she was pierced in the chest by a beach umbrella on 54th street in ocean city sunday afternoon. The incident happened at approximately 3: 11 pm. Ocean city beach patrol captain butch arbin said the victim was pierced by an unattended rental umbrella that had not been returned to the stand. Captain arbin said first responders secured the umbrella so it wouldn't blow around with the help of beach goers. Once the fire department arrived on scene, they were able to cut the wooden pole, but a small piece remained under the victim's skin. We're told first responders didn't want to remove the pole completely in fear of causing more damage. Oc paramedics responded to the scene and took the woman to a maryland state police aviation helicopter. She was then transported to peninsula regional medical center. According to captain arbin, at prmc, doctors will perform x-rays and decide the best way to remove the remaining pole. Her condition is currently unknown at this time, but officials say her injuries are not life threatening. This article will be updated as more information becomes available."

The study by the us geological survey of a section of the fault in the grapevine area found that major quakes strike there on average once every 100 years — and the last one hit 160 years ago, per a usgs release. Only two people were killed in the old quake, but a similar one today would surely have a much higher toll, while also damaging aqueducts, the electric grid, and highways. In fact, \" it would impact our ability to be a world-class city, \" a usgs geologist tells the los angeles times. Geologists examined a previously unstudied area of the fault, close to the juncture of los angeles, ventura, and kern counties. They dug down deep to get 1,200 years of data, finding evidence of 10 major earthquakes that happened at irregular intervals, making the timing of the next one difficult to predict. Some intervals were as short as 20 years, some as long as 200 years. The quakes were generally in the 7 to 7.5 range in magnitude, though the 1857 quake was 7.9, significantly larger. A caltech seismologist says that's actually good news because the quake released a lot of energy, which could explain why there's been such a relatively long lull. Still, \" the stress is building up along the san andreas and a large earthquake is inevitable, \" another geologist tells kabc-tv.",

        "summary": "Feeding infants rice cereals as first foods is taking a new hit from researchers and organizations alike, and now a new study published in jama pediatrics adds to the growing chorus that rice be scaled back or put off altogether. This is because, as researchers report, infants who are fed rice cereal have much higher arsenic levels, and the long-term effects of exposure to arsenic in food are yet to be determined. Just this month, the fda proposed a limit of 100 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal. Rice is especially popular as a first food because it is so rarely an allergen, but rice grains are also especially good at absorbing arsenic, which naturally occurs in soil and water, reports abc news. Meanwhile, the fda reports that as a percentage of body weight, infants get three times as much rice as adults, primarily in the form of cereal. The researchers examined the diets of 759 infants and found that 80 % were introduced to rice in their first year. Compared to babies with no rice in their diets, those who were fed rice cereal had more than three times the level of arsenic in their urine. \" we were surprised by the number of infants consuming rice products, \" one of the researchers tells npr, which notes that the fda suggests trying oats, wheat, or barley as a first food, while the american academy of pediatricians says that a wide variety of foods will decrease a baby's exposure to arsenic from rice, including finely chopped meats and vegetable purees. Gerber, for its part, reports that in early 2016 it began to source its rice exclusively from california, which has been shown to grow the rice with the lowest arsenic levels in the country. But it reminds consumers that some arsenic is simply unavoidable in a wide range of healthy foods. ( scientists say one cooking method removes half the arsenic in rice. )",

            "After six months of advertising, mr. Mircov said, his days are punctuated by hope and disappointment. He said a man from mannheim, germany, had offered to fly him to germany and cover the transplant costs. But when mr. Mircov tried to follow up, he said, the man disappeared. A woman from macedonia offered $ 24,000 for a kidney from his partner, daniella, but that was $ 12,000 below her asking price. She noted that she has blood type o, which can bring a $ 12,000 premium on the organ market because the blood is safe for most recipients. Mr. Mircov said he had no fear about an eventual operation or legal strictures forbidding organ sales. \"it's my body, and i should be able to do what i want with it, \" he said. Government officials insisted that serbia was not so poor as to reduce people to selling their body parts, while police officials said not a single case of organ trafficking in serbia had been prosecuted in the past 10 years. Experts who study illegal organ sales said prosecutions were rare because transplants usually took place in third countries, making them difficult to track. Dr. Djoko maksic, a leading nephrologist who runs the transplant program at the military medical academy in belgrade, expressed disbelief that illegal organ selling was taking place in serbia"

A set of studies suggests that students learn better when they take notes by hand, vox reports. Researchers reached their conclusions after studying test results by a total of 327 students at princeton and ucla. In the first study, students watched a ted talk; some took notes by hand, others by computer. Then they took a test on the talk, and while both groups were comparable in their ability to answer factual questions, those who hand-wrote their notes beat those who typed on conceptual questions, vox notes. Two other studies in the same series showed similar results. In the journal psychological science, researchers offer a possible reason for the difference: \" laptop note takers'tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning. \" indeed, as an expert told the new york times last year: \" when we write, a unique neural circuit is automatically activated, \" said psychologist stanislas dehaene. \" there is a core recognition of the gesture in the written word, a sort of recognition by mental simulation in your brain. \" so next time you're looking to learn, maybe leave the laptop at home.

Now it turns out that the women of nearby dorset have the highest birthrates in the nation with an average of three kids each, twice the rate of the rest of the country. Experts don't know when the huge figure was carved. Some link the giant to a saxon deity, a celtic british figure or the roman heracles. The earliest known written reference to the nude man was in 1684. The giant shared space in 2007 with a contemporary pal, semi-nude homer simpson, painted on the hill to advertise a simpson movie.

This album is \" much sharper and more focused \" than king of limbs, writes alexis petridis at the guardian. The \" abundance of sonic intrigue is matched by the quantity of beautiful tunes, \" writes petridis, who notes that most of the \" really important \" music of our era is happening in hip-hop and r&b, with radiohead the only big rock band expected \" to not just release albums but make grand artistic statements worth dissecting and poring over in the same way as the output of kendrick lamar or beyonce. \" jon pareles at the new york times praises the \" patient perfectionism \" on display.

        "summary": "Two coaches who served as unarmed security monitors at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland, fla., have been reassigned after controversial reports of their behavior on the day of the shooting, reports usa today. Baseball coach andrew medina told investigators that before the feb. 14 shooting that took 17 lives, he noticed the shooter, nikolas cruz, wearing a backpack and carrying a duffel bag while looking like he was \" on a mission, \" and recognized him as someone staffers had discussed: \" if there's gonna be anybody who's gonna come to this school and shoot this school up, it's gonna be that kid, \" they had said during a meeting about him, medina recalled, though he later disputed telling investigators that. When medina approached him, cruz ran away; soon after, medina heard gunshots, but didn't immediately send out an emergency warning of an active shooter. Medina had radioed ahead to fellow coach and monitor david taylor and warned him that a \"suspicious kid \" was coming, the sun sentinel reports. When taylor heard shots, he took cover in a janitor's closet. At least two parents have talked to school officials about how the crisis was handled. \" all [ medina ] had to do was say ' code red, ' \" says andrew pollack, whose daughter meadow was killed in the shooting. \"he was trained to say those words and he didn't do it. \" fred guttenberg, the father of another shooting victim, tweeted that he went with pollack to the school \" to lay out our concerns and to ask for [ medina's ] removal. Glad that we got this done, \" per fox. Medina said later that he was reluctant to call for a code red because he didn't see the gun. Both he and taylor have been barred from the grounds of the school. ( former school resource officer scot peterson has also been harshly criticized for his handling of the shooting. )",

Amid reports of ballot box-stuffing and other chicanery, moscow released official results showing that vladimir putin had been re-elected with 76.7 % of the vote, his highest score ever, up from 63 % in 2012. His newest six-year term will run until 2024, when current russian law will ban him from a third consecutive term, cnn reports. \" we are a single team, i am a member of this team, and all those who cast their ballots today are members of our large national team, \" putin told supporters in moscow. He later said he was planning changes to the government, but wouldn't change the constitution to stay in power. More: the rest of the field. Authorities say communist candidate pavel grudinin came in second with 11.6 % of the vote, with ultra-nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky third with 5.6 %. The guardian reports that tv star ksenia sobchak, the only candidate who actually criticized putin, took 1.6 % of the vote. Opposition leader alexei navalny was banned from running. Official figures put sunday's turnout at around 67 %, below the 70 % the kremlin had hoped for.",

With 99.8 % of the votes counted, putin won with 76.7 %, according to central election commission data. It means putin will rule until 2024, when he will be 71 and obliged by law to step down. Putin sailed to victory against the backdrop of wall-to-wall support from state media and with no serious challenger. His nearest rival, communist party candidate pavel grudinin, won 11.79 %, while ultra-nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky took 5.7 %. Former reality tv presenter ksenia sobchak was on 1.7 %, while veteran liberal politician grigory yavlinsky received just over 1 % of the vote.

We will do all we can to solve all disputes with our partners using political and diplomatic means. \" putin's victory, with a 76.7 % share of the vote, comes amid high tensions between london and moscow over the nerve agent attack in salisbury.

The 1955 painting — described by the bbc as a \" vibrant, cubist depiction of nude courtesans \" — was part of a christie's sale called \" looking forward to the past \" that also saw alberto giacometti's life-size pointing man set the record for most expensive sculpture at $ 141.3 million, the ap reports. Both record-breaking prices include the auction house's commission of around 12 %. The previous record for a painting sold at auction was set in 2013 when francis bacon's three studies of lucian freud sold for $ 142.5 million. Experts believe that the strong interest in 20th-century artworks will see prices continue to reach dizzying levels for years to come. \" i think we will continue to see the financiers seeking these works out as they would a blue chip company that pays reliable dividends, \" a professor of design history and curatorial studies at the new school tells the ap.

His assessment came as a spokesman for the plant operator offered a glimmer of hope, saying that an emergency power line — one that could theoretically revive the electric cooling pumps — is nearly operational.

        "summary": "The death toll has risen to at least 17 in a week of clashes tied to a miners'strike in south africa, the ap reports. At least seven people were killed after police fired at striking miners today. Officers, accompanied by armored vehicles, were setting up barbed wire near a platinum mine today as 3,000 workers protested. Details of what followed are murky: reuters suggests that officers fired after several men appeared from behind a vehicle; the bbc cites reports that the machete-wielding protesters had ignored orders to drop their weapons. Some type of projectiles — possibly grenades — were reportedly hurled at the police before the shooting. While the bbc reports seven dead, south african news says 18 bodies were found on the ground. Talks between police and the leaders of the association of mineworkers and construction union, which backed most the strikers, yielded no progress, police say, forcing them to resort to force. \" today was, unfortunately, d-day, \" said one. The violence comes amid a conflict between the more radical amcu and the longstanding national union of mineworkers.",

        "summary": "Anyone who's crammed for a test may have suspected as much, but a new study finds that reading something aloud is the best way to remember it. Researchers at the university of waterloo tested 95 students over two semesters using four different methods: reading silently, reading aloud, hearing someone else read aloud, and hearing a recording of themselves read aloud, reports quartz. Reading the information aloud to themselves emerged as the most effective method in the test, which involved trying to remember a list of words. As mental floss notes, hearing a recording of themselves also seemed to help, at least more so than hearing another's voice, perhaps because it's so odd to hear ourselves that it becomes what's known as a \" salient memory. \" the study in the journal memory builds off what's known as the \" production \" effect, referring to the repetition of words aloud instead of in silence. \" this study confirms that learning and memory benefit from active involvement, \" says study co-author and waterloo psychology professor colin m. Macleod in a news release. \" when we add an active measure or a production element to a word, that word becomes more distinct in long-term memory, and hence more memorable. \" the researchers say that the findings could help seniors looking to boost their memory. In addition to, say, doing puzzles or crosswords, they might want to mix in some out-loud reading.

Secretary of state hillary rodham clinton. Burma has lurched unexpectedly toward reform in the past three months. Its move has coincided with a broader attempt by obama to pivot his administration's foreign policy focus away from the middle east, to counter-balance of china's rise in asia. The result was the first u.s. Secretary of state ever to set foot in the gaudy presidential palace in this constructed-from-scratch capital. And clinton carried to her meeting with burmese president thein sein a letter from obama that conveyed praise, but also a warning that significantly more progress is needed for change to take root. \"for decades, the choices of this country's leaders kept it apart from the global economy and the community of nations, \" clinton said after the meeting. \"while the measures already taken may be unprecedented and welcomed, they are just a beginning. \" the burmese overture — and the u.s.

        "summary": "Scientists already knew tyrannosaurus rex had a ferocious bite, but a new study in scientific reports spells out in detail just how fearsome it was. In terms of raw numbers, they measured the bite force at nearly 8,000 pounds, with the tip of the teeth exerting pressure of around 431,000 pounds per square inch. That's more than double the bite force of the living champ, crocodiles. The feat allowed t. Rex to \" pulverize \" bones, the better to get at the marrow inside, say researchers in a release. Here's how stories covering the study tried to put the astonishing bite force into relatable terms: \" that's like setting three small cars on top of the jaws of a t. Rex — that's basically what was pushing down, \" npr quotes researcher gregory erickson of florida state university as saying. \" the maximum pressure at the tip of a t. Rex tooth was 28 times what is felt at the bottom of the deep-sea mariana trench in the western pacific, \" writes ben guarino in the washington post. \" it was enough to cause the toughest dinosaur bones to fracture. \" a t. Rex bite could shatter bones like a \".45-caliber bullet with a mushroom head, \" erickson tells the post. Remember that scene in jurassic park when a t. Rex chomps on a ford explorer as if it were a snack? this study shows it \" might not have been that hyperbolic, \" writes maddie stone at gizmodo. Popular science explains the two numbers: bite force ( the 8,000-pound figure ) refers to the force exerted by the jaw, but that's only half the story. \" the other really big factor is how that force was applied. And in the case of t. Rex, that force was concentrated at the tips of giant, sharp, serrated teeth that enhanced the power of the jaws up to a whopping 431,342 pounds per square inch ( psi ). That's comparable to 1/128 the estimated pressure at the center of the earth. \" all of which leads to one final quote from erickson, this time in newsweek. Asked to describe what it would be like to be bitten, he said: \" to quote clubber lang from rocky iii: ' pain ' — albeit brief. \" ( check out where t. Rex lies on the dino family tree. )",

        "summary": "In 2008, a researcher in the netherlands used an advanced x-ray technique to show that vincent van gogh's 1887 work \" patch of grass \" was actually done over an earlier painting of a woman's face. The practice is thought to have been common for van gogh, with an estimated one in three of his earlier paintings overlaying older works. Now, using a similar scanning technique, researchers in australia are reporting in the journal scientific reports that they have uncovered the striking face of a woman that lay hidden beneath edgar degas ' \" portrait of a woman \" for 140 years, reports the new york times. The painting had actually been criticized as long ago as 1922 for its discoloration, reports the guardian. Researchers think the face belongs to one of degas ' favorite models, emma dobigny, and that it's only possible to see because the paints degas used over it were so thin. The scanner employs a narrow, brilliant x-ray beam a million times brighter than the sun that's generated by a machine called a synchrotron, which is a type of particle accelerator. The technique forced atoms in the paint to fluoresce and reveal their elemental makeup. Mercury sulphide, for instance, provides the vermillion that colors the model's cheeks and lips, while iron and manganese hint at degas ' use of umber for brown hair. The image is so high-res that it even shows the imprints of the paintbrush bristles within each stroke. One researcher says when he first saw the scan it was \" one of the most exciting times in my scientific career. \" ( a computer is helping rembrandt paint again. )",

The agency, along with its british cousin gchq, did some of its spying in the virtual world, through games like world of warcraft and second life, the guardian reports, based on the latest edward snowden documents. A 2008 nsa document labeled the virtual worlds a \" target-rich communications network \" that could allow targets to \" hide in plain sight. \" the document argued that the games offered terrorists a place to communicate and even shift funds in secret, the new york times notes. Second life, for instance, had anonymous texting, in-game calls, and noticeboards in the works that could facilitate covert communications. Amongst the agencies ' collection was reams of data from the xbox live network. There were enough nsa agents working in the games that officials had to develop a \" deconfliction \" group, the guardian notes, in order to prevent accidental snooping on each other. Yet there's no evidence that the agencies ' in-game activities stopped any terror — or even that the virtual worlds were being used for such purposes.

If he's proven to be a liar, it's more than just a matter of handing in old trophies, notes the new york times. Under a case now being investigated by a federal grand jury, he could face charges of fraud, money laundering, corruption, and drug trafficking.",

Kenneth mendez, president of the asthma and allergy foundation of america, penned an open letter to the filmmakers and sony, noting that \" we strongly urge you to refrain from the type of programming that mocks food allergies in the future. \" mendez also points out that sony has portrayed food allergies as a \" punchline \" before in children's films, citing one of the smurfs movies and cloudy with a chance of meatballs as two examples. Per the ap, sony has issued a joint statement with the filmmakers apologizing for the scene, admitting the flick shouldn't have \" made light \" of the character's allergy, \" even in a cartoonish, slapstick way. \" ( new guidelines are out on giving babies peanuts. )",

As he's worked on \" the office \" over the past six seasons, the actor has also found time to star in half a dozen live-action features and voice two animated films, including his newest hit \" despicable me \" and his upcoming comedy \" dinner for schmucks, \" slipping in movie shoots during his short television hiatuses. In reporting on a story about his new film \" dinner for schmucks, \" we asked carell about the upcoming shift in his career that will take him off the \" office \" to an even more fertile big-screen life. Although he's starred in a reasonably wide range of films -- \" get smart, \" \" dan in real life \" and \" evan almighty \" among them -- carell has worked a similar tactic in many of them: the gap between what his character believes and what the audience knows, milking that alternately for comedy and drama. But carell, who next stars in a marital-crisis comedy opposite julianne moore called \" crazy, stupid, love, \" says that when he makes his big-screen decisions post- \" office, \" he won't be looking to branch out for its own sake. \" i just never want to be precious or pretentious about choosing something in order to switch it up, or do a 180 just to show people what i ' m capable of, \" he told 24 frames.

        "summary": "About half of us adults — more than 117 million people — are part of a \" virtual, perpetual lineup \" thanks to the increasing and unregulated use of facial recognition technology by the country's law enforcement agencies, according to a report released tuesday by georgetown law's center on privacy and technology. The center's executive director tells the guardian the use of this surveillance technology \" can change the basic freedom we have to go about our lives. \" the big difference between this new virtual lineup and traditional databases of fingerprints and dna is that it is \" overwhelmingly made up of \" innocent people. Sixteen states let police use driver's license photos of residents for facial recognition purposes without a warrant, the new york times reports. Others use passports, visa applications, and more. And while the report calls the current use of facial recognition technology \" highly problematic, \" it recognizes it as a useful tool — provided there's more oversight. According to the intercept, 52 law enforcement agencies admitted using facial recognition technology in the report; 51 of them say they are doing so without legislative approval. The report worries the technology will be used to crackdown on freedom of speech — police have used it to scan faces at anti-police protests, and only one agency in the country says it can't be used to track people exercising their right to political or religious speech. Facial recognition technology also disproportionately affects people of color for multiple reasons, including that its algorithms are 10 % less accurate for black faces than white ones.

According to the ap, jurors deliberated for 25 hours but couldn't come to a decision on the charges faced by 26-year-old former university of cincinnati police officer ray tensing. Tensing pulled 43-year-old samuel dubose over in july 2015 because dubose was missing a front license plate. During the traffic stop, dubose — who police say had marijuana in the car and had previously been convicted of dealing — began to drive away, the new york times reports. Tensing claims he was being dragged by the car and shot dubose in the head out of fear for his life. But footage from tensing's body camera doesn't show tensing being dragged, and prosecutors say none of the evidence backs up tensing's story. Prosecutor joseph deters calls it a \" senseless, asinine shooting. \" tensing was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter. Jurors were leaning toward convicting him on the lesser charge but couldn't agree if tensing had \" acted in a fit of rage or sudden passion. \" deters says prosecutors will decide in the next two weeks whether to retry the case or dismiss the charges.

Instead, it looks like he ' ll end monday still in his job, with nbc news reporting a decision on his job status has been \" postponed. \" though rosenstein visited the white house monday, president trump is in new york for a un general assembly meeting. Sarah sanders says the two will now meet thursday, which nbc news points out will likely be a very newsy day. The ap reports that sanders said the men did speak monday, however, in an \" extended conversation \" that occurred at rosenstein's request. The developments come in the wake of reports that rosenstein had floated the idea of clandestinely recording president trump. A sampling of the jumping-the-gun that occurred in the am ( now being roundly mocked by the onion ): axios reported by way of one source that rosenstein verbally resigned to chief of staff john kelly. Bloomberg's sources also said he resigned and the white house had accepted that resignation. The washington post's sources said he told the white house he would be willing to resign. The new york times reported it was unclear whether he'd resign or be fired. Cnbc reported that nbc news justice correspondent pete williams said rosenstein would actually refuse to resign.

Regulator, the office of the comptroller of the currency, for failing to take more aggressive enforcement measures against the bank after the occ became aware of illicit activities. \"banks that ignore anti-money-laundering rules are a big problem for our country, \" said sen.

On the campaign trail in florida yesterday, the candidate — a prominent opponent of the so-called ground zero mosque — portrayed himself as the candidate of religious freedom, the wall street journal reports. He accused obama of declaring \" war on christianity \" with a regulation requiring employers to cover birth control in their health policies. The catholic church, which gingrich joined in 2009, denounced the policy in a letter read to parishioners across the country sunday, abc notes. Gingrich also slammed romney for a similar policy introduced while he was governor of massachusetts — and accused him of cutting off funds for kosher meals for elderly jews on medicare. Romney \" has no understanding of the importance of conscience or the importance of religious liberty in this country, \" gingrich said. \"i will make religious liberty your right, to go with god with no government interference. \"",

            "( image credit: charles dharapak/ap photo ) the most recent showdown between roman catholic church leaders and the obama administration over contraceptive services threatens to alienate the president's liberal religious supporters at a time when discontent with washington is surging. In letters read to parishioners sunday, catholic church leaders across the country openly denounced the administration's recent decision mandating faith-based hospitals, charities and schools to provide birth control and reproductive services in health insurance plans. The catholic church had lobbied against the new requirement, which will go into effect january 2013. The wording in the letters, penned by individual clergy, varied widely but the theme was distinctly anti-washington. Bishop alexander k. Sample of marquette, mich., for example, accused the administration of casting aside the first amendment, \" denying to catholics our nation's first and most fundamental freedom, that of religious liberty \" and treating people of faith as second-class citizens. Others threatened to not comply with the new rule, which provides exemption to churches and \" religious employers. \" the mandate is particularly worrisome to supporters of president obama, who had coalesced behind him despite his liberal views on abortion and reproductive rights. \" this has hurt the case that some catholics have made that voting for obama in some ways is a vote for catholic social teaching, \" said mathew n.
