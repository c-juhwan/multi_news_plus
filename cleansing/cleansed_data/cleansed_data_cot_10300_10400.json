The former general, whose controversial leadership was ended by a series of strokes in early 2006, was taken from his hospital in tel aviv to his family ranch in southern israel, ap reports. Sharon has been in what medical staff describe as a \" limbo \" state — uncommunicative, but responsive to basic stimuli and tv. Doctors downplayed any suggestion that the 82-year-old former leader could make a significant recovery or even — as some of his more fervent supporters hope for — return to public life, reports reuters. \" clearly what's behind this is the hope that his situation will get better. But the improvements that we talk about in such situations are not great improvements, not dramatic improvements, \" said a hospital chief.",

The court — which stressed that it was not easing the country's rape laws, but merely clarifying a murky clause in an existing law — decided that in the future, rape victims seeking abortions should not have to receive a judge's permission first.

The supreme court confirmed a lower court's decision to allow a 15-year-old rape victim to terminate her pregnancy. An estimated 500,000 illegal abortions are carried out in argentina each year. The supreme court unanimously backed the decision by the superior court in the southern province of chubut to allow the 15-year-old girl, who had become pregnant after years of sexual abuse by her stepfather, to terminate her pregnancy. The case caused outrage in argentina, partly because of the length of time it took the lower court to reach its decision. By the time the ruling in favour of an abortion was made, the girl was 20 weeks into her pregnancy. Controversial law at the centre of the controversy was section 2, article 86 of the argentine penal code, which says that abortion is not a punishable act \" if the pregnancy stems from a rape or an attack on the modesty of a woman of feeble mind \". Some judges interpreted the sentence to mean abortions were only allowed in cases in which a woman \" of feeble mind \" was raped. Others argued it meant no woman should be punished for having an abortion after she was raped. The supreme court also ruled that in future, women would not have to seek judicial permission to get an abortion if they had been raped. The judges said a sworn statement given to the doctor would suffice. The supreme court is argentina's highest judicial instance and its decision can not be appealed against. Dangerous practice however, the judges said that their decision was not part of a discussion about the legalisation of abortion in argentina, but just a clarification of existing laws. They said that debate would have to be carried out in congress. Activists have long called for a legalisation of abortion, citing the country's high maternal mortality rate as a sign that the current policies of criminalising abortion do not work.

Sound familiar? a man who has built a business around telling people to relax makes his case in the new york times: \" paradoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less, \" writes tony schwartz, founder of the energy project. While americans are working overtime, skipping vacations, and eating at their desks, schwartz rolls out studies showing that more sleep and time off dramatically improve productivity. One study found that lack of sleep costs us companies $ 63.2 billion annually; others that short naps sharpen the mind and long naps improve memory as well as eight hours'sleep. More fascinating is the notion that people shift from alertness to fatigue about every 90 minutes, so you can relax or exercise during \" down \" periods. In fact, the most productive workers toil for a maximum of 4.5 hours per day. \" like time, energy is finite; but unlike time, it is renewable, \" writes schwartz. The only problem: \" taking more time off is counterintuitive for most of us. \" click for his full article.",

Physicists understand energy as the capacity to do work. Like time, energy is finite; but unlike time, it is renewable. Taking more time off is counterintuitive for most of us. The idea is also at odds with the prevailing work ethic in most companies, where downtime is typically viewed as time wasted. More than one-third of employees, for example, eat lunch at their desks on a regular basis. More than 50 percent assume they ' ll work during their vacations. In most workplaces, rewards still accrue to those who push the hardest and most continuously over time. But that doesn't mean they're the most productive.

In a study of nearly 400 employees, published last year, researchers found that sleeping too little — defined as less than six hours each night — was one of the best predictors of on-the-job burn-out. A recent harvard study estimated that sleep deprivation costs american companies $ 63.2 billion a year in lost productivity. The stanford researcher cheri d. Mah found that when she got male basketball players to sleep 10 hours a night, their performances in practice dramatically improved: free-throw and three-point shooting each increased by an average of 9 percent. Daytime naps have a similar effect on performance. When night shift air traffic controllers were given 40 minutes to nap — and slept an average of 19 minutes — they performed much better on tests that measured vigilance and reaction time. Longer naps have an even more profound impact than shorter ones. Sara c. Mednick, a sleep researcher at the university of california, riverside, found that a 60- to 90-minute nap improved memory test results as fully as did eight hours of sleep. More vacations are similarly beneficial. In 2006, the accounting firm ernst &amp; young did an internal study of its employees and found that for each additional 10 hours of vacation employees took, their year-end performance ratings from supervisors ( on a scale of one to five ) improved by 8 percent.

Anyone found violating the ban faced jail time and a fine. But in 2016, most people didn't know about the ban and officials couldn't find any records of people being cited for breaking it. \"i've been serving beer and wine legally out of my record store, and having illegal pinball games, \" says mike wilson, owner of american dream hi-fi. \"it's funny. \" on tuesday, mayor greg goodnight signed the new pinball-legalizing bill into law on top of one of american dream's pinball machines, the kokomo tribune reports. \" i was reflecting that ever since i was a young boy, i played the silver ball, \" goodnight paraphrased. \" from southway up to morgan street, i think i played them all. \" police chief rob baker, the only person in city hall who hadn't violated the ban, then got the first game.

Researchers showed 126 undergraduates a bunch of texts featuring an invitation and a reply. Participants rated replies that were properly punctuated with a period as less sincere, the washington post reports. That perception did not apply to handwritten notes, which were also part of the study. \" texting is lacking many of the social cues used in actual face-to-face conversations. When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information, \" lead researcher celia klin explains in a press release. \" thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them — emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds, and, according to our data, punctuation. \" in following up on the study, the results of which were published last month in the journal computers in human behavior, the researchers found that adding an exclamation point to a text reply bestows a higher degree of perceived sincerity on the message. \" given that people are wonderfully adept at communicating complex and nuanced information in conversations, \" klin says, \" it's not surprising that as texting evolves, people are finding ways to convey the same types of information in their texts. \" ( this company will send a breakup text to your significant other for $ 10. )",

But new research suggests that undershoots the mark six-fold, reports cnn. The study in neurology estimates that alzheimer's kills 503,000 people a year, a number that would make it the no. 3 cause of death behind heart disease ( 600,000 ) and cancer ( 575,000 ). Researchers led by an epidemiologist at the rush alzheimer's disease center in chicago say that death certificates under-report alzheimer's by attributing the death to a more immediate problem such as pneumonia. \"death certificates may not be the best way to measure how many people die from something that takes up to 10 years \" to reach its full effects, lead author bryan james tells the washington post. \" we're not saying they didn't die of those things; we're just saying, 'well, what put them in the hospital with that condition?

Max-gesner beauvoir, 79, was a biochemical engineer educated in the us and france who became a vodou priest upon returning to his native country in the 1970s. Vodou expert elizabeth mcalister explained to npr in 2010 that the vodou religion \" operates through revelation \" — and without any scripture, central doctrine, or pope-like figure. As the new york times reported in a 2008 look at beauvoir, his position as supreme leader was one newly created at the time by houngans ( vodou priests ). They had joined forces and made beauvoir their \" public face, \" as the times put it, one who could represent the often misunderstood and sensationalized religion. Nbc news reports vodou is thought to be practiced by all but 25 % of haiti's population. It evolved in that country when colonists brought slaves from west africa there in the 1600s; forced to practice catholicism, they \" adopted saints to coincide with african spirits, \" reports the ap. Beauvoir's death was announced yesterday by haitian president michel martelly as \" a great loss for the country. \" it may only be the beginning for beauvoir, however. \" the haitian people do not get afraid of death, \" he told npr in 2010. \" we believe that everyone lives 16 times — eight times we live as men, and eight times as women, \" with that new life beginning after a year and a day spent underwater.

If the work does proceed, the sculptures should be \" dedicated to the dog he murdered, \" and all money should be used caring for homeless animals, the petition states. Otterness apologized three years ago for his dog snuff film. \" when i was 25 years old, i made a film in which i shot a dog.

He bought a shelter dog, chained it to a fence, shot it to death and filmed the murder in a movie he called'shot dog film.'this crime has tainted any work he shows, publicly, and it would be a disgrace for the ny public library to let this project proceed. Petition: we, the undersigned, are outraged that tom otterness has been commissioned to create a sculpture for the new york public library. In 1977, otterness adopted a dog from a shelter,",
            "\" patience \" and \" fortitude \" are the nicknames of the two lions that hold court in front of the new york public library's main branch, and brooklyn-based sculptor tom otterness would do well to try to embody these two virtues as he tries to ride out a new controversy concerning his own set of bronze lions with cubs for the battery park city public library. What is so offensive about otterness's characteristically cartoonish cats? well, nothing, except that they reminded representatives of people for the ethical treatment of animals ( peta ) — and dog-owners throughout the city — of one of the artist's youthful indiscretions: in an infamous gesture, the artist once killed a shelter dog on camera. These days, otterness is best known for his bulbous bronze people and creatures — hardly shocking public works — which cutely populate the nooks and crannies of new york,"

And tragically, that seemed to be what happened to a 79-year-old australian woman who passed away after a sneeze caused her to lose control of her vehicle. Moose: this is just bad luck. While driving down a country road, a norwegian man swerved his car in order to avoid hitting a moose in the road and ended up... Hitting a bear. Mom: stealing a car is likely a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you're just 13 years old. Now imagine seeing your mom in the opposite lane while you're driving a stolen toyota camry. Apparently, that was all it took to make a new jersey teen crash the ripped-off vehicle into a tree. Spider: swatting a spider is not a good enough reason to let go of a steering wheel on a highway, as one 17-year-old girl in kansas learned. Eleven people were taken to the hospital after her car crossed the center line and slammed into a jeep head-on. Eclipse: a san francisco woman blamed the moon moving in front of the sun as the reason she didn't see two pedestrians walking in front of her car. The 26-year-claimed she had been blinded by the eclipse's glare when she plowed into a mother and daughter crossing the street.

            "What is distracted driving? distracted driving is any activity that could divert a person's attention away from the primary task of driving. All distractions endanger driver, passenger, and bystander safety. These types of distractions include: texting using a cell phone or smartphone eating and drinking talking to passengers grooming reading, including maps using a navigation system watching a video adjusting a radio, cd player, or mp3 player but, because text messaging requires visual, manual, and cognitive attention from the driver, it is by far the most alarming distraction. The best way to end distracted driving is to educate all americans about the danger it poses. On this page, you ' ll find facts and statistics that are powerfully persuasive. If you don't already think distracted driving is a safety problem, please take a moment to learn more. And, as with everything on",

            "Over the past 48 hours, two competing polls in delaware have provided confusing information to the state's electorate and the nation in general. One telephone poll of 797 likely delaware voters, conducted by fairleigh dickinson university ( fdu ), october 20 - 26, shows democrat chris coons with a 21 % point lead over republican christine o'donnell, 57 % to 36 % ( plus or minus 3.5 % ). However, another telephone poll of 1,171 likely voters in the state, conducted by monmouth university's polling institute ( mu ), october 25 - 27, shows coons with only a 10 % point lead, 51 % to 41 % ( plus or minus 2.9 % ). What are we to make of the competing numbers? unfortunately for the public, the two polls are not comparable, and without more details it's tough to say for sure which is more accurate. Among the many issues, the interviews were conducted over different time periods, they have different target populations, they define their populations of \" likely voters \" differently, the questionnaires are different, and most notably, while both polls were done by telephone, live interviewers conducted the fdu poll, and the mu poll used a combination",

        "summary": "Figure this one out: the fake drugs we know as placebos seem to be getting more and more effective in the us. That strange finding comes out of a new analysis in the journal pain, which looked at medical studies going back to 1990. It turns out that people who take the sham medication in studies today report more pain relief than those who took them in studies 25 years ago, say researchers out of mcgill university in a press release. The scientists theorize that people today have higher expectations about drugs, and when they're participating in a big, fancy study — studies have grown in scope over the last two decades — they expect to feel better. It's no mere quirk, as nature explains. To get their drugs approved, manufacturers need to show that they outperform placebos, and the improved placebo performance is making it harder to do that. \" the data suggest that longer and larger trials are associated with bigger placebo responses, \" says the author of the paper. \" this, in turn, tends to result in the failure of those trials — since it makes it harder for pharmaceutical companies to prove that the drug being tested is more effective than treatment with a placebo. \" forbes notes that the finding applies only to the us, and not to other countries studied. One theory on why: the us allows drug companies to advertise directly to consumers, perhaps again raising those aforementioned expectations. Popular science draws a lesson: \" for drug companies looking to get their products on the market, they may have to find a different way to conduct clinical trials, like making them shorter and smaller. \" ( you ' ll perform better if you think you slept well, even if you didn't. )",

On wednesday, a university of pennsylvania professor spotted an suv near the philadelphia convention center, souped up with two high-tech license-plate readers and a placard linking it to the pennsylvania state police — but with a google maps decal smacked onto its window, phillyvoice.com reports. \" wtf? \" matt blaze tweeted with a picture of the strangely camouflaged vehicle, which the philadelphia police department did confirm thursday was part of its fleet. \" however, the placing of any particular decal on the vehicle was not approved through any chain of command, \" a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to motherboard. The rep adds the decals were ordered to be taken down asap and that an investigation was launched. What some are saying is worrisome is the fact that these automated license plate readers ( alprs ) — which law enforcement can use for everything from tracking down stolen cars to following up on amber alerts — are able to take in thousands of plate images per minute, basically enabling law enforcement to spy on drivers without warrants. \" it's certainly concerning if the city of philadelphia is running mass surveillance and going out of its way to mislead people, \" dave maass, a researcher with the nonprofit electronic frontier foundation, tells motherboard. Gizmodo marvels at the apparently backfired scheme to cover up the suv's real mission, noting that the google maps sticker \" simply looked too handmade. \" meanwhile, a google rep tells motherboard it is also looking into the matter. \" if i were google, i would be seriously rankled over the use of their logo to hide surveillance, \" maass says.

English in her presumed capacity as acting director. \" so which boss is the real boss? the courts may have to decide. The mess stems from the resignation last week of the previous cfpb chief, richard cordray. He appointed english acting director until a permanent director is named, but trump stepped in and appointed mulvaney to be interim chief instead. ( mulvaney has long been a fierce critic of the agency and its role in regulating the banking industry, though he did bring doughnuts on his first day. ) english has sued to remain in the post, though the agency's own general counsel sides with trump. It's a mess, but as politico notes, the issue will be moot soon enough when the president appoints a permanent new leader.",

Now a prominent teen is adding her own two cents, and plenty of people are sure to be curious about her take. Speaking in the uk tuesday to commemorate the first anniversary of a taliban attack that left more than 150 dead at a school in peshawar, pakistan, malala told afp that trump's comments were \" full of hatred, full of this ideology of being discriminative towards others, \" the bbc reports. \" the more you speak about islam and against all muslims, the more terrorists we create, \" the 18-year-old told channel 4 at the birmingham event. \" so it's important that whatever politicians say, whatever the media say, they should be really, really careful about it. \" the main reason for such caution is that pushing a whole demographic away could only lead to one thing, added malala, who herself was shot in the face by the taliban in 2012. \" if your intention is to stop terrorism, do not try to blame the whole population of muslims for it, because it cannot stop terrorism, \" she noted. \" it will radicalize more terrorists. \" malala's father, ziauddin yousafzai, a pakistani diplomat, also spoke at the event and noted that it's \" very unfair, very unjust that we associate 1.6 billion [ muslims ] with a few terrorist organizations, \" per the guardian.

Interestingly, the law was first introduced as legislation prohibiting all weapons on drones and requiring officers to get a search warrant before using a drone for surveillance. The man behind the bill, republican state rep. Rick becker, tells ars technica the law enforcement lobby would only allow the search warrant provision if weapons were allowed. \" i hear a lot of ideas about drones, and this is one of the worst, \" says law professor and drone expert ryan calo of the university of washington. He worries police officers won't have \" situational awareness \" in cases where the drones could be used and will use them \" too often because the perception ( is ) that the stakes are not very high. \" he adds, however, \" sometimes less-than-lethal can be lethal. \" indeed, the guardian reports at least 39 people in the us have died from police tasers this year alone. Becker says he's not happy with the final law and will attempt to eliminate the use of weapons.

On tuesday, the rapper tweeted a photo showing that he was listening to a sufjan stevens song on his computer. But, as ars technica points out, a close examination of the photo shows a few other suspicious browser tabs that, taken together, indicate he was attempting to illegally download serum, music editing software that costs $ 190. One of the tabs reads \" pirate bay torrent, \" although ars technica thinks he was actually using a rip-off version that goes by the same name as the \" real \" pirate bay torrent site. \" what the f --- @kanyewest... Can't afford serum? dick, \" tweeted deadmau5, the music producer who also co-founded xfer records, the maker of serum. He added, \" let's start a kickstarter to help @kanyewest afford a copy of serum. \" and then: \" he needs a small loan of 200$ #prayforyeezy. \" indeed, there was briefly a gofundme campaign set up to help west afford serum, 9 to 5 mac reports, but it's since been taken down.

Krlich failed, clemente moved in, and the horn-honking started, at clemente's urging, krlich alleges. But clemente says he never instigated the honks — though his son's friends do honk as a means of saying goodbye. Krlich went on to train surveillance cameras on the street, and says he has caught a fireman and a police officer blaring their horns. ( he has also started a website proclaiming it a case of \" small town terrorism. \" ) now, he's suing at least 40 alleged honkers. Says clemente's wife, \" just a regular beep or just to beep at the neighbors across the street, he ' ll take you to court. \" abc will have more on the case on tonight's 20/20; it notes it invited the whole town to a \" peace and reconciliation barbecue. \" vindy.com talked to attendees, who didn't report much in the way of reconciliation.",

The bill is currently at $ 700, but the unidentified woman refuses to budge. \"i have no right to cut his organ and mutilate him, \" she told channel 2, as reported by the times of israel. \" and the court has no right to force me to do so. \" the court, however, says that \" circumcision is a standard surgical procedure that is performed on every jewish baby boy, so when one of the parents demands it, the other cannot delay it. \" and that's where things get a little confusing. The child's parents are going through a divorce, and the mother says her soon-to-be ex initially agreed with the decision to leave the boy uncircumcised but changed his mind during the divorce proceedings. In its ruling against her, the court suggested this was part of a scheme of some sort on her part: \"if the mother is given the opportunity to prevent the circumcision or use her objection [ to the procedure ] as a tool to make headway in the divorce struggle, we could find ourselves facing a flood of cases like these, \" wrote the rabbis. \" this trend must be stopped immediately. \" rabbinical courts have authority over all marriage issues, notes 972mag.com.

An israeli woman is being fined nis 500 ( $ 140 ) every day for refusing to circumcise her one-year-old-son, israel's channel 2 reported today. There is no sweeping legal requirement for jews in israel to circumcise their children, but the woman is undergoing a divorce process at the haifa rabbinical court, and her husband has appealed to the court to pressure the woman into circumcising the son. \"i've been exposed to a lot of information about circumcision and decided not to proceed with the circumcision, \" the woman told channel 2. \"i have no right to cut at his genitals and to maim him, and the court has no authority to force me to. \" her lawyer also",

            "The rabbinical court in jerusalem rejected an appeal monday by a netanya woman fined nis 500 ( $ 140 ) per day for refusing to circumcise her son, as is required by jewish law ( halacha ). The penalty was initially levied by a rabbinical court in netanya earlier this year at the request of the woman's estranged husband who has demanded that the circumcision take place. The two are reportedly undergoing divorce proceedings, and the court stated that it believes her refusal was part of some ploy to save her marriage.

According to fox 5, burwell traveled to the site with another person in his car and fell 60 feet to his death after he got out of the vehicle to search for a parking spot. Thor wilink, 13, tells nbc 7 that he rushed from his home with climbing supplies after hearing screams and shouts, including, \" help, please god, save me. \" the teen says he witnessed surfers performing cpr on burwell, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Bender says the death should serve as a reminder, nbc reports. \" just like driving and using a cell phone, you don't want to be walking and using a cell phone or be distracted or anything, \" he says.

To apple ceo tim cook, it's \" maddening \" and nothing more than \" total political crap \" — and washington seems inclined to agree, with us treasury secretary jack lew noting wednesday the european commission's ruling was an attempt to tax income that \" ought to be taxed in the united states, \" per reuters and rte. Cook — who told rte that apple has \" several billion dollars \" put aside to pay us tax liabilities, per the ap — refutes his company getting any \" sweetheart \" deals and specifically takes issue with the effective tax rate of 0.005 % it supposedly paid on european profits in 2014, saying apple forked over \" a worldwide income tax rate \" of 26.1 % that year. But european competition commissioner margrethe vestager says what's crap is cook's assessment, noting the info that resulted in the ruling came directly from apple-provided numbers and other openly available data. Now european countries are stepping up with their own opinions, and it seems they're not team apple. The french finance minister said in a presser that \" it's normal to make apple pay normal taxes, \" joining germany in supporting the ruling. Who's really in a pickle at the moment: ireland, which is struggling to decide whether to take the huge tax payment ( reuters notes it would pay for the country's health system for a full year ) or turn it down so it can keep cajoling others into its low-tax fold, therefore creating jobs. Some regular irish citizens say to just go for the cash. \" they don't care about the normal people, \" one woman who cares for her ailing elderly mother tells reuters. \" the money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive. \" ( apple and the us only have themselves to blame, says a new york times editorial. )",

Indeed, merkel got the idea from a cleveland brown fan's obit, his son tells wkbw. Taking the trolling a step further, merkel, a longtime season ticket holder, will be buried in a bills t-shirt bearing the words, \" just one before i die. \" though merkel's beloved team didn't win a super bowl in his lifetime, \" my dad has several grandkids so he never lost hope that they will see the bills win the big one, \" his son says. In addition to being a bills super-fan, merkel was a member of the utica optimist club, an \" avid fisherman, \" and an army veteran, according to his obit. He is survived by his wife, sharon, three sons, and seven grandkids.",

A key quote from the orlando sentinel: \" a teenager is dead because a man made certain assumptions... And because his assumptions were wrong, trayvon benjamin martin no longer walks on this earth. \" the defense will get its turn tomorrow morning, and the jury is expected to begin deliberations in the afternoon, reports cnn. Even with the closing arguments getting underway, today's big news remains the judge's decision to allow the jury to consider lesser charges of manslaughter along with those of second-degree murder, either of which could bring life in prison. The ap explains the difference on the murder and manslaughter charges thusly: \" to win a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors must prove zimmerman showed ill will, hatred, or spite — a burden the defense has argued the state failed to meet. To get a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that zimmerman killed without lawful justification. \"",

D ' iberville — a 7-month-old boy was resuscitated after he was found trapped inside a washing machine at a d ' i ' berville laundromat. The mother noticed the baby was missing and saw him inside the machine, which was filled with water. \"she couldn't get the door to open, \" davis said. The woman ran for help at a business next door and a good samaritan was able to get the child out and resuscitate him. The baby was taken to biloxi regional medical center then transferred to the university of south alabama medical center in mobile. How it happened remains unclear. \"the family is hispanic and there was a language barrier, \" davis said. \"i can only speculate the 7-month-old climbed in and the 4-year-old closed the door. The baby is okay but he was taken to mobile as a precaution to make sure there's no lung problems. \" the department of human services was notified but davis said he doesn't believe criminal charges will be filed.",

Jefferson parish sheriff joe lopinto appeared with the coroner at a news conference amid widespread media scrutiny of the case. Lopinto declined to identify the four deputies involved but did confirm they were white. Per the ap, lopinto said it was too early to conclude whether a choke hold was used. \" there's no doubt they used force, \" lopinto said. \" it's whether the force was excessive. \" news outlets in new orleans reported that authorities had said robinson was under surveillance by narcotics agents thursday morning when he noticed the agents approaching at a gas station. He drove away but abandoned his car after crashing into two vehicles. Deputies chased him and caught and handcuffed him in the back yard of a home. Lopinto said he was in possession of heroin. He was unarmed, although there was a gun in the abandoned car. Meanwhile, an attorney for robinson's family says a march has been scheduled for monday evening in his honor near the spot where the struggle happened. The attorney, hester hilliard, appeared with the family at a news conference where she said the sheriff's office and coroner had acted with \" professionalism and transparency. \" however, she also said the family would like to see an agency other than the sheriff's office lead the investigation.",

Department store operators macy's inc ( m.n ) and kohl's corp ( kss.n ) both cut their profit forecasts for 2016 on wednesday, pointing to weak sales in the last months of the year and bringing shares in the entire retail sector down after hours. Shares of macy's fell 9 percent to $ 32.63 in extended trading. Kohl's corp ( kss.n ) shares fell 14.8 percent to $ 44.22. Other retailers were also down sharply in after-hours trading, with j.c. Penney co inc ( jcp.n ) off 4.4 percent and nordstrom inc ( jwn.n ) tumbling 6 percent. Kohl's cut its adjusted profit forecast for the fiscal year ending jan. 30 to $ 3.60-$ 3.65 per share from its previous forecast of $ 3.80-$ 4.00 per share. \" sales were volatile throughout",

The announcement was issued alongside an unfavorable earnings report, showing comparable store sales dipped 2.1 % last quarter. The news caused its stock to plunge nearly 10 % during after-hours trading wednesday. Macy's ( m ) said it expects to layoff about 3,900 workers as a result of the upcoming store closures, and another 6,200 jobs will be cut as the company works to streamline its management team, according to a press release. A few stores have already been shuttered, but 63 will close down between now and mid-2017, leaving about 660 u.s. Stores left open. The closings are among the 100 stores macy's said last august that it intends to shutter.

        "summary": "Two geologists may have spotted a surprisingly simple correlation that can help predict earthquakes — and if they're correct, the earth is on track for an uptick in major quakes next year. The pair pored over a century's worth of a data on earthquakes and detected a pattern: when the earth's rotation slows, as it does periodically, the slowdown is followed by an increase in quakes with a magnitude of 7 or greater, reports the guardian. Their research, published in geophysical research letters, has been well-received in the field, and it will be put to the test soon. The rotational slowdowns typically happen over five years, and the last began four years ago. Meaning, we can expect to see two to five more major earthquakes than normal in 2018, or 17 to 20, reports science. \" the earth offers us a five-years ' heads up on future earthquakes, which is remarkable, \" says roger bilham of the university of colorado, who detected the correlation with rebecca bendick of the university of montana. Exactly where the quakes will take place is fuzzier, but typically the increase shows up in regions along the equator. The researchers aren't sure how to explain all this, but one theory is that it involves nearly imperceptible changes in the flow of molten iron in the earth's core. That might be enough to slow down the earth's spin a millisecond or two, a difference that can be measured by atomic clocks, and perhaps result in the release of vast amounts of energy underground. The cycle seems to take place about every three decades, writes geologist trevor nace at forbes. ( la residents won't like this san andreas prediction. )",

For decades, scientists have charted tiny fluctuations in the length of earth's day: gain a millisecond here, lose a millisecond there. Last week at the annual meeting of the geological society of america here, two geophysicists argued that these minute changes could be enough to influence the timing of major earthquakes — and potentially help forecast them. During the past 100 years, earth's slowdowns have correlated surprisingly well with periods with a global increase in magnitude-7 and larger earthquakes, according to roger bilham of the university of colorado ( cu ) in boulder and rebecca bendick at the university of montana in missoula. Usefully, the spike, which adds two to five more quakes than typical, happens well after the slow-down begins. \"the earth offers us a 5-years heads up on future earthquakes, which is remarkable, \" says bilham, who presented the work. Most seismologists agree that earthquake prediction is a minefield. And so far, bilham and bendick have only fuzzy, hard-to-test ideas about what might cause the pattern they found.

To start, the research team of geologists analyzed every earthquake to occur since 1900 at a magnitude above 7.0. They were looking for trends in the occurrence of large earthquakes. What they found is that roughly every 32 years there was an uptick in the number of significant earthquakes worldwide. The team was puzzled as to the root cause of this cyclicity in earthquake rate.

But as the new york times reports, the cooperation he provided will likely continue to mean trouble for the president's family business, the trump organization. For example, the newspaper says cohen told prosecutors that the company's chief financial officer, allen weisselberg, also was involved in discussions for hush-money payments to two women who alleged affairs with trump. Cohen already has implicated trump in the payments, which might run afoul of felony campaign finance rules, and investigators are continuing to investigate the role of other trump organization employees in the payments. On monday, trump made reference to the \" private transaction, \" saying the focus on it is a desperate ploy by democrats because they can't turn up evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia. \"that's because there was no collusion, \" he wrote. \" so now the dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution, which it was not...

Harvard researchers programmed 1,024 of the \" kilobots \" to work in tandem with each other to form complex shapes, a feat being hailed as the biggest robot swarm ever created, reports the wall street journal. The development — inspired by collaborations in nature by the likes of bees, ants, and birds — is detailed in science and is nothing short of \" engineering majesty, \" a roboticist at rice university not involved with the research tells the boston globe. Each tiny robot has a battery, a sensor to detect where fellow robots are, and three vibrating legs on which it moves. Lead researcher mike rubenstein explains that he draws up a pattern on a computer, beams it to all the robots at once, and off they go. No one robot is in charge. \" the only thing they have to go on, to make decisions, is what their neighbors are doing, \" he tells the bbc. Possible applications in the future include everything from oil-spill cleanups to the exploration of planets. Rubenstein's one regret might be the name \" kilobot, \" a play off kilobyte. \" unfortunately, it sounds like they're ' killerbots, ' which...

The famous italian tower is doing just fine more than 800 years after it first started tilting during construction, according to a group that's been monitoring the 190-foot tuscan monument since 2001. It's in better condition now than predicted by an international committee of researchers, reports ansa. Indeed, the tower has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past two decades — it was closed in 1990 because its tilt became too considerable, per popular science — with \" oscillations now varying at the average of 1/2 millimeter a year, \" says nunziante squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the university of pisa. \" what counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected, \" adds squeglia, who credits work to stabilize the structure on soft soil. A study published in may actually pointed out the importance of that soil in keeping pisa's landmark upright. Essentially, the soft soil modifies ground vibrations — not uncommon in italy, which sits on multiple fault lines — to prevent much motion in the tower, which has emerged undamaged from at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. \" ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events, \" an engineer says in a release.

It all started with an affair. Harris and husband david harris were both dentists living in a south houston suburb with their 3-year old twin sons, according to texas monthly. Harris became suspicious of her husband and hired an investigator to follow him. When told that her husband could be found with his former receptionist, gail bridges, at the nassau bay hilton, harris flew into a jealous rage. She jumped into her silver s-class 430 mercedes-benz along with her teenage step-daughter, lindsey, who was visiting and would later testify against her, per khou11. With lindsey in tow, harris confronted the couple in the lobby, where she lunged at the woman, tore at her clothing, and pulled her hair. David harris and bridges eventually walked out of the hotel and proceeded to bridges'suv, while the investigator filmed the event from the parking lot. Clara harris went back to her car, gunned the engine, and ran it into bridges'vehicle, which tossed david harris across the parking lot. As her husband lay on the ground, harris drove the car around the parking lot several times, running over david harris three times.

According to the change.org petition, which has received more than 30,000 signatures, vegetarians eating at in-n-out are stuck with french fries or a \" cheese-slathered bun. \" it adds that there is no \" healthy, humane, and sustainable option \" at the restaurant. The los angeles times points out that in-n-out's official menu is \" renowned for its simplicity, \" but the restaurant does offer a grilled cheese sandwich on its \" secret menu. \" in-n-out is aware of the petition, which will be sent to the company's president, but has no comment. The petition was started by the good food institute. \" southern california is a mecca for plant-based eating and food, \" the nonprofit's executive director, bruce friedrich, says. \" in-n-out should be leading the charge. \" and while his petition may gaining signatures, business insider points out anti-veggie burger comments are drowning out the pro-veggie side on the in-n-out facebook page. And not everyone against the petition is a meat-eater. One vegan wonders why any vegetarian would want to \" support a company that slaughters cows by the thousands \" even if it has an awesome veggie burger. Regardless, friedrich hopes a veggie option can crack the in-n-out menu — or at least its secret menu.",

It is next to a fully exposed stone block of similar, but smaller, dimensions, known as hajjar-al-hibla, or stone of the pregnant woman.

The federal prison inmate learned on wednesday that his effort to get those convictions overturned — via a nov. 6 motion he filed \" pro se, \" meaning he was representing himself — failed, and how. Judge tanya walton pratt of the us district court for the southern district of indiana didn't mince words in rejecting the \" frivolous \" claim in a two-page ruling. It's a bit circuitous, but here's what he attempted: the indianapolis star reports that he tried to claim the federal court that he pleaded guilty in didn't actually have the authority to render a judgment against him. In an attempt to bolster his argument, he cited a \" friend of the court brief \" filed a couple of months ago by frank edwin pate, a fellow inmate at the englewood federal correctional institution in littleton, colo. As courthouse news explains, pate's motion claimed the court didn't have that authority because fogle is a \" sovereign citizen, \" meaning free from any government's laws. In his 22-page motion, pate argued the federal court took \" control of ( fogle's ) liberty illegally \" and requests that the court offer proof of its jurisdiction or dismiss the charges. Pratt's response to fogle: \" federal courts have subject matter and personal jurisdiction over defendants brought before them on federal indictments alleging violations of federal law. \" she characterizes the \" sovereign citizen defense \" as \" shop worn \" and having \" no conceivable validity in american law. \" ( fogle has been attacked while in prison. )",

After enduring months of rehab and an experimental drug for his brain injury, it finally clicked for rory that he was not, in fact, a major hollywood star. The australian who could only speak mandarin: ben mcmahon had studied mandarin in high school but was far from fluent. However, after getting into a car crash, he woke up from a coma speaking nothing but mandarin. While his english skills eventually recovered, mcmahon later took advantage of his newfound mandarin abilities by moving to shanghai and co-hosting a chinese tv show. The toddler who took up drinking and smoking: spending five days in a coma left a 3-year-old chinese girl with the habits of a much older person. Ya wen was a normal toddler prior to being hit by a speeding van, reported the ny daily news in 2010. After she woke up from the coma, however, ya wen's mother claims the little girl's personality changed significantly and she started stealing cigarettes and drinking up to three glasses of beer at a time. The grandfather who became a sex addict: an 81-year-old swiss grandfather reportedly morphed into a sex addict after falling from a tree and slipping into a four-day coma, reported the mirror in 2010. According to angelo de luca's son, daniele, the \" sex mad \" senior citizen spent more than $ 4,000 at a brothel after recovering from the fall. Daniele suspected that the coma must have \" wiped out \" a brain function that inhibits sex drive; he took control of his dad's affairs. The teen who became fluent in german: a 13-year-old girl in croatia puzzled doctors and her family when she emerged from a 24-hour coma with the ability to only speak german and not her native croatian. Reportedly, the girl had taken basic lessons in german but was still at a beginner level when she mysteriously fell ill.

Myers, and the construction bill tied to the 3,000-square-foot addition on his existing weekend home will be footed by the archdiocese of newark — which the new york times points out had to close a beloved catholic elementary school two years ago due to a lack of funds — well, the news isn't going over so well. It didn't two weeks ago, when the star-ledger reported on the addition to the franklin township house, where myers has spent his weekends since the archdiocese bought it in 2002. And it didn't go over well this sunday, which saw parishioners closing their checkbooks, particularly to the ongoing archbishop's annual appeal, which supports catholic schools, feeding the poor, and retired priests, among other causes. Withholding funds has been a tough decision for some, who feel it's the only way to send a message — though they acknowledge the move will hurt the poor, not the archbishop. In an effort to better target him, a number of parishioners tell the star-ledger they have written to the vatican's us ambassador, asking that he speak to pope francis about having myers removed from his position. No funds from the appeal will go to the addition on the $ 800,000 home, which already claims five bedrooms and an amoeba-shaped swimming pool. With two years to go until retirement, myers, 72, is tacking on a three-story, 3,000-square-foot addition that will house an indoor exercise pool, hot tub, library, and elevator, and the archdiocese says it is using money from the sales of other properties, along with donations, to pay for it. Per the star-ledger, records show the addition will cost at least $ 500,000 — and that doesn't include architectural costs, furniture, or landscaping.",

He's done writing checks. \" if this is the only way i can be heard, so be it, \" said ferri, 70. \" i ' m disgusted.
