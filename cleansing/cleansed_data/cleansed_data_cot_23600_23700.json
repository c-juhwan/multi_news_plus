He was briefly the gop frontrunner before dropping out of the race in september. Politico reports trump is nearly 500 delegates short of the 1,237 he needs to avoid an open convention in july. If a nominee isn't agreed upon by a majority in the first convention vote, delegates are free to throw their support behind anyone. In that event, paul ryan is seen as a favorite non-candidate to receive the nomination, despite him insisting he isn't interested, according to the new york times. Wisconsin's april 5 primary is seen as a key battle in preventing trump from clinching the nomination. Walker hasn't endorsed any of the candidates yet, though politico believes he is only a few days away from throwing his support behind cruz.",

        "summary": "A ban on us-bound passengers on flights on certain airlines from airports in eight countries in the middle east and north africa bringing laptops, tablets, and cameras into airline cabins was prompted by intelligence about a possible terror threat, us officials say. Federal officials haven't been specific about the threat, though a source tells cnn that the ban was brought in after intelligence indicated that al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula was perfecting \" battery bombs \" powerful enough to bring down a plane and that could be hidden in electronic items. According to the daily beast's sources, this intelligence was seized during a us raid on yemen in january. In other coverage: the uk introduced a similar ban on laptops and other electronics bigger than cellphones tuesday, though with a slightly different list of countries, reports the ap, which has a list of the countries, airlines, and airports affected by the american and british bans. A source tells abc that the threat to bring down a plane came from isis associates, and the government considers the information to be both \" substantiated \" and \" credible. \" the ban comes as secretary of state rex tillerson hosts a meeting in washington wednesday and thursday with 68 countries involved in the fight against isis, reports the bbc, which describes the summit as a chance for the trump administration to \" put its stamp on \" the battle against the extremist group. Experts tell the ap that while a bomb in the cargo hold could be just as deadly as one in the cabin, passengers are still allowed to have laptops in checked baggage because more sophisticated technology is used to scan those bags. One of the daily beast's sources say the kind of bomb authorities are worried about needs to be manually triggered. Airline industry analyst robert mann, however, tells the guardian that filling a plane's cargo hold with hundreds of devices containing lithium-ion batteries increases the danger of fire and explosions. He warns that fires in the hold are harder to detect and fight than ones in the cabin. The washington post reports that some analysts suspect the ban is more about business interests than about security. They note that us airlines accuse some of the affected airlines, which fly from hubs in the gulf, of receiving unfair subsidies — and that the ban is likely to cause many first-class and business class passengers who want to use laptops to work while they fly to choose us airlines over competitors like emirates.",

            "Électricité de france, the giant power utility and the world's biggest operator of nuclear power plants, was found guilty on thursday of spying on greenpeace in a bizarre and convoluted computer hacking case that also ensnared the disgraced american cyclist floyd landis. Agence france-presse — getty images a court in nanterre, near paris, fined e.d.f. 1.5 million euros, or about $ 2 million, for complicity in concealing stolen documents and complicity to intrude in a computer network. It also sentenced two e.d.f. Security officials and two security consultants to prison terms and ordered e.d.f. To pay greenpeace 500,000 euros ( $ 680,000 ) in damages. The company had argued that it had itself been the victim, with the security consulting firm that it hired acting illegally without its knowledge. The court also handed down suspended sentences of 12 months each to mr. Landis — who was stripped of his 2006 tour de france victory after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone — and his coach, arnie baker. Both men, who have always maintained their innocence, were tried in absentia for having received stolen documents. I wrote in detail about this unusual case two years ago, but to sum up, e.d.f.

His reply: \" well, that's easy to answer. I didn't have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda. I did a couple of speeches for them, i do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that i had any kind of a relationship with them. Do i take the product? yes. I think it's a good product. \" today, though, critics are accusing carson of trying to gloss over his ties to the company. The wall street journal previously reported on his paid speeches and promotional videos for the company, including one in which he spoke of taking mannatech products after a diagnosis of prostate cancer more than a decade ago. \"within about three weeks my symptoms went away, and i was really quite amazed, \" he told sales associates, as captured in a 2004 video. Carson said he even considered passing on surgery, though he went ahead with the procedure and is cancer-free today. Some examples of the criticism he's taking: politifact: it rates the \" no involvement \" claim as false. \" as far as we can tell, carson was not a paid employee or official endorser of the product. However, his claim suggests he has no ties to mannatech whatsoever. In reality, he got paid to deliver speeches to mannatech and appeared in promotional videos, and he consistently delivered glowing reviews of the nutritional supplements. As a world-renowned surgeon, carson's opinion on health issues carries weight, and mannatech has used carson's endorsement to its advantage. \" national review: \" his declarations that ' i didn't have an involvement with them ' and ' absurd to say that i had any kind of relationship with them ' are just bald-faced lies, \" writes jim geraghty. \" carson's lack of due diligence before working with the company is forgivable. His blatant lying about it now is much harder to forgive. \" the atlantic: \" presidential candidates frequently stretch the truth, \" writes matt ford. \" but carson's outright denial seems egregious even by that standard.

        "summary": "Flint residents battling tainted water may finally get some resolution on tuesday. A federal judge is expected to approve a sweeping settlement that spells out a plan to replace water lines for thousands of homes, reports the ap. Under the deal, flint would replace at least 18,000 lead or galvanized-steel water lines by 2020, and the state would pick up the bill with state and federal money. The cost is expected to be about $ 100 million. The settlement calls for the replacement of 6,000 lines in each of the next three years, with all the work done by jan. 1, 2020, reports the detroit free press. More than 700 water lines already have been replaced and work is ongoing, but the agreement would end the uncertainty over how to pay for the enormous task. The state will set aside $ 87 million and keep another $ 10 million in reserve if necessary. Another part of the deal revolves around bottled water. The state would deliver it for free to homebound residents and continue running at least nine distribution centers, reports the detroit news. But if demand peters out and tests improve, the state can begin shutting down the distribution centers later this year. Plaintiffs wanted door-to-door delivery of bottled water, but the agreement rejected that. Instead, residents can continue to call the city's 211 service and get free bottled water within 24 hours.",

        "summary": "The delicate human hand with its 27 bones folds up into an effective blunt weapon — and that is probably not a coincidence, say researchers who studied the difference between blows from a clenched fist, an unclenched fist, and an open hand. University of utah researcher david carrier and his colleagues used fishing line and guitar tuners to string up the arms of nine cadavers for their experiments. The upshot? they say the shape of our hands evolved to make it possible to best punch with a closed fist without damaging bones, especially those in the palm, the los angeles times reports. Most researchers think our hands evolved the way they did entirely because of the more dexterous tasks early humans started performing, but \" we suggest that the hand proportions that allow the formation of a fist may tell us something important about our evolutionary history and who we are as a species, \" carrier says in a press release. Carrier, whose earlier research claimed that male faces evolved to take punches, says no other primate can form a \" buttressed \" fist with the thumb outside the fingers. He admits that his findings are controversial, and notes that a national geographic science blogger declared his work to be \" bro science — dudes pummeling each other driving human evolution. \" he tells the washington post that the idea for the research came during an argument with an old friend about biology, during which his friend held up a fist, and said: \" i can hit you in the face with this, but that's not why it evolved! \" ( other researchers claim that people who suffer chronic back pain have less evolved spines. )",

Photograph by kathy baccari, national geographic your shot migrating monarch butterflies are in \" grave danger, \" according to a report that shows their colonies in mexico now occupy the smallest area since records began in 1993. The report is based on a survey of mexico's monarch butterfly biosphere reserve done in december 2013. The butterflies, which spend the winter hibernating in the reserve's forest, occupied only 1.65 acres ( 0.6 hectare ) in december 2013 — a 44 percent drop from 2012, when the insects covered 2.76 acres ( 1.12 hectares ) of land. The survey was conducted by the wwf-telcel alliance and mexico's national commission for protected areas. Though monarchs are found in many parts of the world, the migratory monarch is the most thoroughly studied, since it's the group that's most at risk. ( watch a video of monarch butterflies. ) omar vidal, director general of wwf-mexico, noted by email: \" the monarch butterfly as a species is not endangered. What is endangered is its migratory phenomenon from canada to mexico and back. \" the number of migrating monarchs is plummeting for a few reasons: widespread loss of a plant called milkweed, which their young rely on for food; extreme climate fluctuations in north america, including freezing temperatures",

        "summary": "Originally slated to compete with disney's the jungle book in 2016, mowgli: legend of the jungle joins netflix's extensive library on dec. 7 following a limited release this weekend. The change comes after the film's sale by warner bros, which ultimately decided against a major release — and perhaps for good reason, as reviews put andy serkis ' film starring rohan chand at a distant second to disney's offering. Four opinions: it's \" somewhere between a film that's for kids and yet, in its persistent cruelty and bleakness, definitely not for kids, \" writes matt zoller seitz at rogerebert.com. \" mowgli is repeatedly beaten and tormented, even locked in a cage at one point, \" he notes, adding this \" sits oddly with the slapstick comedy. \" he was also off-put by the animals ' faces, \" vividly \" reflecting the actors who voice them. Mowgli \" fails to deliver the bare necessities, \" michael rechtshaffen writes at the hollywood reporter, blaming \" performance-capture that falls unpersuasively short of state-of-the-art and a prestige cast ( including christian bale, cate blanchett and benedict cumberbatch ) that curiously fails to engage. \" he, too, references scenes \" certain to scare the crap out of the kiddies. \" brian lowry is thankful for netflix's save, however. \" this is one of those happy occasions where the netflix model allows a project that might have been lost in the theatrical wilds to find its place, \" he writes at cnn, arguing \" this darker, more distinctly british take \" on rudyard kipling's book is \" well worth the time, \" not least because the \" dialogue possesses a certain poetry. \" glenn kenny was much less taken with the script by callie kloves. Placing the story in early 20th-century india, it \" diverges from the kipling stories considerably and at times uneasily \" and \" makes some daring moves exploring what one might call the dual nature of mowgli. \" but \" while not everything here works, what does is impressive, \" kenny writes at the new york times, commending chand on \" a scarily credible physical performance, \" despite being just 11 at the time of filming.

        "summary": "A 49-year-old california man died yesterday while waiting for a ride to his uncle's funeral, according to family members. Tony calderon was waiting streetside in an unincorporated part of east los angeles when a palm tree's 2,000-pound crown became detached and fell on top of him, initially trapping but not killing him. Bystanders responded to his screams for help, but were unable to budge the tree top, which firefighters eventually had to remove using a crane. It took responders nearly two hours to get to the body, cbs los angeles reports. Though an arborist tells nbc los angeles that the canary island date palm didn't appear outwardly troubled — \" it had a lot of live fronds. That's how palms can fool you \" — calderon's family members say that the owner of the property that housed the palm has ignored repeated requests to take it down. \" it's been going on for 15 years already and it wasn't taken care of, \" says calderon's brother. County officials say that because the tree was located on private property, it wasn't their responsibility. Says the mother of the homeowner, \" i've always worried about those trees but i don't have the money to cut them down. \" ( in april, a boy was killed hours after his father's funeral in pennsylvania. )",

The family of a pregnant teen in honduras who died and was buried yanked her body out of her tomb a day after the funeral, convinced she was still alive, the guardian reports. The incident reportedly happened in july, but it's just being circulated now after a tv report last week from primer impacto. In a somewhat confusing chain of events, the guardian reports that three-months-pregnant nelsy perez ( also referred to as neysi in some reports ), 16, suddenly fell ill. Some local reports say she had a heart attack after hearing gunfire; others indicated that the cause of her sudden illness was unknown and that her parents called in a pastor for an exorcism, thinking she was possessed. Whatever the cause, nelsy apparently died and was buried. But when her husband ( also referred to as her fiance ) visited the tomb a day later, he tells primer impacto, \" i could hear noises inside. I heard banging, then i heard her voice. She was screaming for help, \" the new york daily news reports. A cemetery worker backs up his claim, per aol, saying he heard screams. Video shows relatives breaking open the concrete tomb and pulling out nelsy's casket. Another shot shows her in the coffin, dressed in her wedding gown. Family rushed her to a clinic, but a doctor there said nelsy was dead. Her family, however, continues to insist nelsy was buried alive — they say her fingers were bruised and there was a broken glass panel inside the coffin. And while a police investigator says the decomposing body's gases could have broken the glass, an aunt says the teen \" didn't smell bad or anything. \" some say it's possible she could have initially suffered from a trance-like state called catalepsy.

Despite efforts to revive the young woman, the family found no signs of life and later returned her to the cemetery to be reburied. Perez was three months pregnant when she collapsed outside",

            "Relatives in honduras say noises were heard coming from the tomb of nelsy perez and her coffin showed signs of damage inside when unearthed relatives of a pregnant honduran teenager, who had been buried after being pronounced dead at a hospital, broke down her tomb and pulled out her coffin after apparently hearing banging from the inside. Nelsy perez, 16, was then rushed to a clinic, still lying in her coffin and dressed in the wedding gown she was going to wear when she married the father of her unborn child, but doctors there found no signs of life. Relatives say they observed signs of a struggle in the broken glass panel of the coffin over her face, and bruises on her fingers. The case has sparked much speculation over what could have happened. Some have suggested catalepsy, a nervous condition that causes muscular rigidity, insensitivity to external stimuli"

The elephant, believed to have been caught in a current while crossing a stretch of water separating two areas of jungle near the town of kokkilai, was spotted trying to keep its trunk above the waves some 10 miles off the northeast coast of sri lanka on tuesday. The navy and department of wildlife officials then jumped into action. Over 12 hours, rescuers tied the elephant with ropes and slowly pulled it to shallow waters, reports the guardian. A rep for a conservation group says elephants are \" very good swimmers \" who are known to travel between local islands; they may have even first reached sri lanka after swimming from southern india. But while it's not unusual to see elephants paddling 10 miles off shore, \" they can't keep swimming for long because they burn a lot of energy, \" the rep says, adding, \" in this case, the situation probably warranted human intervention. \" a video of the rescue shows the elephant barely staying afloat before it was pulled ashore and put in the care of wildlife officials, per the sunday times.",

        "summary": "Compared to a generation ago, today's young people are dawdling when it comes to experiencing behaviors traditionally seen as precursors to adulthood: drinking, driving, having sex, and joining the workforce. As a result, they're often called \" lazy \" — but that's not exactly accurate. According to researchers, today's 18-year-olds are acting like 15-year-olds of the late 1970s because of the secure environment in which they're raised, per the san diego union tribune. Whereas previous generations enjoyed fewer resources and viewed quickly finding a job and starting a family as necessary for survival, smaller families have fueled \" the idea that children need to be carefully nurtured, \" psychologist jean twenge tells the washington post. That's led to \" helicopter parenting \" and less independence for teens, but they're far from sheltered. Knowing a college degree is necessary for many jobs, teens are planning for their futures early and avoiding risky behaviors that could jeopardize that future, says a researcher with the council on contemporary families. According to twenge, whose analysis of seven surveys of 8.3 million teens over the past four decades is published in child development, this explains why the percentage of high school seniors who'd dated or tried alcohol was more than 20 % lower between 2010 and 2016 than it was four decades previously — and why adolescents from large families or families with lower incomes are more likely to drink, date, and have sex, per scientific american.

Service members tell fox that because of their design, the handle breaks easily when the cups are dropped — and when that happens, a new mug has to be purchased at great expense because replacement parts are not available. Decreased production has caused the price of replacement cups to almost double over the last few years. After grassley wrote to the air force, questioning what he called \" yet another report of wasteful spending in the department of defense, \" wilson told him that a solution was in the works. She said the new air force rapid sustainment office can supply 3d printed handles for just 50 cents each. \" it is simply irresponsible to spend thousands of dollars on manufactured parts when we have the technology available to produce them ourselves, \" she told the republican. Grassley said in a statement friday that while he was glad to hear about the innovations, he's still not sure why the air force can't find a cheaper alternative to a $ 1,280 cup in the first place. \" government officials have the responsibility to use taxpayer dollars efficiently, \" he said. \" too often, that's not the case. \" ( the air force also paid $ 30,000 for three toilet seat covers. )",

Police are treating it as a murder-suicide and are not looking for suspects, but they have provided few details about what might have happened. Coverage: early phone call: police say they received a call from a \" male person \" connected to the 30-acre property about 5am, and officers arrived soon after to find the bodies.

After multiple chemotherapy treatments, an august brain scan revealed that the tumor was still there, and parents joey and kristen masciantonio decided to do one more round of chemo before withdrawing treatment and enjoying their final days together, reports the san francisco chronicle. Then, in september, they got a call from an fbi friend who'd secured them passes to see the pope during his visit to philadelphia, reports nbc news. Avid catholics, the parents got permission from their doctor to brave the throngs and bring baby gianna to the crowded streets. In what some call the miracle on market street, a security guard brought the baby forward and the pope kissed gianna's head, and now, two months later, scans reveal her tumor is smaller and doctors have changed the originally grim prognosis. \" it was the luck of the draw, \" her father said. But while he believes in \" divine intervention, \" he's also careful not to dismiss the role of the doctors treating his daughter. \" the kiss was god's work, that's for sure.

Given the conditions, they have only a short window to complete their reconnaissance mission — \" it's a very remote location and very expensive to put people into, \" one scientist tells the bbc — but if in the next year or two they can extract a core of the planet's oldest ice, they hope to get answers to pressing questions about established fluctuations in earth's temperatures as well as past levels of gasses that trap heat, such as carbon dioxide. They're specifically investigating the pleistocene epoch, which stretches from 11,700 years ago to 1.8 million years ago, reports live science. The team wants to go back further than the oldest core that's been studied so far, which is 800,000 years old, to understand why more than a million years ago temperature swings changed from 41,000-year cycles to 100,000-year cycles, reports nature news. A project out of the uk is already starting to drill at \" little dome c \" to extract chips of ice and measure temps 650 yards deep, while a french team hopes to probe nearly 2 miles deep next year and a us team hopes to drill on ross island next year. All groups are working under the umbrella group international partnerships in ice core sciences, and say that multiple 1.5-million-year-old core samples would be ideal in understanding how past conditions might shape future changes.

            "Treatment started shortly after birth seems to have kept virus from getting a foothold in her immune system by dennis thompson healthday reporter wednesday, oct. 23, 2013 ( healthday news ) -- a 3-year-old mississippi girl apparently cured of hiv infection by aggressive treatment right after her birth remains free of the virus, her doctors report. Early treatment with a combination of potent antiretroviral drugs appears to have kept the virus from successfully establishing a reservoir in the child's system, said immunologist dr. Katherine luzuriaga, of the university of massachusetts medical school, who is part of the research team tracking the case. Doctors are hesitant to declare the child fully cured, but in a case update reported in the oct. 24 issue of the new england journal of medicine they said that no actively replicating hiv has been found in her system by even the most sensitive tests available. The girl stopped taking hiv medication when she was 18 months old. A couple of tests have found very low-level indications of hiv in the girl's blood, but doctors cannot tell if they are false positives or simply remnants of the eradicated virus. \" if they are remnants, the question is whether they are capable of reigniting, \" luzuriaga said. \" for that reason, we are calling this a remission because we want to follow the baby over a longer",
            "Panel a shows hiv-1 rna levels indicating confirmed hiv-1 infection, with positive values for hiv-1 rna in plasma at four time points before and after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy ( art ). The decline in the viral load was biphasic, which is typically seen during effective art. Panel b shows hiv-1 rna levels indicating sustained control of hiv-1 replication during art and after the discontinuation of therapy. The solid arrow indicates the last time that prescriptions for art were filled ( at 15 months of age, according to pharmacy records ), and the dashed arrow the time of the last administration of art ( at 18 months of age, according to maternal report ). In both panel a and panel b, solid circles indicate detectable hiv-1 rna, and open circles undetectable hiv-1 rna; the shaded area indicates the limit of detection of the plasma viral-load assay. Panel c shows the percentage of cd4+ t cells from the child's birth until 30 months of age. The shaded area indicates the cd4+ t-cell percentage in the normal range ( 10th to 90th percentiles ); fluctuations in the normal range are due to age-related changes.3tc denotes lamivudine, azt zidovudine, and nvp nevirapine.

The images were served up the very next day, to much backlash from jezebel commenters ( a sample comment blasted the site as \" mean and petty \" ), and now dunham herself has weighed in. In an interview with grantland posted yesterday, dunham says she found the whole thing \" messed up \" and that \" it felt gross \" — and was \" a monumental error in [ jezebel's ] approach to feminism, \" e! reports. Ultimately, comparing the images showed that little retouching was done — a fact that jezebel writer jessica coen acknowledged, saying, \" while dunham has not been radically photoshopped, it's clearer than ever what kind of woman vogue finds vogue-worthy: the taller, longer-limbed, svelter version of reality. \" that wasn't a good enough explanation for dunham: \" instead of saying, ' hey, we kind of f --- ed up. These pictures aren't that retouched.

Now, the supreme court is letting that dismissal stand. \" the court's reasoning in this case echoes old supreme court pronouncements that discriminating against pregnant women at work isn't sex discrimination because both men and women can be non-pregnant, \" writes gale sherwin of the aclu, noting that \" congress long ago rejected this ridiculous reasoning. \" angela ames took action against nationwide insurance after she came back from maternity leave and had no place to pump milk, the aclu reports. An office \" lactation room \" apparently required paperwork that took three days to process. Instead, the company nurse said, ames could use a sick room, but she'd have to wait until it was free, writes sherwin. In the meantime, her supervisor said that she'd need to get all the work she missed done within two weeks to avoid facing discipline, sherwin writes. As ames grappled with pain in her breasts, which had started to leak, she talked to her department head, who suggested that she \" just go home and be with ( her ) babies. \" ultimately, the department head dictated a letter of resignation for ames to sign, sherwin notes. In dismissing the case, courts held that ames hadn't taken proper internal action before resigning and hadn't technically been fired. A trial court deemed the \" be with your babies \" comment was gender-neutral, sherwin adds. While the department head was a woman, the federal appeals court that rejected discrimination claims, msnbc notes, was made up of three men. ( delta recently apologized over a breast-pump mishap. )",

National geographic takes note of census bureau stats that show women now make up 11 % of the nation's 13.7 million hunters, up from 9 % in 2006. What's going on? the story hits on a slew of factors, including the increased popularity of the sustainable and local-food movements and their focus on paying attention to where the food on our plates comes from. \" hunting may be the next frontier for local food, \" says author lily raff mccaulou. \" i was pretty detached from what i ate before i started hunting. \" ( and vegetarians, take note: she also eats less meat now, she says. ) retailers have, of course, noticed the spike in female hunters — and perhaps contributed to it, by marketing smaller firearms and gear tailored for women, reports cbs minnesota. That state mirrors the national trend, with the number of hunting licenses granted to women up from 50,000 in 2000 to 72,000 last year. Minnesota and other states also are conducting outdoorsy how-to's specifically for women. In fact, \" women tend to be actually better hunters because they tend to be a bit more patient, and oftentimes are a much better shot, because they tend to be a bit more focused, \" one hunter — a male one — tells npr. ( in another gender-role story, it turns out that women may have been the main cave painters of yore. )",

The problem has just begun to emerge, so far mostly in michigan, which has had more people sickened by the drug — 112 out of 404 nationwide — than any other state. \"we're hearing about it in michigan and other locations as well, \" said dr. Tom m. Chiller, the deputy chief of the mycotic diseases branch of the centers for disease control and prevention. \"we don't have a good handle on how many people are coming back. \" he added, \"we are just learning about this and trying to assess how best to manage these patients. They're very complicated. \" in the last few days, about a third of the 53 patients treated for meningitis at st. Joseph mercy hospital in ann arbor, mich., have returned with abscesses, said dr. Lakshmi k. Halasyamani, the chief medical officer. \"this is a significant shift in the presentation of this fungal infection, and quite concerning, \" she said. \"an epidural abscess is very serious. It's not something we expected. \" she and other experts said they were especially puzzled that the infections could occur even though patients were",

        "summary": "Who drives around with a shirt draped over their windshield? a 19-year-old in michigan did, and now her tale — which includes a chilling warning — has gone viral. Wdaf reports ashley hardacre had just finished up working an evening shift at flint's genesee valley center on thursday and had gotten into her car in the dark parking lot and locked it when she spotted something strange: a blue flannel shirt on her windshield, tucked around a wiper. At first hardacre thought maybe someone had tossed it onto her car \" for some odd reason, \" she explained in a facebook post, so she tried to toss it off by turning on her wipers. When the shirt stubbornly remained, however, hardacre suddenly remembered something that prompted her to do the unexpected: instead of getting out of the car to unravel the shirt from the wiper, she started driving. What came to mind before hardacre hit the gas, she tells cbs news, is something she'd heard from her mom and on social media about tricksters planting things on women's cars to lure them out. She had also noticed two cars near her own as she pondered the mystery shirt, one with its engine running, and she \" immediately felt uneasy, \" she wrote on facebook. Hardacre drove just far enough to where she felt safe, rolled down her window, and pulled the shirt off. \" it had to have been intentional the way it was put on there, \" she says. A flint township police detective saw hardacre's post and got in touch with her, and both cops and mall security are now working to track down the shirt-placer. Hardacre says she hopes her post, which has been shared nearly 103,000 times, will \" inform others. \" ( a detroit victim found her carjackers had been mistakenly let out of prison. )",

Researchers say the patient, who suffered severe brain injuries in a car accident, began tracking objects with his eyes, turning his head toward people speaking to him, and even responding to simple requests after a vagus nerve stimulator was implanted in his chest, the guardian reports. The vagus nerve runs to the brain stem from other parts of the body and it is already stimulated to treat disorders including epilepsy. Neuroscientist angela sirigu, one of the authors of a study published monday in current biology, says the patient also moved his head and shed tears when a favorite song was played, the ap reports. She tells cnn that vagus nerve activity is \" important for arousal, alertness and the fight-or-flight response. \" she says the team chose somebody who had been in a vegetative state for such a long time to show that the signs of consciousness \" could not be the result of chance. \" she says she now plans a larger study to look at ways the new technique can help patients in vegetative states, who number around 50,000 in the us alone.

Among the features being discussed: bendable screens, ceramics to make the phones especially durable, and top-of-the-line photo capabilities. The droid product line would continue separately.

            "All of a sudden, google's expensive motorola purchase is beginning to make sense. Google and motorola are reportedly working on an advanced smartphone, currently codenamed the \"x phone, \" which will serve as a direct competitor to the iphone, the wall street journal reports. Google paid $ 12.5 billion for motorola last year, and while it seemed obvious that moto would serve as a key way for google to build its very own smartphone, the only benefit from the deal so far has been plenty of new patents. Sources tell the wsj that motorola will also continue to work on its our droid lineup of android phones, and that the company will also work on an \"x tablet \" once the x phone is completed sometime next year. Google already works directly with device makers for its nexus lineup of smartphone and tablets, but with x phone it would have direct control over the manufacturing and design process. Of course, this will raise hell for google with other android makers, in particular samsung. The news doesn't come as much of a surprise — even microsoft is reportedly working on a \"surface \" phone of its own. In the end, both google and microsoft can only go so far when dealing with other phone manufacturers. For them to truly rival the iphone, they will need to build their own devices. Google finally sold its motorola home division, which was responsible for cable set-top boxes, a few days ago to arris for $ 2.35 billion. The x phone team is being led by lor ron, a former google product manager who focused on mapping. Motorola has reportedly been looking into implementing new technologies like bendable screens and ceramic material to make the phone stronger, though it's had trouble with implementing both of those. The company was also aiming to include a better quality camera and the ability to take a panoramic picture, only to find that the iphone ( and plenty of other android phones ) have already implemented the latter feature. Motorola mobility ceo dennis woodside wouldn't discuss products under development with the wsj, but he noted that the company is \"investing in a team and a technology that will do something quite different than the current approaches. \" photo: devindra hardawar/venturebeat"

It's \" almost like reverse product placement, \" anselmo ramos, the chief creative officer and founder of david, tells adweek.

        "summary": "Following deliberations that pointed to a divided supreme court, justices will hand down a decision on obamacare's contraception mandate today around 10am, politico reports. Americans appear to favor the government in the matter: just 35 % agree with the idea that employers'religious beliefs should play a role in determining contraceptive coverage, a reuters poll finds. Some 53 % disagree. Of course, what really matters is what the court thinks — and according to newsweek, experts believe it's leaning toward favoring hobby lobby, the company leading the charge against the mandate. Still, the court could label the mandate a tax, hearkening back to its earlier ruling on the individual mandate. As for the justices themselves, ruth bader ginsburg, elena kagan, and sonia sotomayor appear to be on the administration's side, while samuel alito, clarence thomas, and antonin scalia seem to favor hobby lobby, politico reports. As for the other justices: in earlier arguments, anthony kennedy seemed to see both sides of the story. But politico believes his swing vote is more likely to back the company and its allies. Stephen breyer repeatedly said during arguments that his questions came from \" no point of view at all, \" but he wondered if there might be a \" less restrictive way \" to fund contraception via the government. Hard to say how he ' ll vote, politico notes. Finally, chief justice john roberts looks likely to write the majority opinion, and he seems to back hobby lobby, too. He may, however, restrict his decision to protecting the religious beliefs of \" closely held \" companies whose bosses ' views are bound up in the business.",

The draft report issued late this afternoon does not give president obama a clear yes-or-no recommendation on whether the project should move forward, but it generally plays down the environmental risks of the 1,700-mile pipeline from canada, reports usa today. The newspaper calls it a \" largely positive \" review. For example, the state department's assessment says canada is going to develop its tar sands whether this pipeline happens or not, meaning it wouldn't make a big difference on climate change if it got rejected. \" approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands, or on the amount of heavy crude oil refined in the gulf coast area, \" says the lengthy report. It also states that it sees \" no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed project route. \" sample criticism, from activist bill mckibben of 350.org: \" we're hearing the same rehashed arguments from the state [ department ] about why a great threat to the climate is not a threat at all. \" the review now gets a 45-day period for public comment. The wall street journal points out that backers of the pipeline seem pretty happy with the report, with an exec at the american petroleum institute calling the project \" one step closer to reality. \" president obama is expected to make his final decision sometime this summer.",

Norishige kanai has exceeded the typical growth of roughly 0.75 inches to 2.0 inches ( as this famed us astronaut did ), saying he has instead grown 3.5 inches since reaching the international space station in mid-december. \" i grew like some plant in just three weeks.

The bbc explains the soyuz spacecraft, which shuttles astronauts to and from earth, does have a height limit, which the washington post reports is 6 feet, 3 inches.

The wall street journal notes the deal is valued at $ 400 million, as gannett would be acquiring tribune's debt. Gannett ceo robert dickey says that after making the offer he communicated with tribune ceo justin dearborn and chair michael ferro via phone. But after what dickey frames as \" tribune's continued refusal to begin constructive discussions with us, \" gannett went public with the proposal. \" what we're hoping for is to sit down with tribune's board and work out a transaction, \" says dickey. What that transaction would mean: joining usa today and 107 local outlets ( the detroit free press, milwaukee journal sentinel, arizona republic, etc. ), would be 11 dailies, chief among them the los angeles times, chicago tribune, and baltimore sun. Tribune \" fills a number of geographical gaps for us, \" dickey says. Gannett thinks it could shave $ 50 million in costs due to overlaps, though dickey says editorial wouldn't be slashed.

And doctors say use is lower in many countries where cost is more of an issue. In the united states, perjeta costs about $ 5,900 a month and herceptin about $ 5,300 a month, mr. Lang said.

            "A new but very expensive breast cancer drug has shown \"unprecedented \" benefits in extending the lives of women with an aggressive form of the disease. Data released by the pharmaceutical company roche suggests perjeta could, in combination with other drugs, increase the survival of women with advanced breast cancer by 15 months. The results will raise the stakes in the battle in the uk over the funding of cancer drugs. Perjeta was turned down in principle by the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) for routine nhs use last year, but women can obtain it if their doctor applies to the cancer drugs fund, set up by the government to take the political",
            "First-line treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved overall survival in the cleopatra study, first-line treatment with pertuzumab/trastuzumab/docetaxel significantly improved overall survival ( os ) for patients with her2-positive metastatic breast cancer compared with placebo/trastuzumab/docetaxel, providing a 15.7 month increase in the median values. The median os of 56.5 months is unprecedented in first-line and this substantial improvement confirms the pertuzumab containing regimen as standard of care in this setting, reported prof. Sandra swain of the medstar washington hospital center, washington cancer institute, washington, usa during the presidential symposium 1 at esmo congress 2014 in madrid, spain. In the cleopatra study, 808 patients from 25 countries with her2-positive metastatic breast cancer were",
            "In madrid today, researchers presented new findings on the effectiveness of perjeta ( pertuzumab, roche ), a monoclonal antibody used in combination with other drugs to treat some types of breast cancer. The updated report on the cleopatra trial supports that adding perjeta to herceptin and chemotherapy significantly extends survival in patients with her2-overexpressing ( her2+ ) metastatic breast cancer. The international randomized trial, funded by roche, included over 800 women with advanced her2+ disease. The study participants all took herceptin ( trastuzumab, an antibody ) and docetaxel ( a chemotherapy, usually sold as taxotere ) and, based on the randomization, also received infusions of perjeta or a placebo. Overall survival among"
