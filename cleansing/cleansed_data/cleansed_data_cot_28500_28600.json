The woman appeared to be seriously wounded by gunfire. ( update: the driver has died. ) whatever happened started near the white house. Cnn says police stopped the car there, or tried to, but the female driver sped off toward the capitol, setting off the police chase.

Gerry connolly, who heard the gunfire while standing on a capitol balcony, reports the washington post. \"that's when we saw people fleeing, and we realized this was no fireworks. It sounded liked the first volley of a 21-gun salute. \" it now appears that all the gunfire came from police.

        "summary": "A team doctor who allegedly molested athletes; coaches who reportedly knew but turned a blind eye. It's not the story of michigan state university and larry nassar but that of ohio state — and the allegations are touching a \" powerful \" republican congressman. Nbc news on tuesday reported on claims from three former wrestlers who say the late dr. Richard strauss molested players during his tenure with the team from the mid- ' 70s to late ' 90s — and that ohio rep. Jim jordan, the team's assistant wrestling coach for the 1986 to 1994 period, knew. Jordan denied being aware of the abuse claims several months ago ( the university said in april it was investigating ) and repeated that denial tuesday. But those nbc news spoke with say that just isn't so. More: former wrestler dunyasha yetts says he went straight to jordan after strauss began to remove his wrestling shorts when he sought help for a thumb injury. He said jordan and then-head coach russ hellickson spoke with strauss, who the new york times reports committed suicide in 2005. Yetts says it was far from the only discussion players had with jordan, and that it was commonly known strauss showered with players though he didn't work out. Mike disabato, another player who spoke with nbc news, got detailed in an interview with cnn: \" i never saw doc strauss... Where he didn't ask me to — where i went to see him for medicine or whatever, finger injury, shoulder, knee — where he did not want to examine my testicles. He groped. Every time. If you wanted your meds, if you wanted to stay healthy... So that you could stay on scholarship, you grinned and beared it, so to speak. \" cnn says male members from 14 of the university's sports teams — among them baseball, fencing, football, swimming, and track — have levied allegations against strauss per ohio state. Some 150 people have been interviewed as part of the probe. What a rep for jordan had to say after nbc news published its article: \" congressman jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at ohio state. He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask because, if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice. \" the columbus dispatch quotes a written statement from porter wright morris &amp; arthur attorney kathleen trafford as saying jordan was contacted by phone and email but did not respond to the interview requests.",

        "summary": "\" these findings worry us. \" that from the head of a new study out of johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health suggests fracking could bring radon to the surface — raising levels of the odorless toxic gas in our homes. The researchers looked specifically at 860,000 readings taken in pennsylvania homes, using a state database that covers 1987 to 2013. What they found per their study, published in environmental health perspectives: \" basement radon concentrations fluctuated \" during that period, \" but began an upward trend from 2004-2012 in all county categories, higher levels in counties with ≥100 drilled wells vs. Counties with none. \" that roughly coincides with when fracking began in the state: between 2005 and 2013, 7,469 unconventional wells that use fracking to extract natural gas from shale were drilled there. A press release notes that homes and buildings in the rural and suburban areas where most unconventional natural gas wells are located had a 39 % higher concentration of radon than their urban counterparts. The study doesn't pinpoint how the excess radiation got in; study author joan a. Casey suggests one of three ways: via well water that's been affected by fracking, from air around the wells, or through the natural gas produced by these wells and used in homes. Still, usa today notes that the study doesn't \" conclusively prove \" that fracking lets radon loose in the first place. As for why pennsylvania, the authors studied it in part because it has one of america's highest residential radon levels; the state sits on bedrock that contains radium, which degrades into radon, the second-leading cause of lung cancer worldwide.",

But when it happened last october, the head was nowhere to be found — and with a replacement statue of the baby being held by mary estimated to cost between $ 6,000 and $ 10,000, priest gerard lajeunesse didn't think the statue would get a revamp this time around, cbc news reports. That's when heather wise, a local artist who noticed the decapitated statue, stepped forward to offer her services to anne des pins church, reports sudbury.com. For now, she has created a reddish-orange terra-cotta replacement noggin, and it's causing a whole lot of double-takes. \" it really is shocking to the eyes because of the big contrast in color, \" lajeunesse muses to the cbc, noting that the head is just \" temporary \" until a stone head can be acquired. That needs to be soon, as the clay head is already eroding from being exposed to the elements. Still, despite the complaints about baby jesus ' makeover — the guardian notes comparisons to maggie simpson — lajeunesse says he's grateful to wise, who hopes to offer a permanent stone replacement by the spring. \" it's a first try. … and hopefully what is done at the end will please everyone, \" he tells the cbc, adding, \" i wasn't trained for this in seminary. \" ( no one wanted this \" homeless jesus \" sculpture. )",

        "summary": "In what the new york times called the \" lawsuit of the ages \" when it was first filed two years ago, a new development is making the case even juicier with \" smoking-gun evidence \" that one of the world's most popular songs is in fact in the public domain, reports the hollywood reporter. Documentary filmmaker jennifer nelson, who had to pay warner/chappell a $ 1,500 licensing fee to use the \" happy birthday \" song in her film — which happens to be about the song itself — says her legal team has found proof in a 1927 children's songbook that warner/chappell handed over earlier this month as part of \" approximately 200 pages of documents [ warner/chappell ] claim were ' mistakenly ' not produced during discovery \" last year, her lawyers write. ( the full legal doc is in pdf form on scribd. ) the 1927 songbook was published eight years before warner/chappell's 1935 copyright. It included two songs, \" good morning \" and \" happy birthday, \" both of whose lyrics were written by patty hill and set to the tune of \" good morning to you, \" which was composed in the 1800s. The birthday song even appeared in earlier editions of the book dating back to 1922. Unlike other songs in the book, it was printed without a copyright notice, but rather with a blurred line reading, \" special permission through courtesy of the clayton f. Summy co. \" ( apparently this was the only line in the entire book that was blurred. ) this notice is key because, under the 1909 copyright act in place at the time, any songs published without copyright were interjected \" irrevocably \" into the public domain, reports ars technica. If there was a 1922 copyright it would have expired in 1949, and even if it was renewed it would have expired again at the end of 1997. Warner/chappell, which makes $ 2 million a year on licensing fees alone for the song, has yet to respond to the motion, and a hearing is scheduled for today.",

Others have been using the 2000 election as an example of a candidate who wouldn't accept results, but philip bump at the washington post writes that the situations were different. \" gore's fight was a fight over counting ballots, not over an allegation that the election itself was unfair, \" he writes. Yes, gore recanted his election night concession, but that was because the counting process was in chaos. Once the supreme court weighed in, he ended the fight. And in his subsequent concession speech, gore was civil and congenial, saying that in past in contested elections, \" both the victor and the vanquished have accepted the result peacefully, and in the spirit of reconciliation.

( associated press ) everything was fairly normal in the 2000 presidential election until about 10 p.m. Eastern on election day. Television networks had called the state of florida for vice president al gore, a critical win that seemed to pave his path to the presidency. Results in other states hinted at a close race; gore's florida win slotted a critically large chunk of electoral votes into his column. But about 10 p.m., those electoral votes were wrenched back out. The initial calls for florida had been premature, based on exit polling in a stunningly close contest that was undercut as the votes were counted. The final official margin of victory in the state was 537 votes, 0.009 percent of the nearly 6 million cast. It was a close enough race that guessing the winner from exit polling amounted to a coin toss as it turned out, and the networks had guessed wrong. The toss-up state was once again a toss-up. This was the first moment at which the 2000 election really got weird, as votes were counted and it became apparent that the result in a critically important state might be in flux. The situation 16 years ago was entirely different from the situation now, a situation in which republican nominee donald trump said during the third presidential debate that he would not necessarily concede the race if he lost, and that he would keep the country in \"suspense. \" as is often the case when trump says controversial things, his supporters have seized on a nonequivalent scenario in his defense.

        "summary": "Now the world can finally get a good look at one of the ocean's more mysterious creatures, the oarfish, believed to be the longest bony fish in existence — basically, the longest fish that's not a ray or shark, livescience reports. While researchers were investigating the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2011, their camera came upon the fish. The result is the longest and highest-quality video of the species yet, says one of the scientists behind the video, which was posted online in tandem with a new paper last week. Described as \" shimmering \" and \" alien-looking \" by the los angeles times, the oarfish in the video measures 8 feet, though the creatures may grow six times that long. Part of their mystery is due to their habitat: far offshore, in deep waters. To wit, this one was swimming well below the surface ( the lat says 200 feet; livescience says it reached depths of 364 feet ). The eel-like fish positions itself vertically: its head is closer to the surface while its body droops below, the lat notes. The video is particularly special because it seems to show a crustacean called a parasitic isopod attached to the fish's dorsal fins, something that's never been recorded before.",

            "Scientists have released video of an 8-foot-long, shimmering oarfish taken about 200 feet below the ocean surface -- and it is breathtaking. Elusive and alien-looking, the oarfish has a thin, eel-like body with squiggly iridescent markings that glow blue in the video. It also has a long dorsal fin that stretches the length of nearly half its body, and large round eyes rimmed in silver. That bright white blob you see in the fish's spiny dorsal fins is a parasitic isopod -- sort of like an ocean version of the roly poly bug -- that has attached itself to the fish. It is a common parasite of marine fish, but it is the first time one has been seen on an oarfish, said mark benfield, a marine biologist at louisiana state university. Benfield is the lead author of a paper describing the oarfish video, published in a recent issue of the journal of fish biology.

Anthony burgess, 24, died sunday while attempting to rescue his 3-year-old daughter from a pontiac g6 that hold rolled backward into an indianapolis pond. Police say the child accidentally hit the gear shift, putting the car into neutral. The star reports burgess had parked at the core riverbend apartments so he could talk to a friend; the girl started to get out of the car, and burgess told her to get back inside. She apparently knocked the gear shift while climbing across the front seat, wibc reports. After the men observed the car rolling they both jumped into the 35-degree water, though neither could swim. The cold forced the friend back, but burgess managed to get the girl out and pass her to a bystander who had also jumped in. Then burgess disappeared below the surface. Fox59 reports he was in the water at least 19 minutes before being pulled out; he died sunday night. The child was on monday upgraded to stable condition. The car was retrieved from the pond that same day, some 50 feet from shore in water 25 feet deep.",

It was not clear if the 20-year-old had escaped or been released by the militants after she was found \" heavily traumatized and not very stable \" near the town of mubi in adamawa state, police spokesman emmanuel ojukwu told nbc news. Ojukwu said the woman was identified as one the nearly 300 schoolgirls abducted from their dorm in chibok by the al qaeda-linked sect boko haram in april.

The list, seen by the telegraph, includes a former spokesman for the group, abu qaqa, and a spiritual advisor, mallam bashir. But it consists mainly of mid-level field commanders rather than senior leaders - a sign, sources say, that the group is now trying to offer \" realistic \" terms that it believes the nigerian government will be tempted to accept. The islamist group has also drawn up a list of schoolgirls that it is willing to hand over in exchange - ten of them christians",
            "One of the school students snatched by boko haram when they raided a nigerian dormitory has been found wandering through a small north-eastern village, the first confirmed escape since the atrocity that shocked the world in april this year. Of the almost 300 girls and young women rounded up and carted away after boko haram stormed chibok secondary school, a handful fled during the initial confusion. A relentless string of attacks in remote northern towns in boko haram's stronghold of borno state prompted a summit in paris that led to a renewed military push from nigeria, neighbours chad, cameroon and niger, and western allies including the us and the uk.

The spree continued monday with the couple allegedly robbing a georgia gas station and briefly kidnapping its cashier.

The 71-year-old died july 10 from a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria vibrio vulnificus, reports the south florida sun-sentinel. Though such infections are rare — only about 205 us cases per year, according to the cdc — the florida department of health notes that exposure is most common from may to october, when the saltwater the bacteria inhabits is warmest. The bacteria can enter the body through open wounds and cause a skin infection, though health official michael drennon tells fox 13 those who consume the bacteria usually display gastrointestinal symptoms. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and rapid breathing are among possible reactions. It's unclear what symptoms presented in this case, but officials say other ailments contributed to the man's death. There have been three confirmed deaths in 16 cases of vibrio vulnificus infections in florida so far this year, per wfts. The infection can lead to amputations, carries a fatality rate of up to 30 % and, despite rumors, can't be killed with lemon juice, alcohol, or hot sauce, reports the sarasota herald-tribune. In a similar case, cnn reported last week that a new jersey man was at risk of dying after being infected by vibrio vulnificus while river fishing for crabs.

Both times, police noted that fellow gamers seemed blasé about the death, continuing to play even as investigators gathered evidence. Only with the arrival of investigators \" did the other patrons realize that someone had died, but they still showed no concern and kept playing their games.

        "summary": "The biggest reason people skip out on going to the dentist isn't fear or inconvenience; it's cost, kidy reports. A study published this month in health affairs found people are more likely to forego dental health because of cost than any other type of health care. And that's a problem because avoiding dental care can have other health repercussions down the road, according to health central. Healthday news reports the study found that 13 % of working-age adults don't go to the dentist because of the cost. And nearly 25 % of low-income adults are dissuaded from the dentist by cost. Cost is more than three times more likely than fear to be the reason people skip the dentist. In fact, cost is the main reason for not seeing a dentist even among people who have private dental insurance. Study author marko vujicic points to maximum benefit limits and high co-pays in most dental coverage as the culprit. \" anything beyond checkups, like getting a cavity filled or a root canal and a crown, you're looking right away at 20 % to 50 % coinsurance, \" he says. Fillings can cost more than $ 600 and crowns more than $ 1,400. In 2015, 40 % of dental care costs were paid out of pocket; that's compared to just 11 % of total health care costs. \" it seems like medical insurance is doing a better job at protecting consumers from financial hardship than dental insurance, \" vujicic says. The study shows it may be time for dental insurance to move away from a \" pay per procedure \" model. ( studies show flossing likely a waste of time. )",

Bhargava tells the afp he's trying to raise awareness of domestic abuse that can plague women in rural areas. \" women say whenever their husbands get drunk they become violent, \" he explains. \" their savings are taken away and splurged on liquor. \" he told the brides they could also use the bats against other drunk family members, the hindustan times reports.

        "summary": "A popular new york city restaurateur is eliminating tipping in all 13 of his restaurants starting in november in the hopes of changing the american dining experience as a whole, the atlantic reports. Danny meyer says he's making the change to offer more competitive wages and even things out for cooks, dishwashers, and others who are legally prohibited from sharing in tips. \" we will now have the ability to compensate all of our employees equitably, competitively, and professionally, \" meyer said in a press release wednesday. \" and by eliminating tipping, our employees who want to grow financially and professionally will be able to earn those opportunities based on the merit of their work. \" eater reports it's the first time no tipping will be the standard policy of a major us restaurant group. Waiters on average make more than mid-level line cooks despite a lower hourly wage thanks to tipping, especially at the fancier new york restaurants, eater reports. Meyer says this is partially responsible for a shortage of talented cooks willing to start their careers in expensive new york city. He's hopes eliminating tips and increasing wages will change that. \" i hate those saturday nights where the whole dining room is high-fiving because they just set a record, and they're counting their shekels, and the kitchen just says, 'well boy, did we sweat tonight, ' \" he tells eater. In his press release, meyer says prices at his restaurants won't change \" much. \" but eater reports an \" across-the-board increase in prices \" of 21 % to 25 %. Meyer is banking on diners remembering they would have tipped nearly that much anyway.",

            "Is it a good thing that tipping is customary? many say it doesn't make sense, that it's not consistent across customers because people have different conceptions of how to do it correctly, that it's a bizarre tradition, and research indicates that it can be discriminatory against african americans. On the other hand, tipping is incentive for a server to do a good job. ( which prompts the usual counterargument: research has found that people often tip even when their servers do a bad job. ) calls to abolish tipping abound, and at least a few restaurants in the u.s. Have opted out of the tradition.

        "summary": "As of tuesday, tv viewers in the uk can no longer get their sean hannity fix. Per the bbc, 21st century fox announced it has pulled its news feed from uk broadcaster sky in a deal it says is no longer in the company's \"commercial interest. \" the reason? no one's watching. A company spokesperson cited fox news'dismal ratings directly for the move: \" fox news is focused on the us market and designed for a us audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the uk. \" one source told the bbc that sky received about 2,000 fox news viewers per day. But data from the broadcaster's audience research board suggests that its uk audience is much higher, averaging up to 60,000 viewers daily in 2017. There's speculation over whether 21st century fox owner rupert murdoch's bid to buy sky has influenced the decision. ( 21st century fox already owns a 39 % stake in the broadcaster. ) as the guardian puts it, \" fox news has become increasingly troublesome for the murdochs as they attempt to buy sky, \" and those troubles could threaten the takeover bid. Issues related to fox news have been the center of multiple rulings from ofcom, the uk media regulator, and then there's the negative press regarding the network's sexual harassment scandal. Though 21st century fox denies it, critics like former labour leader ed miliband view the decision as an attempt to distance the company from those controversies. Adds labour mp tom watson, \" fox news has breached ofcom's rules over and over again, so 21st century fox clearly thought it was easier to pull it from the uk altogether than to clean up its act. \"",

Ankhesenamun was tut's teenage bride and half-sister, international business times reports. Shortly after tut's death in 1323bc, ankhesenamun married ay. But their marriage marks her last appearance in historical records. She's also absent from ay's tomb, where another wife's name appears.

        "summary": "What appeared to be a straightforward suicide case morphed into what's been called \" one of northeast ohio's biggest mysteries, \" involving a long-dead boy, identity theft, and a war hero turned deadbeat dad. Now, per the plain dealer, the cold case has been ( somewhat ) solved, largely thanks to peter elliott, a persistent us marshal who discovered joseph newton chandler iii's real identity. After the man known as chandler killed himself in eastlake in 2002, the first oddity cropped up: it was found his identity had been lifted from an 8-year-old oklahoma boy who'd died in a 1945 texas car crash. A full probe ensued, with mostly dead ends until 2014, when elliott came on board. Meticulous sleuthing and dna evidence ( the washington post goes into deeper detail on that ) finally made a match: the dead man was indiana's robert ivan nichols, a decorated wwii hero who'd left his wife and sons in 1964. But that was only the first piece of the puzzle. Elliott found one of nichols'sons, phil, living in cincinnati, and phil reveals his father's strange past, including his aloofness from his family, \" loner \" tendencies, and the cryptic statement he made when he ditched the family: \" in due time, you ' ll know why. \" the last correspondence phil received from his father was in 1965, and it was an envelope with no note and a single penny inside. Meanwhile, elliott is convinced there's more still to be found out about nichols — and even thinks there's a chance he could be the long-sought-after zodiac killer. \" the first part of the mystery is solved, \" elliott says, per the post. \" let's figure out the rest of the story. \" phil nichols, meanwhile, says he holds \" no animosity \" toward his dad. \" i always hoped he found a happy life, \" he said, per oxygen.

U.s.

But it was her backstage comments that caught the attention of the hollywood reporter, which noted soloway turned to the topic of donald trump and how she thinks he's \" otherizing people \" and is a \" complete dangerous monster. \" leslie jones spiced up what's usually the most boring moment of the awards show: the salute to ernst &amp; young's accountants. \" since you good at keeping things safe, i got a job for you — my twitter account, \" jones told the company's trio of reps, per the ap, referring to the recent abuse and harassment she's dealt with online. \" put that in the vault, please. \" check out all of the night's winners.",

Lead researcher adam frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the university of rochester, says that even if civilization arose on just one in a trillion planets, which he calls a very pessimistic estimate, there would have been more than 10 billion civilizations since the universe began, reports livescience. Frank, who estimates the odds of us being the first technological civilization to arise are in the neighborhood of one in 10 billion trillion, calls his calculations the \" archaeological form \" of the drake equation, since billions of other intelligent species have presumably become extinct over the universe's 13 billion-year history, discovery reports.

Parts of the tihange nuclear plant 43 miles from aachen are more than 40 years old, deutsche welle reports. Reactors at the plant have been shut down repeatedly recently due to water leaks and micro-cracks. \" for more than two years we've been worried about the reactor cracks getting bigger — the population has been very worried, \" a city spokesperson tells the bbc. Belgium's federal nuclear agency says international experts don't believe tihange is in danger of leaking radiation. Iodine can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer after the release of radiation. Tablets are usually stored in a central location and distributed in the case of an emergency. But aachen officials argued the city is so close to tihange there wouldn't be time to get iodine to everyone if a disaster occurred. An expert on reactor safety tells deutsche welle he believes the danger posed by tihange is being blown out of proportion, but anyone concerned enough to get iodine tablets ahead of time should also stock up on water, food, vitamins, and material to seal doors and windows. Residents under 46 years old have until nov. 15 to apply online for free iodine tablets, which they can pick up at area pharmacies, the ap reports.

        "summary": "It's a most personal subject: the number of people you've slept with. Here are five ways to see if your number of partners is \" normal. \" use slate's new interactive calculator. It aims to tell you if the number of people you've slept with is \" a lot. \" you plug in your age, gender, and the number of sex partners you've had since the age of 18, and, voila, you ' ll see where you \" stack up \" against the rest of the population. The questionnaire is short and sweet, letting people decide on their own what to define as a sexual encounter. Calculate your number here. Compare your college self to a harvard student: as it does annually, the harvard crimson surveyed the school's graduating seniors, and found the following: 58 % started their freshman year as a virgin; 21 % had sex for the first time as a freshman, and 24 % had no sex while at harvard. As for the number of partners, 19 % of men and 7 % of women had 10 or more during their college career. Check out your generation's average: a recent study in the archives of sexual behavior crunched 40 years of sexual data from more than 33,000 americans. It projects that millennials — those born between 1982 and 1999 — will have sex with about eight different partners in their lifetime, behind gen xers with 10, and baby boomers with 12. Consult the cdc: it's a little outdated, but its website shares data from the national health statistics report published in 2012, including the \" number of sexual partners in the past 12 months. \" the most recent range specified is 2006-2010. Men had an average of 3.9 to women's 1.8; partners with whom the respondent had vaginal, oral, or anal sex were counted. Look at this chart: the 2010 national survey of sexual health and behavior, which was conducted by indiana university researchers, was self-described as \" one of the most comprehensive \" sex studies \" in almost two decades. \" it looked at the sex habits of 5,865 people ages 14 to 94 to come up with this chart. While it doesn't specify the number of sex partners, you ' ll get another sense of where you rank. It shows the percentage of men and women who reported engaging in one of nine sexual behaviors in the previous year. In other sex news, researchers have determined the most dangerous sex position.",

A magistrate judge is recommending the suit against the police be tossed due to local regulations, but kktv reports the suit \" gives insights \" into what saxton thinks transpired.

Lucas asked her to meet on a street near his grandmother's house; a half hour later, she wrote: \" where are you... I've been here for over an hour just waiting. \" she was never heard from again. Later that morning lucas withdrew $ 400 from an atm in schelling's car using her card. He was also filmed driving her car to the walmart parking lot; on feb. 7, a hooded figure drove off in the car, which was ultimately found at a hospital. Lucas says he did meet schelling, that she accompanied him to the bank ( surveillance video doesn't back this up ) and that he left her at walmart. Police say lucas remains a person of interest, and the help find kelsie site shares a january 2014 press release from the pueblo pd that says they will \" continue to look at every lead, \" but adds that they \" do not use unlawful methods to solve a case. \" ( this pregnant woman's disappearance proved more mysterious once she was found. )",

Sounds dire, but noah feldman at bloomberg thinks reaction like this is overblown. What's happening isn't a coup or unconstitutional, he writes. \" what the writer describes is a lot like what happens in many, probably most administrations: officials who share some but not all the president's goals use bureaucratic tools to avoid or delay implementing presidential initiatives they don't like. \" the only thing different about the op-ed is that it reflects a \" depth of contempt \" for trump that appears to be far greater than that toward any modern president, writes feldman. \" it's all pretty normal — except for the tone, the bombast and the contempt. \" ( is the use of the word \" lodestar \" in the op-ed a clue? )",

Here are six things you need to know about her life, her work, and the legacy she leaves behind: allen breed at the ap writes about how lee turning down his request for an interview was the \" politest rejection \" he ever received. \" i simply don't give interviews — i gave all my publisher and the movie people asked me to give long ago ( before you were born ), and that was it, \" part of her response to him reads. Meanwhile, slate examines how the publishing of the to kill a mockingbird sequel go set a watchman in 2015 complicated lee's legacy by tarnishing that of the hero atticus finch. \" it was all sad, and — here is the funny, almost unearthly, part — all utterly of a piece with lee's philosophy as a writer, \" slate writes of the response to the followup novel. Abc news profiles lee's friendship, starting in childhood, with another great american writer, truman capote. \" in addition to sharing a love of reading and active imaginations … they both felt left out of the rest of their worlds in different ways. \" the guardian has a roundup of tributes to lee from authors, celebrities, and more. \" what that one story did, more powerfully than one hundred speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw ourselves, \" the obama family said in a statement. While mashable rounds up the many memorable lines from to kill a mockingbird that still offer wisdom today. \" sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hands of another, \" for example. Finally, today lets you take a look at lee's life in photos.",

Wells fargo bank was owed the money from a 2006 loan and submitted the winning — and only bid — for the 1.1 million-square-foot galleria at pittsburgh mills on wednesday, the ap reports. The bank was acting as trustee for msci 2007 hq11, the trust that bought the mall in suburban frazer township. Wells fargo foreclosed last year on the mall, which opened in 2005. The mall once was worth $ 190 million but recently was appraised at just $ 11 million and is slightly more than half occupied. Analysts say that in this kind of \" consensual foreclosure \" situation, it's normal for there to be no other bidders. Steve jellinek at morningstar credit ratings tells the pittsburgh post-gazette that regional malls are struggling and lenders may find it difficult to minimize their losses. \" the problem of regional malls is the loss severity tends to be higher than ones located in or near big cities, \" jellinek says, adding that it can be hard for malls to recover after they lose big tenants like sears, which left pittsburgh mills in 2014. \" then you see a marked decrease in cash flow and it's harder to repurpose and refill. \" ( there are 484 rooms under an abandoned mall in michigan. )",

The 40-year-old lost her passport on a connecting flight between oman and qatar, and she was sent back to oman instead of being allowed to board her flight to india. Oman refused to readmit her and the various authorities involved are blaming each other for her death, the independent reports. Indian politicians say that airport and airline authorities should have done more to help the stranded woman, while omani officials say the indian embassy failed to act on repeated requests to provide her with a temporary passport. Witnesses say the woman, who was provided with food and bedding, became severely stressed as days at the airport went by and feared she would be there indefinitely, the bbc reports.

You can see it in a 2004 mit study showing that job-seekers with \" white names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews \" than job seekers with comparable resumes and \" african-american-sounding names. \" and you can see it in a news media that looks like an all-white country club and a u.s.

Kellar and burnworth have both been charged in federal court with attempted enticement of a minor and conspiracy to produce child pornography.

Researchers say that, relatively speaking, the hits absorbed by kids as young as 7 have the same impact as those delivered by teens and adults on their own peers, reports the new york times. What's more, the virginia tech-wake forest study found that kids in youth leagues take a lot of hits, with most coming during practice. \"the number of hits and magnitude was a lot higher than people would have estimated, \" says one of the researchers. \" when we present it to the parents, everyone is surprised. \" as a rough estimate among 7- and 8-year-olds, figure nine hits per practice and 11 per game. None of the 19 boys in the study got concussions, but some of the hits were at a level ( 80g of force ) that presents a high risk. The researchers say the results suggest that youth football leagues should ease up on physical contact in practices. In western new york, meanwhile, a high school team has canceled the remainder of its varsity season after one of its players sustained a head injury during a game and died a few days later.

        "summary": "Some potentially unsettling health news for pot smokers: a new study has identified a link between marijuana usage and blood sugar control issues later in life, though there are some caveats and question marks. A press release explains that american researchers arrived at their conclusion using data from the coronary artery risk development in young adults study, which began in 1985 by studying participants between the ages of 18 and 30 and who have now been studied for some 30 years. Study lead michael bancks explains to livescience that prior studies had indicated pot smokers may have a lower rate of diabetes than non-users, but due to those studies'design they couldn't determine whether diabetes came before or after the pot use. The setup of this study, published in diabetologia, changed that, at least in terms of prediabetes. The researchers write that \" occurrence of prediabetes in middle adulthood was significantly elevated for individuals who reported using marijuana in excess of 100 times by young adulthood. \" specifically, among 3,151 participants who were free from prediabetes and diabetes at year 7 ( 1992-1993 ) and had at least one study-related follow-up exam over the next 18 years, individuals who used at least 100 times had a 40 % greater risk for developing prediabetes than those who never used the drug. But the researchers didn't find a link between pot use and full-blown diabetes, and it's \" unclear \" why that's the case, they write. One possibility: \" the effect of marijuana use might have a more noticeable impact on glucose metabolism in the prediabetes range compared with the diabetes range. \" ( here's what marijuana might do to sperm. )",

In the study, researchers found that people who used large amounts of marijuana during young adulthood were 40 percent more likely to develop prediabetes as middle-age adults than those who had never tried the drug. However, marijuana use was not linked to an increased risk of having type 2 diabetes, according to the study, published today ( sept. 13 ) in the journal diabetologia.

Meanwhile, buzzfeed has dug up a number of examples of bloomberg apparently pointing out that he's jewish to attract the jewish vote, including an eight-page glossy brochure he sent out in 2005 promoting \" mike the mensch, \" with photos of him wearing a yarmulke and a headline that reads \" orthodox jewish families a priority for bloomberg. \"",

That's the takeaway from a new jama assessment of 79 studies involving nearly 6,500 people that found little evidence the drug helps patients, including those suffering from depression and glaucoma, the ap and livescience report. The strongest evidence of marijuana's positive effects came in those with chronic nerve or cancer pain. Patients who took cannabinoids like thc or cbd were 40 % more likely to see at least a 30 % reduction in pain compared to those using a placebo. Positive effects were also seen in those with muscle stiffness related to multiple sclerosis and in chemotherapy patients dealing with nausea and vomiting, but that's not to say that marijuana treats those conditions only or at all, adds reuters. Some researchers argue too little is known about marijuana's potential benefits because research is often hindered by governments against its use. The studies that do exist tend to be small and based on \" low-quality scientific evidence, anecdotal reports, individual testimonials, legislative initiatives, and public opinion, \" the study authors say. \" imagine if other drugs were approved through a similar approach. \" however, the department of health announced yesterday that it will eliminate a federal public health service review of research proposals, which could allow more privately funded medical marijuana research. Colorado has also pledged some $ 8 million to explore pot's potential benefits, including possible effects on veterans suffering from ptsd. \" it's not a wonder drug but it certainly has some potential, \" a researcher says.
