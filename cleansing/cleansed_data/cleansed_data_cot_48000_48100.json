Though his locked vehicle was found two days later, on july 10, parked near a hiking trail in bear mountain state park, there has been no trace of the father of two daughters since then, reports the times herald-record. And so daughter suzanne locascio has put wedding planning on the back burner amid the search for the man described as a \" doting \" father. \" he was so excited, \" his wife, barbara locascio, tells cbs new york. \" we talked about what song he would dance to with her. \" friends with raymond since kindergarten, barbara says her husband suffers from diabetes and doesn't travel with his meds, and that disorientation is far likelier than suicide or foul play. \" he hadn't had lunch, \" she says. \" he works crazy hours.

Buzzfeed reports the 47-year-old has had police protection since 2011 and was two years later added to al-qaeda's most wanted list. In a 2012 interview with der spiegel, he had this to say: \" if we worried about the consequences of each of our drawings in each of our 1,057 issues, then we would have had to close shop a long time ago.... A drawing has never killed anyone. \" as for his own safety, he said, \" i have neither a wife nor children, not even a dog. But i ' m not going to hide. \" more: the other dead cartoonists are jean cabut, or cabu, who has published cartoons in france for 60 years; georges wolinski, 80; and bernard verlhac, or tignous, 57. The fifth journalist to be named is bernard maris, a 68-year-old economics professor who was the magazine's deputy editor, reports the guardian. The wall street journal and the bbc report several of the dead were thought to have been in an editorial meeting when the attack occurred. Footage aired by french tv captures two masked attackers shouting, in french, \" we have avenged prophet muhammad. We have killed charlie hebdo. \" the guardian has graphic video of two gunmen shooting a police officer. Though the magazine's website was down for a period, it's now online and bears a single image with a phrase trending on social media: \" je suis charlie \" ( \" i am charlie \" ). John kerry said as much today: \" each and every american stands with you today. Not just in horror or in anger or outrage... But we stand with you in solidarity. \" the week rounds up some reactions to the tragedy from cartoonists around the world who have responded in their best way: via cartoon.

        "summary": "The united states postal service's money woes just got $ 3.5 million worse, and the statue of liberty is to blame. A judge ruled last week that the agency did commit copyright infringement when it used an image of robert s. Davidson's statue of liberty on a stamp it issued in 2011. The lady liberty that towers over new york harbor was designed by french sculptor frédéric auguste bartholdi; davidson's replica stands before the new york-new york hotel &amp; casino in las vegas, reports fast company. The washington post ( which has an image of the stamp ) in december 2013 reported that the usps had obtained the image from getty images but didn't also seek permission from davidson, likely because the usps assumed what it was using was in the public domain. Not so. A stamp collector had identified the mix-up in 2011, and the usps was made aware — but then it printed another 1.13 billion of the stamps on top of the 3.5 billion it had already made, reported artsy in 2017. As such, the suit claimed the infringement was knowingly committed. Identical copies of works in the public domain ( which the statue is ) aren't covered by copyright infringement protections. But davidson argued in his suit that he wasn't trying to create a replica but rather to craft a fresher, more feminine version. Per the ruling, \" he envisioned his mother-in-law as inspiration... And viewed her picture every night during the construction of the face of the statue. \" the judge ruled the \" plaintiff succeeded in making the statue his own creation, particularly the face. \" the amount owed: $ 3,554,946.95 in royalties, plus interest.

Such changes mean those elements of the sculpture are copyrighted and their use by the usps entitles him to damages, davidson argues.

Bruggink of the united states court of federal claims, which hears lawsuits brought against the federal government, rejected davidson's motion to end the case in his favor before trial.

Davidson made a replica of the statue of liberty that lives in front of the new york-new york hotel &amp; casino in las vegas. When the usps came out with a new stamp in 2011, some experts noticed that the image used seemed to be of davidson's hotel piece and not of the actual statue of liberty. The post office even owned up to the mistake. Davidson subsequently sued the post office, claiming that his piece of art was unique and different from the original statue of liberty. And a judge agreed. \"we are satisfied that plaintiff succeeded in making the statue his own creation, particularly the face, \" the judge declared last week. \"a comparison of the two faces unmistakably shows that they are different. \" the ruling goes on, \"having determined that the face of plaintiff's"

It turns out, however, it was actually a picture of a sculptor's version of the statue of liberty. Because of this technicality, a judge just ruled that the usps owes this sculptor millions of dollars. First, a little background. Robert s. Davidson made a replica of the statue of liberty that lives in front of the new york-new york hotel &amp; casino in las vegas. When the usps came out with a new stamp in 2011, some experts noticed that the image used seemed to be of davidson's hotel piece and not of the actual statue of liberty. The post office even owned up to the mistake. Davidson subsequently sued the post office, claiming that his piece of art was unique and different from the original statue of liberty. And a judge agreed. \"we are satisfied that plaintiff succeeded in making the statue his own creation, particularly the face, \" the judge declared last week. \"a comparison of the two faces unmistakably shows that they are different. \" the ruling goes on, \"having determined that the face of plaintiff's"

The prison commissioner in the state, where 155 of some 22,000 inmates had such visits last year, blames budget issues as well as \" the number of babies being born possibly as a result. \" the new york times speaks to the spouses who treasure the time, even if it's brief and less than comfortable. \" it's not romantic, but it doesn't matter, \" says the wife of an arkansas inmate; she drives eight hours to see her husband, who is due for release in 2022. \" obviously they did something wrong.

Today, inmates must be married and have a clean behavior record ( generally no fighting, swearing, etc., in the last six months ) to qualify; they usually have to apply for the visits, which occur only in medium- to lower-security prisons; federal prisons allow no such visits. \" extended family visits \" can last up to 24 hours for well-behaved prisoners nearing release. Mississippi has recently allowed only one-hour visits, the times notes. The visits occur in private apartments inside prison walls, which are usually outfitted with sheets, soap, towels, and condoms. The prison does not provide food. California and new york allow same-sex couples to participate in the practice within marriages or civil unions.

The actors are generally \" stuck in a meh plot \" with \" subpar special effects \" and a clunky script. Plus it takes 90 minutes for the mutants to face off, and then \" the payoff underwhelms. \" the one bonus: \" an awesome synth-pop '80s soundtrack. \" joe morgenstern saw the film in 3d, \" which i wouldn't recommend, but then i wouldn't recommend seeing it in any d, \" he writes at the wall street journal. \" enormous goings on keep going on, and on, in x-men: apocalypse, a collection of explosions, eruptions and conflagrations that suggests the implosion of a franchise, \" he writes. \" this is surprising, as well as disappointing. \" but rafer guzman is more forgiving. \" x-men: apocalypse is definitely one of the series ' weakest entries, but it's far from a total disaster, \" he writes at newsday. At least the mutants aren't fighting aliens but \" an ancient egyptian god nicknamed apocalypse who wakes up in the early 1980s and begins amassing followers to help him ' cleanse'the earth. \" and \" nearly every mutant gets his or her moment. \"",

Her crowdfunding effort on bobbitt's behalf has since surpassed $ 375,000, and the new friends appeared together on good morning america on sunday to talk about everything that's happened since they first met, abc news reports. \" i just got her gas to help her get back on her way, \" bobbitt said. \" i wasn't expecting anything in return. \" wearing sunglasses on gma due to an infection in his eye from wearing his contacts too long on the streets, bobbitt explained it can get \" lonely \" in his situation, but that mcclure and her boyfriend, mark d ' amico, have just treated him \" like a regular person. \" in an interview with the bbc, bobbitt added he's \" blown away \" by the generosity from mcclure, d ' amico, and everyone who's donated. Per gma, bobbitt actually asked the couple at one point to halt the fundraiser, which they did for all of 12 minutes before people insisted they still wanted to donate. Mcclure is arranging to hire a lawyer and financial adviser for bobbitt, who says he plans to offer some of the cash that's come his way to organizations that help people in need. \" everybody out there is facing some kind of struggle, so if i can touch their life, the way mine was touched, [ it'd be ] an amazing feeling, \" he said. \" i want to feel the feeling on the opposite end. \" his sudden windfall will also help him purchase a home, per wqad.

And because \"same-sex marriages \" are clearly contrary to god's plan for the human family, and therefore objectively sinful, catholics should examine their consciences very carefully before deciding whether or not to endorse same-sex relationships or attend same-sex ceremonies, realizing that to do so might harm their relationship with god and cause significant scandal to others.

        "summary": "Residents in louisiana's st. Bernard parish had to deal with a nasty brain-eating amoeba in their water supply last summer — and now the amoeba has made a return appearance. Water in the parish right outside new orleans has tested positive for naegleria fowleri, and officials say the state's department of health and hospitals has ordered a \" chlorine burn \" to purge the system of the possibly fatal pathogen, abc news reports. Naegleria fowleri can cause a rare, potentially deadly brain infection when contaminated water enters a person's body ( usually by water going up the nose, per the cdc ) and travels up to the brain. A statement from the state's department of health and hospitals says two of the seven sites it tested came back positive for the amoeba; nbc news notes one of the two positive samples was of untreated water; the other was from a sampling station hit by a car, which may have caused untreated groundwater to leak into the supply. The 225-mile water system that serves the parish used to provide about 68,000 residents with water, but hurricane katrina whittled that number down to about 44,000 — and because of that decreased population and an increase in ecofriendly water devices, less water is being treated in the same system, which could end up creating the ideal breeding ground for the amoeba, per abc. \" use is good because it pushes new water through the system, \" a health department spokeswoman tells nbc. If fresh water isn't continually forced through the pipes, it can lose the chlorine that kills the amoeba and become contaminated. Despite elevated concern from this news, the health department says it's still safe to drink the water — consumers should just take special care not to get it up their noses.

Police say they tried to detain a shirtless flores, who was latino, with non-lethal weapons, per nbc news. But a man who recorded video of the incident tells cnn that the officers, also latino, had their guns pointed at flores during the entire 20-minute encounter. As flores evaded cops outside, he \" acted like he was going to run back inside his house and then ran around the cars by the cop car and the cops started pursuing closer to him, \" michael thomas says. \" he put his hands in the air and then he had his hands up for a few seconds and the cops shot him twice. \" thomas ' video shows flores with at least one arm raised when officers opened fire; his other arm is obscured by a utility post. A district attorney says a second video, recorded by a neighbor, shows \" a better view to make an assessment on what happened. It is a closer view and a better angle. \" it has not been shared with the public, though a lawyer for flores ' family tells the ap he may file a lawsuit pressing police to release the footage. \" with everything going on in the world, with police shootings and everything, i thought i would record what was happening, \" says thomas, who sold his video to ksat for $ 100. Ksat says its job is to share \" information in the public interest \" and \" it is not uncommon for news organizations to pay for video from freelancers or citizen journalists. \" bexar county police say the move has \" sparked threats to our deputies ' lives \" and \" deputies are coming to work in civilian clothes because of their concern for safety. \"",

Though details, including a purchase price, have yet to be finalized, the companies agree that dish ceo charlie ergen would be chairman of the combined company, while t-mobile ceo john legere would be the new company's ceo. The deal comes amid similar ones, like at&t-directv and charter-time warner-bright house networks. So why should you care? if you're a dish customer: the deal would give dish a \" robust broadband internet \" offering, always a good thing for a tv company in this day and age. It would also hand dish the cellular network it needs to use its billions of dollars worth of wireless licenses. The merger \" makes perfect sense, \" an analyst tells usa today, because without it, \" t-mobile and dish were in danger of becoming the lone single-service providers left in the market, with everyone else combining tv, broadband, and wireless. \" if you're a t-mobile customer: the company is still no match for at&t or verizon in terms of size, but its capacity would jump thanks to the aforementioned wireless licenses. The analyst continues: \" t-mobile has a growing subscriber base and network but not enough spectrum, while dish has lots of spectrum and no network, so their assets are very complementary. \" even if you're not a customer of either company: re/code offers up a pleasantly colloquial explainer that calls the deal \" akin to two people who hook up because they are the last ones left in the bar at closing time, \" which is worth a read even if you're not usually into mergers &amp; acquisitions.

Researchers in japan mixed the embryonic stem cells with certain proteins and hormones. They converted the resulting cells into germ cells, which they implanted in the testes of mice. There, they developed into working sperm, discover reports. Researchers hope the discovery will lead to male infertility treatments, notes sciencenow. Scientists had previously created sperm-like cells, but they didn't function. Though the experiment was a success, \"very difficult \" issues remain — both physical and ethical, says a researcher. For one thing, the scientists would like to generate the sperm cells in the lab, without having to involve the mice at all. They hope to generate eggs, too. But questions remain over whether the process used for mice will work on humans.",

            "Scientists have long wanted to produce sperm and eggs in the laboratory to not only better understand this fundamental reproductive process but also to discover new ways of helping infertile couples conceive. Using embryonic stem ( es ) cells, which in theory can produce all of the body's cell types, several teams made some progress in the past few years but were unable to produce viable sperm or eggs. Now a kyoto university group has found a way to turn mouse es cells into sperm precursor cells and to use the resulting sperm to produce normal mouse pups. Such research may eventually lead to treatments for human male infertility. But that will require resolving several \" very difficult \" technical and ethical issues, says stem cell biologist mitinori saitou, leader of the kyoto team. Sperm and eggs develop from what are known as primordial germ cells. These germ cells are produced in early stage embryos in a mass of cells called the epiblast. Several years ago, researchers learned how to take epiblast cells from a mouse embryo and create epiblast stem cells that could regenerate in a dish for long periods of time. Researchers hoped that these epiblast stem cells could be used to produce primordial germ cells and ultimately fertile sperm and eggs. But despite years of attempts, no one succeeded. The kyoto group concluded that when the lab-created epiblast stem cells gained their ability to grow in dishes, they may have lost their ability to form germ cells. So taking a different approach, the scientists cultured mouse es cells in cocktails of growth factors and proteins to produce epliblast-like cells that they could keep alive only for several days. They found that they could use 2-day-old cells to generate primordial germ cell-like cells. When injected into the testes of mice unable to produce their own sperm, these primordial germ cells matured into sperm that were able to fertilize eggs in vitro. The researchers implanted the resulting embryos into surrogate mothers, which produced normal offspring. Those mice then produced their own offspring. Saitou and his colleagues report their work online today in cell. \" all i can say is wow! it is a breakthrough, \" says orly lacham-kaplan, a reproductive biologist at monash university in australia. The work provides evidence \" that es cell-derived primordial germ cells can generate functional germ cells, \" says amander clark, a stem cell biologist at university of california, los angeles, who calls the work \" a critical advance to our basic understanding of the principles of germ cell development. \" saitou says that there are",

        "summary": "There's been plenty of talk of \" revolution \" on the campaign trail this year, and now pope francis wants to start his own regarding marriage, divorce, sex, and family life, issuing a major document friday that addresses these issues while calling for one's conscience, rather than hard-and-fast rules, to serve as catholics ' guiding force, the ap reports. In his 256-page \" amoris laetitia, \" or \" joy of love, \" the pontiff doesn't make any major overhauls to church doctrine, but instead calls for less judgment and exhorts priests to embrace those who may appear to fall short of what the gospel preaches, welcoming everyone from single parents and gay couples to unmarried couples living together into the fold, the new york times reports. \" a pastor cannot feel that it is enough to simply apply moral laws to those living in ' irregular'situations, as if they were stones to throw at people's lives, \" he writes. In the document that has the pope sounding \" less like a pontiff than a marriage counselor, \" per the washington post, francis calls for more empathy, a more \" attentive \" church, and a \" new route back for divorced catholics, \" the new york times explains in excerpts from his appeal. He advocates for rejuvenating broken marriages and continued sex education, though he denounces the \" narcissism \" of terms like \" protection \" and \" safe sex, \" which he says epitomize a \" negative attitude towards the natural procreative finality of sexuality, as if an eventual child were an enemy to be protected against. \" he even talks about nurturing romance within marriage, including sharing a \" morning kiss \" and \" household chores \" together — even throwing parties to \" break the routine. \" yet although he warns against anti-gay violence, one issue he doesn't sway on is gay marriage. \" there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to god's plan for marriage and family, \" he writes.

At an estimated age of more than 150 years, speed had been in geriatric decline for some time, with arthritis and other maladies. Keepers treated him with medication, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, even acupuncture. Finally, a decision was made friday to euthanize speed, who had been at the zoo since 1933. He was brought to the zoo as part of an early effort to preserve the endangered species from the volcan cerro azul island of the galapagos islands, off ecuador. For years speed and other galapagos tortoises resided at the children's zoo, where youngsters were allowed to ride them. ( a practice long since abandoned ). In 2010, the massive, lumbering herbivores — the males can weigh more than 500 pounds — were moved to a new $ 1-million habitat near the reptile house. While tortoises do not get the public notice of charismatic vertebrates such as pandas, koalas, elephants, polar bears and big cats, they do have their own fan base. Members of the san diego turtle and tortoise society are frequent visitors to the habitat, keeping tabs on each tortoise by its number ( speed was 5 ) and personality. Speed, in his earlier decades, was an alpha male and given to butting his leathery head with other males in dominance skirmishes. With speed gone, the zoo has 13 galapagos tortoises.

The tortoise, known as speed, had been in geriatric decline for some time. Keepers at san diego zoo had used acupuncture and hydrotherapy to treat his arthritis and other ailments. Speed had been brought to california in 1933 as part of a programme to preserve the endangered species from the volcan cerro azul island of the galapagos, off ecuador. Thirteen galapagos tortoises remain at the zoo. The group has produced more than 90 offspring which can be found in many other zoos. Many of them have been sired by speed.",
            "Sad news from the san diego zoo: the galapagos tortoise speed has died. At an estimated age of more than 150 years, speed had been in geriatric decline for some time, with arthritis and other maladies. Keepers treated him with medication, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, even acupuncture. Finally, a decision was made friday to euthanize speed, who had been at the zoo since 1933. He was brought to the zoo as part of an early effort to preserve the endangered species from the volcan cerro azul island of the galapagos islands, off ecuador. For years speed and other galapagos tortoises resided at the children's zoo, where youngsters were allowed to ride them. ( a practice long since abandoned ). In 2010, the massive, lumbering herbivores — the males can weigh more than 500 pounds — were moved to a new $ 1-million habitat near the reptile house. While tortoises do not get the public notice of charismatic vertebrates such as pandas, koalas, elephants, polar bears and big cats, they do have their own fan base. Members of the san diego turtle and tortoise society are frequent visitors to the habitat, keeping tabs on each tortoise by its number ( speed was 5 ) and personality. Speed, in his earlier decades, was an alpha male and given to butting his leathery head with other males in dominance skirmishes. With speed gone, the zoo has 13 galapagos tortoises. The group has produced more than 90 offspring sent to other zoos, many of them sired by speed."

But police also revealed that her killers made a dumb move that alerted authorities to the crime, reports the telegraph. Police initially believed that kelty herself sent out a distress signal from her gps device, but now they say one of the bandits involved in her death accidentally pressed the button while trying to figure out how to work the device. \" stupid, \" says a local police official. The signal led police to a riverside village, and they were eventually able to arrest three suspects. Three more are at large, and a seventh man was shot to death, reportedly by a rival gang out to steal kelty's gear from him. A local resident says the gang member provided details of the crime before his death. It seems that the bandits came across kelty's remote campsite and incorrectly assumed she was a drug trafficker. \" when the men saw her tent they thought it belonged to a colombian with drugs, so they started firing from about 50 meters away, \" the resident tells the telegraph. He says kelty was hit in the arm and began screaming for help, and the bandits then moved in. According to the resident's account, the men cut off her hair, demanding to know where the drugs were, then sexually abused her, cut her throat, and dumped her body in the river.

How so? the network has made the bold decision to kill off co-star erinn hayes, who played the wife of kevin james ' character on season one, and give james a new love interest in the form of leah remini. Which means that james and remini will essentially be resurrecting their long-running king of queens partnership, notes usa today. \"the character will have passed away and we will be moving forward in time catching up at a later date, \" cbs programming boss thom sherman explained to a gathering of tv critics on tuesday, per variety. He pushed back against the notion that the show will become a slightly different version of king of queens, though remini herself suggested otherwise previously. The two kevin can wait characters are \" literally doug and carrie as cops, \" she said, referring to their former iterations of doug and carrie heffernan.",

He landed in brazil's rio de janeiro yesterday for a week of world youth day festivities to boisterous crowds, and a somewhat confused driver. The ap reports that the fiat he was riding in from the airport took a wrong turn, missing the lanes that had been cleared for him and driving into ones packed with buses and taxis, forcing the pontiff's car to stop — at which point it was promptly rushed by thousands of people, who reached into the car's open window and snapped photos. A vatican rep says the pope wasn't worried, and assured anyone concerned about a perceived security breach that \" there are no concerns for security. \" apparently not, as the pope later rode in his open-air vehicle that was also surrounded by the screaming faithful. He apparently left his bulletproof popemobile in the vatican garage so he could better connect with people. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing thus far. Nbc news reports that a crude pipe bomb was found sunday at a shrine he is set to visit, and about 1,500 protesters burned the governor in effigy last night outside rio's guanabara palace, where francis was meeting with the president. ( experts say the ire was focused on the government, not the pope, however. ) but things may be calmer today: it's a planned day of rest for the pontiff.",

Researchers hope their new study shrinks that number even more, reports usa today. Using high-definition images of fetuses, they found that those inside smokers touched their faces and moved their mouths significantly more than those in non-smokers. That kind of movement isn't a good sign, because healthy fetuses generally stop such activity over time. The study, then, suggests that \" mothers who smoke may delay the development of their babies ' central nervous systems, \" explains the independent. The researchers compared fetuses in 20 women, four of whom smoked, and took four sets of 4d ultrasound scans between 24 and 36 weeks. \" normal fetal behavior shows fewer movements, but the images suggest that fetuses in smokers are less mature in their behavior, \" says lead researcher nadja reissland of the uk's durham university. The team will next use a larger sample of women to see if they can replicate the findings. Researchers also found increased movement in fetuses of women who were stressed or depressed while pregnant, but the association wasn't as strong as with smokers, reports medical news today.

After two depressing defeats against ghana the last two world cups, it was finally time for a us win. And win it did -- scoring its victory goal in the 2-1 match in the last few minutes of the game. Us soccer fans rejoiced, twitter users rejoiced, and us companies also got in on the social media action -- congratulating the us team. One such company, delta airlines, tweeted \" congrats team #usa! nice goal \" and attached an image. And, that is when the trouble began. The attached image showed a photo of the statue of liberty with a \" 2 \" overlay and an image of a giraffe with a \" 1 \" overlay. It's unclear when an image of a giraffe started to represent the country of ghana, oh wait, giraffes have never represented ghana -- they don't even exist there. Delta's tweet caused a twitter frenzy with some people poking fun at the company's ignorance and others downright angered at what they deemed as racist. \" and it's @delta's social media team with today's awful brand world cup tweet, \" wrote alex horton, who also got a screenshot of delta's tweet ( pictured above ). \" i remember when i was in ghana riding my giraffe on the beach, \" wrote twitter user hambone.

        "summary": "\" it is difficult to prevent a disease when it is not known how infection is acquired, \" reads a study published monday that tracks the spread of a flesh-eating ulcer in australia, and that's not the only mystery surrounding the rise in buruli ulcers. The disease has historically most often struck in tropical and swampy parts of africa, but incidents of it have surged in victoria, which the bbc notes has a \" temperate \" climate — and only victoria, with no cases reported in the neighboring australian states of new south wales, south australia, and tasmania. The ulcers were first reported in victoria 70 years ago, but the surge is a recent one: 182 new cases in 2016, a 72 % rise over the previous high; and though total 2017 figures weren't in, the year was shaping up to show 50 % more cases than in 2016. Buruli expert paul johnson, who was not involved in the study, notes the oddities about how the disease appears in victoria, telling the guardian, \" if you don't enter an endemic area, you don't get the disease. \" but \" when you enter an endemic area, it looks the same as the area you just left. \" he suspects the bacteria that causes the ulcer is carried by mosquitoes and possums. The bacteria produces toxins that eat through fat, skin cells, and blood vessels in the fatty layer of the skin; it's only once the ulcer erupts through the skin's outer layer that a person becomes aware they are infected. The study, which appears in the medical journal of australia, argues government funding needs to quickly be dedicated to studying the ulcer in order to answer six critical questions, including \" why are cases becoming more severe? \" ( the bacteria gave this girl a \" zombie leg. \" )",

            "Understanding risk factors is key to defining the source and transmission route of mycobacterium ulcerans mycobacterium ulcerans causes an infectious disease known internationally as buruli ulcer, and also as bairnsdale ulcer or daintree ulcer in australia. It causes severe destructive lesions of skin and soft tissue, resulting in significant morbidity, in attributable mortality and often in long term disability and cosmetic deformity.1 all age groups, including young children, are affected, and the emotional and psychological impact on patients and their carers is substantial ( box 1 ). Although treatment effectiveness has improved in recent years, with cure rates approaching 100 % using combination antibiotic regimens such as rifampicin and clarithromycin,2 these antibiotics are not covered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for this condition and are, therefore, expensive to patients. Moreover, these antibiotics have severe side effects in up to one-quarter of patients,1 and many people also require reparative plastic surgery, sometimes with prolonged hospital admissions. The disease thus results in substantial costs, averaging $ 14 000 per patient including direct3 and indirect costs ( eg, transport, lost productivity and dressings ) — it had an estimated cost to victoria in 2016 of $ 2 548 000 ( paul mwebaze, research scientist, adaptive urban and social systems, land and water, csiro, australia, personal communication, june 2017 ).",

Executive editor stephen george says he is \" shocked and saddened \" by johnson's death, but he stands by the story.",

        "summary": "Spain is dusting off a never-before-used emergency clause in its constitution in a bid to end the push for independence in catalonia. How things will turn out remains very much up in the air. Specifically, spanish prime minister mariano rajoy says he is beginning the process to invoke article 155 of the constitution, which allows madrid to suspend catalonia's autonomy and impose direct rule, reports cnn. Spain could theoretically remove catalonia's current leaders and take over the police and all government institutions, notes reuters, but much is unclear because article 155 has never been used. It was put in place after the downfall of the dictator francisco franco 40 years ago, intended for use only in a crisis. This is the first such crisis in the eyes of madrid. All this was set off when catalonians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum deemed illegal by spain. However, catalonian leader carles puigdemont immediately suspended a declaration of independence and said he wanted to negotiate. Puigdemont has since dodged two deadlines from madrid seeking clarification, prompting rajoy to say wednesday: \"it's simple and it's not that difficult. It's answering one question. Have you or have you not declared the independence of catalonia? \" if the answer is yes, he added, \" the government is obliged \" to \" act in a certain way. \" the next steps could drag out for weeks, explains the bbc. Rajoy's cabinet meets saturday to formalize the decision to invoke article 155, which then needs to go through parliament. Then catalonia would likely be given time to issue a formal response.",

It all started in the summer of 2014, when their son checked out a dr. Seuss book for the couple's granddaughter at the tecumseh district library. It was somehow misplaced and the son, then a minor, didn't tell his parents about the notices the library was emailing to his account, reports abc news. Catherine duren, 44, says she first found out about the ordeal in october 2014, when the library told her the late charges would hit her credit report. Still, \" we had no intent of not paying the fees, \" she says of herself and her husband melvin, 63. With catherine battling stage three kidney disease and melvin being tested for cancer, the couple faces hefty monthly medical bills and by may 2015 had not paid the late fees. The library sent a notice asking to replace the book, and around this time the couple checked out the rome prophecy, and soon couldn't find it, either. Though they found and returned that book in january, they were soon being investigated by lenawee county's economic crimes unit, which is helping the library deal with an annual $ 10,000 worth of unreturned books, reports the daily telegram. When the couple finally tried to pay what catherine says was $ 55 in fees in february 2016, the library refused because a $ 105 \" diversion fee \" for each book had not yet been paid to the ecu. All of this resulted in the couple appearing in court last week to plead not guilty to larceny of rental equipment. Catherine says she was treated \" like a criminal \"; she and her husband are due back in court may 3. ( this high school library book was returned 65 years late. )",

Most of that money goes towards their medications, duren said. \"we had no intent of not paying the fees, \" she said, noting that she and her husband intended to pay the library fees eventually. Wxyz however, in may 2015, she and her husband received another letter saying the book would have to be replaced, so she went to the library in person to clarify the matter. \"they told me they would send me the charges with the late fees through the mail, \" duren said, noting that when she left the library that day, she gave them $ 10 to pay towards the late fees. Around the same time, the couple went to the library and checked out the book \" the rome prophecy. \" when they were moving to an apartment later that year, the book"

Her chevrolet malibu likely went airborne, hit several trees, and rolled down a steep embankment before stopping in a grove of aspen trees, a patrol officer told reuters.

Some samples: learning curve: compared to most apple products, this one has a learning curve, writes farhad manjoo in the new york times. But he came to love it after three days, and he concludes his review with a one-sentence summary that would fit nicely on the screen: \" the first apple watch may not be for you — but someday soon, it will change your world. \" don't spend a ton: the verge gives it a solid 7 out of 10 in its review. It's easily \" the most capable smartwatch available today, \" writes nilay patel. It's also incredibly ambitious, \" hoping to do and change so much about how we interact with technology. But that ambition robs it of focus: it can do tiny bits of everything, instead of a few things extraordinarily well. \" it is, after all, a smartwatch, and it's \" not clear that anyone's yet figured out what smartwatches are actually for. \" if you want to take the plunge, stick with one of the lower-priced models and wait for improvements.

Wearing a smartwatch like the apple watch is a far deeper commitment than carrying a smartphone in your pocket; you are literally putting the technology on your body and allowing it to touch and measure you while you display it to the rest of the world. Committing to technology that's a little slow to respond to you is dicey at best, especially when it's supposed to step in for your phone. If the watch is slow, i ' m going to pull out my phone. But if i keep pulling out my phone, i ' ll never use the watch. So i have resolved to wait it out. I '",
            "What's more, unlike previous breakthrough apple products, the watch's software requires a learning curve that may deter some people. There's a good chance it will not work perfectly for most consumers right out of the box, because it is best after you fiddle with various software settings to personalize use.

I stop talking, tilt my head, and whip my arm aggressively into view to see the source of the agitation. A second later, the small screen on my new apple watch beams to life with a very important message for me: twitter has suggestions for people i should follow. A version of this happens dozens of times throughout the day — for messages, e-mails, activity achievements, tweets, and so much more. Wait a second.

Wearing a smartwatch like the apple watch is a far deeper commitment than carrying a smartphone in your pocket; you are literally putting the technology on your body and allowing it to touch and measure you while you display it to the rest of the world. Committing to technology that's a little slow to respond to you is dicey at best, especially when it's supposed to step in for your phone. If the watch is slow, i ' m going to pull out my phone. But if i keep pulling out my phone, i ' ll never use the watch. So i have resolved to wait it out. I '",

        "summary": "A clay seal found in an ancient garbage pit in jerusalem might have belonged to the prophet isaiah, who's described as predicting the virgin birth and jesus'death in the old testament. Or, less exciting, it might have belonged to some random guy named isaiah. At present, it's impossible to know for sure, but there are clues that point to the famous isaiah as the seal's owner, which, if true, would mean the first evidence of the prophet's existence outside of the bible, per the daily beast. Why the uncertainty? as archaeologist eilat mazar explains in the biblical archaeology review, the 2,700-year-old seal is damaged, so only a portion of its impression is visible. While it might have once read, \" belonging to isaiah the prophet, \" it now shows the name isaiah ( \" yesha ' yah[ u ] \" in hebrew ) and \" nvy, \" reports national geographic. If the hebrew letter aleph appeared with \" nvy \" — mazar notes it might be obscured by damage — this second word would read \" prophet. \" \" without an aleph at the end, the word ' nvy ' is most likely just a personal name, \" mazar tells the jerusalem post. There's other evidence that keeps her interest sparked, however. Mazar notes the half-inch seal was found just 10 feet from another seal bearing the personal mark of king hezekiah, whom the prophet isaiah served as an adviser, according to the hebrew bible. The timing is right, too, as hezekiah reigned from the late eighth to the early seventh century bc. Yet with no aleph on the seal, the prophet's ownership of it \" cannot be confirmed, \" expert christopher rollston tells national geographic.

A jurassic-era dinosaur skeleton discovered in wyoming in 2013 is going to be auctioned off in paris, at the eiffel tower, on june 4, per the guardian. Researchers who dug up the skeleton initially thought it was a type of theropod known as an allosaurus, but it was found to have more teeth, a bigger pelvis, and differences in the bones of the skull, reports the antiques trade gazette. Scientists are now content to classify it as an unknown species of theropod, which walked upright, on three-toed limbs, similar to a tyrannosaurus rex. \" we can therefore confirm that this is totally new, \" reports fossil expert eric mickeler, who is handling the sale for the paris auction house aguttes. Aguttes recently sold a rare late pleistocene-era mammoth skeleton from siberia for about $ 515,000. But that was a shrimp in comparison, measuring 18 feet long, from tusk to tail. Whoever buys the skeleton will have naming privileges and can put it wherever they like, but mickeler believes the buyer will want to make it available for public viewing. He's never handled a dinosaur sale where the buyer tucked the skeleton away. \" buyers like to share their pleasure, and there's the size to consider, \" he said.",

            "Greenwich — police have identified the boy who died tuesday night after being buried in a snowbank in a lot off rock street. Cambridge-greenwich police chief george bell said wednesday, during a press conference, that joshua j. Demarest, 13, and a seventh-grade student at greenwich central school, was pronounced dead at around 10 p.m. Tuesday, after he and a friend were dug out of the snow pile. Bell said police began searching for the two boys after an older sister of one of the boys reported that they had not returned before dark, as was typical, and she was concerned. Police found footprints leading to the lot, which is used by the village to dump snow after storm cleanups. The village does not own the lot, bell said. Police dogs were brought to the lot and one of them alerted rescuers to the snow pile, bell said. That's when rescuers began digging. \" i bet they moved seven ton of snow, easily, out of that pile by hand, shovel, snow rakes -- i can't even tell you what they used... To recover those two boys, \" he said. Demarest was recovered from the pile at around 7: 15 p.m., and rescuers began cpr. He was taken to saratoga hospital. The second boy, tyler j. Day,",

Not everybody's a fan: richard lawson, gawker: it goes even further than the brit version in pushing the idea that teens are \" messy jumbles of extremes with very little shading in between, lacking in kindness, decorum, and any sense of responsibility or consequence. It's a pretty bleak and unfair characterization. Teenagers are dumb, yes, but they're not monsters ( not all of them at least ). I wish television and movies would stop trying to tell us they are. \" hank stuever, washington post: it feels \" fake, \" he writes. It's \" so determined to relate to hardened kids — without sermon, theme or context — that it accidentally discovers a new frontier in phoniness and filth. Even if i could warp time and watch it as my teenaged self, i ' m pretty sure i would have been bored by it back then, too — even with all the sex. \" james poniewozik, time: \" what may be most shocking to an american audience is how insouciantly it defies teen tv's unwritten mandate of consequences. On us teen dramas, you can titillate the audience with bad behavior so long as, at some point, there's a pregnancy scare or a cautionary drug overdose. \" not so here. Still, he adds, \" for all its cheekiness and raunch, skins has more sweetness than snarky teen soaps like gossip girl. \"",

        "summary": "It's been 75 years since gone with the wind was released — and given the many hurdles to its production, it's kind of amazing that it ever was. In entertainment weekly, chris nashawaty tells the story of the film's making, which centered on producer david selznick. He was at first reluctant to make the film, despite a glowing review of the book by one of his employees. \" i am absolutely off my nut about this book, \" katharine brown wrote, finally convincing him to take action. But plenty got in the way. Among the challenges: the first writer dropped out after spending months on the script. After a number of other writers tried their hand, including selznick himself, writer ben hecht took it on, but there was no time for him to read margaret mitchell's book. So selznick and director victor fleming \" stayed up all night acting out the story for him. \" clark gable was under contract to selznick's father-in-law, who finally \" loaned \" him to selznick, with plenty of strings attached — and gable wasn't thrilled about it. Original director george cukor didn't get along with gable and was eventually replaced by fleming, who didn't get along with vivien leigh. \" leigh hated fleming. With a passion. Fleming hated her. Clark gable hated david … everybody hated david, \" an assistant said. Fleming quit before returning. Ultimately, the film required \" 125 days of photography, 37 months of preparation, half a million feet of film and a budget of $ 4.25 million ( at a time when the average feature cost less than $ 1 million ), \" nashawaty writes. And the trouble was far from over: racism plagued the various premieres, with black cast members in many cases banned from attending, the los angeles times reports. That prompted anger from selznick, the ap reports; gable, meanwhile, had already stood against segregated toilets on set, threatening to bail on the film, according to a life magazine book cited by the times. Ultimately, however, \" selznick kept that film together, \" says a film scholar, and it still holds the record for domestic box-office gross, adjusted for inflation, the times notes ( and you can bet it's a lot better than the current crop of big-grossing films ).",

As the mercurial, 34-year-old movie mogul's official east coast story editor and unofficial gal friday/arbiter of good taste, brown needed to have lightning-quick instincts and the thick hide of an elephant. After all, selznick was notoriously demanding and infamous for his short-fused three a.m. Phone calls. It wasn't easy keeping pace with a mind that whirred as feverishly as selznick's.

The newly appointed ceo of amc entertainment says he's considering allowing mobile phone use, including texting, in theaters as a way to attract millennials to see a show. It's actually one of many new strategies being discussed — including more \" exciting \" food — as amc prepares to become the world's largest theater operator upon its merger with carmike, but it's likely to be the most controversial. \" we need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers, \" adam aron tells variety. The way to do that? \" you can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. \" \" when you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear ' please cut off your left arm above the elbow, ' \" he continues. If this sounds like a terrible idea, don't freak out just yet. Aron acknowledges that \" today's moviegoer doesn't want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on, \" so he says a compromise might be to have mobile-friendly auditoriums. \" if ever, we only would pursue in a way we'd be totally confident all our guests will fully enjoy movie-going experience, \" he adds on twitter, per wncn. Aron says a new deal with ticketing app atom tickets might also help attract millennials: when you buy a ticket, it will send a text to friends who can then reserve a seat next to you, aron says.

When the definition is broadened to include other forms of sexual violence, the percentage of female victims rises to 44 %. The victims include those unable to give consent because they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs, notes salon. The cdc estimates more than 11 million women were raped in that manner in 2011. The report also says 2 % of men have been raped, and 23 % have been victims of sexual violence of some kind. In fact, new york highlights this paragraph from the cdc report itself: \" consistent with previous studies, the overall pattern of results suggest that women, in particular, are heavily impacted over their lifetime. However, the results also indicate that many men experience sexual violence, stalking, and, in particular, physical violence by an intimate partner. \" for both genders, the abuse is most likely to have happened before age 25.

Us soccer first addressed the issue last september after megan rapinoe took a knee in protest during the national anthem prior to a match. Rapinoe said she was kneeling in solidarity with san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick and marginalized groups, specifically the lgbt community. \" we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag, \" the league said in a statement following rapinoe's protest. Despite no other us soccer player, including rapinoe, appearing to kneel since then, the organization decided to go a step further. Espn reports a new rule was approved by the us soccer board of directors in february and revealed saturday during the organization's general meeting in hawaii. Fox sports'stuart holden tweeted a photo of the new rule, which states all national team players must \" stand respectfully \" during the anthem. That covers kneeling, as well as turning one's back on the flag and other potentially disrespectful actions, according to fox sports. The rule doesn't specify any punishment for kneelers, and us soccer president sunil gulati says consequences will be figured out if/when necessary. ( meanwhile, kaepernick announced this week he ' ll no longer be kneeling for the anthem. )",

The link to the prescription drugs? people get hooked on them but can't afford to sustain the habit and so turn to cheaper, easier-to-get heroin. \"the price on the street for prescription painkillers, like oxycontin, got very expensive, \" says the study's author in forbes. \"it has sold for up to a dollar per milligram, so an 80 milligram tablet would cost $ 80. Meanwhile, they can get heroin for $ 10. \" the result is that 90 % of new heroin users in the last decade were white, with the average age of first use at 23. Three-quarters of them got started on prescription meds. The shift to heroin has become even more pronounced as the makers of the prescription drugs take steps to curb abuse, such as making their pills harder to crush. \"the crackdown in prescription narcotics has pushed more people over to heroin, \" an expert at the cleveland clinic not involved with the study tells nbc news.

            "At the sundance film festival in january, joseph gordon-levitt said that acting opposite daniel day-lewis in lincoln was \"uncanny. \" he said, \"i had absolutely no problem fully believing that i was standing across from and speaking to abraham lincoln. \" after seeing the trailer for steven spielberg's long-in-the-works historical drama about the last four months of the president's life, i have an inkling how gordon-levitt must have felt. There are no audio recordings of lincoln's voice, but when day-lewis concludes at the end, \" … shall we stop this bleeding, \" who doesn't doubt that his is the voice of the great emancipator himself. It just feels and sounds … right. Seeing abraham lincoln living and breathing on the screen is thrilling, especially since hollywood hasn't really given the 16th president his due since henry fonda played him in 1939. ( sorry bill &amp; ted's excellent adventure. ) day-lewis instills a sadness and grace that remind us of the incredible weight on his shoulders. As spielberg said in the google+ hangout video that followed the online trailer premiere last night, \"we treat him as a man, not a monument. \" it's difficult to tell exactly where the movie picks up, but it's understood that lincoln has been re-elected, and that city on fire just might be one of the southern cities in general sherman's path on his march to the sea, which helped break the back of the confederacy in december 1864. Don't expect too many such action sequences, though; spielberg said battlefield scenes take a back",
            "Can't wait for the movie ' lincoln ', directed by steven spielberg, starring daniel day-lewis and coming november 9? neither can we. But our long national struggle just got a little easier with the release of the movie's first full-length trailer thursday.

        "summary": "Seniors dealing with insomnia or anxiety might want to take it easy on commonly prescribed drugs such as ativan, xanax, valium, and klonopin, a new study in the british medical journal suggests. Researchers in canada found what looks to be a strong link between alzheimer's and this class of drugs, called benzodiazepines, reports the cbc. Specifically, those who took the drugs for longer than 3 months were 51 % more likely to develop the disease. The study compared 1,800 people age 65 and older recently diagnosed with about 7,100 seniors who did not have alzheimer's. The findings don't establish definitive proof that long-term use of benzodiazepines causes alzheimer's, \" but it does strengthen such suspicions, \" observes the los angeles times. Scientists already knew that benzodiazepines take a toll on memory and mental sharpness, and the study authors write that their findings make it crucial for doctors \" to carefully balance the risks and benefits when initiating or renewing a treatment with benzodiazepines and related products in older patients. \" the american geriatrics society already considers the drugs a bad choice for seniors, writes alice walton at forbes. \" it may be time for doctors to listen to this recommendation. \" ( scratch-and-sniff tests might someday help diagnose the ailment. )",

        "summary": "There literally does appear to be an app for almost everything, and treating symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder just got its own entry. Treatment for ocd ( a condition in which patients can't stop having obsessive thoughts and engaging in repetitive behaviors ) has been notoriously hit or miss: upi reports that up to 40 % of patients don't respond that well to either medication or \" talk therapy \" in dealing specifically with symptoms like extreme phobias related to contamination and excessive hand-washing. But a new study published in scientific reports says subjects with strong contamination fears — for ethical reasons, the scientists didn't study actual ocd patients for fear of worsening their symptoms — who used a \" brain training \" app found significant relief for their symptoms after just one week of intervention. University of cambridge researchers split 93 otherwise healthy subjects into three groups. For seven days, they were told to watch a 30-second video four times a day. Depending on which group they were in, that video was either of themselves washing their hands, touching a fake contaminated surface, or simply moving their hands around in various gestures ( the control group ). The subjects in the two non-control groups experienced a noticeable decrease in their ocd-like symptoms, with about a 21 % jump in their yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale scores — the most commonly used gauge in assessing ocd, per a release. Although research involving actual ocd patients is needed, scientists are encouraged. ( workaholics may be prone to ocd. )",

            "People with ocd may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. These symptoms can interfere with all aspects of life, such as work, school, and personal relationships. Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include: fear of germs or contamination unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, and harm aggressive thoughts towards others or self having things symmetrical or in a perfect order compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with ocd feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include: excessive cleaning and/or handwashing ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off compulsive counting not all rituals or habits are compulsions.

This repetitive and compulsive behaviour is also associated with 'cognitive rigidity ' – in other words, an inability to adapt to new situations or new rules. Breaking out of compulsive habits, such as handwashing, requires cognitive flexibility so that the ocd patient can switch to new activities instead. Ocd is treated using a combination of medication such as prozac and a form of cognitive behavioural therapy ( 'talking therapy ' ) termed 'exposure and response prevention '.

        "summary": "The us has long had dicey relations with the un cultural organization unesco, and those relations have just taken another sour turn. The state department announced thursday that the us is pulling out of the organization at the end of next year, citing what it sees as an anti-israel bias, concern over america's mounting back dues, and the \" need for fundamental reform, \" reports the hill. Though it won't be a full member, the us will maintain a lesser role with \" observer \" status. Details: not the first time: ronald reagan severed ties with unesco in 1984, accusing the group of having a pro-soviet bias and of being plagued with corruption, notes foreign policy. George w. Bush reinstated ties in 2002, saying the organization had made the necessary reforms and corrected an anti-israel bias. About israel: the us stopped paying $ 80 million in annual dues in 2011 after unesco accepted palestine as a member. And this summer, unesco recognized the old city of hebron in the west bank as a palestinian world heritage site over the objections of the us and israel. Those unpaid dues, meanwhile, now add up to about $ 550 million in back payments, reports the ap, and the us wants to stop the amount from growing. Unesco mission: the organization, formed after wwii and based in paris, is perhaps best known for the aforementioned world heritage operation, which designates cultural sites worthy of preservation. ( the statue of liberty and the grand canyon are among them. ) beyond that, the broad mission is in the name: the united nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization. One example is improving girls ' access to education. The group has 195 member nations and is currently in the process of picking a new leader, per the washington post. Trump pattern? reuters sees the move as in line with the trump administration's embrace of \" america first \" and its corresponding disdain of engaging with international bodies. It cites the disavowal of the tpp trade deal and the paris climate accord, as well as the potential ditching of nafta.

On friday, soldiers found 7-year-old yamato tanooka in a hut at a military drill area a few miles away from where his parents had left him by the side of a forest road as punishment, the japan times reports. Soldiers say he was curled up on a mattress when they found him and they gave him rice balls and bread when he told them he was hungry and thirsty, the guardian reports. He was taken to a hospital by military helicopter and was treated for dehydration and possible hypothermia.

Yamato's parents told authorities that they returned five minutes after leaving the boy and found him gone. At least 180 rescuers joined the search, combing woods on the northern island of hokkaido, which are home to a species of brown bear. It's not clear how long the boy had been in the unheated hut during a week when overnight temperatures dropped as low as 44 degrees fahrenheit.

The memo means dreamers will continue to be able to use and apply for permits to work in the us. \" this is a big victory for dreamers amid months of draconian and mean-spirited immigration enforcement policy, \" an immigration lawyer tells the new york times. But that doesn't mean dreamers can rest easy. On friday, white house officials said that despite the memo trump hasn't made any decision on the future of the daca program and may still fulfill his campaign promise. That led to disappointment from immigration advocates — including the lawyer quoted above — that dreamers are still facing an uncertain future. Vox reports there are currently more than 750,000 dreamers in the us. The program allows them to legally work in the us for two years without fear of deportation under a number of conditions. Many dreamers have no connection to their homelands and some don't even speak the languages of those homelands.",

But the foreseeable future may not be that long. Homeland security secretary john kelly issued a memo thursday night stating that the deferred action for childhood arrivals program launched by president barack obama in 2012 — which granted renewable two-year protections from deportation to unauthorized immigrants who'd come to the us as children and met other requirements — would remain in effect.

The website points out the irony: \" a place that's designed to increase health will bear the trademark of a company that profits from destroying health. \" a clinic spokesperson tells gawker that some people may see the new name and think they \" sold out \" to a company that makes a killing on unhealthy foods, but that criticism is overblown because the name isn't technically connected to the doughnut chain itself. According to a unc press release, the children's specialty clinic was actually named after the krispy kreme challenge — an event wherein participants eat 12 doughnuts while running five miles in an hour that was started by nc state students on a dare in 2004. The clinic spokesperson tells gawker that krispy kreme has no involvement in the challenge or connection to the clinic's renaming. \" we're disappointed that a small minority of people have jumped to that conclusion, \" the spokesperson says. \" they couldn't be more wrong. \" the krispy kreme challenge is run by students and has raised nearly $ 1 million for the clinic — which treats feeding and swallowing issues and consults on diabetes — since 2006 and plans to raise another million by 2020, according to the press release. \"anyone worried about the future of this country should spend just 30 or 40 minutes with these remarkable students, \" the clinic's chief physician tells wral. \" i come away impressed after every interaction. \"",
