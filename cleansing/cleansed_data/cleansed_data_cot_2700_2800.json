But the spare-no-expense \" campfire \" retreat comes at a price — the silence of the writers who attend. This year may prove different, however, as tensions continue to build between amazon and the fourth-largest publisher hachette over e-book pricing and, more essentially, profit margins. \" the literary world overflows with tension and invective these days, \" reports the new york times, which was able to get several writers to break their silence and open up about the weekend and the larger conflict. \" people are choosing sides. \" this past weekend, which was supposed to be the fifth campfire event ( but which amazon would not even confirm took place ), some writers asked not to be invited back, while others simply weren't invited at all. In santa fe, not one local author has been invited this year, and some in the faction are \" fuming \" at the snub, reports the santa fe new mexican. The event follows six months of thinly veiled vitriol between the bookseller and the book publisher, and more than 900 writers openly criticized amazon in an ad in the times in august for essentially \" boycotting \" hachette authors, reports publishers weekly.

Some 200 years after he died, a bill that would give bernardo de gálvez y madrid honorary citizenship will be considered by the house judiciary committee this week, the new york post reports. If the bill — authored by republican jeff miller and co-sponsored by the entire florida delegation — is passed, gálvez will be just the eighth person to get the designation from congress and, it appears, the first spanish-speaker. As for why florida is pushing the move, miller notes that \" capturing pensacola was key to defeating the british forces, and it was achieved in large part due to the efforts of gálvez. \" ( miller's chief of staff notes, however, \" this is clearly an honorary situation \" and has nothing to do with the current immigration debate. ) some background: as governor of spanish louisiana, gálvez backed the americans even before spain officially entered the war; he supplied us forces with weapons and medicine, and later led a 7,500-strong army that emerged victorious in baton rouge, natchez, mobile, and the siege of pensacola, a nearly two-month-long fight that snatched the last british naval base on the gulf coast from them. Voxxi points out gálvez helped draft the peace of paris, which ended the war, in 1783, and his efforts earned him recognition from george washington. But the los angeles times noted in may that gálvez's citizenship isn't a foregone conclusion: mother teresa is one of seven to have been conferred it thus far; anne frank didn't make the cut.",

The fight was fueled by gibson's jealousy that she was around other men at her son's basketball game earlier that day, and the 12-year-old was reportedly in his bedroom during the incident — even when gibson pulled a gun and made his murder-suicide threat. Radar also released another recording from that evening, in which grigorieva accuses gibson of hitting their daughter and he says, \"no one will believe you. \" wondering where all of gibson's christian supporters have gone? click here to find out.",

            "Media playback is unsupported on your device media caption former religious affairs correspondent for the guardian, stephen bates: \" it is an exposure of church hierarchy hypocrisy \" cardinal keith o ' brien, the former leader of the catholic church in scotland, has admitted his sexual conduct has at times \" fallen beneath the standards expected of me \". He apologised and asked forgiveness from those he had \" offended \". In a statement, he also apologised to the church and the people of scotland. The cardinal resigned last monday after three priests and a former priest had made allegations of improper behaviour against him dating back to the 80s. Cardinal o ' brien was britain's most senior roman catholic cleric until he stood down as the archbishop of st andrews and edinburgh. Life in retirement in announcing his resignation, he also said he would not take part in the election for a successor to pope benedict xvi, known as the conclave. Analysis some will find it a relief that the cardinal's week-long silence has ended, and the issue of \" sexual conduct \" now at least has a name. But, as cardinal o ' brien's statement is so conspicuously devoid of any detail, it seems to raise almost as many questions as it answers - particularly about the nature and timing of the occasions",
            "A key figure behind allegations of inappropriate behaviour by cardinal keith o ' brien has launched a powerful attack on the catholic church's response to the complaints, saying he fears the church hierarchy would \" crush \" him if they could. Last sunday the observer revealed that the former priest, along with three serving priests, had reported o ' brien's behaviour to the vatican, prompting the uk's most senior catholic to resign the following day. Now the former priest, who says he was the subject of unwanted attention by o ' brien when he was a 20-year-old seminarian, has come forward to explain why he made his allegations public and to lambast the scottish church leadership's reaction to last week's story. He is \" disappointed \" by the \" lack of integrity \" shown by the catholic church. \" there have been two sensations for me this week.

            "Media playback is unsupported on your device media caption former religious affairs correspondent for the guardian, stephen bates: \" it is an exposure of church hierarchy hypocrisy \" cardinal keith o ' brien, the former leader of the catholic church in scotland, has admitted his sexual conduct has at times \" fallen beneath the standards expected of me \". He apologised and asked forgiveness from those he had \" offended \". In a statement, he also apologised to the church and the people of scotland. The cardinal resigned last monday after three priests and a former priest had made allegations of improper behaviour against him dating back to the 80s. Cardinal o ' brien was britain's most senior roman catholic cleric until he stood down as the archbishop of st andrews and edinburgh. Life in retirement in announcing his resignation, he also said he would not take part in the election for a successor to pope benedict xvi, known as the conclave. Analysis some will find it a relief that the cardinal's week-long silence has ended, and the issue of \" sexual conduct \" now at least has a name. But, as cardinal o ' brien's statement is so conspicuously devoid of any detail, it seems to raise almost as many questions as it answers - particularly about the nature and timing of the occasions",
            "A key figure behind allegations of inappropriate behaviour by cardinal keith o ' brien has launched a powerful attack on the catholic church's response to the complaints, saying he fears the church hierarchy would \" crush \" him if they could. Last sunday the observer revealed that the former priest, along with three serving priests, had reported o ' brien's behaviour to the vatican, prompting the uk's most senior catholic to resign the following day. Now the former priest, who says he was the subject of unwanted attention by o ' brien when he was a 20-year-old seminarian, has come forward to explain why he made his allegations public and to lambast the scottish church leadership's reaction to last week's story. He is \" disappointed \" by the \" lack of integrity \" shown by the catholic church. \" there have been two sensations for me this week. One is feeling the hot breath of the media on the back of my neck and the other is sensing the cold disapproval of the church hierarchy for daring to break ranks. I feel like if they could crush me, they would, \" he told the observer.

The president's personal assistant, john mcentee, was abruptly fired and escorted out of the white house over some kind of security clearance issue, reports the wall street journal. White house officials won't provide details, but cnn reports that mcentee is under investigation by homeland security for \" serious financial crimes \" unrelated to the president. Almost immediately after losing his white house job, however, the 27-year-old mcentee was hired by the trump campaign as an adviser. The hartfort courant has taken note of the news for an odd reason: it seems that mcentee once played quarterback for the university of connecticut, and he posted a video of trick throws on youtube back in 2011 that now has more than 7 million views. Mcentee first joined the trump campaign as a volunteer before being hired full time to serve as trump's \" body man. \" the journal describes examples of his former duties: \" he made sure mr. Trump had markers to sign autographs, delivered messages to him in the white house residence and, over the weekend, ensured that the clocks in the white house residence were adjusted for daylight-saving time. \" ( trump also lamented the recent loss of hope hicks. )",

        "summary": "It's official: theresa may is britain's new prime minister, cnn reports. After david cameron officially tendered his resignation wednesday, may bowed down before queen elizabeth ii and accepted the monarch's invite to form a new government, becoming the only woman other than margaret thatcher to hold the office. More on may's ascension: before may could take over, cameron said his last goodbye to 10 downing street — and to larry the cat, the wall street journal reports. The new york times compiles a \" 5 things to know \" list that covers the political ( she's a moderate in her party ) to the personal ( she collects cookbooks ). A guardian video profile fills in more blanks on may's rise to power. The bbc and the telegraph list what may can expect in her inbox and in her first days, weeks, and months in office, including the \" letter of last resort \" she has to pen right after she's shown her new office. Thatcher was known as the \" iron lady, \" and may has already started collecting her own labels. Nbc news reports that some of those include \" dull as porridge, \" and, in one hot-mic moment, \" bloody difficult woman. \" may has taken a particular shine to the latter. Speaking of women: may says she's going to fill her cabinet with them, per the guardian. Queen elizabeth has seen 12 prime ministers come and go before may during her reign. The washington post explains why it doesn't think may will be her last. Let's get down to brass tacks: is may good for the us? cnn examines five america-centric questions.",

Construction of trails and boardwalks at effigy mounds national monument, in iowa, required tribal approval and archeological investigation. But the park's former superintendent, phyllis ewing, and another official, tom sinclair, ignored such laws, documents released by the park service show. The area, which contains 200 mounds linked to 12 tribes, was treated as a place \" to walk your dog, \" a tribal leader says. Two of three boardwalks remain at the site; the construction was undertaken, park service workers say, to improve disabled access. In the process, artifacts were removed from the site. Ewing was fired in february — years after regional officials learned of the illegal activity in 2009. Sinclair has also left his position. A whistleblower-prompted investigation resulted in a 700-plus-page report which cites problems as early as 2001, national parks traveler notes. \" we've tried to understand how a park can behave so badly.

If the shroud of turin truly was jesus ' burial cloth, the reality is something more closely resembling a y, according to matteo borrini. The forensic anthropologist was curious about the left arm's bloodstains, which new scientist describes as the cloth's \" clearest \", and whether they were in step with what the body of a crucified man would produce. So he teamed up with an italian professor and recreated possible crucifixion positions, while donated blood dripped from a tube affixed to the professor's wrist. They determined that the shroud's marks are indeed consistent with someone who has been crucified — in a y position, with arms secured above the head. Borrini calls the position \" very painful, \" and one that could have led to death by asphyxiation. His findings are in line with those of two doctors who have studied the shroud and come to similar conclusions. And while borrini isn't making any claims as to the linen cloth's authenticity, he does say that if it's a forgery, it's a fairly remarkable one, since the blood pattern syncs so closely with what a crucified body would produce. ( another recent study suggests the shroud may have been created by an earthquake. )",

His parents say doctors told them their son's body had sustained more than 20 external injuries and that he also suffered internal injuries. \" my son's body was completely covered with scars, from top to toe, \" his mother told local media. His cause of death is not yet known, but the director and four teachers from the center have been held by police and the center is shut down as the investigation continues. According to the telegraph, it was an illegal camp that had already been ordered by officials to cease operations. The washington post runs down similar tragedies at other camps, including the beating deaths of a 15-year-old and a 19-year-old.

( hpq ) was sued by an investor over an $ 8.8 billion writedown that the company said was partly related to falsified finances at autonomy corp., the british software maker it bought last year. The shareholder, in a complaint filed yesterday federal court in san francisco, alleges that hewlett-packard issued false and misleading statements. The company concealed that it had gained control of autonomy based on financial statements that were unreliable because of accounting manipulation, according to the complaint. Hewlett-packard chief executive officer meg whitman and the company's former ceo, leo apotheker, are named as defendants, along with chief financial officer catherine lesjak. \"at the time hewlett-packard agreed in principle to acquire autonomy, defendants were looking to unwind the deal in light of the accounting irregularities that plagued autonomy's financial statements, \" according to the complaint. Hewlett-packard said nov. 20 that $ 5 billion of the total charge is due to accounting practices, which were disclosed by a senior executive at autonomy. Hewlett-packard said it referred the matter to u.s. And u.k. Securities regulators and will also pursue civil litigation.

In laboratory tests, people with low blood sugar were also the most willing to blast their partner with a loud, obnoxious noise in what they were told was a game, usa today reports. The results were similar no matter how strong a couple said their marriage was. Low blood sugar can trigger hormones that cause people to become aggressive and irritable, a professor of medicine explains to bloomberg. \" probably more regular and healthy meals could improve the dynamics of a relationship, \" he says, adding that counseling should be considered when diabetes is involved.",

That king was edward viii, most famously known for abdicating so that he could marry divorcee wallis simpson. But before he did so, an \" abdication crisis \" broke out, leading britain's home office ( which oversees police, mi5, etc ) to order that all calls between his residence at fort belvedere or buckingham palace and \" the continent of europe \" be intercepted; at the time, simpson was bunking with friends in france. It appears the bugging of calls was short-lived: a \" most secret \" memo confirming the interception is dated dec. 5, 1936, reports the afp; edward, who had not yet been formally crowned, stepped down on dec. 10, ending a 326-day reign. The files, released by the national archives, do not log any details of calls that may have been intercepted.",

White, like jordan, is a tsu graduate who has worked at small legal firms. Also today, bland's toxicology report revealed 18 micrograms per liter of marijuana in her blood when she died. That's high enough to indicate that she took the drug about five hours before her death — like in jail.

Ramirez explains to abc 7 that she grew suspicious of a fidgety man in her pittsburg store — her job is to watch for shoplifters — who then went out to the parking lot and stayed for hours, acting like a \" weirdo. \" at one point, she saw him grab his steering wheel and shake it. She took down his license plate number, just in case, then phoned it in to police later that night when she heard of an amber alert for a missing 7-year-old girl. ( descriptions of the suspect and car in the alert rang bells. ) sure enough, police soon tracked down and arrested 43-year-old suspect david douglas. They found the girl, too, and she's fine. \" what she did was what truly broke the case, \" an antioch police official tells the contra costa times. Walmart fires beer guy: a much lighter story, but no happy ending. Last week, a walmart manager in titusville, florida, suspected two men of stealing beer, so he went out to the parking lot to get their license plate as they were leaving. Mike dawson then jumped into the back of their pickup because he says it was the only way to avoid getting hit. Then came a high-speed ride over 15 miles, during which dawson signaled to another driver that he was in trouble. That driver pulled a gun and forced dawson's driver to slow down, allowing dawson to escape, reports nbc miami. Police later arrested the pickup's driver, who now faces kidnapping charges in addition to robbery charges. Walmart, however, has since fired dawson, reports wesh. He should have just taken the plate number and left it at that, says the chain. It's not the first time a walmart employee has been fired for trying to help.",

Doctors initially cited a gallbladder issue when the 30-year-old arrived at a hospital in western australia complaining of stomach pain. But when she returned two days later with worsening pain, a ct scan revealed \" something metallic \" was poking into \" quite a large loop of dilated, unhappy bowel, \" dr. Talia shepherd tells abc radio perth and popular science. \" something metallic \" turned out to be a nearly 3-inch-long wire from the patient's braces, which had been removed a decade earlier. \" we were all a bit dumbfounded, \" says shepherd. \" it wasn't what i was expecting to find at all. \" the woman \" did not recall ingesting the wire or having her braces wire go missing, \" reads a description of the \" unique \" case in bmj case reports. Shepherd describes the case as especially rare given that the wire must have been lodged in the digestive system for years. Normally, an item presents itself in the stomach soon after it's been swallowed because that's where \" it has a high risk of causing a perforation, \" shepherd says. In this case, doctors found the wire had punctured several spots in the small intestine, causing it to twist into what is known medically as a volvulus, reports live science. The wire was removed in an emergency surgery and the woman has since recovered, shepherd says. ( a 10-year-old girl swallowed part of a fidget spinner. )",

        "summary": "A mural inside newtown high school that paid tribute to victims of the sandy hook shooting rampage was created as a form of art therapy. But within two years, the administration became worried that despite its intentions, the painting of a dreamcatcher was upsetting some students. To address those concerns, painter lindsay fuori at the start of this school year colored over the words \" in loving memory \" and \" 12-14-12, \" a reference to the date of the massacre of 20 first-graders and six educators at the elementary school. Then in october, the newtown superintendent had her 10-foot-by-15-foot mural covered with plasterboard. The decision led to an online student petition rallying support for uncovering the painting, sparking debate about how to deal with the tragedy, and revealing the challenges that face administrators. Superintendent joseph erardi jr. Says students and families described struggles related to the mural. In a note to families, he wrote that he knew covering it up would be controversial, but he had to act. \" if there is anything i can do to support families who continue to recover and were most effected by 12/14, that has been my consistent practice, \" he tells the newtown bee. Fuori says the blank, white wall that now greets students at the top of a stairwell might cause more problems than the painting. \" a lot of students feel like they're being told to forget, and that's not a healthy feeling, either, \" she says. The mural depicts 26 green beads, footprints, and clouds along with the dreamcatcher, a theme she thought fitting because intrusive dreams and memories are common effects of post-traumatic stress.",

        "summary": "Apple's new macbook pros are due to be revealed on thursday. If images leaked by macrumors are to be believed, the refresh will continue a long-running apple tradition of removing beloved legacy features: the macbook air shed the optical drive, the iphone 5 introduced the lightning port ( making years of legacy chargers and docks useless ), and most recently the iphone 7 removed the headphone jack. Now, the new macbook pros appear to be removing the physical escape key in favor of a touch-sensitive oled strip and touch id. While the change isn't likely to be a problem for most regular users, it will be a major pain for one group of power users: programmers. As popular mechanics explains, the escape key is integral to quick operation of a popular text editor called vim. As this video shows, the escape key is used to toggle between editing and navigation modes. While the key could probably be remapped, many programmers have built up years of muscle memory, and the initial reaction to the news on twitter was total dismay. History has proven that people will probably get over it, though; and if they don't, external keyboards featuring escape keys will still work with the new macbook pros.",

An oled touch panel is located on top of the keyboard, where the function keys would normally be placed, and it very clearly supports touch id, as it is seen used with apple pay.as has been rumored, the touch panel, which may be called the \" magic toolbar, \" appears to be contextual, changing based on what's on the screen.

It looks like the 13-inch macbook pro is used in the images, suggesting the machine will gain speakers located at the side of the keyboard.thickness can't be determined from the orientation of the macbook pro in the images, but rumors suggest the new machine is thinner and lighter weight than existing models.

The condition, called congenital trismus, is so rare that his ottawa doctors still aren't sure how to help him. \" nobody can tell us if wyatt is going to be better in two years, five years, 10 years, or if he will be eating from a tube the rest of his life, \" said his mother, amy miville. He's already had one horrifying episode, in which he started vomiting but couldn't open his mouth to get it out. He was rushed to the hospital, crying and choking, and lost consciousness — but luckily suffered no brain damage, the ottawa citizen reports. The condition comes with other problems, too, like an inability to blink, use facial muscles, or swallow, so he drools more than most other young babies. Doctors think he might have a muscle problem — ct and mri scans have shown no signs of a fused joint or extra tissue — but anesthesiologists won't put him under so doctors can carry out a necessary muscle biopsy because wyatt's closed mouth blocks his airways, abc news reports. Now his parents have created a website to solicit advice from around the world, and nurses have emailed dozens of tips for raising a baby that's fed through tubes — but still, no grand solution. \" sometimes you ask yourself, why me? \" said wyatt's mom. \" but then it is what it is and we've made do. \" ( in other unusual pregnancy news, a woman is pregnant with another couple's twins after a mix-up. )",

As the curtain drew back during her pricing game to reveal her potential bounty, a surprised but mostly collected perez reacted, saying, \" these are really nice. \" perez says the reaction of the stunned audience was edited out of the show, per cnn. \" i just thought, ' oh, this is perfect … you cannot make this up, ' \" she tells people. \" it's not even that i ' m in a wheelchair, it's that i literally don't have feet. \" perez, a los angeles comedian who lost her legs in a 2004 accident, kept her sense of humor, tweeting a pic of her surprised reaction captioned, \" when you win a treadmill on national tv, but you have no feet. \" she also used her twitter feed to mention she's been \" popping wheelies \" since she won ( especially upon hearing gawker wrote about her ) and that she'd be all for an snl appearance.

Though pandas developed \" powerful jaws and teeth \" to break down up to 28 pounds of bamboo per day, the samples showed pandas process only 17 % of the bamboo they eat — meaning they can't extract maximum energy — mainly because their gut bacteria is meant to process meat, the los angeles times and bbc report. Rather than house bacteria common in herbivores that need to break down fiber, the pandas ' guts featured escherichia/shigella and streptococcus bacteria, similar to bacteria found in meat-eating bears, used to process protein. \" unlike other plant-eating animals that have successfully evolved anatomically specialized digestive systems to effectively deconstruct fibrous plant matter, the giant panda still retains a gastrointestinal tract typical of carnivores, \" lead researcher zhihe zhang says. Over time, other herbivores developed longer guts or produced enzymes that helped them break down plants. But whereas cows have four-chambered stomachs that help in plant digestion, pandas have only simple stomachs and short intestines, the guardian reports. They also have \" extremely low \" diversity in their gut microbiome, which researchers think could indicate an animal is less resilient to changes in their environment. That's especially bad news for pandas that lead a \" highly fragile lifestyle \" in a shrinking habitat. This combination of factors \" may have increased their risk of extinction, \" zhang says.

All told, the researchers counted 1,461 contagious yawns, which they found were far more likely to occur between people with close social bonds. But the gender discrepancy was a new find. Not only do the researchers link \" the higher empathic abilities of women compared with men \" to a greater tendency to catch a yawn, they go so far as to suggest that covering a woman's face can disrupt her ability to exert influence in social settings. \" the fact that female influence in social dynamics also relies on face-to-face emotional exchange raises concerns on the negative repercussions of having women's facial expressions forcibly concealed, \" they write.

As they probably should be, writes david ignatius in the washington post. Still, he finds a kernel of optimism in the changing dynamics of the region, particularly in \" a budding sunni arab coalition of saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, egypt and jordan. \" a key part of the new strategy revolves around getting hamas, which controls gaza, to move away from their hard-line backers in qatar. ( this is an \" offshoot \" of the current feud between qatar and its moderate arab neighbors, writes ignatius. ) this could bring gaza back into the fold of the palestinian authority, and a newly united pa could speak for all palestinians in future peace talks. \" the trump administration seems to envision an ' outside-in'strategy for breaking the palestinian-israeli stalemate, \" writes ignatius. \" the united states, it's hoped, could eventually bring together israelis and leaders of the major arab states for a peace conference, \" and the president's close ties with israel and gulf arabs could help on that front. The white house sees all this as a potential \" game-changer, \" but ignatius warns that 50 years of failed deal-making \" sadly warn us that a new initiative probably won't work. \" plus, president trump's troubles in the us won't help in the delivery of any promises.

In january, trump had this to say: \"when this group comes back, hopefully with an agreement, i am signing it. I will be signing it. I ' m not going to say, 'oh, gee, i want this or i want that.

It's possible it could have secured the final votes needed to pass had trump and the white house not vehemently opposed it and threatened a veto. The bill trump did support received just 39 of the needed 60 votes to pass.

A video of the stunt, posted to youtube, shows even the most skilled swimmers have trouble. After downing shots and booze shot from squirt guns, the team took breath tests to make sure they were totally hammered — one man's level hit 1.82 promille, or a bac of 0.182 — then jumped in the water and attempted to perform a winning routine. It wasn't all that graceful. Some of the swimmers could hardly stay afloat.

The protester, amanda cleveland, lay motionless on the street until taken to hospital, and was later released with bruises on her head and arm. \" the vehicle accelerated and struck her, accelerated very fast and struck her violently and she fell to the ground, \" says legal observer guy danilowitz, who shot video of the moment, per cnn. \" it was a very fast acceleration, not the way you would move with people around. \" cleveland called it a \" hit and run \" and said \" if i did that i'd be charged. It's a disregard for human life. \" the sacramento county sheriff's department confirmed the accident but said two of its vehicles were surrounded by demonstrators who were shouting and kicking. Channel 10 footage shows a crowd surrounding a vehicle as the deputy says \" back away from my vehicle \" and sounds his siren; he slowly pulls away, but the second vehicle strikes cleveland and leaves the scene. Several protesters later stood near the sheriff's station and chanted \" hit and run \" until a helicopter urged them to leave or face arrest, and they returned to the main demonstration. Protests have rocked sacramento since stephon clark, 22, was shot by deputies who said he had a gun, but realized it was just a phone. ( a private autopsy shows clark was shot eight times, mostly from behind. )",

The government accountability office explains that because the cost was in excess of $ 5,000, the epa was required to alert congress. Presidential appointees may make improvements to their offices up to that limit without telling congress, and the gao struck down the epa's argument, reports the washington post: that the nearly $ 25,000 spent on the booth and the $ 18,000 in installation costs shouldn't be classified as redecoration and therefore shouldn't be beholden to that limit. \" because epa did not comply with the notification requirement, the funds were not legally available at the time epa incurred the obligation, \" the gao found and reported in a letter to the senate democrats who had asked for the spending review, per the ap. The gao says the epa is legally required to report its violation to congress and to president trump, and a rep for the agency says it will get \" congress the necessary information this week. \" the gao did not pass any judgment on whether the booth was a justified expense; \" epa's failure to make the necessary notification is the only subject of this opinion, \" per the letter.",

The international group for historic aircraft recovery ( tighar ) had more than a decade ago pinpointed the pacific island of nikumaroro as the location where her plane likely went down; now, they say newly analyzed underwater sonar images taken during a 2012 island visit support their theory. What's described by deutsche welle as a \" grainy \" photo reveals something about 600 feet below the water's surface, says tighar: an \" anomaly. \" \" the most prominent part of the anomaly appears to be less than 32 feet long, \" explains tighar on its website; it notes the plane was 38 feet 7 inches long. Discovery reports that the anomaly \" lines up nicely \" with another possible debris field. \" if our theory about what happened is correct \" — that theory being that earhart's plane landed on reef flats but soon washed into the sea — \" this is exactly what we would expect to see in just the place we would expect to see it, \" the group's executive director tells deutsche welle. Now tighar is hoping to secure funding for an \" independent comprehensive analysis of all the sonar data \" obtained last year and a trip back to the island. In the meantime, a quasi-independent assessment from the inventor of the submersible vehicle used in last year's search lends credence: \" this target looks very promising.

        "summary": "You may think you can avoid coming into contact with the new guinea flatworm by simply not visiting new guinea, but the critter is closer to home than you might guess. Per the palm beach post, the potentially deadly parasite is proliferating throughout south florida, slithering from where it was first spotted in miami all the way over to cape coral on the southwest coast. It's a cause for concern, since once a rat eats one of these invasive invertebrates — dark worms with a thin orange stripe down their back, lee county agricultural expert roy beckford tells wftx — the rodent can then pass on a slew of spinal, lung, and brain diseases, including meningitis, to humans. Even if residents live in relatively rat-free areas, the worm is still a hazard: beckford explains that those who touch it can suffer skin problems \" because it actually vomits up this caustic substance. \" \" this is very serious, \" he notes. Indigenous to the south pacific, the flatworms likely showed up first in the miami area last year with shipments of tropical fruit and plants. It's now believed that they've been in the cape coral area since september, though no one knew what they were. The new guinea flatworms, with no natural predators to take them out, are also a menace to the environment, capable of causing damage to local flora and other small fauna like snails. Although the worms can reportedly be killed by dousing them with boiling water, beckford says residents who spot one should take a photo and contact the state fish and wildlife conservation commission at 888-ive-got1.

        "summary": "Variety literally became the spice of life for an illinois man: while sampling the wares at a hot-sauce shop in myrtle beach, sc, randy schmitz had a seizure that ended up being a blessing. Schmitz was visiting the pepper palace while on vacation last august when he decided to try flashbang, one of the venue's most fiery flavors — and after he did, he ended up convulsing on the floor, the chicago tribune reports. He eventually had a brain scan, and the results were shocking: he had an early-stage malignant tumor on his frontal lobe. Schmitz cut short his vacation, went back to illinois, and got the tumor removed within days — and finished his radiation treatment just before his wedding. \" if i didn't try [ the sauce ], i think something eventually would have triggered the seizure and i would've found out, but that … tumor would've grown in my head, \" schmitz tells the paper. Flashbang — described on the pepper palace site as an \" explosive sauce \" made of \" carolina reaper, scorpion, jolokia ( ghost ), and habanero peppers \" and served inside a \" collectible grenade \" — is so hot customers have to sign a waiver before tasting, the tribune notes. And while a northwestern memorial hospital neuro-oncology specialist tells the paper he can't be sure the sauce led to schmitz's seizure, it does have the potential. \" if you have a lot of hot sauce and you're sweating a lot, people can have dehydration and it can cause seizures, \" jeffrey raizer says. An amusing footnote: schmitz sent pepper palace an email thanking it for its role in saving his life, but he tacked on an apology. \" after the seizure first happened, my mom ran into the store yelling that the product was destroying me or something like that, \" he writes. \" she wants to say she is so sorry. \" ( one of the peppers used in flashbang is the world's hottest. )",

        "summary": "In further proof that size matters, the giraffe likely developed a long neck so males could battle each other for mates. If you've ever seen a male giraffe whip its foes, you ' ll know the neck can be an nasty weapon, with the added benefit that giraffes can reach vegetation others cannot, an animal behaviorist writes at the arizona daily sun. But while scientists know why giraffes have long necks, how they got them has been somewhat of a mystery. Now, a study suggests the giraffe didn't simply grow its long neck suddenly, or even steadily over millions of years. Rather, two bursts of evolution created the animal we know today. A researcher who studied 71 fossils of nine extinct and two living giraffe species says in a release that \" the most primitive giraffe already started off with a slightly elongated neck \" around 16 million years ago. Then 7 million years ago, the end of the third cervical ( c3 ) vertebra near the head of extinct relative samotherium began to stretch. The neck was elongated, but it didn't compare to that of the modern giraffe. Then around one million years ago, the back end of the same c3 vertebra started to stretch so that the vertebra reached the length it is today — about as long as the bone that runs from your shoulder to your elbow and nine times longer than its width. Interestingly, around the time of this evolution, another giraffe relative known as okapi — still found in central africa today — set off on a different evolutionary path as its neck began to shorten, researchers say. \" it's interesting to note that that the lengthening was not consistent, \" says a paleontologist. \" first, only the front portion of the c3 vertebra lengthened in one group of species. The second stage was the elongation of the back portion of the c3 neck vertebra. The modern giraffe is the only species that underwent both stages, which is why it has a remarkably long neck. \" ( think giraffes are silent? you're wrong. )",

            "The common response to the question, \"why are giraffe necks so long? \" is that giraffes evolved long necks because they allowed them to feed on higher leaves in the trees. Most people accept it without much thought, but that doesn't make it true. It's certainly true that giraffes are able to reach higher leaves than shorter animals, but that doesn't mean that this capability was a driving force in evolution. Giraffes actually spend very little time foraging on high leaves in trees, feeding primarily at shoulder or even belly height. When droughts make food scarce and competition for it is most intense, they eat low brush. During their evolutionary history, giraffes have grown proportionally more in their necks than in their legs, which is a physiologically costly way to increase height. These observations suggest that the advantage of reaching higher leaves is insufficient to explain the evolution of the giraffe's long neck. Just because an animal uses a feature in a particular way is no proof that it evolved for that reason. It's common in evolution for a trait to be co-opted for a different purpose.

A new study of fossil cervical vertebrae reveals the evolution likely occurred in several stages as one of the animal's neck vertebrae stretched first toward the head and then toward the tail a few million years later. The study's authors say the research shows, for the first time, the specifics of the evolutionary transformation in extinct species within the giraffe family. \" it's interesting to note that that the lengthening was not consistent, \" said nikos solounias, a giraffe anatomy expert and paleontologist at nyit college of osteopathic medicine. \" first, only the front portion of the c3 vertebra lengthened in one group of species. The second stage was the elongation of the back portion of the c3 neck vertebra. The modern giraffe is the only species that underwent both stages, which is why it has a remarkably long neck. \" the study, which includes a computational tracking model of the evolutionary elongation, is published in royal society open science.

The washington post reports nine out of 10 kids don't eat enough vegetables, and the problem of wasted veggies is only getting worse since the national school lunch program started requiring vegetables on every plate. After looking at \" plate waste data \" from 8,500 elementary school students, researchers discovered veggie waste increases with popular entrées, such as burgers or chicken nuggets, and decreases with entrées kids don't like all that much, such as deli sliders, the post reports. \"our study shows that optimizing entrée-vegetable pairings in schools \" results in more vegetables being eaten, researcher dr. Oral capps jr. Says in a press release. The study, published in august, implies schools are better off pairing popular entrées with the most popular veggies, such as fries and tater tots ( the research was funded by a potato lobby ), while saving the steamed broccoli for something else. On the latter point, cafeterias might have to get creative. One psychologist tells the post that schools have found success in serving vegetables on their own, thus eliminating the competition. \" we tested it with kids in school cafeterias, where it more than quadrupled the amount of vegetables eaten. \" ( or, just do what congress did and declare pizza a vegetable. )",

The bill could affect current and future homeowners in a few different ways, including by capping the deduction for state and local property taxes at $ 10,000. Under the current tax system, there is no cap on the amount of property taxes a homeowner can deduct.

            "Managua, nicaragua ( ap ) — tropical storm nate formed off the coast of nicaragua on thursday and was being blamed for five deaths in that country as it spun north toward a potential landfall on the u.s. Gulf coast as a hurricane over the weekend. The u.s. National hurricane center said the storm could cause dangerous flooding by dumping as much as 15 to 20 inches ( 38 to 50 centimeters ) of rain on nicaragua, with higher accumulations in a few places. It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 kph ) thursday morning and was likely to strengthen over the northwestern caribbean sea thursday night and friday. The storm was centered about 30 miles ( 45 kilometers ) northwest of puerto cabezas, nicaragua, and was moving northwest near 9 mph ( 15 kph ). Nate was fueling heavy rains across much of a region already soaked by torrential rains. In nicaragua,"

        "summary": "\" what other secrets about our past are still hidden in brazil's jungles? \" these are the musings of lailson camelo da silva, the man credited with stumbling across the \" amazon's own stonehenge, \" the new york times reports. Scientists had come across the huge granite blocks — a 2006 ap report say there are 127 of them, some as high as 9 feet tall, arranged in a circle — in amapa state along the rego grande waterway as far back as the late 1800s, but those explorers didn't place much significance in them. Then da silva, an ex-ranch foreman, found them: first as a teen in the 1960s while on a hunting trip, then again in the 1990s while helping deforest the jungle. And he'd stayed away for three decades for a reason. \" the place initially felt sacred, like we didn't belong here, \" he says, noting, however, that the site was \" impossible to miss \" when the trees were being taken out. A decade or so ago, brazilian archaeologists got money and permission to rope off the stones ( also known as the calcoene observatory ) and started studying them in earnest, taking measurements during the winter solstice and applying radiocarbon dating. The experts have dated the stone structures back around 1,000 years ago and believe they were set up as an astronomical observatory. This find, combined with other physical evidence in the amazon rainforest, appears to contradict earlier theories that the region had been \" untouched by humans \" in ancient times, save for tiny nomadic tribes. Some experts say more research is needed to definitively determine if these rocks were used for astronomical observations. \" it takes more than a circle of standing stones to get to a stonehenge, \" says an astronomy professor.

Husted, for his part, says he's \" very happy to be sued on this issue because the law is crystal clear, \" per the hill. Though maybe not as clear as he thinks: per the columbus dispatch, husted is citing the 2015 election manual, which says eligible 17-year-olds can nominate candidates for office — so other primary races, such as those for the us senate and state legislative positions, are fair game — but they can't elect candidates for office ( and in the ohio presidential primary, voters are technically electing delegates to nominate for them ). But democratic state rep. Kathleen clyde says there's no precedence for husted's interpretation, and the dispatch points out ohio's revised code, which says \" every qualified elector who is or will be on the day of the next general election eighteen or more years of age... Shall be entitled to vote... At the primary election, \" with no mentioned exception for presidential primaries. The sanders ' campaign also brings up in its suit a 2009 pamphlet put out by ohio's then-secretary of state that clearly shows eligible 17-year-olds can vote in the presidential primary, but not for \" one-time questions on issues like school levies or statewide ballot issues \" or for \" election of state or county central committee persons. \" sanders calls the block \" unconstitutional \" and adds \" it is an outrage that [ husted ] … is going out of his way to keep young people — significantly african-american young people, latino young people — from participating. \" ( one of the biggest political upsets ever: bernie's win in michigan tuesday. )",

Carlo goias was charged under new jersey's strict gun law, which requires permits for firearms, including the airsoft gun goias used while filming a car chase scene. Goias rejected a plea deal offer tuesday that could have sent him to jail for less than a year. He faces up to a decade behind bars because of prior felony convictions that prosecutors say include theft and burglary. \" i was shooting a movie — i wasn't committing a crime intentionally, \" goias says. \" robert de niro doesn't ask marty scorsese if he has gun permits. We're actors. That's for the production company to worry about. \" when he was arrested, goias was playing the body guard of a drug dealer in the unfinished film vendetta games. The car chase scene was shot in a residential neighborhood, prompting several neighbors to call 911. \" i pretended to shoot out the window; they were going to dub in the sound later, \" goias says. \" we get back, and within a couple of minutes we're surrounded by cop cars. \" goias said he spent four days in jail as friends and family raised $ 10,000 for bail. Goias'defense attorney says his client is innocent based on his intent, which was to act in a movie, not commit a crime. Some state lawmakers say goias ' case highlights the need for new jersey to change its gun laws. ( these 23 actors have served time in prison. )",

In fact the department's attorney sensed that things weren't going well and thus suggested a compromise — restore part of the ban. \" i ' m not sure i ' m convincing the court, so i want to make one really key point with regard to the injunction, and that is that it's overbroad, \" said august flentje, per bloomberg.

But as the new york times notes, one of the judges, richard clifton, sounded skeptical that was the court's role. \"why shouldn't we look to the executive branch to more clearly define what the order means? \" he asked. And opposing attorney noah purcell complained that \" they've changed their minds about five times \" since the order was issued about its exact terms.

Fifteen years later, marchionne has earned a description from the wall street journal as \" one of the last larger-than-life car-maker ceos, \" though that comes with sad news: the chief of fiat chrysler has died at the age of 66 after complications following shoulder surgery. He'd stepped down as ceo over the weekend as his condition deteriorated. As the head of fiat, marchionne made the bold ( and successful ) decision to merge his struggling company with an equally struggling chrysler at the height of the recession. Despite initial raised eyebrows at that move, the new conglomerate's stock prices have almost quadrupled over the past four years, and initial detractors now hail marchionne as an unconventional innovator. Marchionne was defined as much by his business acumen as his personal quirks: he liked to drive fast cars — he once totaled a $ 350,000 ferrari, per bloomberg — chain-smoked muratti cigarettes and guzzled espressos, and wasn't often seen wearing anything but a black sweater and jeans. \" i have the same clothing everywhere i live, \" so he didn't have to spend the \" three seconds \" making a decision on what to wear, per a 2011 interview. Marchionne, who was born in italy and moved to canada as a teen, was also known as a workaholic, per the journal, often carrying multiple cellphones and working every day of the week. \" i don't care what a tough guy he was to work for, he saved our company, \" a chrysler and jeep dealer in georgia tells bloomberg. \" he deserves a bronze statue. \" marchionne leaves behind two children, alessio and jonathan, with his estranged wife, orlandina.",
