        "summary": "This is the official facebook page for the black lives matter movement, one with more than 300,000 followers. Anyone searching for it over the past year would have been forgiven if they'd instead stumbled onto a different blm facebook page with more than double the number of followers. That one, however, appears to have been a fake, and facebook has suspended it after inquiries from cnn. The site in question had links to a middle-aged white man in australia, and at least some of the $ 100,000 it raised in the name of blm instead went to australian bank accounts. The site raised money through sites such as paypal, patreon, donorbox, and classy, all of which have cut ties. One aspect of the story getting attention: facebook had been receiving complaints about the site for months, including from authentic blm organizers, but didn't act. The man apparently behind the site is ian mackay, an official with a prominent workers ' union in australia. The national union of workers has suspended him and another union official in the wake of the allegations, and the controversy has caught the attention of australian prime minister malcolm turnbull. \" i haven't seen the details of that report, but any sort of dishonesty or fraud of the kind that's alleged is wrong — it would be illegal, \" he tells australia's abc. Mackay denied running the site to cnn, saying he buys and sells domain names as a \" personal hobby. \" he has registered several other websites with ties to black rights, including blackpowerfist.com. ( one of the biggest names in tech says he's defecting from facebook. )",

        "summary": "Dallas got a rather unpleasant wakeup call over the weekend: nearly 160 emergency sirens blaring throughout the city in tandem, in what rocky vaz, director of the city's office of emergency management, says was the result of hacking from \" someone outside our system \" but in or near the city, per the dallas morning news. The 156 sirens — which reuters notes are used to warn about dangerous weather sweeping in — started screaming at 11: 42pm friday and weren't completely turned off until 1: 17am saturday, going off for 90 seconds at a time at least 15 times, city rep sana syed says, per courthouse news service. Vaz told reporters an infrastructure hacking like this is a \" very rare event \" and that workers had to eventually power down the whole system when other methods of shutting off the sirens weren't working, the new york times reports. The washington post notes that jokes started circulating even as the sirens were still singing their late-night song. Some compared it to the end of the world, while rep. Rafael anchia put up a poll wondering if it was a mothra versus godzilla situation or perhaps a zombie apocalypse. But not everyone chuckled: syed told the times that some feared it was a bomb or missile, especially in the wake of us strikes on syria two nights earlier. Even though the city took to twitter to plead with locals not to tie up 911, there were more than 4,400 calls made in a four-hour span — about double what dallas usually sees on a friday night. Finding out what happened is now at the top of the dallas city council's long to-do list, with one city council member telling the morning news, \" you can put me down as terrified. \" ( firefighters sued a siren company for loss of hearing. )",

Luis and nair rodriguez were on a family outing to the movies with their 19-year-old daughter when nair and her daughter got into a fight that ended with nair slapping the teenager and leaving for the family car, followed by her husband. A witness ran into the theater lobby and told two police officers who happened to be there, dealing with two drunk patrons, that there was a domestic dispute going on outside. But officers apparently focused on luis, not nair, when they went to investigate; nair and her daughter say they beat him, koco reports. The confrontation ended with luis pinned on the ground by five men — in addition to the two police officers, there was a third off-duty police officer and two off-duty state game wardens who were all working security at the theater — as nair recorded the scene on her cell phone. \" please somebody tell me that he is alive, \" she says at one point on the recording. \" he is not moving. \" a medical unit was called, but luis rodriguez died; his autopsy results are pending and a medical examiner's report could be weeks away, kfor reports. The police chief says the officers ' actions were \" reasonable, \" though the three police officers were suspended with pay; he says pepper spray was used, newsok reports.

Amazonians will be able to break from their daily labors to walk amid the greenery along suspension bridges and climb into meeting spaces resembling bird nests perched in mature trees, where the company expects them to brainstorm — and perhaps even invent the next billion-dollar opportunity. Amazon's new headquarters was designed to project a forward-thinking company eager to help employees be more productive, creative and happy by providing a connection to nature. But the most trend-setting and appealing feature of the new complex is most likely its location: plopped between glass and steel high-rises on a busy street in downtown seattle where",
            "By patrick may / july 8, 2016 at 10: 16 am perhaps because it was stung so badly last year by the new york times whose writers called it a \" bruising workplace, \" or maybe to blunt other criticism of being disconnected from its hometown of seattle, amazon is now figuratively going full monty, offering the public guided tours of its seattle headquarters — as long as visitors don't bring binoculars with them. Criticized in the past by the local paper for being tight-fisted when it comes to helping local charities, amazon's headquarters tour site points out that the tech giant is the city's biggest private employer and one of its largest taxpayers. And it boasts that one of its unused buildings serves as a homeless shelter for families. \"several years ago, we made a conscious choice to invest in downtown seattle, even though it would've been cheaper for us to move our headquarters to the suburbs, \" says a note on site. \"we chose to commit to seattle because we believed it was the right choice for our employees and for the city. \" amazon has made previous efforts to show the public a friendly face: it currently offers open-houses at six fulfillment centers across the country.

        "summary": "\"it's a death sentence when people pick up a baby critter and turn it over to us. \" that's the message colorado parks and wildlife spokesperson joe lewandowski had for a group of people who tried to help a week-old baby deer last weekend in the la plata mountains, the denver post reports. According to abc news, the people believed the fawn had been abandoned by its mother, put it in their car, and drove it 30 miles to an animal shelter. Wildlife officers ended up euthanizing the baby deer, as that was \" the most humane thing to do. \" \"turning it loose in the wild would be cruel, especially since we don't know where it had been taken from or where its mother is, \" lewandowski says. Wildlife officials also didn't have a way to keep the fawn alive or teach it how to keep itself alive in the wild. Sadly, the baby deer would likely have been just fine had the group left it alone, people reports. Mother deer often leave their babies for a bit in order to feed themselves. \"the way i like to put it is, 'mom is taking a break from the kids, ' \" lewandowski tells the post. It's very rare for deer to actually abandon their offspring. In fact, in the rare instances they do leave their offspring, it's usually because humans have moved or touched the fawn. Lewandowski says the group was probably just trying to help in this instance, and they won't be prosecuted. He compared the \" unfortunate \" incident to the bison calf who had to be euthanized after visitors to yellowstone put it in their car, believing it was in trouble. ( similar tragedies have recently befallen harbor seal pups as well. )",

Bilgin ciftci is accused of insulting president recep tayyip erdogan — a prisonable offense in turkey — after sharing photos of the politician and gollum in similar poses. The judge on the case admitted he hadn't seen enough of the lord of the rings series to determine whether the comparison is insulting and appointed a panel of experts to study the character in detail. The experts include two academics, two behavioral scientists, and a tv and film expert, reports today's zaman, per the bbc. The panel will have two and a half months to study the character — the case has been adjourned until february — but it isn't clear how it will come to its decision. Ciftci's lawyer jokes the trial has become \" a case of saving the pride of gollum, \" per the telegraph. Though gollum is first introduced as \" a small, slimy creature \" and is known for eating raw fish, talking to himself, and appearing rather ugly, ciftci argues gollum is actually the hero of the series. It's an idea supported by many lotr fans because of how gollum helps frodo and sam. A few on social media suggest a comparison between erdogan and an evil lord would be more fitting amid what some call \" the worst crackdown on the press in the republic's history, \" per the guardian.

Weeks after a belfast court rejected facebook's efforts to stop the lawsuit, many other victims are considering their legal options, media lawyer paul tweed told the paper. \" a case like this risks opening the floodgates for other civil cases to be taken against facebook and other social media sites, \" he said. \" i can see it being a very real problem for all the social media sites going forward. \" the stakes are \" seismic \" for the tech world if facebook is found negligent of misusing private info and violating the data protection act, per the guardian. The case revolves around a nude photo of the 14-year-old that appeared on a \" shaming page \" on the social network. Facebook maintains it removes lewd posts once notified — as eu law requires — and cannot police the massive amounts of material that appear on its pages. A rep told the guardian there was \" no place for this kind of content on facebook and we remove it when it's reported to us. \" but victims ' advocates say facebook is not doing enough to combat shaming posts up front though it has the technology to do so. The company uses microsoft's photodna to tag child exploitation posts so they won't repeat, yet the photo of the 14-year-old popped up multiple times over 14 months, per cnnmoney. \" there is a widespread feeling that [ facebook ] is not doing enough to tackle content that their own terms and conditions forbid, \" expert john carr told the guardian. The results of public shaming can be devastating, as seen last month when an italian woman killed herself after a sex tape went viral. The suicide came even after tiziana cantone, 31, had won a legal case to have the material removed from social media and search engines.",

The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, is suing facebook ( fb ) and the man who repeatedly posted her photo on the social network.

Maria ellis perez, 55, a mold inspector from pompano beach, fla., gives treatibles chews made from hemp to one of her pets, a domesticated female skunk named ricochet.

About once a week he would violently convulse, foam at the mouth, and urinate on himself for several minutes before recovering an or so hour later. The medication he was given seriously disoriented him, was harmful to his liver and for the most part didn't work. At the end of their rope, bernie's parents decided to put him on a pet supplement derived from cannabis. Gradually, his seizures became less severe and less frequent, before disappearing altogether. Despite a large amount of promising anecdotal evidence like bernie's story, and a growing industry of cannabis-based pet products, many people have a hard time taking medical marijuana for pets seriously. \"it sounds ridiculous, until you experience it yourself, \" said bernie's owner, anthony georgiadis, who says his dog hasn't had a seizure in four months. Living in florida, where medical marijuana is illegal, georgiadis orders bernie's supplement online from a california company called treatibles. He is allowed to do this because treatibles products are derived from legal hemp and contain little to no thc ("

On sept. 5, however, she broke out, swam across a lake, and started running when she got to the other side. It was then that jasmine ran into earl melchert, who said he saw a \" speck \" rushing toward him in his truck; he tells the new york times he thought it was a deer at first. As she got closer, he realized it wasn't a deer, but a missing girl he recognized from newscasts and posters around town. He got jasmine into his truck, called 911, and started driving the teen to the local police station. As they drove, jasmine saw a car driven by one of the suspects, which helped cops catch them the same day. But it was melchert's next \" incredible act of kindness, \" as the alexandria police department notes on facebook, that brought on even more hugs: he turned down the $ 7,000 reward and gave it to jasmine instead. \" he believes that young lady that came running towards him that september day is the real hero, \" the alexandria pd notes, adding, \" thank you earl, it is people like you that make this world a better place. \" melchert tells the press he was simply \" in the right place at the right time. \" jasmine is back in school and healing with the help of a therapy dog, while the three suspects — thomas barker, 32, a family acquaintance, as well as joshua holby, 31, and steven powers, 20 — have been charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, and criminal sexual conduct.",

As commenters poked fun of the interview online and wondered if it was legit, egyptair issued a grammatically iffy tweet in the article's defense, noting, \" this a professional magazine interview \" and naming the author as aida tekla, who it says is an ex-president of the hollywood foreign press association. The airline also retweeted a post from the alleged author, who misspells barrymore's name, says the interview happened in new york, and claims \" we interviewed her several times. \" a barrymore rep tells huffpost the actress \" did not participate \" in the article and adds her camp is \" working with the airline pr team. \" barrymore's camp also tells the bbc that tekla apparently penned the q&a based on a barrymore presser.

Outside magazine outlines the challenges faced by james sharman as he prepped for a gourmet meal at mount everest's base camp in december, an endeavor attempted at least once before but abandoned when the chef took ill with altitude sickness. Not only did sharman and his team have to learn in general about nepalese delicacies like goat spinal cord and yak yogurt, which they weren't terribly familiar with: they also had to figure out how to keep the victuals fresh during the nine-day trek to base camp and how to set up an entire kitchen and dining area on the icy landscape. This wasn't the first unconventional meal sharman and his crew had overseen. Since last year, sharman and his one star house party pop-up restaurant have been roaming the world, feeding free-spending diners in exotic locales such as bangkok and beijing. The 15 or so paying guests for the everest shindig, which sharman calls \" humbling, \" coughed up $ 1,050 for accommodations and food during the 14-day experience. \" looking back, i can't believe all the things that came together, \" sharman says. Some of the next few destinations on sharman's itinerary, which a september new york times article noted will span a two-year period: nairobi, reykjavik, and, per vogue india, a possible \" darjeeling limited \" experience in which sharman whips up a feast on a train that's chugging through india's tea country.

Scientists at vanderbilt university have developed headgear that sends a subtle electric current through subjects ' brains. It doesn't feel like much — just a little tingling at first — but the current appears to boost our learning ability, the researchers find. They tested the gizmo by measuring electrical brain activity among subjects after their brains were stimulated for 20 minutes. They were asked to deduce, by trial and error, which buttons on a game controller were associated with which colors on a screen, kurzweil reports. The study depended on the idea of an \" inner critic, \" says a researcher, per the daily mail. Our brains show a negative voltage spike when we make a mistake; it's what kurzweil calls an \" instinctive ' oops'response. \" in a majority of subjects who had received anodal stimulation — current running from their crowns to their cheeks — a spike in brain activity during the experiment was significantly higher. Those subjects also learned faster and made fewer mistakes than did a \" placebo \" group that didn't get brain stimulation. Among subjects who received cathodal stimulation — current running in the opposite direction — the spike was smaller and subjects messed up more frequently. In other words, \" we can make you more cautious, less error-prone, more adaptable to new or changing situations — which is pretty extraordinary, \" says the researcher.",

Herbst served in local government for years before being appointed to her current post last may, after the mayor died.

Herbst began living as \" jess \" last september and dressed as a woman at a town council meeting for the first time on tuesday. Reaction was \" phenomenally positive, \" she tells the times.

The leading politician became hostile to google after he searched his own name and found articles criticising him personally, leaked cables from the us embassy in beijing say. That single act prompted a politically inspired assault on google, forcing it to \" walk away from a potential market of 400 million internet users \" in january this year, amid a highly publicised row about internet censorship. The explosive allegation that the attack on google came from near the top of the communist party has never been made public until now. The politician allegedly collaborated with a second member of the politburo in an attempt to force google to drop a link from its chinese-language search engine to its uncensored google.com version. A cable from the beijing embassy marked as secret records that attempts to break into the accounts of dissidents who used google's gmail system had been co-ordinated \" with the oversight of \" the two politburo members. The cyber assault was described to the americans by a high-level chinese source as \" 100 % political in nature \" and having \" nothing to do with removing google...

However, there's some support for the theory in the behavior of birds ( descended from dinosaurs ) who help their parents with new babies instead of having their own; up to 8 % of birds do this. The scientists will further study their dino-sitter theory by testing the babies ' bones. If they are at the same point in development, they may be related.

A brawl ensued, and an outnumbered stone was stabbed, though the worker says he never cried out or stumbled, and didn't even seem hurt at first. After the fight, the woman left with the suspects, whom cbs sacramento says are two asian men who fled in a toyota camry. \" i thought she was with the white guy the whole time because he was sticking up for her, but she ended up leaving with the asian guys, \" the worker says. A taxi driver who also saw the fight echoes the sentiment that stone was calm and collected after the stabbing; he also tells cbs a woman was indeed involved, though he says the woman in question was with stone: \" she tried to protect [ stone ] too but she got hit too. Like you know, big punch, like boom, \" he says. As for police, they say the fight appeared to be \" related to a nightclub incident \" and broke out between two different groups: stone's group and the attackers.

W. P. Andrew lee, who will be involved in the transplants. Some 1,367 male us services members are said to have suffered genital wounds in afghanistan and iraq from 2001 to 2013. Doctors have gotten the green light to perform the surgery on 60 of these men next year; the penises will come from recently deceased organ donors. With any luck, the defense department will foot the $ 200,000-$ 400,000 bill for some of the operations. Sexual function should return, doctors say, along with feelings of identity and manhood — as long as recipients can live with another man's penis. And biological children will be possible if the testicles aren't completely lost. But it has succeeded in only one of two past attempts; in the failed case, in china in 2006, the 44-year-old recipient had the transplant removed when patches of its skin died and he and his wife suffered psychological problems, urology times reported in march. Still, doctors say genitalia-loss is just too devastating to ignore. The wife of a paralyzed veteran learned that when she asked her husband whether he would want his arms or his penis functioning again, the military times reported last year. \" he's like, ' i don't care about my arms!

Cnn reports mcfarland faces charges he defrauded at least two investors who put up $ 1.2 million to back his ultra-luxe bahamas music festival that crashed and burned in april. Mcfarland and his partner, rapper ja rule, face more than a dozen lawsuits in connection with the scheme, per the new york times. A lawyer for ja rule tells the paper he hadn't been arrested and is not believed to be \" a subject of this investigation. \" acting manhattan us attorney joon kim says in a statement that beginning in late 2016, mcfarland used \" fake documents to induce investors to put over a million dollars into his company, \" fyre media, \" and the fiasco called the fyre festival. \" if convicted, mcfarland faces up to 20 years in prison. Festival-goers who paid $ 12k for tickets — and up to $ 400k for packages — to the festival pitched by celebrities like kendall jenner were \" promised a ' life-changing ' \" event, kim says. But instead of gourmet eats and top-flight bands, they got a \" disaster. \" when guests arrived at the private island of exumas, they found partially built disaster tents, little food or water — and no beer, per cnn. One lawsuit likened the scene, complete with feral dogs, to \" the hunger games or lord of the flies. \" bands like blink-182 cancelled, and people were left to fend for themselves. Twitter posts showed people crowding into the airport in an attempt to flee. ( german music festival plans underground pipeline for beer. )",

        "summary": "Donald trump had what the ap calls \" political whiplash \" after a wednesday that involved a speech in mexico where he softened his tone on immigration, and a fiery speech in arizona where he ratcheted his rhetoric back up again, vowing that there will be no legal pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally — and that mexico will pay for a \" beautiful \" border wall. A round-up of coverage: npr fact-checks trump's arizona speech and finds a number of inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and exaggerations. Among them: his claim that immigration is occurring at a record pace, when in reality more mexican immigrants left the us than arrived between 2009 and 2014, and his assertion that syrian refugees are arriving with \" no paperwork, \" when they go through an extensive screening process. The washington post reports that trump's visit to mexico, where he held a joint press conference with president enrique peña nieto, angered and baffled many mexicans. Radio host sergio sarmiento says hundreds of calls to his show have all been negative and the visit is going to do nothing to help the president's plunging popularity. Other commentators said the visit had \" humiliated \" mexico — and predicted, correctly, that trump would strike a very different tone in arizona. The difference between the two trump speeches \" was so jarring that his true vision and intentions on immigration were hard to discern, \" writes patrick healy at the new york times. The mexico trip was a gamble, but it isn't clear if it will win over any undecided voters, or if core trump supporters will stand by him after a shift away from a deportation-focused policy, he notes. In the us, latino trump supporters do exist, but there are fewer of them after the arizona speech, politico reports. \" i was a strong supporter of donald trump when i believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately, \" says jacob monty, a houston attorney who quit trump's national hispanic advisory council after the speech. \" what i heard today was not realistic and not compassionate. \" he is one of several prominent hispanic trump supporters to reconsider their stance after the speech. After the mexico trip, hillary clinton blasted trump as a flip-flopper far too unreliable to build personal relationships with foreign leaders, politico reports. \" it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again, \" she said. \" that is not how it works. \" the san francisco chronicle reports that there now appears to be",

What gives with the phantom vibration? maybe you wanted, or even needed, the phone to buzz. Researchers at the university of michigan have found that people with attachment anxiety — those insecure about friendships and other relationships — are much more likely to feel such phantom buzzes than those who'd prefer to be left alone, reports michigan daily. The researchers dubbed the problem \" ringxiety. \" someone susceptible might feel something on their skin, for instance, but because they're so primed to get a message, the sensation ends up feeling like a vibrating phone. Some even hear a phantom ring. \" it's a cultural phenomenon — so many people do experience it, and it's significant in the sense that we found personality traits that influence this phenomenon, \" says one of the researchers. The work builds on a study out of georgia tech estimating that 90 % of us have experienced the issue to some extent, mistaking \" tiny muscle spasms \" for an incoming text, reports the telegraph. And a post at van wrinkles notes that research at the dow international medical school suggests that a lack of sleep can make the problem worse. It finds the new study intriguing. Phantom buzzes are generally dismissed as minor annoyances, but \" they could be a sign of underlying issues with our friendships, \" writes jeremy grossman. \" now that's something worth examining. \" ( also, this is why you shouldn't sleep with your smartphone. )",

Washington state university researchers set out to discover whether glyphosate could be found in breast milk after a moms across america-sustainable pulse study last year identified traces in three out of 10 breast milk samples, per a press release. Wsu lead author michelle mcguire analyzed breast milk and urine from 41 women in or around moscow, idaho, and pullman, wash., agricultural areas where glyphosate is often used. Ten said they lived on or next to a farm or ranch and five said they'd mixed or applied glyphosate. However, none of the women's breast milk contained traces of glyphosate, even when detectable but \" extremely low \" levels were found in urine, researchers say. Researchers say they found no differences between women who lived on or near farms and those who didn't, or those who ate organic food versus conventionally grown food. \" the moms across america study flat out got it wrong, \" says mcguire, who presented her findings at a biology conference yesterday. \" the maa findings are unverified, not consistent with published safety data, and are based off an assay designed to test for glyphosate in water, not breast milk. \" some of mcguire's samples were analyzed in monsanto labs; others were verified at covance laboratories, a lab with no links to wsu or monsanto.

Lightning struck a google data center in belgium four times in rapid succession last week, permanently erasing a small amount of users'data from the cloud, the bbc reports. The lightning caused power failures and damaged a number of the disks used to store data. While most data from the affected disks was able to be recovered, google reports that data stored on 0.000001 % of the disk space is gone for good, according to a statement. Google took full responsibility for the loss of data and apologized to its customers for the \" exceptional \" event, reports nbc. Nothing from gmail, youtube, or google drive was affected, notes cnnmoney. The bbc reports data centers require more lightning protection than most buildings, as multiple lightning strikes don't have to hit the same spot to do damage and could cause trouble just by hitting a telecommunications cable connected to the building. Data centers typically have a system of lightning rods to protect them, but it is still possible for lightning to get through — though experts say the chance of it erasing data is very low. According to its statement, google is continuing to improve its infrastructure to protect cloud users. \" the durability of storage is our highest priority, \" the company states.",

Now meet lynsi snyder, a 36-year-old who has battled drug and alcohol use, sports bible-verse tattoos, and is married to a race-car driver. The kicker: she is in-n-out's president, just listed by forbes as the youngest woman among america's richest 400 billionaires ( her net worth: $ 3 billion ). Sporting black combat boots and piles of silver bracelets on each arm, she's also a traditionalist: \" it's not [ about ] adding new products. Or thinking of the next bacon-wrapped this or that. We're making the same burger, the same fry, \" she says. \" we're really picky and strategic. We're not going to compromise. \" all this fits in-n-out's history, a curious mix of tradition and dangerous living. Opened in 1948 in baldwin park, calif., by snyder's grandparents, the chain was led by her uncle for 17 years until he died in a 1993 plane crash. Snyder's father guy then became chair despite his drag racing and opioid habits; he survived three overdoses but died of heart failure at age 48. Snyder, meanwhile, went through two early marriages and substance abuse: \" it was like a black-sheep era of my life, \" she says. \" by the time i hit 22, it was pretty much over \" — but all that \" forced me to be stronger. \" taking the reins in 2010, she saw the company's value grow to nearly $ 1 billion as it expanded into texas and oregon. But snyder still sticks to the basics: no frozen meat, no microwaves, no heat lamps, no franchising, and no ipo. \" it's not about the money for us, \" she says, per people. \" unless god sends a lightning bolt down and changes my heart miraculously, i would not ever sell. \"",

One of the firm's partners, curt anderson, worked on cain's losing 2004 u.s. Senate campaign. Cain thinks he's the hired political gun who leaked details to politico, a washington trade publication, of alleged \"sexually suggestive behavior \" cain is said to have exhibited towards two women while he ran the national restaurant association in the 1990s. That story set off a media frenzy which has quickly put cain's campaign on the defense. In the summer of 2003, cain recalls briefing anderson — his general campaign consultant at the time — that sexual harassment claims were brought against him while he was chairman of the national restaurant association from 1996 to 1999. \"i told my wife about this in 1999 and i've got nothing to hide, \" cain told me wednesday. \"when i sat down with my general campaign consultant",

It also has republicans worried that the circus-like atmosphere is boosting president obama's chances of winning a second term. \"rick perry needs to apologize to herman cain, his family, and america for this despicable action, \" cain chief of staff mark block said on fox news wednesday evening. Advertisement cain told forbes magazine wednesday that he believed curt anderson, a former consultant on cain's unsuccessful 2004 senate bid in georgia, leaked the allegations. The former godfather's pizza ceo told the magazine that he had notified anderson he had been falsely accused of sexual harassment in case the issue came up during his senate run. Anderson now works for on message inc., a consulting group hired by perry's presidential campaign. He denied being the leak. \"i have great respect for herman and his character and i would never speak ill of him, on the record or off the record, \" anderson said in a statement, adding that he knew nothing of the allegations until he read about them in the media.

Here the californian had amassed a big block of frozen breast milk while traveling without her infant on an eight-city, 15-day business trip through europe, where four countries had already allowed the milk to pass, the sun reports. Seems airport security at heathrow's terminal 5 went by the letter of department for transport rules, which set the liquid-size limit at roughly 3.4 ounces unless the passenger is boarding with a baby, the bbc reports. Martinez's argument: more than 300 ounces of her 500-ounce milk supply was frozen, not liquid, and she was willing to put it in checked luggage. Security apparently said the milk might \" melt and become a liquid, \" and she couldn't check it because she had already crossed a border — so they confiscated it. Martinez says she begged, pleaded, and even cried \" out of sheer shock and desperation, \" to no avail. \" beyond literally taking food from my child's mouth, you humiliated me and made me feel completely defeated as a professional and a mother. \" heathrow says it was only following british law. ( another breastfeeding mom lauded delta for its first-class act. )",

The ring, which had been in england since the 15th century, sold at auction for more than $ 400,000 ( about 30 times its estimated worth ), the telegraph reports. Purchased by the puy du fou foundation, which runs a historical theme park in western france, the ring arrived home on friday, the bbc reports. The foundation's president praised the \" glorious return \" of a \" french treasure. \" inscribed with \" ihs \" and \" mar \" ( for jesus and mary ), the silver gilt devotional ring was made in about 1400. It will be officially unveiled this month, according to reports. Joan of arc herself describes the ring in transcripts from the trial that ultimately led to her 1431 execution in normandy ( then ruled by the english ) on charges of being a heretic and sorcerer. It is believed that she gave the ring to england's cardinal henry beaufort the day before she was killed at age 19. Centuries later, a man bought the ring in a 1947 auction for about $ 250. He passed it on to his son, robert hasson of essex, who discovered the ring's value after taking it to be appraised by timeline auctions. Committed to turning back an english invasion of france, joan of arc led forces into battle and advised french royalty. A devout catholic, who claimed to receive divine guidance, she was canonized as a saint in 1920.",

Moore, who was nabbed in galkayo while driving from the airport in january 2012, is currently receiving medical care. A german foreign ministry rep tells the ap that moore is at the german embassy in nairobi, kenya, though officials there denied that. The rep says that a crisis group from her organization, german police, and us officials working \" very closely \" together helped secure moore's release; the governor of somalia's mudug region tells cnn that local elders also played a part. Moore's mother, marlis saunders, wouldn't comment to cnn on whether a ransom was paid, but a pirate commander tells the ap that moore was exchanged for $ 1.6 million; the commander also reveals that the pirates were afraid the us would soon intervene using force. Moore had penned a number of stories before his capture explaining how somali piracy might be perpetuated by illegal european fishing, says an editor at pacific standard, for which moore freelanced. \" of all the people for the pirates to nab, \" michel todd tells cnn. \" i ' m not saying he was pro-pirate, but he was pro-truth, and that seemed like something that might have been helpful to somalis. \"",

But after spending seven years ( and $ 100 million, a third of which was financed by bank of america in 2013 ) refurbishing and expanding the estate, pereira and his wife, sion, have decided it makes more sense to sell the property given they now spend so much of their time in my seanna — a 185-foot yacht named after their young daughter. After being listed last year for $ 139 million before being taken off the market amid more construction, the \" trophy property \" is back up for sale for $ 159 million, making it the priciest private listing in the country. Miami-based agent mayi de la vega says she's already fielded a serious query out of dubai. So what does $ 159 million get you? the 60,500-square-foot le palais royale features 11 bedrooms, 17 bathrooms, entry gates gilded in 22-karat yellow gold leaf, a 3,000-bottle wine cellar, and a $ 2 million marble staircase.

The estate includes a night club, bowling alley, ice skating rink, imax cinema, go-kart circuit, 4,500-square-foot swimming pool with swim-up bar and water slide, a glass-bottomed hot tub suspended over the pool, six waterfalls, 1,300-gallon aquarium, outdoor pizza kitchen, and putting green. Oh, and the underground garage fits 30 cars, reports the wall street journal. \" no corner was cut, nothing was too expensive, \" de la vega says.

Yesterday, a judge overturned a state law banning the sale of foie gras, noting it interferes with a federal law regulating poultry products. The ban, in place since 2012, had been hailed a victory for animal rights activists as ducks and geese are force-fed corn to enlarge the liver. Now, chefs are celebrating \" culinary freedom. \" one tells the los angeles times he immediately shipped foie gras from new york to his restaurant in hermosa beach so it could be featured on his menu, saying it's \" going to be a little bit of a foie gras extravaganza. \" another compared the lifting of the ban to the end of prohibition. Indeed, \" duckeasies \" offering free foie gras in protest are now unnecessary, reuters reports. Restaurants and producers, who claimed to have missed out on millions in lost sales, argued the california law was illegal since the poultry products inspection act gives the federal government the authority to decide poultry ingredients. In siding with the eateries, the judge wrote, \" california cannot regulate foie gras products ' ingredients by creatively phrasing its law in terms of the manner in which those ingredients were produced. \" animal rights groups, including the animal legal defense fund and the humane society, promise to appeal the decision, with the farm sanctuary calling foie gras \" a product of egregious cruelty to animals, \" the san jose mercury news reports.",

California's bill outlawing foie gras passed in 2004 but the ban didn't go into effect until 2012.

While some california chefs planned to celebrate the return of fatty duck liver, animal rights activists said the state's hard-fought foie gras battle was far from over. California's bill outlawing foie gras passed in 2004 but the ban didn't go into effect until 2012. Foie gras producers and restaurants for years have lobbied to remove the ban, which gave rise to underground \"duckeasies \" that offered free foie gras or sold it as unlisted menu item.

Yesterday google, facebook, yahoo and other web companies took out full-page newspaper ads railing against the house's recently introduced stop online piracy act, even as supporters sung its praises at a hearing. \"the problem of rogue web sites is real, immediate and widespread, \" said sponsor lamar smith. The bill is backed by lobbyists from media and even pharmaceutical companies, who say piracy costs them $ 135 billion a year, the washington post reports. But tech companies say the bill would cause lawsuits and force them to shut down sites, since it makes them responsible for infringement from their users. Search engines also would be responsible for blocking links to infringing sites, according to the new york daily news. \"almost overnight, sopa has morphed into a full-on assault against lawful us internet companies, \" says the director of one industry group. Verizon is opposed, too, complaining that the law would force it to develop new technologies to block foreign piracy sites. ( a zdnet writer thinks sopa is an awful idea. )",

Then his luck got worse: police in mankato, minn., found a bag of powder in his car, and a field test suggested it might be meth, reports kmsp-tv. Cops didn't buy the 31-year-old's story that the powder was actually vitamins for his sore shoulder, so into jail he went. And there he sat for weeks, until a state lab test was finally ordered, and it confirmed that burrell's powder was perfectly legal. Authorities immediately released him after about three months in jail. \" i had been sitting in the jail since november with my bail set at $ 250,000, \" burrell tells the mankato free press. \" then, two days before trial, they dropped the charges and let me go. \" he says prosecutors had pressed him to plead guilty, but he declined. Burrell has a criminal history and acknowledges using drugs in the past. In fact, that's one more twist in the story: he says he had just completed a drug-treatment program before his arrest.",

        "summary": "They're already used by international spies and nosy neighbors. And one day in the future, drones may be used to save lives, reuters reports. Sweden scientists tested whether a drone could be used to rush defibrillators to people suffering heart attacks. The karolinska institute study found that drones beat ambulance time by about 16 minutes. Researchers sent drones to 18 locations within a 6.2-mile radius in stockholm where emts had responded to cardiac arrests between 2006 and 2013; the ambulance vs. Drone arrival times were then compared. The idea is that bystanders would act as life-savers and grab the defibrillators. While no actual heart attack patients participated in the study, defibrillators are commonly found in public places and are \" easier to use than a fire extinguisher, \" jacob hollenberg at karolinska tells the guardian. Cardiac arrest is a leading killer worldwide, with only one in 10 people surviving an attack outside a hospital, per reuters. \" every second is crucial, \" hollenberg tells the guardian. The results published in jama show that dispatchers got a drone in the air within a median time of 3 seconds of the emergency call, compared to 3 minutes for an ambulance; the median drone arrival time was 5 minutes, 21 seconds from time of call, versus 22 minutes for the ambulance. Larger-scale tests are needed, but hollenberg predicts drone defibrillators could be aloft in sweden within two years. Researchers are eyeing them for remote areas, too, though current laws in sweden and elsewhere require them to be operated within sight, per the guardian.

At the weekly standard, michael warren has narrowed it down to four likely suspects: larry kudlow, chair of the national economic council, whose free-market views don't always go over well in the white house. Kevin hassett, chair of the council of economic advisers, whose views on issues from tax reform to the military generally line up with those of the op-ed writer.

Mike pompeo, secretary of state and former cia chief. \" as someone fond of, and thought fondly of, by cia agents, pompeo could be particularly irked by the suggestion by trump and his supporters that a'deep state ' is at work against the president, \" warren writes.

        "summary": "A university officer in texas killed a student by shooting him five times at close range — including a bullet to the back that may have done him in, an autopsy reveals. The location of the bullets that killed 23-year-old cameron redus last year is old news, but family members say they're shaken by details from the autopsy, raw story reports. Namely, they don't get why redus was found lying on his back if the fatal bullet entered him from behind, the san antonio express-news reports. Other bullets entered redus in the left eye ( another candidate for the fatal shot ), upper chest, right hip, and left elbow, kens-tv reports. Police say christopher carter, a university of incarnate word police officer, spotted redus driving erratically on dec. 6 and approached the student when he parked at home. Carter told redus to put his hands behind his back 14 times, according to a mic on carter's uniform, and police say carter told him to stop resisting 56 times. Redus was reportedly sarcastic ( \" oh, you're gonna shoot me? \" he said ) and carter said he only fired at redus after the student grabbed his baton and attacked him. Redus ' blood-alcohol content was 0.155 — almost twice the legal limit for driving — but his family is standing firm: \" the extreme and brutal results of cameron's encounter with officer carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes, \" the family said.",

Steven spielberg's latest is enjoying nearly universal praise for its intense portrayal of the man and of american politics. Here's what critics are saying: \" this is less a biopic than a political thriller, a civics lesson that is energetically staged and alive with moral energy, \" writes ao scott of the new york times. Writer tony kushner \" fills nearly every scene with wonderful, maddening talk, \" and the result \" is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece. \" the acting is top-notch, raves peter travers of rolling stone. The supporting cast is superb — tommy lee jones turns in an \" oscar-caliber performance \" — and daniel day-lewis \" wears his role like a second skin and feels it down to his nerve endings … this lincoln can whisper across canyons. \" if you're expecting a saintly lincoln, think again. \" lincoln is smarter and tougher than that, \" writes ty burr of the boston globe. It \" neatly balances naivete and cynicism … in a way that flatters an audience's ability to think for itself. \" spielberg has often \" represented both the best and worst impulses of american film, \" and his \" biggest challenge \" was probably repressing the latter, writes andrew o ' hehir at salon. This could have been maudlin.

Another source tells the journal that martinez's 33-year-old girlfriend, who is pregnant, told investigators that he was a high-ranking member of the crips gang. She told investigators that she last saw him getting his hair braided at a barbershop near where the body was found — and she wasn't very surprised when he turned up dead. Police were able to determine his identity because a tattoo on his back of the virgin mary with a rose was mentioned in the missing-persons report.

        "summary": "Mark zuckerberg has somehow found the time to pick up some pretty impressive language skills: the facebook ceo amazed a crowd at beijing's tsinghua university yesterday by conducting a 30-minute q&a session in mandarin chinese, reports marketwatch. In his first public q&a in the language, \" we discussed connecting the world, internet.org, innovation, and the early days of facebook, \" zuckerberg says in a facebook post. So just how good is zuckerberg's mandarin? his vocabulary is definitely impressive, though his pronunciation needs work — at one point, he used the wrong tone ( there are four ) and said facebook had 11 mobile users instead of 1 billion, according to quartz. At foreign policy, isaac stone fish, himself a \" rusty \" mandarin speaker, was a bit harsher: \" i'd put it roughly at the level of someone who studied for two years in college, which means he can communicate like an articulate 7-year-old with a mouth full of marbles. \" still, as tech writer farhad manjoo tweeted, \" he learned mandarin while running a company. You spent your day on facebook. \" zuckerberg told the audience that he learned the language because he wants to speak with his in-laws in their own language, he wants to study chinese culture, and he relishes the challenge. Wired notes that zuckerberg faces another challenge where mandarin could be useful: trying to get facebook unbanned in china. ( in other facebook news, a court has ruled that a message sent via the site isn't the right way to tell your ex he ' ll be a dad. )",

But no body was recovered, and 28 years later, in 1940, a woman stepped forward claiming she was allison and knowing details only a family member would be privy to. Helen kramer claimed she was put into a lifeboat with a man who, before his death, told her of her true identity and revealed himself to be titanic designer thomas andrews, who was also thought to have died in the sinking. The wealthy allison family largely brushed her off over the years, and the story could have ended a mystery with her 1992 death... Except it didn't. Twenty years later, kramer's granddaughter, debrina woods, started republicizing the claim, posting to online forums, saying she intended to write a book on the case, and selling mugs and mouse pads. The allison family was equally unimpressed, and even took out a restraining order to prevent woods from scattering kramer's ashes over the family plot. Science to the rescue: a titanic researcher founded the loraine allison identification project, and tested mitochondrial dna from a relative of both allison and kramer. The word came last month: no match. Woods claims she still has proof the story is true; an allison family member calls it a \" colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years. \" ( in other titanic news, a theme park being built in china will house a life-size replica of the ship... That will \" hit \" an iceberg. )",
