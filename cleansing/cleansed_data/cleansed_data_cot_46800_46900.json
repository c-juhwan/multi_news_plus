        "summary": "Robert hinton had a chance to move on with his life. But the former inmate of riker's island — whose savage beating there by guards spawned a pending $ 450,000 settlement — was shot and killed thursday night outside a housing project in brooklyn, the daily news reports. Hinton had just eaten thanksgiving dinner with his family when the 28-year-old went home with his nephews and little sister, according to his aunt, lynette johnson. She says the family was still together when they heard news of his death. \" it was devastating, \" says johnson. \" it doesn't seem real. In the blink of eye you're gone. He was a beautiful person. \" another victim was shot in the leg and fled the scene, officials say. Police are still seeking the gunman. Hinton was just weeks from receiving his money over the beating he suffered at riker's in april 2012, the new york times reports. In his lawsuit, hinton said a captain and five guards shackled and beat him, fracturing a vertebra and breaking his nose; all six were later fired for the attack. Hinton apparently hoped for a new start with the payout, but his mom, parys johnson, tells the daily news that he \" felt like something was going to happen to him. \" she says her son was likely \" set up \" by people who believed he already had the settlement money. Hinton has a pregnant girlfriend, but it's unclear who, if anyone, will receive the money. Hinton had been linked to the bloods street gang and was serving time for shooting and injuring a man when the beating occurred. ( read about an innocent man who was \" tortured \" at riker's and later killed himself. )",

        "summary": "An alabama teacher has been suspended without pay after a lesson this week that had parents fuming. An unidentified female teacher at selma's brantley elementary was discussing current affairs with her sixth-grade class when a student brought up the michael brown shooting, the superintendent tells the selma-times journal. That's when the teacher reportedly told students to research the shooting, including where each bullet hit brown, before the class re-enacted the event in what one parent calls an \" absurd \" skit, per the new york daily news — though it isn't clear if the teacher was the one to suggest that idea. Wsfa notes the suspension was handed down yesterday after an investigation. Parent jessica baughn, who brought attention to the incident by posting about it on social media, called the teacher's actions \" nowhere near right. \" as part of the re-enactment, a white student shot fake paper bullets out of a gun, also made of paper, while a black child fell \" on the ground like he's dead, \" she says. \" i understand talking about current history, \" baughn adds, but \" they are teaching these children to hate one another when we're supposed to be teaching them to love one another. \" the superintendent said the teacher would return to the classroom in the future.",

        "summary": "In 2010, sonia vallabh noticed her mother acting oddly. \" she was fitful and couldn't really tell you if she'd been awake or asleep, \" vallabh tells cnn. Soon, the 52-year-old couldn't recognize her daughter and would spasm and speak in tongues. Upon her death months later, vallabh recalls her father, a doctor, warning, \" her disease was genetic. \" those words would change the course of vallabh's life. Vallabh and her husband both quit their jobs and are now getting their phds in biology at harvard medical school in the hope that they can find a cure for fatal familial insomnia before it takes her life. Ffi is caused by a gene mutation that vallabh has inherited as a member of one of the few affected families in the world. Says a member of another such family: \" it's been a disaster. A brutal suffering. \" research on ffi began in 1984 when an italian man named silvano urged sleep scientists at the university of bologna to discover \" the cause of the curse of my family. \" researchers watched as silvano, 53, struggled to sleep while his body jerked him awake, preventing the restorative stage of sleep. A brain analysis later revealed two sections of his brain's switchboard, or thalamus, had been destroyed by abnormal prion proteins, affecting the sleep-wake cycle. For now, relatives can only undergo a genetic test and wait for the disease to hit, usually in their 50s. But vallabh wants a different outcome. \" the hope has to be always that you find a cure, \" says a pathologist, who imagines a time when \" fatal \" will be erased from ffi's name. The bbc reported last year on a drug that may keep abnormal prions from forming. ( more on vallabh and her husband here. )",

But while on the ship's dance floor one evening, he was embarrassed to find that his shirt had become drenched in sweat. Concerned, he examined himself in a mirror, only to find that his pupils had shrunk to two tiny black pinpricks. It was the same glassy-eyed stare that had afflicted his father and two sisters at the beginning of their mysterious illnesses. He knew this was just the beginning. Tremors, impotence and constipation could follow.

But what really wracked our brains was not one word at all, but a kind of word, illustrated by merrian-webster's unusual choice for its annual \"word of the year \": ism. \"socialism, \" \"capitalism, \" \"fascism, \" \"terrorism, \" and \" communism \" were all among the most-popular searches this year, along with \"racism \" and \"feminism. \" as editor-at-large peter sokolowski told quartz, 2015 was a year of news stories that raised a whole host of abstract, difficult concepts we struggled to define — not just a single word around a single event, like \"bailout. \" he writes in an email, \"this simply seems to be a year of heightened anxiety in many ways. \" in a prepared statement, sokolowski noted that searches for \"socialism, \" while always popular, grew significantly this year because of presidential candidate bernie sanders'socialist policies ( and spiked following the first democratic debate, in which sanders gave an"

Greenwald was at the rio de janeiro airport at the time to meet partner david miranda upon his return to brazil, where they both live. Brazil's government released a statement calling miranda's detention unjustified, the guardian also wants answers, and now even lawmakers in the uk are calling for an explanation from police as to why miranda was held, the bbc reports. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation says it's rare for anyone to be held for so long under schedule 7 of the terrorism act 2000, which allows police to detain someone at an airport for as long as nine hours to question them about links to terrorism. But \" they never asked him about a single question at all about terrorism or anything relating to a terrorist organization, \" greenwald says. \" they spent the entire day asking about the reporting i was doing and other guardian journalists were doing on the nsa stories. \"",

Despite the fact that other parts of the law are still on hold, it is already stricter than similar laws in arizona, utah, indiana, and georgia. Three lawsuits, including one from president obama's administration, have been filed against the law, and the judge's ruling will likely be appealed.

Other bombs were found in the house. The radio bombs contained ball bearings and magnets, indicating that they were going to be attached to vehicles as in the india and georgia blasts. Thai authorities say the three suspects — who partied with prostitutes soon after arriving in the country — haven't revealed anything substantial under interrogation. Iran has denied any responsibility.

Kpix reports that on wednesday, some 20 potential jurors refused to serve on a jury in an unrelated stolen-goods case under santa clara county superior court judge aaron persky. \" i can't believe what you did, \" one woman told persky, referring to his lenient sentence for stanford sex attacker brock turner, the san jose mercury news reports. In other developments: lawyer barbara spector tells the new york daily news that in a 2011 civil trial over the alleged gang rape of a 17-year-old girl, she felt persky sided with the group of baseball players accused of raping the girl. Spector says persky allowed lawyers for the defendants to show facebook photos of the girl wearing revealing clothing months after the incident because they argued the photos showed she did not have ptsd. Persky has his defenders, who say he is fair-minded and not a man known for issuing harsh sentences — or bowing to public pressure. He has \" a reputation for being a thoughtful jurist and he has been fair and decent to our clients, many of whom come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds, \" a public defender in santa clara tells the guardian. In an open letter to turner's victim published on buzzfeed, joe biden praises her \" breathtaking \" bravery and \" solid steel spine. \" \" your story has already changed lives, \" he writes. \" you have helped change the culture. You have shaken untold thousands out of the torpor and indifference towards sexual violence that allows this problem to continue. \" rep. Ted poe, a former prosecutor and judge from texas, read portions of the victim's searing court statement in the house yesterday and called for voters to recall persky, the dallas morning news reports. \" this judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain't sin as long as good folk do it, \" said poe, a republican. \" the judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night. \" the huffington post reports that on the evening of june 15, lawmakers from both parties will spend an hour reading the stanford victim's statement in full in the house.

Not that moore is the sole pioneer on this landscape: other researchers at colleges and with pharma companies have been toiling away in labs seeking a similar remedy for the coughing, sneezing, and sniffling that the cdc notes is the main reason why kids miss school and grownups call in sick to work. Per an emory press release, even though scientists in the ' 60s were able to develop a vaccine effective against one type of rhinovirus, it didn't work against the many other varieties that exist; mashable pegs that figure at more than 160. So moore mixed together 50 different rhinoviruses — gathered from immunologist james gern, who keeps what he calls \" one of the world's biggest collections of kid snot \" — into one vaccine, \" like a bunch of slightly different christmas ornaments. \" post-vaccine, the monkeys had developed antibodies in their blood for 49 out of the 50 viruses; similar results were found in the mice. Moore is hoping to eventually test the vaccine out on humans. \" we think that creating a vaccine for the common cold can be reduced to technical challenges related to manufacturing, \" he says.

Laura was accused of adultery after she says her drink was drugged at a doha hotel in mid-march and she woke up in a stranger's apartment to find she had been sexually assaulted; when she notified police, she was arrested. Laura's lawyer says that she was on vacation at a hotel that permitted the sale of alcohol ( liquor is mostly illegal in qatar ). A former qatar justice minister tells al jazeera that defense lawyers would had to have proved \" no voluntary actions \" existed between the woman and the man, ided by dutch news as syrian national omar abdullah al-hassan. He claims the sex was consensual but that they argued after, prompting laura to file her report; he received a sentence of 140 lashes — 100 for the extramarital sex, 40 for drinking booze, none for rape. The burden in qatar of proving sexual assault is so strong that a man and woman walking together could be enough to convince officials that the woman gave the ok to sex later.

The majority had nothing but praise for director jj abrams'reboot of the beloved franchise, and even those who thought it was hit-and-miss say it's easily the best star wars movie since 1983's return of the jedi. A spoiler-free roundup: \" there are very few films which leave me facially exhausted after grinning for 135 minutes, but this is one, \" writes peter bradshaw at the guardian, praising abrams and co-writer lawrence kasdan for creating a movie that is both \" a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot. \" the force awakens \" is ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity, \" he writes. Abrams has \" united the original cast with a group of newcomers who mesh seamlessly with their elders, in an ensemble effort that brims with the chops and brio of a great jam session, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post, praising new cast members like daisy ridley who \" shoulder their responsibilities with skill and confidence. \" star wars fans are certain to love the movie, writes aa dowd at the av club, though he feels force awakens may contain a little too much nostalgic \" fan service. \" \" what abrams has done is strip star wars down to its core components, rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest, \" he writes. This is the best star wars sequel yet and one of the best movies of 2015, according to mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle, who's relieved that disney, which bought lucasfilm in 2012, hasn't turned out to be the evil empire. \" it's hard to imagine any star wars movie better than the one they've made, \" he writes. Abrams \" blends the old with the new, along with a fanboy's love and a director's skill, and the results are thrilling, \" writes bill goodykoontz at the arizona republic, who says even \" casual \" star wars fans — if they exist — will find a lot to love. \" what abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round: fun, \" he writes.

Researchers named the creature jaggermeryx naida, which translates to \" jagger's water nymph, \" a reference to the creature's jagger-like lips and its swamp habitat. The jawbone fossils of the creature suggest that, when it was alive some 19 million years ago, it was deer-sized and likely resembled a cross between a small hippo and a long-legged pig. A series of holes along the jawbone sets jaggermeryx apart from other species in its group. The holes likely held nerve endings for the chin and lower lip that would have given the animal a set of super-sized and sensitive lips, the researchers said. \" the animal probably had a highly innervated muzzle with mobile and tactile lips, thus the jagger reference, \" gregg gunnell, a paleontologist at duke university and co-author of the study describing the creature, said in a statement.

        "summary": "Your old science teacher was wrong: it turns out that not all fish are cold-blooded. Scientists have discovered that the opah, a deep-sea dweller also known as the moonfish, is, in fact, a warm-blooded creature and the first such fish ever found, reports livescience. Thanks to a unique set of blood vessels in its gills, the opah stays about 9 degrees warmer than the water around it. That may not sound like much, but the washington post explains that it gives the fish a huge advantage: most of the other creatures who live in the deepest and thus coldest parts of the ocean move at a snail's pace because of those cold temperatures. The opah, however, is a relative speedster, which comes in handy when hunting prey or eluding predators. \" there has never been anything like this seen in a fish's gills before, \" says nicholas wegner of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, lead scientist of a study in science. \" this is a cool innovation by these animals that gives them a competitive edge. \" a handful of fish can warm up parts of their bodies, but the opah warms up the entire thing. National geographic provides a sense of how it's done: \" the blood vessels carrying warm blood from heart to gills flows next to those carrying cold blood from the gills to the rest of the body, warming them up. So, while a tuna or shark might isolate its warm muscles from the rest of its cold body, the opah flips this arrangement. It isolates the cold bits — the gills — from everything else. \" the opah generates the heat needed to stay warm by flapping its large pectoral fins like wings while swimming, notes a post by the noaa at science daily.

        "summary": "A \" deepening political crisis and diplomatic embarrassment \" is how the new york times frames what british prime minister theresa may was left to deal with thursday after a scathing sun interview with president trump in which he faulted may's handling of brexit and noted she may have \" killed \" chances of a free-trade deal with the us. But at a friday press conference at may's chequers estate, trump did a 180, saying us-uk ties were at \" the highest level of special \" and praising may as an \" incredible woman … doing a fantastic job. \" he also said whatever the uk chooses to do after it ditches the eu is \" ok with me, that's their decision. \" may, for her part, added that the us was \" keen \" to forge a trade deal with the uk and that her nation would also forge similar deals with \" others around the rest of the world, \" per the bbc. Trump didn't pass up the opportunity to slam the sun for \" fake news, \" addressing his criticism of may in that article by saying, \" i didn't criticize the prime minister \" and lamenting that the sun neglected to include his praise for may in its \" generally fine \" story. He said he apologized to may for how the interview came off, to which he said may replied, \" don't worry, it's only the press, \" the independent notes. Trump also touched on immigration, saying it's been \" very bad for europe \" and is \" changing the culture \" there, and noted that at his upcoming summit with vladimir putin he planned to ask once more about meddling in the 2016 us election. \" i will absolutely, firmly ask the question, \" he said, per fortune, though he doesn't anticipate a \" gotcha \" moment with putin. \" there won't be a perry mason here, i don't think, but you never know what happens, right? \" watch the press conference here.",

Researchers at the university of houston and the university of illinois at urbana-champaign \" developed a flexible pixellated sheet that can detect light falling upon it and change its pattern to match, \" writes ed yong at national geographic. Their sheet can turn from black to white and then back to black, which the researchers admit is a far cry from the cephalopods ' mad skills. \" but it's a pretty good starting point, \" says one of the lead scientists. The technique borrows the general principle of the animals'skin, which has three layers, explains the bbc: \" the top layer contains the colors, the middle layer drives the color changes, and the lower layer senses the background patterns to be copied. \" scientists used photosensors to detect changes of light, and dyes responded accordingly. The research is funded by the us navy, but plenty of non-military applications are possible, including one suggested by an art professor in chicago who studies fashion. Think the opposite of camouflage, with material that responds to your surroundings: \" maybe you want your clothing configured so that you stand out from the crowd, \" says the researcher.

        "summary": "An unfamiliar name has suddenly become much more familiar this week in the wake of the james comey firing. It's that of deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, who has emerged as a leading, if reluctant, figure in the controversy. Rosenstein wrote a memo to president trump that criticizes comey at length, though he reportedly feels he was unfairly set up to be the villain in the firing. Related coverage: threat to quit: the washington post reports that rosenstein threatened to resign over the chain of events. As the story lays it out, trump had already decided he wanted to fire comey when he asked attorney general jeff sessions and rosenstein to write memos justifying the decision. But the white house has been suggesting that trump made his decision in response to the memos, particularly rosenstein's. ( update: trump himself said thursday that he planned to fire comey anyway. ) the memo: read the actual rosenstein memo on comey at the baltimore sun. The focus is on comey's handling of hillary clinton's email mess. What it doesn't say: though it comes close, the memo does not explicitly recommend that comey be fired, observes the los angeles times. Who is rosenstein? he's been deputy attorney general for only about two weeks, but prior to that the 52-year-old was a justice department attorney with an unusual resume: he served under george w. Bush and barack obama. In a profile, the atlantic notes that his \" integrity has been compared to that of jimmy stewart, the actor who portrayed egoless small-town heroes driven by bygone ideals: of right and wrong, and black and white in a world gone increasing gray. \" another profile at cnn echoes the point and calls him the \" unlikely hatchet man \" in the comey story. Now a target: a forward piece notes that rosenstein was confirmed to the justice department's no. 2 post by a vote of 94-6 in the senate, a feat of rare bipartisanship. But he's now being publicly criticized over comey, and the story raises the question of whether he ' ll be able to survive the \" growing firestorm. \" a plea to rosenstein: the new york times editorial board has written an open letter to rosenstein, asserting that trump has exploited his integrity and urging him to name a special counsel for the russia investigation, even if it costs him his job.",

Farrow said the network dropped the story, and when initially asked why, he said, \" you would have to ask nbc and nbc executives about the details. \" now, those details may be emerging, at least via a former producer with the network who spoke to the new york times and via the daily beast's sources. Nbc news very vocally denies the new claim that it tried to kill the story, and farrow had no comment. The beast lays out a timeline dating to november 2016, when farrow and producer rich mchugh decided to report on hollywood's infamous \" casting couch \" and were reportedly advised by nbc news president noah oppenheim to look into rose mcgowan's october 2016 tweet about rape at the hands of a hollywood exec.",

It is a redefinition, they say, that reflects an evolving society where puberty hits earlier, bodies develop into the 20s, and where young people leave home, get married, have children and gain economic independence later than ever. \"adolescence encompasses elements of biological growth and major social role transitions, both of which have changed in the past century, \" they write in the article, published wednesday. \"arguably, the transition period from childhood to adulthood now occupies a greater portion of the life course than ever before at a time when unprecedented social forces, including marketing and digital media, are affecting health and wellbeing across these years. \" the call for redefinition is an attempt to ensure health policy safeguards the future health of the 1.8 billion people aged 10-24 who make up more than a quarter of the world's population, according to the united nations population fund. \"an expanded and more inclusive definition of adolescence is essential for developmentally appropriate framing of laws, social policies, and service systems, \" the new article reads.

A police spokesman tells the times that after one of the group poked muralles with a stick, he backed up and accidentally spilled his coffee on a 15-year-old boy, who stabbed him to death. \" at least 10 people drove by and walked by this thing when it was going on, and we only got one call, \" the spokesman says. \" people just don't pay attention or are afraid to get involved. \" medics in an ambulance on its way to another call stopped when they saw muralles collapsed on the sidewalk, but doctors were unable to save him. A police spokesman tells the stamford advocate that people \" sickened \" by the killing eventually came forward, and two suspects, the 15-year-old and 22-year-old james mclamb, have been charged with murder. Mclamb allegedly beat muralles while the teen stabbed him repeatedly. Muralles had been living with his niece, who told the advocate last week that her music-loving uncle \" was one of those guys that never looked for trouble \" and had planned to save a little more money before returning to guatemala to care for his 92-year-old father.

Researchers say that at a conservative estimate, one in 25 of the thousands of people condemned to death between 1973 and 2004 is innocent and while 138 were exonerated and some were almost certainly executed, up to 200 were taken off death row and are serving life for murders they didn't commit, the guardian reports. The researchers — who employed a statistical method often used to assess survival rates of patients treated with new medical therapies — say being moved off death row tends to reduce the chances of exoneration, as the inmates ' cases are no longer treated as priorities and they have fewer options for appeals, scientific american reports. \" the great majority of innocent defendants who are convicted of capital murder in the united states are neither executed nor exonerated, \" the study concludes. \" they are sentenced, or re-sentenced to prison for life, and then forgotten. \"",

While camera crews filmed the whole thing. It was aired unedited, meaning viewers got to see every bit of kufrin's shellshocked reaction — and those viewers were not happy about it. It's not clear who raised enough money to pull this off, but entertainment weekly reports that there are now 16 billboards scattered around southern california and minnesota ( kufrin's home state ) reading, \" arie... Not okay, just leave. - everyone. \" the statement is a reference to luyendyk's insistence on sticking around after the breakup despite a sobbing kufrin asking him to go. Viewers also sent kufrin money for wine, buzzfeed reports, while time notes that a minnesota state rep has promised to draft a bill banning luyendyk from the state. Vulture, which called the breakup scene a \" spectacle of human misery, \" notes that while it was supposedly unedited, luyendyk's half of the split-screen cuts to black after luyendyk does, at one point, finally leave the house; when the video comes back, he's heading back inside, presumably at the direction of a producer. \" what seemed initially designed to show us a real moment between two people ended up doing something very, very different: it became a presentation of a man being puppeteered by reality-tv producers, and it became an indictment of a franchise plummeting to new depths of ratings-mining cynicism, \" writes kathryn vanarendonk. Buzzfeed notes that the show's ratings have been down all season, and by \" destroying \" kufrin in the finale, it did manage to boost those ratings. On tuesday's after the final rose live special ( spoiler alert! ), people reports viewers found out kufrin forgave luyendyk and, predictably, was named the next bachelorette; viewers also got to see luyendyk and runner-up lauren burnham, predictably, get engaged.",

Italy's highest criminal court today overturned her 2011 acquittal in the slaying of her british roommate and ordered a new trial, reports the ap. The court of cassation ruled that an appeals court in florence must re-hear the case against the american and her italian ex-boyfriend, raffaele sollecito, for the murder of 21-year-old meredith kercher. What this means for foxy knoxy: the issues under question:... Are still unknown. The specific issues that have to be reconsidered will be revealed when the court releases its full ruling — within 90 days. The bbc notes that the court didn't review the details of the case, but instead considered whether procedural irregularities occurred. What did the prosecutor say? npr reports that he argued that the appeals court had been too quick to disregard dna evidence. Will knox have to go back to italy? nope. Italian law can't force her to do so, though she could be found in contempt of court if she doesn't show up. There are no penalties for being in contempt, however. And if she's convicted? it's unclear what would happen next, though her lawyer yesterday said such a ruling could prompt italy to seek her extradition. The us would then have to decide whether it will comply. Alternatively, the two countries could work out a deal that would allow knox to stay in the us. How her lawyers reacted: they looked \" grim, \" noted the ap. How knox reacted: in a statement, she called the move \" painful. \" she described prosecutors'theory on her role in the murder as \" completely unfounded and unfair, \" and said, \" no matter what happens, my family and i will face this continuing legal battle as we always have, confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity. \"",

        "summary": "The new york times magazine has a lengthy profile of tim geithner ahead of monday's release of the former treasury chief's new book, and one bit in particular involving bill clinton is getting a lot of attention. Geithner had asked clinton's advice on appeasing populist anger in dealing with lloyd blankfein of goldman sachs: \"you could take lloyd blankfein into a dark alley and slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days, \" said clinton. \" then the blood lust would rise again. \" the washington post thinks that's interesting in the context of the 2016 election, considering that it could pit hillary clinton, seen as a safe choice by wall street, against the more populist elizabeth warren. Some other highlights, as spotted by politico: trying to leave: geithner says he began pushing president obama to let him step down in 2010, suggesting hillary clinton as his replacement. Obama resisted, however, even lobbying geithner's wife, carole. \" i knew it was kind of a hopeless cause — that if he needed to stay, he needed to stay — but i was not easily convinced, \" she tells the times. \"and that was probably a little surprising to the president. \" too big to fail: as treasury chief, geithner went along with the administration's reforms to end the concept of too-big-to-fail banks, but now he's got a different take. During a lecture, when asked about whether the principle still exists, he answered, \"yeah, of course it does. \" ending too-big-to-fail was \"like moby-dick for economists or regulators. It's not just quixotic, it's misguided. \"",

A judge yesterday threw out the men's 2011 convictions in the danziger bridge case, citing \" grotesque prosecutorial misconduct \" in a 129-page decision the new york times calls \" heated. \" judge kurt engelhardt gave both sides a month to figure out their scheduling issues in advance of setting that new date — though the family of ronald madison, one of the men killed, has urged the doj to appeal the judge's decision, noting that it \" re-opens this terrible wound not only for our family but our entire community. \" the times-picayune notes that the doj did release a statement yesterday indicating it was not happy with the ruling; it's reviewing both the decision and its options, per a rep. The misconduct: federal prosecutors in new orleans and washington made anonymous online comments about the case, both before and during the trial, on the times-picayune website, creating what the judge called a \" prejudicial, poisonous atmosphere. \" ( sample: one lawyer commented that the police department was \" corrupt, \" \" ineffectual, \" and \" a joke. \" ) the online comments were first revealed last year; the us attorney whose louisiana office was involved stepped down, as did two local prosecutors who made comments. But yesterday, the judge revealed a previously unnamed commenter: a doj lawyer in washington who helped ready the case for trial. In an article calling the judge's reversal a \" bitter pill \" for katrina survivors, the times-picayune notes that none of the prosecutors involved ever addressed the jury.",

Lauper sang \"the star-spangled banner \" before the women's semi-final match between serena williams and caroline wozniacki. \"o ' er the ramparts, we watched as our flag was still streaming, \" lauper sang, instead of \"o ' er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming. \" just as they did after christina aguilera botched the same lyrics during the 2011 super bowl, americans who were outraged as they watched and were outraged took to their twitters.

The show, especially the premiere that airs at 8pm eastern on abc, will have a distinctly trumpian theme, reports the ap. It seems that roseanne barr's namesake character, roseanne conner, voted for donald trump, a decision that has caused serious friction with sister jackie, played once again by laurie metcalf. A look at some of the coverage: her argument: in the show, roseanne explains her vote thusly: \"he talked about jobs, jackie. He said he'd shape things up. \" when jackie tells her to watch the news because things are now worse, roseanne shoots back, \" not on the real news. \" it's the most \" overtly political exchange \" not only in the episode but in all nine of the new episodes to come, writes joanna weiss at politico. She talks to executive producer bruce helford, who says the show will aim to get polarized families talking again, to \" put the whole discourse out in the open. \"",

The us has a complicated relationship with iran's revolutionary guards, which is accused of supporting groups like hamas and hezbollah while also helping the us fight the islamic state in iraq and afghanistan, the atlantic reports. While the revolutionary guards itself has never been listed as a terrorist organization by the us, individuals and groups associated with it have. Experts say trump designating it a terrorist organization would be a largely political move as the revolutionary guards has already had a number of sanctions placed on it by the us.

        "summary": "Protesters in chicago say they haven't eaten in eight days and will continue their hunger strike until a proposal to turn a former high school into a new \" green tech \" school is accepted. For years, members of the coalition to revitalize dyett high school have fought to preserve the school, which was to close after its last class of 13 students graduated in june, before chicago public schools decided to open it under a new name. Pairing with education experts at the university of illinois, the coalition has now proposed turning it into the dyett global leadership and green technology high school, reports dnainfo. But that's only one of three ideas on the table: not-for-profit group little black pearl hopes to turn the school into an art and design academy, while a principal brought in to phase out dyett wants to see an athletic school. Cps says it will make a decision in september. The chicago sun-times reports protesters have asked little black pearl to withdraw its proposal, noting just 5 % of the organization's students met or exceeded state standards last school year. \" in what sane society do they actually get a school? \" asks protest leader jitu brown. Yet little black pearl's founder has refused to pull out. \" if we're selected, we're going to bring forth everything we can to provide a great opportunity to children in that school, and if we're not selected we're going to support whoever is selected, \" she says. Protesters argue racism is alive and well in the debate, noting cps leaders initially ignored the coalition's proposal while calling for additional, inferior plans. Civil rights leader jesse jackson joined the hunger strike last week. \" we have to starve ourselves to have our voices heard, \" but \" we're undeterred, \" brown says. \" we ' ll be here until we get this school. \" ( chicago has closed many more schools, too. )",

        "summary": "The math isn't pretty: an official in harris county, texas, estimated wednesday that harvey has destroyed up to 40,000 homes in the houston area, reports abc news. Countless others have lesser damage. Now balance those figures with another: only 2 in 10 homeowners in the hardest-hit areas have flood insurance, according to a washington post analysis. It's all adding up to a devastating financial toll for homeowners. Details: $ 555 a year: the average annual premium for flood insurance in harris county is $ 555 this year, and the ap reports that more and more homeowners had opted to skip it. The percentage of those covered dropped 9 % in harris county alone over the last five years, and the plummet is even greater in certain parts of the county. One critic blames fema for not urging homeowners to recognize the need. Out $ 30,000: one homeowner on the outskirts of houston figured he was safe without flood insurance when he moved in several years ago, because he wasn't in a flood plain and neighbors couldn't ever remember seeing water in the street. He tells the ap that the decision will now cost him about $ 30,000. The rules: only those who live in a designated \" 100-year floodplain \" and who have a federally backed mortgage ( or a stricter private lender ) are required to get flood insurance through the national flood insurance program, explains quartz. ( the post adds that the data the government uses to designate flood zones can be years out of date. ) it's people outside such zones who are out of luck if they gambled on skipping — or perhaps mistakenly thought they were covered. A loophole: normal home insurance covers wind damage. Therefore, those without flood insurance might be able to collect if they can show that their home sustained water damage after the roof was blown off or windows blown out, per a separate ap story. Ominous quote: \" there are some early indications that this is going to have an exceptionally large impact on the number of people who are totally uninsured, \" says an insurance expert at accounting firm deloitte, per quartz. These people can get some federal relief, perhaps through low-interest loans, but a second loan on top of the mortgage might not be a feasible option for many homeowners. A new law: a law that goes into effect on friday across texas makes it more difficult for homeowners to sue insurers in a dispute, reports cbs news. Gov.

        "summary": "Amazon has a reputation for making returns easy — but many users have complained that the retail giant has banned them because they returned too many of their purchases from the site. People have been talking about such experiences for years, but a new wall street journal article brings new attention to the issue — and reports that dozens of users have told stories online of their accounts being canceled without warning and amazon informing them they will not be allowed to open a new one. Sometimes no explanation is given; sometimes amazon cites too many returns as the reason. Though amazon doesn't have an official limit on returns, its conditions of use state that it has the right to terminate accounts at its discretion. An amazon rep tells the journal, \" we want everyone to be able to use amazon, but there are rare occasions where someone abuses our service over an extended period of time. \" former amazon managers tell the paper that human employees typically evaluate cases after algorithms identify users with questionable activity, including too many returns, sending the wrong items back, receiving compensation for reviews, or marking an \" atypical \" reason for returns. \" if your behavior is consistently outside the norm, you're not really the kind of customer they want, \" says one former amazon manager. The journal spoke to a few people whose accounts were canceled, some of whom were able to get reinstated after much back-and-forth with amazon and others of whom weren't so lucky. At cnbc, todd haselton notes that traditional retailers also flag customers who return items too frequently, but he argues amazon shouldn't act like a brick-and-mortar store in this regard. \" when you walk into an electronics store or a clothing store, you get the chance to see a product and, often, even try it before you walk out the door, \" he writes. \" you don't get that same experience with amazon. \"",

According to the orange county register, orange county coroner's officials in california had misidentified the body. The mix-up began on may 6 when a man was found dead behind a verizon store.

        "summary": "As experts scramble to make heads or tails over wannacry, a global cyberattack unleashed friday that's affected up to 200,000 computers in 150 countries, some fear the worst is yet to come. According to the wall street journal, the spread of attacks has slowed down after a kill switch was activated by a stroke of luck, but even more computers may find the ransomware waiting for them when they log back into their systems after the weekend break. Here's the latest on wannacry: a primer: cnn's breakdown and timeline of the wannacry attack, which some are calling the largest cyberattack ever executed, will catch you up to speed on what happened. The attack exploits a vulnerability in microsoft windows. About ransomware: the anonymous attack comes in the form of ransomware, a type of malware that locks a computer's files, making it impossible to access them. On the locked screen, users are instructed to pay up a sum within a time frame — in this case $ 300 to a bitcoin account within three days. Tech blogger and expert troy hunt explains more in detail. Windows users: if you're using windows xp, upgrade quickly, advises a q&a in the irish times. If you're already infected, the fix isn't easy, but microsoft has the particulars. Are macs safer? in this case, yes. Wannacry affects windows systems, but not macs. Apple computers tend to field less attacks, but according to the international business times, it's not because mac security is impenetrable. Since pcs are more widespread, more viruses are written for them. Shoring up your digital security: the new york times outlines eight general steps that can help your digital thumbprint from mobile to desktop, like using apps such as signal or whatsapp when texting. Nsa's role: some of the key code utilized may have been created by the nsa, reports the bbc. It raises the question of whether government agencies should disclose the vulnerabilities they've discovered. Edward snowden concurs: \" in light of today's attack, congress needs to be asking @nsagov if it knows of any other vulnerabilities in software used in our hospitals, \" he wrote on twitter. Bitcoin in spotlight: bitcoin, the anonymous digital currency, saw a drop in value on friday from $ 1,800 to $ 1,600, according to cryptocoin news, before it stabilized to $ 1,700 saturday. Some experts think hackers might be trying to manipulate the currency to boost profits. The site looks at how the attack could affect the currency, for better or worse. Microsoft has offered",

In addition, we helped to reestablish power and water to the community of phortse where our work with the khumbu climbing center is focused and ongoing.

        "summary": "Monday's the day that the justice department has demanded to hear back from north carolina on whether the state is going to enforce its contentious public restroom law, reuters reports. The feds had warned the state via a trio of letters last week that the law — which requires transgender individuals to use bathrooms that match up with the gender they were designated at birth — flouts civil rights and is discriminatory, and could lead to a federal lawsuit. One of the letters gave gov. Pat mccrory until the close of business monday to offer his solution to \" remedy the situation, \" per cnn. But although mccrory has indicated he ' ll respond by day's end, the governor appears to be digging his heels in to stick by house bill 2, the ap notes, potentially risking both the suit and funding for his state. Ucla school of law attorneys estimate up to $ 4.8 billion in funding, mainly in the form of educational grants, could be at risk. During an appearance on fox news sunday, mccrory called the government a \" bully \" and framed the deadline as \" unrealistic, \" per cnn. Roy cooper, the state's democratic ag, scoffed at the time complaint, reports the new york times: \" governor mccrory signed hb2 into law in the dark of night after passing it in just 12 hours, and now complains when he's given five days to defend it. \" mccrory had been offered a one-week extension if he had conceded the law is discriminatory. On fox news he rejected that option. \" i ' m not going to publicly announce that something discriminates, which is agreeing with their letter, because we're really talking about a letter in which they're trying to define gender identity, and there is no clear definition of gender identity. \"",

Ohio state says it is looking into claims that urban meyer was aware in 2015 of domestic violence allegations involving former assistant coach zach smith, the new york times reports. The university announced that meyer had been placed on leave hours after former espn journalist brett mcmurphy published a report on facebook alleging that meyer's wife, shelley, had known in 2015 about two domestic violence incidents involving smith and his now ex-wife, courtney smith. Mcmurphy said his report was backed up by text messages. \" shelley said she was going to have to tell urban, \" courtney smith said in an interview, per the dayton daily news. \" i said,'that's fine. You should tell urban. We can't have somebody like this coaching young men. \" smith was fired last week after a court granted courtney smith a domestic violence restraining order. Meyer could lose his $ 7.6 million-a-year job if he is found to have violated ohio state's title ix sexual misconduct policy on reporting domestic violence allegations, the ap reports. In a statement, meyer said placing him on leave was a good move. \" this allows the team to conduct training camp with minimal distraction, \" he said. \" i eagerly look forward to the resolution of this matter. \"",

If you're a twitter user and set your fb page to post your tweets, you're seen as an active user – even if you never visit the site. With a world population of seven billion, the math is extraordinary simple: one in seven people in the world are on facebook. With just over two and a quarter billion of these connected to internet, then almost every other person has a facebook account. Anyway, just look how facebook is going to town to celebrate this moment. There's a brand new mission statement. Phew, those ten digits must have weighing heavily on zuck's mind for quite",
            "This morning, there are more than one billion people using facebook actively each month. If you're reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honor of serving you. Helping a billion people connect is amazing, humbling and by far the thing i am most proud of in my life. I am committed to working every day to make facebook better for you, and hopefully together one day we will be able to connect the rest of the world too.",
            "You know what's cooler than a million users? a billion users. And now facebook has just that. Yep, the social network birthed in a harvard dorm grew in eight short years to a membership that it says accounts for nearly one-seventh of the world's population. Not fake users or bots — which facebook tracks closely — but real humans who actively engage on the social network, a company spokesperson told today. Just so we're clear: as of sept. 14, one in seven people on this planet has been classified by the company as an active facebook user. Facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg shared the milestone in an exclusive interview with matt lauer, which aired thursday on today. \" i mean, it's just — an amazing honor, \" zuckerberg said of his social network's monolithic membership when he sat down with lauer last week at facebook's campus in menlo park, calif. \" to be able to come into work every day and build things that help a billion people stay connected with the people they care"

Among the most interesting races: in new york's 11th district, a man facing a federal indictment on 20 counts — who also threatened on camera to hurl a reporter off a balcony — is actually leading the race, both parties say. Republican rep. Michael grimm is ahead of domenic recchia in a red area of staten island, and recchia hasn't helped himself with befuddled discussions of policy, politico reports. In california's 52nd, a poll shows democratic rep. Scott peters with 45 % of the vote to ex-san diego councilman carl demaio's 46 %. Demaio is facing trouble over accusations of sexual harassment from a former staffer; he denies them, and police aren't looking to charge him. The gop is still hopeful. In west virginia's 3rd, an almost four-decade incumbent is grappling with koch-funded attacks pushing his association with president obama. Democratic rep. Nick rahall is now just behind republican evan jenkins in both parties ' polls — and if jenkins wins, republicans are poised to hold onto the seat for a long time. Here's an odd one: both candidates running in florida's 26th are caught up in scandals, and perhaps the weirdest is the accusation that democratic incumbent joe garcia ate his own earwax on tv, the daily beast reports. But opponent carlos curbelo has taken flak for calling medicare and social security \" ponzi schemes. \" in nebraska's 2nd, the race could hinge on an inflammatory ad. Former rnc chairman michael steele says the ad, which targets democratic state lawmaker brad ashford, is \" racist. \" the spot argues that ashford backed a \" good time law \" resulting in the early release of convicted murderer nikko jenkins. The district offers democrats a chance at a new seat, but some in the gop believe the ad could help the party keep it. Of course, some people think this election is pretty boring...",

But roy became stuck just shy of halfway through the 600-foot journey, reports india today, after his hair got stuck in the line's wheeler; within 45 minutes he was dead. Though roy wore a life jacket, he apparently didn't arrange for emergency aid. \" he was desperately trying to move forward. He was trying to scream out some instruction. But no one could follow what he was saying, \" says a photographer at the scene. In fact, india today reports that spectators, unaware of what was happening, continued to clap as he struggled. He eventually lost consciousness and died of a massive heart attack, according to doctors. Rescuers were able to remove him from the line after about 45 minutes. A sad coda: a friend tells the bbc that roy had told his wife, who was worried for his safety, this would be his last stunt. In 2008, he pulled the nearly 39-ton darjeeling toy train using his ponytail.",

The city, a unesco world heritage site known for its ancient ruins, was captured by isis last may. According to the bbc, one human rights group estimates that in the months since then isis executed at least 280 people. The mass grave found friday contained 42 bodies, 24 of which were civilians and three of which were children. They were soldiers or supporters of the assad regime and their relatives. Only some of the bodies have been identified so far. The reclaiming of palmyra by syrian troops last sunday is seen by experts as one of the biggest setbacks for isis in two years. But its months in the hands of the terrorist group took a toll beyond the loss of life. The ap reports many of the ancient ruins that once drew tens of thousands of tourists every year were destroyed by isis, including the 1,800-year-old arch of triumph, two roman-era temples, and a 13th century citadel. And what remains of the city following isis ' occupation and syrian and russian airstrikes is empty. Residents are too afraid of either violence from the assad regime or remaining isis landmines to return.

( associated press ) palmyra, syria ( ap ) — explosions rocked the ancient town of palmyra on friday and on the horizon, black smoke wafted behind its majestic roman ruins, as syrian army experts carefully detonated hundreds of mines they say were planted by islamic state militants before they fled the town.

New details as of this morning, per cnn and usa today: the alleged plan involved using pipe bombs to force those in the us capitol to flee; cornell and his partner were to be armed with assault rifles that would be used to take down officials and employees as they exited the building.

        "summary": "After centuries of mistreatment and nearly 50 years of mystery, a biblical painting in a dutch museum has finally been declared an authentic rembrandt. Experts say they needed \" csi-style \" tools to authenticate saul and david, which had been repeatedly over-painted in long-ago restorations and even cut in two at some point in the 19th century, possibly in an attempt to sell it as separate portraits of saul and david, the new york times reports. The mauritshuis royal picture gallery put the painting on display as a rembrandt in 1898, but a leading expert cast doubt on its origin in 1969. A restoration expert tells the ap the skepticism now seems unsurprising because there had been so much paint added there was none of rembrandt's left to see. Researcher used tools such as advanced x-ray techniques and paint sample analysis to determine that the dutch master himself, not one of his followers, created the painting in two stages starting around 1645, the times reports. Saul and david will now be the centerpiece of an exhibition focusing on the investigation's years of detective work. \" the analysis helped us to determine that the painting is in fact made up of 15 different pieces of canvas; three main parts — the saul, the david, and an insert of a copy of an old painting in the upper right corner plus strips all around the edges, \" the museum's director tells the ap. \" so it's a real patchwork. \" ( another recent art find: hitler's long-lost bronze horses. )",

Witnesses told police that kim had stepped out onto what's been described as a 2-foot-wide window ledge to take pictures and apparently slipped when one of the dorm's residents asked her to come back in a little before 6pm. The resident said he looked out the window after she fell and saw her lying on the sidewalk below. Kim, who suffered severe head trauma, was transported to thomas jefferson university hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Although police don't have anything to suggest the fall was anything other than a terrible accident, they ' ll be checking out surveillance tapes from nearby businesses and are in the process of getting a search warrant for the dorm room, according to the post-gazette.",

Navid azodi and thomas pryor, undergraduates at the university of washington, were recently awarded a $ 10,000 lemelson-mit student prize for inventing a pair of gloves, called signaloud, that convert asl to speech. The goal is to \" provide an easy-to-use bridge between native speakers of american sign language and the rest of the world, \" says azodi, who used non-verbal communication until age 7, per the christian science monitor. Sensors inside the gloves read hand position and movement, the data is sent to a computer via bluetooth, and the computer speaks the asl word or phrase in english. These aren't the first such gloves. \" some use video input, while others have sensors that cover the user's entire arm or body, \" pryor tells medical daily. However, \" our gloves are lightweight, compact, and worn on the hands, but ergonomic enough to use as an everyday accessory, similar to hearing aids or contact lenses. \" whether the deaf community is interested is another story: azodi tells npr the pair have been criticized for \" not understanding the [ asl ] culture. \" for example, a negative of a word in asl is often conveyed with a shaking of the head or a frown, which isn't possible with signaloud.
