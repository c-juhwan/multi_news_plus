On leave from a tour of duty in kosovo, pilot scott landis, 34, had taken to the skies with his brother, 29-year-old patrick landis, to spread the ashes over a cranberry bog, reports the boston herald. However, the single-engine plane crashed into a pond near hanson's cranland airport around 4pm. The airport owner cites \" engine failure on takeoff, \" per necn. \" the engine started slowing down, and [ scott ] started to turn to come back, and then you heard the engine drop off. \" \" we are all confident that he did the best that he thought he could do \" given the altitude and speed, a friend adds. \" it just didn't work out. \" it took 15 minutes to free the men, who were trapped in water, as first responders used \" sawzalls and hand tools to remove part of the aircraft, \" reports nbc boston. Scott, who reportedly borrowed the plane from its owner, was pronounced dead at a hospital, leaving behind a wife and 16-month-old son who are to receive more than $ 63,000 raised through a gofundme campaign.

One potential sign of good news: representatives of the protesters will meet with prime minister edouard philippe friday night. \" our message is that we are listening to them, \" says a government spokesman. A look at what the protests are about, and the mounting criticism on president emmanuel macron: the start: the original protests were over a fuel tax increase, part of a plan to steer france toward cleaner energy. Macron has since scrapped the tax hike in the wake of the protests in the first big about-face of his presidency, notes reuters. But the protests have gone way beyond that single issue at this point. Much bigger: \" this is now about so much more than fuel tax, \" one of the protesters, a 41-year-old single mom, tells the guardian. \" we seem to live in a world gone mad where the rich pay next to nothing and the poor are constantly taxed. \" the newspaper sums up the complaints: macron presents himself as a progressive to the world, but at home, he defends the old guard and is seen as \" an arrogant, would-be monarch. \" protesters now want reform on a wide range of cost-of-living issues. A pattern: the fuel tax \" was the latest of several reforms proposed by macron that would disproportionately affect france's least well-off, including abolishing a wealth tax, making it easier for companies to hire and fire employees, and fighting unions, \" per the washington post.",

But thicke's lawyer says all of this is just a response to the custody fight and thicke's claim that patton was violating their prior custody order by refusing him access to their son. \" paula never reported any domestic violence until she was in a position of contempt by violating the custody orders, \" the lawyer tells people. \" she is attempting to throw anything at him to hurt him. \" the lawyer also says that she expects la's department of children and family services to soon close the physical abuse investigation into thicke as \" unfounded, \" but says the department has added an emotional abuse allegation against patton that will continue to be investigated. A source close to the investigation, however, refutes both of those claims, and a dcfs rep reached by people seems to deny that the department handles emotional abuse allegations.",

More than three decades later, police have arrested a suspect in her murder, the news tribune reports. Gary charles hartman, 66, was booked into jail on suspicion of first-degree murder. Police have not yet said how they zeroed in on him, though a news conference set for friday was expected to shed more light on his arrest. \" this is completely from left field for us, i mean like way left field, \" says a neighbor of hartman. \" he had four or five collectible cars that he and his wife would always drive around. Very cordial and very sweet older people. The neighbors thought he was greater than sliced bread. \" records show hartman is a registered nurse with an active license, and a co-worker says in his current job he arranges community placements for patients who are discharged from the state hospital. \" he's gotten a couple of very troubled patients off the ward that have been there for decades, \" the colleague says, noting they were surprised by his arrest. \" it is so unfair that he's been out and living his life and doing whatever he wants to do and hers was cut short, \" a friend of michella tells komo. \" it has always weighed on my heart. \" oddly, a 13-year-old girl disappeared while riding her bike in the area five months later and was found dead weeks after vanishing; police long believed the two murders were connected, but ultimately dna tests revealed two different men killed the girls.

        "summary": "A new book about the trump administration zeroes in on kellyanne conway as the person responsible for much of the anonymous information springing from the oval office. According to ronald kessler, author of the trump white house: changing the rules of the game, conway is the \" number one leaker \" in president trump's white house. Kessler told cnn's jake tapper on sunday that the former campaign manager leaks more information to the press than anyone else in the white house. Kessler also painted conway as loose-lipped with criticisms of her colleagues, with unkind words to say about former chief of staff reince priebus, ivanka trump, and jared kushner. Another claim in the book centers around newly departed communications director hope hicks. Per page six, kessler claims trump's wealthy pals wanted him to fix them up with the 29-year-old former model. \"trump has told friends that billionaires are constantly asking him to fix them up with hicks, who was consumed by her work as communications director and until recently was never seen with a date, \" kessler writes. According to the book, trump told the author he denied the requests. Kessler's book will reportedly be an inside look at the white house akin to michael wolff's fire and fury, but with a more flattering take on the president. Kessler told cnn sunday he believes trump will one day be seen as a great president \" just like reagan. \" his book is due out tuesday.",

Police have interviewed the witness but say the new evidence is unlikely to result in criminal charges.

File - in this may 30, 2013 file photo provided by the murnaghan family, sarah murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in children's hospital of philadelphia with her father, fran, left,... ( associated press ) sarah murnaghan, who suffers from severe cystic fibrosis, was receiving the transplant wednesday at children's hospital of philadelphia, a family spokeswoman said. Her health was deteriorating when a federal judge intervened on june 5, giving her a chance at the much larger list of organs from adult donors. The case could bring change for other children, as another cystic fibrosis patient at the same hospital has also gone to court to be added to the adult donor list. The organ procurement and transplantation network says 31 children under age 11 are on the waiting list for a lung transplant. Murnaghan's mother, janet, said in a facebook post that the family was \" overwhelmed with emotions \" and thanked all her supporters. \" today is the start of sarah's new beginning and new life! \" she wrote. Last week, federal judge michael baylson in philadelphia ruled that murnaghan of newtown square, pa., and 11-year-old javier acosta of new york city should be eligible for adult lungs. Their families challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered. They said pediatric lungs are rarely donated. It was not immediately clear where murnaghan's donation came from. A message was left for a hospital representative. Janet murnaghan said the donor's family \" has experienced a tremendous loss, may god grant them a peace that surpasses understanding. \" critics warn there could be a downside to having judges intervene in the organ transplant system's established procedures. Lung transplants are difficult procedures and some say child patients tend to have more trouble with them than adults. The national organization that manages organ transplants this week resisted making emergency rule changes for children under 12 who are waiting on lungs but created a special appeal and review system to hear such cases."

            "A 10-year-old girl whose efforts to qualify for an organ donation drew public debate over how donated lungs are allocated was getting a transplant wednesday, her family said. File - in this may 30, 2013 file photo provided by the murnaghan family, sarah murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in children's hospital of philadelphia with her father, fran, left,... ( associated press ) sarah murnaghan, who suffers from severe cystic fibrosis, was receiving the transplant wednesday at children's hospital of philadelphia, a family spokeswoman said. Her health was deteriorating when a federal judge intervened on june 5, giving her a chance at the much larger list of organs from adult donors. The case could bring change for other children, as another cystic fibrosis patient at the same hospital has also gone to court to be added to the adult donor list. The organ procurement and transplantation network says 31 children under age 11 are on the waiting list for a lung transplant. Murnaghan's mother, janet, said in a facebook post that the family was \" overwhelmed with emotions \" and thanked all her supporters. \" today is the start of sarah's new beginning and new life! \" she wrote. Last week, federal judge michael baylson in philadelphia ruled that murnaghan of newtown square, pa., and 11-year-old javier acosta of new york city should be eligible for adult lungs. Their families challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered. They said pediatric lungs are rarely donated. It was not immediately clear where murnaghan's donation came from. A message was left for a hospital representative. Janet murnaghan said the donor's family \" has experienced a tremendous loss, may god grant them a peace that surpasses understanding. \" critics warn there could be a downside to having judges intervene in the organ transplant system's established procedures. Lung transplants are difficult procedures and some say child patients tend to have more trouble with them than adults. The national organization that manages organ transplants this week resisted making emergency rule changes for children under 12 who are waiting on lungs but created a special appeal and review system to hear such cases.",

        "summary": "\"lots of things he did were stupid, but in my view, he was a sage or a seer and didn't even understand what came to him. \" so says wealthy mormon david hall about joseph smith, the founder of the mormon church. Bloomberg has a fascinating deep dive into hall's plans to build a high-tech and environmentally sound utopia in vermont, all based on a vision smith had in 1833. Hall believes he can use smith's plat of the city of zion to revert vermont to two-thirds wilderness and one-third occupied farmland while increasing the state's population to 20 million. Vermont is currently home to only 626,000 people. Hall's foundation, newvistas, aims to create \"global environmental balance by building a network of environmentally and socially sustainable villages, communities, and megalopolises. \" to that end, he's spent nearly $ 5 million purchasing 1,200 acres of vermont farmland, where he one day hopes to house 20,000 people through high-tech space-saving solutions like transportation pods and furniture-rearranging robots. He says he has 150 engineers working on the project and plans for 1,000 newvistas communities around the world. But after his plan was discovered by a part-time librarian, hall's new neighbors in vermont have started to organize against him. \"we're really not that interested in what religious figures 200 years ago thought about urban development, \" a local professor says.

On a day when francis delivered a warm address to his cardinals and continued to project humility, the vatican seemed intent on quickly putting to rest questions about the pope's past, dismissing them as opportunistic defamations from anticlerical leftists. The swift response contrasted with past public relations challenges during the papacy of pope benedict xvi, when the vatican often allowed criticisms to linger without rebuttal. \"there has never been a credible",

Since his election on wednesday as the first non-european pope in nearly 1,300 years, francis has signaled a sharp change of style from his predecessor, benedict, and has laid out a clear moral path for the 1.2-billion-member church, which is beset by scandals, intrigue and strife. \" let us never give in to the pessimism, to that bitterness, that the devil places before us every day.

            "Vatican city — reacting with unusual swiftness, the vatican on friday rejected any suggestion that pope francis of argentina was implicated in his country's so-called dirty war during the 1970s, tackling the issue just two days after the pontiff's election. On a day when francis delivered a warm address to his cardinals and continued to project humility, the vatican seemed intent on quickly putting to rest questions about the pope's past, dismissing them as opportunistic defamations from anticlerical leftists. The swift response contrasted with past public relations challenges during the papacy of pope benedict xvi, when the vatican often allowed criticisms to linger without rebuttal. \"there has never been a credible",

        "summary": "Never heard of the term \"supercavitation \"? china's about to school us all with its announcement that it's making progress on a supersonic submarine that uses this technology, theoretically giving the underwater vessel the capability to zip along at the speed of sound, reports the south china morning post. A sub that can reach a top speed of 3,600mph could make it from shanghai to san francisco in 100 minutes, according to a california institute of technology report cited in the morning post. An engineering professor involved with the project says such technology could have future military, civilian transport, and water sports applications. Supercavitation technology works by surrounding an underwater vehicle such as a sub in an \"air bubble \" to cut down on water resistance against the surface area of the vessel. Two problems have previously hampered using this technology: the sub would have to be launched at more than 60mph to keep the air bubble intact, and steering inside the air bubble is extremely difficult. Chinese scientists claim they've almost got a handle on those two issues, though there are other problems they still have to tackle before such a high-tech submarine would be possible. For comparison, today's fastest subs crawl through the surf at a mere 46mph, according to the washington post — which doubts that even a sub using supercavitation would ever reach 3,600mph, but notes that torpedoes using similar technology have hit 230mph.

            "China has moved a step closer to creating a supersonic submarine that could travel from shanghai to san francisco in less than two hours. New technology developed by a team of scientists at harbin institute of technology's complex flow and heat transfer lab has made it easier for a submarine, or torpedo, to travel at extremely high speeds underwater. Li fengchen, professor of fluid machinery and engineering, said the team's innovative approach meant they could now create the complicated air \" bubble \" required for rapid underwater travel. \" we are very excited by its potential, \" he said. Water produces more friction, or drag, on an object than air, which means conventional submarines cannot travel as fast as an aircraft. However, during the cold war, the soviet military developed a technology called supercavitation, which involves enveloping a submerged vessel inside an air bubble to avoid problems caused by water drag. A soviet supercavitation torpedo called shakval was able to reach a speed of 370km/h or more - much faster than any other conventional torpedoes. In theory, a supercavitating vessel could reach the speed of sound underwater, or about 5,800km/h, which would reduce the journey time for a transatlantic underwater cruise to less than an hour, and for a transpacific journey to about 100 minutes, according to a report by california institute of",

        "summary": "Young french soccer star kylian mbappe had an amazing world cup and while some say it's far too early to compare him to pele, pele does not agree. After france's win sunday, the 77-year-old brazilian soccer legend, the only other person to score in a world cup final as a teenager, tweeted: \" if kylian keeps equalling my records like this i may have to dust my boots off again. \" mbappe, 19, is also the only person after pele to have scored two goals in a world cup as a teenager. The paris st. Germain player, who scored a total of four goals in the tournament, received the world cup best young player award. But the hype around mbappe does not appear to have gone to his head. The teen, who grew up in a deprived part of paris, is donating all his earnings from the world cup to a charity that helps disabled children take part in sports and carries out disability training in schools, usa today reports. Mbappe's earnings on the national team included a $ 350,000 bonus for france winning the tournament, which it last did in 1998 — a few months before he was born. In a rave review of mbappe's world cup performance, chuck culpepper at the washington post predicts that the \" sounds that crowds repeatedly made at the soaring 21st world cup figure to ripple across the earth for an mbappe decade to come. \" ( mbappe also high-fived a pussy riot member sunday. )",

And now researchers at the national institute of standards and technology have created the world's two most accurate atomic clocks. The next time they ' ll need to be reset — for a mere one-second delay — is in 50.8 billion years. The researchers ' paper describes the significance of the development: it's like \" specifying the age of the known universe to a precision of less than one second or earth's diameter to less than the width of an atom. \" the clocks, as all atomic clocks do, keep time using light frequencies and the fluctuation of atoms. But small movements of the atom or stray electric fields can interfere with the frequencies, so the new design — known as an optical lattice clock — minimizes these problems, holding the atoms in a vice-like grip, mit technology review reports. And while you're probably thinking no one should be that obsessed with being on time, there are real-world applications.

The crisis is centered in the state of borno, an area that was the focus of a major 2015 offensive against boko haram. As the militants were pushed out, the government initially thought the situation in borno was sustainable. \" it was only in april when we realized the magnitude, and the fact the government couldn't handle this alone, \" another un official tells the post. The nigerian government didn't call for international aid until june of this year.

A doctor fed her sugar water through a syringe. She locked her lips around it. Less than an hour after she arrived at the clinic, health workers decided fana needed to be evacuated to a hospital with electricity and more medicine. Xavier henry, the local coordinator for doctors without borders, called the cameroonian military for an escort. This is still a war zone, and access to roads is largely dictated by the armed forces in the region. But the request was rejected without explanation. Thirty minutes later, fana died. She had malaria and severe acute malnutrition. The baby's aunt carried the body back to their two-room home.

Politico counters that with its report, by way of two trump officials and three outsiders who are close to the situation, which puts trump in the oval office with priebus, former campaign manager corey lewandowski, and deputy campaign manager david bossie shortly after his international travels. The president has been toying with the idea of bringing lewandowski and bossie into the fold and reportedly said, \" i don't want them to come into this mess. If i ' m going to clean house, they will come in as fresh blood.... I ' m giving you until july 4. \" cbs news reports its own source backed up the july 4 deadline. But politico also casts plenty of doubt on the idea that the shakeup will come to pass, citing two former rumored shakeups involving priebus — at the 100-day mark and memorial day — that never materialized. On the much more speculative side, a source tells politico trump has floated ambassador of greece as a possible landing spot for priebus.",

        "summary": "Professional runner moninda marube came in second in a race tuesday but came in first in a more important one wednesday when he encountered two black bears. Marube says he met the bears early in the morning on a dirt road in woods near auburn, maine, the guardian reports. He says he can't swim, and knows better than to try to climb a tree to escape a bear, so he decided running was his only option when they charged. Marube says he managed to make it to a vacant house he had passed earlier. He got to the porch and closed the screen door with the bears just 10 yards behind him. Over the next few minutes, the two bears sniffed around the porch and looked through the screening before wandering off. Marube tells the lewiston sun journal that he encountered a leopard once while running in kenya, where he grew up, but the close call with the bears was much worse. \" i don't fear lion, \" he says. \" i don't fear anything else. But a bear is scary. \" marube says he plans to start his runs later in the morning and will carry pepper spray in the future. Authorities in maine say people who encounter aggressive bears are not advised to run. Instead, they should try to make themselves look larger while slowly backing away — and \" remain calm \" if they charge. Marube says he was aware of advice to \" stand your ground \" — but found it hard to follow it when the bears ran at him. ( this bear crashed through a bedroom window in alaska. )",

        "summary": "It had all the makings of fraud, or at least some level of incompetence: a kickstarter product that raised a ton of cash, didn't ship on time to backers, didn't work properly, and sent the manufacturer into bankruptcy. Not only that — it was the largest project out of europe ever taken on by the crowdfunding site, per consumerist. To get to the bottom of the whispering, kickstarter hired its own investigative reporter to find out what went wrong with the zano mini-drone. Mark harris calls his task a most \" unusual commission. \" he noted in a dec. 8 medium post that he wasn't affiliated with the welsh company behind the drone in any way and had \" no particular axe to grind. \" the creator, torquing group, raised almost $ 3.3 million on its original $ 175,000 goal, but seemed plagued by trouble from the get-go. To start with, when it came time for product to ship, pre-order customers got their drones first instead of the 12,000-plus backers who had plunked down money, consumerist notes. Then, when customers got their drones, the devices often didn't perform. Finally, torquing was forced to declare the european equivalent of chapter 11 because of a litany of errors, miscalculations, and a \" dangerous lack of self-awareness. \" but was it a scam? in a nutshell, no, though consumerist notes \" early videos may have been misleading, and no one ever saw the drones flying as promised in a demonstration … because they never did. \" ( the longer, more fascinating answer can be found in harris ' exhaustive take on medium. ) harris ' conclusion: \" kickstarter, and other crowdfunding platforms, should reconsider the way that they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money. \" ( other kickstarters that failed miserably. )",

The background to all this: after the attacks took place on saturday, trump tweeted, \" at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is ' no reason to be alarmed! ' \" that sparked a backlash against trump by critics who accused him of taking the mayor's remarks out of context. In an interview, khan had said people could expect to see an increased police presence on the streets and added, \" there is no reason to be alarmed by this. \" ( the exact quote is in the independent. ) at the time, a khan spokesman said the mayor \" has more important things to do than respond to donald trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks. \" on monday, after trump's second tweet, prime minister theresa may defended the mayor, though she didn't explicitly criticize trump, reports cnn. \" i think sadiq khan is doing a good job and it's wrong to say anything else, \" she said. Meanwhile, the acting us ambassador to london, lewis lukens, made a point on sunday via twitter to \" commend the strong leadership of the @mayoroflondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack, \" notes politico. Trump and the mayor have bad blood: khan, who is the city's first muslim mayor, criticized candidate trump's proposal for a muslim ban and called him a \" buffoon, \" notes the bbc.",

The clinton campaign doesn't see it the same way.

In one account, a woman says ailes demanded oral sex from her when she was a 16-year-old model appearing on the mike douglas show, on which ailes was a producer. Ailes ' outside counsel, barry asen, accuses carlson of \" attempting to litigate this in the press.... The latest allegations, all 30 to 50 years old, are false. \" asen also takes issue with carlson sidestepping the provision in her contract that states any \" disputes related to her employment \" must be settled by arbitration.

Mrs bruni said she did not know if her new baby, which is due next month, was a boy or a girl.

Or — as rachel feltman at the washington post puts it — you can blame climate change; only in this case lifeforms didn't enact enough of it. Chopra and fellow scientist charley lineweaver published their \" gaian bottleneck \" hypothesis this week in astrobiology. The study states extinction is the \" cosmic default, \" and planets \" need to be inhabited to remain habitable. \" \" life on earth probably played a leading role in stabilizing the planet's climate, \" lineweaver says in the press release. Under this model, rapid evolution is more important to the existence of life on other planets than their proximity to a star or the brightness of that star, the study states. But gizmodo points out gaian bottleneck doesn't account for why so-called gaian regulation is so rare throughout the universe: \" given that there are likely tens of billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy … it would have to be one hell of a bottleneck. \" ( but if alien life does exist, it apparently has a soft spot for florida. )",

Even so, the increased liquor spending is part of a recent trend: in fiscal year 2008, the department spent just $ 118,000 all year on alcohol; in 2011, that was up to $ 331,000; by 2012, $ 415,000. The booze, of course, is used at diplomatic events. Also in september, the state department spent $ 1 million on a granite sculpture by an irish-born artist, plus more than $ 300,000 on other works of art, the weekly standard reports. The sean scully sculpture is meant for the new us embassy in london.",

Four contracts were awarded in the last two weeks of september, including $ 1,000,000 for a granite sculpture by irish-born artist sean scully to be installed at the new u.s. Embassy in london. Notice of the awards was posted sunday afternoon of thanksgiving weekend on the federal business opportunities website.

The washington post looked into such incidents after a dog named trigger shot his owner over the weekend, and found 10 examples — and there could be more if the humans involved didn't report the shooting or seek medical care. The post offers up a convenient chart showing, among other things, the dates of each incident and whether it was a hunting accident ( yes, 50 % of the time ) or occurred in florida ( yes, 40 % of the time ). Many of the incidents involve things like dogs jumping into boats, a truck bed, or a regular bed and setting off guns laying there. In one awful case, a man who was trying to shoot a litter of puppies because he couldn't find homes for them ended up getting shot himself when one of the puppies put its paw on the revolver's trigger; nbc news reported at the time that three of the puppies ended up dead but four survived and were to be adopted. Only one of the cases ended with a human death, in 2008 when a dog jumped onto a gun in the bed of a texas hunter's truck, shot his owner in the thigh, and the man died of blood loss. During the same period of time, the post notes, one cat shot its owner as well; that happened in 2005 when a cat knocked its owner's handgun onto the floor and it went off, fox news reported at the time.",

        "summary": "Former meatpacking company exec sholom rubashkin will be going home to his 10 children after being the first person to have a sentence commuted by president trump. The 57-year-old was eight years into a 27-year sentence for financial crimes uncovered after a massive immigration raid on an iowa plant that provided around 60 % of the country's kosher meat supply, cnn reports. In a statement, the white house said many had called the rabbi's sentence \" excessive. \" the white house said a \" bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking and distinguished \" prosecutors, officials, and legal scholars had expressed concern about the sentence, as had dozens of members of congress from both parties. The move is not a pardon and does not vacate the conviction, the white house stressed. Rubashkin was found guilty in 2009 of submitting fake paperwork so that agriprocessors could borrow more money, the ap reports. He was acquitted in 2010 on state charges of violating state labor laws, and critics of the commutation say he should have been tried on federal immigration charges after the raid on the plant, which led to the arrest of nearly 400 undocumented workers. Former assistant us attorney robert teig tells the des moines register that rubashkin was probably iowa's largest employer of undocumented immigrants at the time. He \" couldn't win legally, factually, or morally, so he had to win politically, \" teig says. \" it's sad when politics interferes with the justice system. \" ( in his only other use of his clemency powers, trump pardoned former arizona sheriff joe arpaio. )",

        "summary": "Sorry, andreas gursky. A private buyer has set \" a new benchmark for the value of peter lik works \" with the purchase of a single photograph — for $ 6.5 million. \" phantom \" is a black-and-white version of the australian photographer's \" ghost, \" which for a time sat in a nature photography exhibit at the smithsonian. The arizona republic reports the photo shows a shaft of light penetrating an underground cavern in arizona's antelope canyon. \" phantom \" sold alongside photographs \" illusion \" for $ 2.4 million and \" eternal moods \" for $ 1.1 million, which, according to a press release, means lik has now sold four of the top 20 most expensive photographs ever — a fact that seems to amaze art critics, who have never been particularly taken with lik's work. \" if this is the most valuable ' fine art photograph ' in history, god help fine art photography, \" jonathan jones writes at the guardian, arguing the photo \" typifies everything that goes wrong when photographers think they are artists. \" a lawyer for the buyer says his client has chosen to remain anonymous, but \" someone has been very foolish with their money, \" jones says. Given such criticism, it's perhaps surprising that the washington post reports lik isn't one to be modest. His website describes \" phantom \" as a \" masterwork \" and lik himself as \" a true leader in the world of fine art. \" still, lik's unusual salesmanship — he's been featured on a jumbotron ad in times square, for example — has made him a hit with the public, the post reports.",

The \" robust \" link between blood sugar and brain shrinkage suggests that the definition of a normal blood sugar level might need to be changed, and that controlling blood sugar levels could help boost the brains of even non-diabetics, say the researchers. The study involved hundreds of australians in their early 60s, and the link remained even when factors such as drinking, smoking, and obesity were taken into account. The lead researcher says that while the study has no explanation for how high blood sugar can shrink the brain, the stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise associated with high blood sugar is likely responsible for poor brain health. More research needs to be done before any recommendations can be made based on the study, says a neurologist not involved in the research. \" to speak as a clinician and tell patients that they better cut out all candy because it will shrink their brain is a leap of faith, \" he tells webmd, but there's a simple way to have a healthy brain. \" it's just what all of our mothers told us: eat well and exercise, \" he says. \" that's a principle we would all do well to live by. \"",

A major appeal for low- and middle-income countries: cytisine costs $ 20 to $ 30 per 25-day treatment compared to $ 100 to $ 700 per eight-week course of nrt, new scientist reports. Like nicotine, cytisine \" alleviate[ s ] any urges to smoke and reduces the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, \" a researcher says. \" plus, if you do smoke while using cytisine, it will be less satisfying — making quitting easier. \" the \" old medication \" — used since the 1960s and produced mainly in bulgaria and poland — was also more effective than nrt in helping smokers refrain from smoking in the first week, and after two and six months. However, \" three out of every 10 people who used cytisine had a side effect, compared to two out of every 10 that used nicotine patches, gum and/or lozenges, \" an expert says. The side effects, including nausea and sleep disturbances, weren't serious and most sufferers said they would recommend cytisine anyway. ( guys, here's one good reason not to smoke. )",

            "By steven reinberg healthday reporter wednesday, dec. 17, 2014 ( healthday news ) -- the naturally occurring plant compound cytisine may be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy in helping smokers quit, a new study suggests. Cytisine, an acid-like chemical found in the seeds of the golden rain tree, has been used in eastern europe for decades to help smokers quit, researchers say. But it's not widely available. \" cytisine is one of the most affordable smoking cessation medicines available, \" said lead researcher natalie walker, an associate director of the center for addiction research at the university of auckland in new zealand. \" it is much cheaper than nicotine patches, gum and/or lozenges and other smoking cessation medicines, \" she said. \" however, currently cytisine is only sold in a number of countries in eastern and central europe. It is important that cytisine become more widely accessible and available. \" for the study, walker and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,300 men and women who called a national smoking quit line in new zealand to 25 days of treatment with cytisine or eight weeks of nicotine replacement therapy with patches, gum and/or lozenges. All participants also received telephone support. After a month, 40 percent of those taking cytisine pills said they hadn't smoked, compared with 31 percent of those who",

Cytisine, a plant extract commonly used in eastern europe to wean people off cigarettes, appears to be much better at the task than nicotine replacement patches and gums. Not to be confused with the dna building block cytosine, cytisine is an alkaloid extract from the laburnum or golden rain tree ( laburnum anagyroides ), which grows all over europe. It works by blocking nicotine's access to the brain's pleasure receptors. Like nicotine, cytisine is toxic when ingested in large amounts but is safe at low doses. It is produced commercially mainly in bulgaria and poland, and has been used as a quitting aid in eastern european countries since the 1960s but is largely unknown elsewhere. Clinical trials carried out in the 60s and 70s did not meet us and european standards so did not lead to wider adoption.

And they haven't mitigated the damage to roads, bridges, power grids, or crops either.
