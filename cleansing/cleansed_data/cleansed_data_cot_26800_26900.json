        "summary": "The georgia grad student who already lost her left leg to amputation will now lose her hands and her right foot to save her from a flesh-eating infection. Aimee copeland's life turned into a nightmare after a zip-line cut her calf during a kayaking trip. Shortly afterward she was felled by the often lethal necrotizing fasciitis, likely caused by aeromonas hydrophila, a bacteria found in fresh water. She's \" very responsive \" now after a battle for her life, but faces further amputation because the infection has already destroyed more blood vessels, according to a psychology department blog at the university of west georgia, where the 24-year-old grad student was studying. Her family is hopeful she will survive the devastating bacteria. \" seeing aimee this morning was so refreshing, \" her sister, paige, wrote yesterday on facebook. \" her eyes are wide open and she is nodding or shaking her head to the questions we ask. My hope for her recovery is stronger than ever! \" a \" love aimee \" vigil was held last night on the campus, and students were offering blood at jms burn center in augusta, where copeland has been hospitalized since last week, reports the atlanta journal constitution.",

Fans were throwing bottles, lighting fireworks, and damaging cars, a town official tells sea coast online, adding that main street was \" littered with glass. \" elsewhere in new hampshire, police reported \" riotous \" crowds in keene, where one student was hit with a thrown rock, while at plymouth state university, students set small fires around campus and ran around naked. A big riot also hit the umass boston campus, where police arrested 15, again using pepper spray to disperse a crowd of about 3,000, the daily new hampshire gazette reports. Students threw water bottles and toilet paper and climbed trees. Two were charged with assault and battery of a police officer.

But its torpedoes missed the schiff 40 while alerting the vessel to its presence. The schiff 40 proceeded to launch a lengthy attack on the tarpon using depth charges.

That changed last march when the owner of a war museum and an archaeologist discovered the wreck of the tarpon 130 feet below the surface of the north sea, the guardian reports. Danish divers explored the 275-foot submarine last week. The evidence of the tarpon's final battle was still visible in the wreckage. Two of its torpedo tubes were empty, and it had sustained significant enough damage that innes mccartney, one of its discoverers, says \" it would have flooded in seconds. \" one of the nazi depth charges even left a crater in the seafloor.

In fact, opdenkelder sued the company in march for $ 750,000 for lost income and mental distress. Freelance journalist julie beun, who profiled opdenkelder in the ottawa citizen in 2010, admits her editor would have been less interested in a story about a dating site had it not involved a strong, beautiful female leader who herself has a much younger partner. \" is it sucky of her to have done it? \" beun asks. \" yeah.

One meteorologist described the loss of ice as \"scary�?. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the arctic will withstand warming the longest. The sea off the north coast of greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as \"the last ice area�? because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet. But abnormal temperature spikes in february and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s. \"almost all of the ice to the north of greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile, �? said ruth mottram of the danish meteorological institute. \"open water off the north coast of greenland is unusual. This area has often been called 'the last ice area ' as it has been suggested",
            "On january 16, 2019, a new global study published in nature communications confirmed that permafrost is thawing quickly across much of the world. Between 2007 and 2016, permafrost temperature increased by 0.29â€ ‰ ± â€ ‰0.12â€ ‰ ° c globally. The greatest warming was seen in parts of siberia, up to 0.93â€ ‰ ° c. Significant warming was also seen in antarctica, and less in mountain regions. In much of the arctic ground temperature increased because of rising average air temperatures, while increased snow thickness in some areas also contributed to warming the ground underneath. Nikita zimov was teaching students to do ecological fieldwork in northern siberia when he stumbled on a disturbing clue that the frozen land might be thawing far faster than expected. View images sergey zimov measures permafrost levels with his granddaughters near the northeast science station which he founded in cherskiy, russia, along the kolyma river. About an hour away is zimov's large-scale scientific experiment pleistocene park, which he runs with his son, nikita zimov. The two believe that by recreating the ecosystem of the pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large mammals, they can slow permafrost thaw.

Turns out, the bust's visage is based on a portrait of a different john walker ( an actor who never set foot in stockton ), itv news reports. Though the error was discovered in 1993 after the national portrait gallery weighed in, it resurfaced recently during a meeting when a city council member asked a city official why the statue is \" hidden \" away in a local shopping center. \" i can reveal that the bust of john walker was inaccurately produced. It is the bust of another john walker, \" the official answered. Walker — the right one — invented the friction match in 1826, accidentally discovering that a chemical-coated stick caught fire when dragged along his hearth, reports the bbc. The chemist never patented the invention, \" perhaps hoping it would be used for the public good. \" stockton has a long history of misguided attempts at honoring walker: a brass plaque installed in 1893 misidentified walker as the inventor of the lucifer match — an imitation that came to market in 1829. A plastic match sculpture that went up in 2001 was subsequently removed because nobody liked it. But the echo notes an accurate plaque does hang where walker's pharmacy once stood, and city officials are trying to figure out where walker's house was so they can install another plaque there.",

Researchers say they've seen this link before, but wanted to test it using brothers who share similar dna to better control for genetic and environmental differences, reports livescience. So they looked at 30,500 men born between 1940 and 1950 in finland, all of whom became fathers before age 45, and then tracked these fathers until they reached 54. Among these dads, 15 % had their first child by age 22, 29 % between ages 22 and 24, 18 % at ages 25 or 26, and 38 % at age 27 or older. Reporting in the journal of epidemiology and community health, the researchers say that the older men are when they father their first child, the less likely they are to die in middle age. In fact, those who had their first child by age 22 were 26 % more likely to die in middle age than those who had kids at 25 or 26, while men who fathered their first child between 30 and 45 were 25 % less likely to die in middle age than those who were 25 or 26.

Thus this \" association between young fatherhood and midlife mortality is likely to be causal, \" they write.

Ge's disappearance and the missing money are part of a horrible six-month stretch for huishan, which claims it runs more dairy farms than any other company in china. In december, a us investment research firm accused huishan of fraud and reporting fake profits. And a few days after ge's letter, the company's stock lost 85 % of its value in a single day, reuters reports. The drop is still unexplained. In the weeks since, nine out of 10 board members have left huishan, the company's debt has ballooned to $ 3.9 billion, and 16 new legal proceedings have started against it.

In fact, scientists at the university of cambridge say stars cannot possibly get much smaller and still function as stars, per a release at phys.org. This one is 600 light-years away from earth and 2,000 to 3,000 times dimmer than our own star, aka the sun. In terms of size, it's more like a planet than a star — by way of comparison, it's slightly bigger than saturn but smaller than jupiter. Scientists spotted it while hunting for exoplanets and figured, based on its size, that it was an exoplanet itself. Their thinking changed, however, when they looked beyond the object's radius and focused on its mass. As it turns out, 57ab has 85 times the mass of jupiter, \" which makes it just massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium and become a true star, \" per popular mechanics. If it were any smaller in mass, 57ab wouldn't be able to pull off the feat of nuclear fusion in its core and thus wouldn't qualify as a star. Instead, it would be a measly brown dwarf. \" our discovery reveals how small stars can be, \" says the lead author of the study in astronomy and physics. A co-author tells the cbc he was surprised to find one so small. It \" likely represents the smallest natural fusion reactor that we know of, \" he says. \" we're trying to replicate fusion on earth in labs, but that's basically as small as it gets in nature. \" ( scientists have identified lord byron's famous \" star. \" )",

They say she scratched the other rider, pulled her hair, and bit her forearm, causing bleeding. The suspect fled when the train stopped at the 21st street and queensbridge station in long island city. The victim was taken to a hospital and is said to be in stable condition, while the attacker remains at large, the new york daily news reports. The nypd has released a picture of the suspect, shown here via cbs new york. ( if the victim was late to work that day, maybe the nyc transportation authority will give her a late note. )",

        "summary": "To all the women living in manhattan, now might be an economically sensible time to head over to soho and stock up on all your feminine products, because neighborhood pharmacy thompson chemists just might be waiving your 7 % \" pink tax. \" owner jolie alony tells gothamist that she wants to \" bring awareness on how it feels to be a woman, so the men actually get to feel it, \" by which she is referring to the fact that women pay roughly 7 % more for personal products marketed to women than they would for the equivalent product marketed to men, as a recent nyc department of consumer affairs report found. The 7 % difference is often called the \" pink tax \" or \" tampon tax, \" and the daily dot reports that there's more: women's clothes cost more to dry clean, for example, and in many states menstrual products are actually taxed as luxury goods. On monday, alony posted two signs out front: \" all female customers shop tax free \" and \" all male customers are subject to a 7 % man tax. \" it's a bit misleading, as time reports, given pricing didn't change at all for men but was dropped 7 % for women ( alony must still pay sales tax in full, so she's paying the difference out of pocket ). She wasn't sure whether she would continue the promotion past monday. And while she said that at the shop her female customers were \" very, very happy \" and the men \" just laughed, \" the story's gone viral and the pharmacy's facebook page is riddled with one-star reviews and comments decrying the store's \" sexist and hateful business practices \" and calling the owners \" idiots. \" apparently they didn't heed the pharmacy's request to \" please avoid locker room banter. \" ( read about why the trip a mom and daughter took to buy tampons went viral. )",

Paired with the wage gap, any extraneous costs lead to an even greater disparity in income between men and women. Now, one manhattan pharmacy is trying to solve that gap with a 7 percent man tax. Thompson chemists owner jolie alony told the daily dot she put up the sign today, and it's already gotten a lot of reaction. \"we thought it'd be a great idea with all the political things going on — with clinton being such a woman and the other guy and his womanizing, \" she said. Citing the \"pink tax, \" she said, \"we wanted to share that women deserve to get a break, and men deserve to be charged 7 percent more. Women are spending more in general and we make less, so we deserve to have a break. \" alony said a few couples have come in and gotten a kick out of the sign, including one woman who said 80 percent of the stuff in the bathroom belongs to her boyfriend anyway. \"other couples were a little upset about it, saying, ' fuck you, \" you're being a sexist, ' and to get a lawyer, \" said alony. \"we live in a big world, and i think we need to raise awareness. \" alony says it's up in the air how long the promotion will last, especially since \" the disclosure of differing prices or fees based upon gender by a retail service establishment \" is a violation of new york city pricing laws.

Jesse matthew was a student there at the time — and left that school for christopher newport university, where he was again questioned in a sexual assault case. That one took place on sept. 7, 2003, and similarly ended without charges, reports the daily progress. School officials provided matthew's timeline, which they classified as unusual, at the school: he came to cnu in january 2003; left the football team on sept. 12, roughly a month after joining it; and exited the university in mid-october, reports cbs6. That university is located in newport news, which has opened two cold cases from 2003 involving vanished women in light of matthew's recent arrest. Autumn wind day, 24, was last sighted at a food lion 2 miles from cnu on july 24, 2003; her car was left in the parking lot. Sophie may rivera, 31, disappeared on sept. 27, 2003, from her home, located 7 miles from cnu. \" while there are no indications that jesse matthew is connected to these two cases, both will be reviewed, \" an nnpd rep tells wavy. Another cold case that's getting a fresh review: the 2009 murder of cassandra morton. She went missing in lynchburg on oct. 10 of that year, one week before morgan harrington, whom matthew has been forensically tied to, also went missing, reports wdbj7.

In an off-the-record discussion with new york times editors, he revealed some flexibility on the issue — if a buzzfeed report can be believed. Trump held the conversation with times editors on january 5 as one of several candidates seeking the paper's endorsement. The times has revealed an on-the-record portion in a dispute with trump over his plan to slap tariffs on chinese goods, but trump's off-the-record chat has \" reached near-mythical status at the times, \" per buzzfeed. Just what did he say? according to buzzfeed's unnamed sources, times columnist gail collins may have given a clue in her saturday column when she wrote about trump: \" so you obviously can't explain how you're going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, because it's going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session. \" neither collins nor times editor-in-chief dean baquet would comment on the off-the-record conversation, and editorial page editor andrew rosenthal says the paper will only consider releasing it with trump's approval. Naturally, ted cruz and marco rubio are calling for trump to have the recording released, the washington post reports. In a cnn interview tweeted by cruz, the gop candidate says he wants the \" secret tape \" made public before super tuesday. But as the post points out, trump already revealed a willingness to negotiate on illegal immigration in a washington examiner interview in january. \" they are very strong positions, \" trump said about his immigration stance. \" it doesn't mean you're not going to negotiate a little bit, but i guess there will always be some negotiation. \"",

Trump visited the paper's manhattan headquarters on tuesday, jan. 5, as part of a round of editorial board meetings that — as is traditional — the democratic candidates for president and some of the republicans attended.

        "summary": "The 2016 race moves westward tuesday. Arizona and utah will vote for their candidates of choice, while idaho democrats will caucus, reports the ap. ( ted cruz previously took the latter state for republicans. ) it ' ll be a late one, with utah republicans permitted to vote online until 1am edt — and exact percentages really matter there. Here's what to watch: donald trump is expected to lose utah, but the big question is by how much. If cruz manages to secure at least 50 % of the vote, he gets all 40 delegates. If he doesn't, they ' ll be handed out proportionally, which the new york times sees as psychologically damaging to cruz and yet another boost for trump on his quest to secure 1,237 delegates. But maybe cruz can pull it off. Politico cites a survey released saturday that gives cruz 53 % of the gop vote. The thorn in cruz's side: john kasich, who the ap reports \" hopes to play spoiler \" and has been running an online ad that suggests mitt romney endorsed him. ( not so. ) the aforementioned poll has kasich at 29 %, and trump at 11 %. In fact, politico reports romney recorded a robocall monday that puts it plainly to utahans: \" a vote for john kasich is a vote for donald trump. \" arizona, with its 58 delegates, is winner-take-all. The hill notes it's the biggest such state left. Trump is expected to win it, though politico notes polling has been light in the state. Interestingly, marco rubio, who dropped out march 15, could end up with a decent number of votes here: arizona has a lengthy early-voting period, and it's possible a majority of votes have already been cast. On the democratic side, the hill notes that \" sanders has fared better in states with smaller percentages of minority voters — likely to be the case in utah and idaho. \" but all delegates are awarded proportionally, so a big win for sanders in arizona ( 75 delegates ) would have more impact than utah ( 33 ) or idaho ( 23 ), notes the hill. Still, \" a string of sizable victories could blunt the pressure on him to withdraw from the race, \" reports the times.",

The cook county state's attorney's office identifies the boy's alleged killer as corey morgan, 27, per the chicago sun-times. The chicago tribune calls him \" a reputed member of the terror dome faction of the black p stones \" gang. He had earlier been named as a person of interest. Police say tyshawn was killed in retaliation for the oct. 13 murder of morgan's 25-year-old brother; police previously said tyshawn's father had gang ties but his connection to that killing isn't clear. Morgan's mother was also shot in the arm during the oct. 13 attack, reports the sun-times. Police say tyshawn was \" lured \" into an alley on nov. 2. An autopsy shows he was shot in the right temple, and that the bullet exited his left. He was also grazed in the back, right forearm, and right hand. At a press conference friday, police said morgan and one other person are in custody and a third person is still being sought in connection with tyshawn's murder, cnn reports. Police say morgan was first questioned two days after tyshawn's murder, then arrested on nov. 17 after he was spotted leaving a hilton hotel with another man, dwight boone-doty, 21, who allegedly had a.40-caliber pistol tucked in his waistband. Police pulled the pair over a few blocks away and allegedly found another pistol in a bag morgan was carrying outside the hotel. Morgan — who was charged with possessing a firearm as a felon, previously convicted of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon — was ordered held on $ 1 million bail for that alleged crime but later posted the required 10 %, a move that \" drew gasps from the courtroom gallery, \" the sun-times noted at the time.

The 20-year-old told prosecutors in the altai region that his parents unexpectedly abandoned him in may, a local prosecutor told ria novosti. The young man has no papers, but said he was born in 1993 near the village of kaitanak in southwestern altai, the prosecutor said. \"he has no education, no social skills and no ideas about the world beyond the forest, \" the prosecutor said, adding that the young man's parents had lived in the forest since 1997. \"the young man is now still there, in his dugout, getting ready for winter, collecting firewood. \" he said that the local prosecutor's office will \"definitely help \" the young man",
            "Russian authorities have found a young man living alone in a siberian forest after having apparently spent most of his life living there in a hut with his parents, local officials said tuesday. Locals near the town of belokurikha found the man, who told the local prosecutor that he was born in 1993 and had lived in the forest since 1997, when his family decided to leave society. But his parents left him alone in the hut in may before he finally went to a nearby village to ask for help when the summer ended, the authorities said. The local prosecutor's office, alarmed that the man may have to spend the siberian winter in a forest by himself, appealed in court to have his identification documents reestablished so that he can seek seek state support, prosecutor roman fomin told afp. \" i am not sure if he needs all this attention, \"",
            "A feral man who says that he has never left the woods has been found near a small settlement in siberia. The 20 year-old was brought up by hermit parents, who then reportedly abandoned him. \"he has got no education, doesn't have any social skills and has no conception of the world outside of the woods, \" said roman fomin, a prosecutor in the town of belokuriha in the altay region. The man said that his parents told him that he was born in 1993, and took him to the forest when he was four. In may of this year, the couple, whose names have not been published in the media, reportedly abandoned him. Police say they are searching for the adults, who were reported by locals to have departed for the island of sakhalin, off russia's pacific coast. A local woman discovered the feral man"

The 34-year-old colorado woman died nov. 4 shortly after giving birth to declan jay, after suffering a rare amniotic fluid embolism, kusa reports. Doctors had no idea anything was amiss until declan's heart rate plummeted while bugal was in labor, at which point she made an important decision — the one that was best for her son: go for an emergency c-section with anesthesia, which would expedite the birth. A gofundme page set up for her family frames her choice as \" sacrificing her own body and ultimately her life to save his. \" per the afe foundation, 50 % of those who die from the condition do so within an hour of symptoms presenting themselves, suggesting \" rapid response \" is paramount; there's no known way to reverse afe, so \" the focus of treatment is on managing individual symptoms as they occur. \" \" it is important to note, \" the foundation continues, \" that even with the best and most responsive care, some women will simply not respond to life saving measures. \" this serious type of embolism — which the mayo clinic says occurs when amniotic fluid or fetal matter enters the mother's bloodstream — only happens in 1 to 12 cases for every 100,000 deliveries. \" we don't know how to prevent it. We don't know how to keep it from happening at all, \" one of bugal's doctors tells kusa. Right after declan was born at a healthy 7 pounds, 4 ounces, bugal managed to ask, \" how big is he? \" before she was rushed to icu, the gofundme page notes. Bugal would have celebrated her eighth wedding anniversary with her husband, wes, on nov. 5, and her 35th birthday on nov. 8. Now wes is left alone with their son and young daughter, mallory. \" how do i explain when he asks where's mommy? \" wes bugal asks kusa. ( a florida woman gave birth after coming out of a coma. )",

            "Karisa bugal was the beloved wife of wes bugal and the mother of 2 children. Together they have a daughter mallory and a newborn baby named declan. Karisa was tragically taken due to an ambiotic fluid embolism while giving birth to declan on november 4th, 2014. This is an extremely rare complication of child birth only seen in approx 1 of 80,000 births. Karisa was 34 years old and was set to celebrate her 8 year wedding anniversary on the 5th followed by her 35th birthday on the 8th of november. The medical staff informed karisa of the embolism and the immediate danger it would pose. She chose to have them perform an emergency c-section so declan could be born sacrificing her own body and ultimately her life to save his. Karisa was concious of declan being born just before the doctors were forced to take her to the icu. She simply asked \" how big is he? \" wes and the kids will try to move forward missing greatly the touch and presence of karisa in their lives. The tasks at hand and the tasks yet to come can not be asked of any one person. Through the pain, anger, and heartache they will need to find their way through an endless maze of questions. We write this story and set up this fund to try and help provide some of those answers before they",
            "Suffering afe can lead to many different outcomes that range from the most severe, death of the mother and/or death of the infant, to the best possible outcome, a full recovery for the mother and infant. Each person ( patient, spouse, family members, friends, health care providers, etc. ) affected by afe has their own story and will have their own unique path to healing — physically, emotionally, and even spiritually. Feelings of confusion, isolation, grief and post-traumatic stress are to be expected after suffering or witnessing a traumatic event. These feelings may be compounded by the range of emotions surrounding the birth of child. The afe foundation offers several types of support for those affected by afe.

            "Karisa bugal was the beloved wife of wes bugal and the mother of 2 children. Together they have a daughter mallory and a newborn baby named declan. Karisa was tragically taken due to an ambiotic fluid embolism while giving birth to declan on november 4th, 2014. This is an extremely rare complication of child birth only seen in approx 1 of 80,000 births. Karisa was 34 years old and was set to celebrate her 8 year wedding anniversary on the 5th followed by her 35th birthday on the 8th of november. The medical staff informed karisa of the embolism and the immediate danger it would pose. She chose to have them perform an emergency c-section so declan could be born sacrificing her own body and ultimately her life to save his. Karisa was concious of declan being born just before the doctors were forced to take her to the icu. She simply asked \" how big is he? \" wes and the kids will try to move forward missing greatly the touch and presence of karisa in their lives. The tasks at hand and the tasks yet to come can not be asked of any one person. Through the pain, anger, and heartache they will need to find their way through an endless maze of questions. We write this story and set up this fund to try and help provide some of those answers before they",
            "Suffering afe can lead to many different outcomes that range from the most severe, death of the mother and/or death of the infant, to the best possible outcome, a full recovery for the mother and infant. Each person ( patient, spouse, family members, friends, health care providers, etc. ) affected by afe has their own story and will have their own unique path to healing — physically, emotionally, and even spiritually. Feelings of confusion, isolation, grief and post-traumatic stress are to be expected after suffering or witnessing a traumatic event. These feelings may be compounded by the range of emotions surrounding the birth of child. The afe foundation offers several types of support for those affected by afe. Emotional support while there are many ways to seek comfort after such an event, we have found the most common needs among those who have experienced or are affected by afe are to learn more about the condition and to connect with others who have also been affected.

        "summary": "Sports betting — legally — is about to get a lot easier after a supreme court decision monday. Since 1992, a federal law has required states other than nevada to ban gambling on sports; nevada was grandfathered in at the time and has since had a monopoly on legal sports betting. But americans have still illegally gambled on sporting events, with the american gaming association having estimated that of the $ 10 billion likely to be wagered on this year's ncaa men's basketball tournament, just 3 % of the bets would be placed legally through nevada. New jersey and its then-gov. Chris christie mounted the supreme court challenge to the 1992 law, arguing that the professional and amateur sports protection act violates the 10th amendment by forcing states to carry out a federal dictate. In a 6-3 ruling monday, the high court agreed and struck down the law, nbc news reports. Writing for the majority, justice samuel alito said \" a more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine, \" noting that the law put state legislatures \" under the direct control of congress \" by forcing them to prohibit something. ( the law doesn't ban sports betting under federal law; it just requires states to ban it. ) christie argued that organized crime profits from illegal sports betting; new jersey wants to benefit from it instead by collecting the taxes from it. Americans are estimated to spend almost $ 150 billion per year on illegal sports gambling. Phil murphy, new jersey's current governor, said in late april his state is ready to allow certain types of sports betting at casinos and racetracks \" sooner than later \" should the court rule in its favor. A research firm estimated that were the supreme court to strike down the 1992 law, 32 states would likely allow sports betting within five years, the ap reports.",

The arizona daily star revealed the $ 7.5 million notice of claim on tuesday after making a public-records request. The paper said the claim was filed last thursday by a former employee. A notice of claim is a legal document that signals a lawsuit will be filed. The daily star reports that the notice was filed after the university's office of institutional equity retained outside counsel to investigate allegations of sexual harassment from a former employee. The investigation, which concluded last week, did not find enough to fire rodriguez, but the university became concerned with the \" climate and direction \" of the program. Arizona athletic director dave heeke announced rodriguez's firing in a statement issued by the school and said the separation terms of his contract will be honored, the ap reports. Rodriguez arrived in tucson after an ugly split with michigan, where he coached for three seasons. He had an immediate impact on the wildcats, leading them to four straight bowl games, but they took a step back last season, losing eight straight games while finishing 3-9. Rodriguez tweeted late tuesday that he will fight the \" fabricated and groundless \" claims. \" i am not a perfect man, but the claims by my former assistant are simply not true and her demands for a financial settlement are outrageous, \" he said.",

Elizabeth warren — and 11 other democratic senators — introduced legislation friday targeting credit reporting companies in the wake of the equifax data breach that affected 143 million us consumers, reuters reports. In short, the freedom from equifax exploitation act would keep equifax from profiting off its own data breach, according to cnn. \" credit reporting agencies like equifax make billions of dollars collecting and selling personal data about consumers without their consent, and then make consumers pay if they want to stop the sharing of their own data, \" warren says. The bill would allow people to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge. Freezing credit prevents new lines of credit, loans, credit cards, and more from being opened. Experts have urged people to freeze their credit in the wake of the equifax hack. The bill would also give people an additional free credit report every year and keep credit reporting companies from profiting off consumers'data while their credit is frozen. Bloomberg reports warren sent letters to equifax, transunion, and experian plc demanding information on how the industry is responding to the data breach. In her letter to equifax, she says she was \" troubled \" by the hack. Despite widespread outrage over the equifax data breach, it's possible the freedom from equifax exploitation act will stall in a republican-controlled congress.",

Tieman said he'd invented theories about what happened to 34-year-old valerie tieman because police had threatened his parents, on whose fairfield property valerie's body was found in september 2016. Authorities believe valerie was killed around aug. 25, when her cellphone was last used. But it was sept. 9 before her parents reported her missing. Her husband then told police valerie had vanished from a walmart store on aug. 30, reports the bangor daily news. She might've gone camping, or died of a heroin overdose, tieman said, before valerie's body turned up with gunshot wounds to the head and neck in a shallow grave near his parents ' home, where the couple lived. The grave also contained flowers, a wedding band, a bag of potato chips, a bottle of gucci fragrance \" guilty, \" and a note containing tieman's nickname \" luc-e, \" per centralmaine.com. \" i ' ll love you forever. Rest in peace, \" it read. Tieman, who said the items came from a bedside table, couldn't explain how they got in the grave. But he said he had no motive to kill valerie, even though prosecutors say he admitted she'd recently learned he was having an affair. After the jury's verdict, tieman's lawyer said his client would appeal. \" we're obviously disappointed. There was no forensic evidence. There was no dna, \" he said.

        "summary": "Emory ellis, a black homeless man in boston, went to burger king for breakfast and tried to pay with a $ 10 bill. That simple transaction in november 2015 led to a series of mistakes that landed ellis in jail for more than three months, reports the ap. It started with the cashier, who accused ellis, 37, of paying with a counterfeit bill and called police. The police took ellis to jail and charged him with forgery. Ellis was on probation and the arrest violated that probation, so he was denied bail. The whole thing was cleared up in february 2016 when the secret service determined that the bill was real. Now ellis is suing burger king corp., the franchisee, and the cashier for $ 950,000 in damages. The case was first reported by law360. Ellis's attorney, justin dreschler, tells the ap that the entire incident was due to ellis ' race and overall appearance. \"a [ white ] person like me would've gotten an apology, \" says dreschler, or at the very least, a cashier who simply refused to accept the bill instead of calling police. \"but a person like emory somehow finds his way in handcuffs for trying to pay for his breakfast with real money. \" ( the lawsuit claims ellis never even got the $ 10 bill back. ) neither burger king nor the franchisee have commented. The incident adds to a growing national dialogue on how people of color are treated in everyday situations. In other recent incidents, police have been called on black people at a starbucks, a golf club, an la fitness, an airbnb rental home, a nordstrom rack, and a black student napping in a yale common room.",

In his book creativity inc, pixar co-founder ed catmull tells the story of how most of the film was almost lost. An employee entered an erasing command into pixar's systems — apparently in the wrong place, as the next web reported. The result was that the computers began to wipe the film data. \" first, woody's hat disappeared. Then his boots. Then he disappeared entirely, \" catmull wrote, per mental floss. \" whole sequences — poof! — were deleted from the drive. \" rebuilding the film \" would have taken 30 people a solid year. \" what's perhaps even more unbelievable is that pixar didn't have a backup copy. That's because its backup system was down. But then a hero rode to the rescue: galyn susman, the film's supervising technical director, had recently had a baby and had been working from home — requiring her to take home a copy each week. She brought her whole computer into work, and the movie was saved. So, perhaps, was pixar, brew notes, since the then-small company had a lot riding on the movie. But the next web adds another wrinkle to the story: after that nightmare, the film was mostly destroyed again — this time intentionally. The film simply wasn't good enough, so it was rewritten and remade in a matter of months before its release. ( the fifty shades of grey movie, meanwhile, is fueling a very different toy story. )",

            "If buddy holly was still alive, he'd be 82 years old today. He was born in lubbock, texas, on september 7, 1936 with a slightly different name: charles hardin holley. On his first record contract, his name was misspelled as \"holly, \" and he liked it that way. When holly died in a plane crash on february 3, 1959, he was only 22 years old, but he has had a lasting impact on music history. Here are a few things you might not know about holly, and his music. 1. He opened for elvis presley. By the time he hit high school, buddy holly was playing guitar; by 1953, when he was only 17, he was playing regularly on radio in the country-and-western duo buddy and bob ( bob was bob montgomery, a friend from elementary school ). On february 13, 1955, at the fair park coliseum in lubbock, buddy and bob opened for elvis — with holly borrowing presley's martin guitar for the occasion. The pair would open for presley twice more that year. 2. \"peggy sue \" was originally cindy lou. The single, released on september 20, 1957, first carried the moniker of holly's niece, cindy lou kaiter. But jerry allison, the crickets's drummer"

        "summary": "Uber ceo travis kalanick's surprise resignation is drawing comparisons to another silicon valley ouster, that of steve jobs on his first go-round with apple in 1985. Here's a look at what people are saying, including the pushback against those comparisons: deja vu: \" this is shocking, \" writes axios editor dan primack. \" it's this generation's version of steve jobs being kicked out of apple. ( i know — not apples/apples since he's staying on the board, wasn't the founder, etc. ) \" ditto: a similar sentiment is common on twitter, notes maya kosoff at vanity fair. Sample tweet: \" be it whatever, my heart goes out to #traviskalanick #uber who is forced to resign from the company he formed, similar to #stevejobs \" not the same: kosoff herself is skeptical, pointing out that \" jobs was fired unceremoniously over what amounts to a leadership dispute and not a series of scandals involving alleged harassment and retaliation in the workplace. \" kalanick, she adds, deserves no sympathy. Ditto: kalanick \" shares certain traits with steve jobs, including a fierce rule-breaking streak, \" writes adam lashinsky at fortune. \" but the comparisons are thin and of limited value. Jobs built one of the best companies the world has ever seen. Kalanick hasn't. \" gates, too: at time, matt vella draws a comparison not only to jobs but to the \" famously aggressive \" bill gates. \" kalanick had a reputation for being a jerk. This brawler persona was useful for uber, \" but under kalanick's watch, it went too far and, if the critics are right, \" provided cover for misbehavior of the worst sort. \" jobs is the exception: yes, it's possible kalanick could follow jobs ' example by returning to uber at some point and leading it to greater success. But don't bet on it, writes oliver staley at quartz. \" most fired ceos, particularly those who leave under the cloud of scandal, don't make it back to the c-suite. The more conventional path is to take on an advisory position at a hedge fund or private-equity firm, sit on some boards, and fade into a comfortable semi-retirement. \" but he can see kalanick going another route: creating a new start-up. Another lesson: the new york times notes that since jobs ' ouster, tech founders have generally had the upper hand with investors and boards. Even with repeated scandals, then, kalanick seemed safe — at first. \" it is the swiftness of the fall that's interesting here",

            "Tree trimmer dies in palm tree in north las vegas a tree trimmer died in north las vegas on monday afternoon after being trapped in a palm tree, according to north las vegas fire officials. Las vegas fire and rescue and north las vegas fire department received word of a man stuck in a tree about 4: 30 p.m. In the 1700 block of james street, near owens avenue and pecos road, said nlv fire spokesman cedric williams in a statement. Upon arriving, firefighters located a 25- to 30-foot palm tree in the yard of a single-story home, but hanging palm fronds shrouded the apparent victim, williams said. Risks of trimming palm trees crews used a ladder to access the fronds covering the victim and cut them down to attempt a rescue. Upon reaching the man, firefighters determined he was dead, williams said. The clark county coroner's office will release the cause of death and identify the victim after family notification.

        "summary": "Statistical experts at fivethirtyeight.com undertook a project last week to discover the most common name in the us. Based on an investigation of social security administration first-name records, census data on last names, adjusted probabilities, and a number of statistical steps, the site ultimately estimated that \" james smith \" takes the top slot ( followed by michael smith and then robert smith ). Though it acknowledged plenty of uncertainty in its conclusion, it seems the site's analysis may be pretty accurate: those three names, in that order, also take the top spots according to targetsmart, a company that has a database of some 230 million registered voters and consumers, fivethirtyeight reports in a follow-up article. Where fivethirtyeight and targetsmart's lists of the 20 tops names diverge, however, is among hispanic names: targetsmart has more of them. Such names are seriously undercounted in both social security administration and census bureau data, and fivethirtyeight did attempt to adjust for that in its estimate. \" but targetsmart's data confirms how hard it is to correct for this problem, \" it observes. Meanwhile, targetsmart doesn't count people who can't vote, so both analyses are a bit off — but it does seem as though james smith is the most common name, andrew flowers writes. And if you're wondering why there are no girls ' names in the top three, the writers note that \" the distribution of female names tends to be more diffuse ( or, to use less statistical jargon, parents tend to be more imaginative when they name their baby girls ). \" it turns out america is home to more than one george washington.",

The photo by nick ut showing children fleeing a napalm attack triggered facebook censors because the central figure is naked 9-year-old girl kim phuc. Norwegian writer tom egeland used the photo in a post discussing the \" seven photographs that changed the history of warfare, \" the guardian reports. Facebook, which bans pictures of nude genitalia, suspended egeland and removed the post. When the newspaper aftenposten reported the suspension on its facebook page, the social media giant told it to \" either remove or pixelize \" the photo, but yanked the post before the paper could act. In a front-page letter to mark zuckerberg ( in english ), the paper's outraged editor-in-chief rapped the facebook founder ( calling him \" the world's most powerful editor \" ) for \" abusing your power. \" espen egil hansen added, \" i am upset, disappointed — well, in fact even afraid — of what you are about to do to a mainstay of our democratic society. \" a #dearmark thread he started on twitter has racked up support, and while zuckerberg himself hasn't responded, facebook isn't backing down. \" while we recognize that this photo is iconic, it's difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others, \" says a spokesman.

        "summary": "Is pakistan in the midst of a coup? speculation is running wild that it is, after president asif ali zardari left the country yesterday, flying to dubai for unclear health reasons — a government adviser says he had a \" minor heart attack, \" but a zardari spokesman says he's just undergoing routine treatment for a pre-existing heart condition, the guardian reports. A former us official told foreign policy that this might be a pretext for zardari to resign over \" ill health. \" the ex-official also said that zardari was \" incoherent \" during a weekend conversation with president obama, because he was under immense pressure to resign thanks to the memogate scandal. \" the noose was getting tighter — it was only a matter of time, \" he said. One expert predicted zardari would be replaced by a puppet leader from his own party — speculation further fueled today when zardari's son and heir-apparent, bilawal, met with pakistan's prime minister. But zardari aides dismissed the rumors. \" there's no question of any resignation, \" one government official said, while a spokesman called such reports \" totally speculative. \"",

In 1959, brian shawcross came upon prehistoric bones on the isle of skye; the amateur fossil hunter donated them to glasgow's hunterian museum in the 1990s, reuters reports, and they were recently identified as a new species, one that lived roughly 170 million years ago. In a nod to shawcross and a move designed to encourage more such gifts to science, the guardian reports the prehistoric reptile was named dearcmhara shawcrossi ( the first word, pronounced \" jark vara, \" is scottish gaelic for \" marine lizard \" ). The ichthyosaur — with its pointy head, flippers, and vertical tail ( illustration here ) — is described today in the scottish journal of geology. Shawcross recovered a literal handful of pieces from the back, tail, and fin of the roughly 14-foot creature ( \" you can hold all of the bones in one hand, \" notes university of edinburgh paleontologist steve brusatte ). The fin bone's features suggest dearcmhara shawcrossi had a different musculature and a possibly stronger swimming ability than that of other ichthyosaurs. The bones also add to a relatively scant marine reptile fossil record from the middle jurassic, says brusatte, who explains that scotland is home to some of the only fossils from the period. \" many other marine reptile fossils have been found in scotland, but the vast majority of these have disappeared into private collections or been sold. This new specimen finally breaks the impasse, \" he says. ( in new mexico, a hiker stumbled upon remains 90 million years old. )",

For example, adults younger than 40 are less likely than older adults to say religion is \"very important \" in their lives not only in wealthy and relatively secular countries such as canada, japan and switzerland, but also in countries that are less affluent and more religious, such as iran, poland and nigeria. While this pattern is widespread",

In 46 out of 106 countries surveyed by the washington-based pew research center, people between the ages of 18 and 39 are less likely to say religion is very important to them than adults over the age of 40. Countries where the age gap is most marked are poland, greece, chile, romania and portugal – all predominantly christian countries, and all with a percentage point difference between the two age groups of 20 or higher. The us has a 17-point difference, and ireland a nine-point gap. The uk is among 58 countries in which there is no significant difference between younger and older adults. In lebanon, a majority muslim country but with a large christian population, there is a 20-point age gap. In iran, ruled by an islamic theocracy, there is a nine-point difference. There is an age gap in a majority of latin american and caribbean countries, about half of european countries, and in north america.

The un's human rights chief has asked us and iraq to review its tactics and avoid isis \" traps \" that can lead to mass civilian casualties, reports the bbc. Survivors of the attacks offer their own insights to the new york times, expressing confusion as to why so many buildings were destroyed when isis fighters had been narrowed down to being at just a few. \" why, just because of one [ islamic state fighter ], kill everyone? \" one local asks. Two war correspondents describe the devastation for the intercept, with one calling it a \" humanitarian disaster. \" journalist anand gopal says that there's been an \" extraordinary number \" of civilian casualties and that coalition forces are \" hitting pretty much everything in sight \" in densely packed neighborhoods.

In an exclusive interview with diane sawyer on good morning america, judd reveals that \" i thought ' no ' meant no, ' \" and \" i fought with this volley of no's \" in trying to fend off weinstein's advances 20 years ago in a hotel suite, where she thought she'd been going for a business meeting. When that didn't work, she decided to forge a \" deal \" with the producer, who wanted her to take part in a massage session. \" when i win an oscar in one of your movies — ok? \" she told him in trying to get out of the situation, standing the whole time and frantically scanning the layout of the suite to see how she could make her exit. Weinstein tried to get her to downgrade that promise to simply getting nominated, but judd says she stood firm. \" and i said, ' no. When i win an oscar. ' and then i just fled. \" she says since then she's been of \" two minds \" on that interaction: one mind feeling ashamed for making that panicked promise, the other telling her she was \" brilliant \" for doing what she had to do to escape. \" good job, kid, you got out of there. Well done! \" she says that supportive alter ego tells her. Judd says her vow was brought up one more time a few years later, when she was a more established actor and ran into weinstein at a dinner. She says he noted he was still scouting for an oscar-worthy screenplay for her, but that he was going to \" let you out of that little agreement we made. \" her response: \" i had come into my power, i had found my voice....

Then the zoo found behind-the-scenes footage of the shoot on the website of art-msk and thinks it figured out why: it shows tomas with a topless model, and the zoo's theory is that the animal was associating breasts with the treats possibly used to coax it during filming. The zoo says it never would have given the ok for the raccoon to be used in a racy ad, and it worries about the raccoon population at large: \" now everyone who sees this video... Will directly associate raccoons with erotica, \" declares the lawsuit. \" absurd, \" responds the head of marketing for art-msk. The ad for blankets and pillows was made for national tv in russia and thus doesn't come close to \" erotica, \" says valery bogatov. In fact, he says the raccoon actually stole the model's bra on set and destroyed it during the august shoot, reports euro news. \" when the zoo told us they would sue us, we told them we'd file our own suit for the cost of the bra, \" he tells the telegraph. \" i said it as a joke, because i thought they were joking, too. \" but the zoo was serious, as this week's filing made clear. It wants all photos and videos related to the shoot taken offline. As for tomas, he seems to have recovered. \" it took two to three months to change his behavior, \" says a spokesman. \" now he is happy again. \" ( an essay argues that keeping apes in zoos is, contrary to popular opinion, a moral imperative. )",

Were detained. New york — a judge has blocked the federal government from deporting citizens of seven countries who were detained at u.s. Airports over the past day or so as a result of an executive order president donald trump issued friday. Advocates said 100 to 200 travelers from those muslim-majority countries were being held at various airports around the u.s. As a result of trump's order, which was billed as an anti-terrorism measure. The detentions sparked protests outside many international airports, including john f. Kennedy airport in new york and dulles airport outside washington. Story continued below u.s. District court judge ann donnelly issued her injunction over the government's objection during an emergency hearing saturday night as several hundred people opposed to trump's order chanted and milled about outside the brooklyn, n.y., federal courthouse. During the brief court session, the judge said it was difficult to see the harm in allowing the newly arrived immigrants to stay since they were being routinely admitted just a couple of days ago. \" if they had come in two days ago,",

Rice herself tells the times that she thought former friend dana weems was somehow behind the leak, along with another pal, lynn armandt — and when times writer matt bai called weems, she reportedly sighed, then replied, \" yeah. That was me. \" ( she also claims armandt was standing next to her when she made the call, listening in. ) the herald story, photo, and ensuing scandal forced hart to drop out of the running for the democratic nomination ( though the washington post disputes bai's assertion that \" hart was as close to a lock for the nomination — and likely the presidency — as any challenger of the modern era \" ). Weems, who has health issues from multiple sclerosis and now sells raincoats online, says hart was actually enchanted with her — not rice — and that rice pursued hart because she wanted to be famous, while hart's philandering behavior ( especially the thought of him getting away with it and becoming president ) made weems \" sick to her stomach. \" she also tells the times that she can't believe her secret has been safe all these years and that she was \" sorry to ruin [ hart's ] life.

Sam, who trains with chess guru garry kasparov, won all four games he played, elevating him over the 2,500-point mark needed for the title; the previous youngest-ever us grandmaster was ray robson, who nabbed that designation in october 2009 just shy of his 15th birthday, notes the us chess federation. \" he really outplayed his opponents in three games. But the fourth, it was really back and forth, \" sam's father, armen, tells afp, adding that his son is the sixth-youngest grandmaster in the world. The california teen is used to winning: when he was just 8, he became the youngest person ever in the us to become an official \" chess expert, \" and in 2009, he became the country's youngest \" national master. \" he's been playing since he was 5, and he and his dad are the only ones in the family who play, the san jose mercury news reported in 2010. \" every attempt to teach [ sam's younger sister ] to play chess fails, \" armen told the paper.

        "summary": "All this time we thought lungs were just for breathing. It turns out they also play a key role in how blood is formed, suggests a study in nature out of the university of california-san francisco. Scientists studying the lungs of mice discovered to their surprise that the lungs produced about half the platelets, blood components necessary for stanching, in the creatures ' circulation, according to a release. It's been long assumed that most if not all of these platelets were generated in bone marrow, not the lungs. What's more, they also discovered that lungs have what new atlas describes as \" a backup reservoir of blood stem cells that can step in when those in the bone marrow run dry, \" and that these cells travel freely between the marrow and lungs. \" this finding definitely suggests a more sophisticated view of the lungs — that they're not just for respiration but also a key partner in formation of crucial aspects of the blood, \" says senior author mark looney. \" what we've observed here in mice strongly suggests the lung may play a key role in blood formation in humans as well. \" if that holds true, researchers say the findings could not only lead to better treatment of blood diseases but improve the odds of successful lung transplants. The telltale clue came in the discovery of a large number of megakaryocytes, cells that produce platelets, in the mice lungs, explains the san diego union tribune. It's been known for a while that lungs are capable of making platelets, but the study suggests that role has been greatly understated. ( your lungs might be able to smell. )",

Scientists working in jamestown, va., have unearthed remains they suspect might belong to sir george yeardley, the first governor of virginia, one of the colonies ' first big slaveholders, and the man who established the first representative assembly in the new world, reports the bbc. The grave, found where one of jamestown's first churches stood, immediately piqued the archaeologists ' interest. At 3-feet-wide, the grave shaft was 50 % wider than the graves previously found in the church, reports the williamsburg yorktown daily, leading them to suspect it was no usual burial. Smithsonian reports there are indications they're on the right track: yeardley died in 1627 at age 39; the skeleton belongs to a man of that age, the condition of the grave suggests it was dug before the church was deconstructed in 1639, and the grave's position in the church's central aisle means someone of prominence was likely buried there. The process of unearthing the remains began by using high-frequency ground-penetrating radar, which detected a headless skeleton with a number of teeth; the teeth were discovered to fit into a skull that had been discovered nearby in 2017. The researchers hope to have the final word on whether they've found yeardley by the middle of next year. ( jamestown archaeologists have also been on the hunt for another prominent man's bones. )",

        "summary": "A spate of headlines this week have surfaced about trump adviser steve bannon and his views on pope francis. The stories center on allegations that bannon, a catholic, has joined forces with the pope's conservative critics within the church in order to torpedo the pontiff's agenda. A look at some of the coverage: the story driving the conversation is a front-page piece in the new york times that says bannon \" bonded \" with one of francis ' fiercest critics, a us cardinal named raymond burke, on a trip to rome in 2014. The gist of the piece: \" just as mr. Bannon has connected with far-right parties threatening to topple governments throughout western europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the roman catholic church who oppose the direction francis is taking them. \" bannon and these critics see francis \" as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff, \" while the pope's opponents in the church view the rise of bannon and president trump as \" potentially game-changing. \" npr provides more background and highlights a speech bannon gave at the vatican in 2014 before a conservative catholic group: \" we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, \" he said, urging those in the room to join together against a \" new barbarity. \" he then spelled it out: \" we are in an outright war against jihadist islamic fascism. And this war is, i think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it. \" columnist ej dionne at the washington post digs into the story and doesn't think bannon wants to force catholics in the us to have to choose between their president and their pope. But, he concludes, \" bannon's worldview could incite the same showdown in the church that he has already ignited in politics. \" read the full column. Anti-francis posters showed up in rome over the weekend, another sign of growing friction in the church. They referenced the pope's decision to exert more influence on a centuries-old catholic group called the knights of malta, reports fox news. ( the posters say he \" decapitated \" the group, which had been critical of him. ) the economist has an explainer on the knights of malta rift here. Cardinal burke will lay out his position in a lecture friday in kansas, notes the kansas city star. His talk is called \" the challenges to the defense of the faith in our times. \" a blogger at catholic culture thinks the idea that bannon and burke are conspiring against the pope is \" baloney. \"",

The white house had announced on wednesday that it was entertaining the idea, but on thursday, just before the senate vote, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said it was no longer under consideration, cnn reports. \" it is a proposal that was made in sincerity by president putin, but president trump disagrees with it, \" she said. \" hopefully president putin will have the 12 identified russians come to the united states to prove their innocence or guilt. \" sanders also confirmed thursday that trump has invited putin to dc for a second summit in the fall, cnn reports. During his summit with trump this week, putin suggested mueller's team could come to russia to question the 12 russians charged with tampering in the us election — if russia was in turn allowed to question \" fugitives on american soil \" including michael mcfaul, former us ambassador to russia, and financier bill browder, who successfully lobbied the us government to impose new sanctions on moscow. A state department rep had slammed the idea, calling russia's assertions against 11 american citizens \" absolutely absurd. \" and before thursday's vote, senate minority leader chuck schumer called on trump \" to say once and for all not through his spokespeople that the lopsided disgraceful trade he called an ' incredible offer ' is now off the table. \" the vote came as reports were still muddled over exactly what trump and putin discussed; us director of national intelligence dan coats said thursday he doesn't know what happened in the meeting.",

        "summary": "Earth recently saw its largest meteor impact since the chelyabinsk incident. Missed it? so did everyone else. While the chelyabinsk impact shattered windows and injured more than 1,000 people, an impact more than 600 miles off the coast of brazil on feb. 6 was relatively quiet in comparison. For one thing, the space rock was only about a third of the size of the chelyabinsk asteroid, though it was still the size of a large living room, astronomer phil plait writes for slate. The impact about 20 miles above earth did release the equivalent energy yield of 13,000 tons of tnt — the same amount of energy as the first atomic bomb, per the independent — but chelyabinsk's meteor impact, with the equivalent of 500,000 tons of tnt, puts that in better perspective. Had the impact been in a populated area, people might have simply felt their windows shake, plait says. It isn't clear how the impact — first reported by a nasa astronomer and recorded in nasa's fireball reports — was detected; plait notes most impacts are detected by satellites, seismic monitors, and atmospheric microphones. Some outlets, including the mirror, have questioned why nasa didn't \" warn the world, \" but plait notes 100 tons of space debris hit earth's atmosphere each day. Nasa estimates about 30 space rocks burn up in the atmosphere each year in \" impacts, \" per forbes, and rare pieces that make it to the surface tend to fall into the ocean. In other words, this impact wasn't the end of the world. ( meteors actually make earth stronger. )",

Suu kyi has called the rule — which many think was written specifically to bar her from the office, the new york times notes — \" very silly \" and has promised she ' ll be the true power behind the new president; after the election results are final, both houses of parliament and the military ( unelected members of which will make up 25 % of parliament no matter what, per constitutional guarantee ) will each nominate a presidential candidate, and a vote will be held in early 2016.

Ailes, died on thursday, sending a shock through a newsroom still reeling from a string of harassment scandals, lawsuits and high-profile departures. The threat of a federal investigation into the network's financial practices has lingered. And on friday, another prominent on-air personality was abruptly tossed. Bob beckel, a co-host of the prime-time talk show \"the five, \" was fired after an african-american employee accused him of making a racially insensitive remark. The drumbeat of tough headlines has taken a toll on morale at fox news, with employees on and off camera describing a feeling of being under siege.

It wasn't immediately clear who would replace beckel on \" the five \" and fox news did not provide details on the incident that led to his firing. Beckel was not immediately available for comment. Douglas wigdor and jeanne christensen, lawyers handling a growing racial discrimination lawsuit filed by current and former fox employees, said in a joint statement that beckel told one of their clients, a black it worker, that he was leaving the office while the employee serviced his computer because the employee is black. When the it worker filed a complaint, beckel attempted to intimidate him to withdraw it,"

Here's everything we know about the device, as well as what else tim cook's gang is rumored to have in store for us: first off, no one actually knows if it ' ll officially be called the \" ipad mini, \" but for now that's what everyone's calling it. Leaked photos show that the back of the device simply says \" ipad, \" but gizmodo predicts it ' ll actually be the \" ipad air. \" the mini will boast a 7.85 \" screen, making it about 40 % bigger than 7-inch rivals like the nexus 7. Reports are split on whether it ' ll boast a retina display, but all things digital points out that it could easily be cut from the same sheets as the iphone 4s. 9to5mac is reporting that the price will start at $ 329, on the high side of what people were expecting, which \" means that apple doesn't have to skimp on specs. \" many are expecting it to pack an a5 processor like the ipad 2 and ipod touch, though in light of the price, 9to5mac thinks an a6 is possible. Expect about 512mb of ram. Leaked photos indicate that the bezel will be thinner than the full-sized ipad, but otherwise it looks much the same, according to gizmodo. The mini is expected to boast apple's new \" lightning \" adapter. Indeed, 9to5 mac is expecting apple to roll out a new iteration of the larger ipad that uses the connecter as well, speculating that such a move could allow apple to make the next generation ipad as thin as the ipad 2. But that's not all we're expecting. Apple is also expected to debut a 13-inch retina macbook pro, an update of itunes, and perhaps some updated mac minis. Some were expecting new imacs as well, but now rumor has it that they've been pushed so far back that that looks unlikely.",

        "summary": "Lyme disease may be coming to a state near you. The debilitating and potentially deadly illness is spreading from the northeast, with four times as many high-risk counties ( 182 ) than in 1993, nbc news reports. The center of infection has shifted from northern new jersey to east-central pennsylvania, and 15 other states now have at-risk counties, says a new cdc report. But what is causing the rise in infections? an increase in tick hosts and warming temperatures are big culprits, according to quartz. Deforestation has killed or driven off many of the animals that feed on white-footed mice — a favorite host for tick larvae and nymphs. Adult ticks prefer deer, which have also experienced a population boom over the past few decades. Add to that the fact that autumns — a key season in the disease's transmission cycle — have been getting gradually warmer in the northeast over the last century, and what we have are more ticks with more time to feed and infect. \"if falls get warmer in the midwest... That should make lyme disease get worse there, \" a leading researcher tells quartz. Unfortunately, infection can result in generalized symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and memory loss, and a correct diagnosis can take years. Treating the disease costs the us health care system up to $ 1.3 billion each year, according to a study by johns hopkins university.

The judge also dropped corruption charges against mubarak and sons alaa and gamal. Mubarak did not go free, however, because he had been sentenced in 2011 to three years in a separate corruption case.

The ap reports that the judge cited the \" inadmissibility \" of the case against mubarak on technical grounds, though he apparently did not spell out his reasoning in his remarks. The rulings can be appealed. Mubarak's ouster was followed by elections that put mohamed morsi in power, but morsi was ousted by the army last year. \" the mubarak era still hasn't fallen, \" one leader of the arab spring movement tells the guardian. \" it hasn't stopped killing — so why would they say mubarak is guilty when they're doing the same thing. \"",
