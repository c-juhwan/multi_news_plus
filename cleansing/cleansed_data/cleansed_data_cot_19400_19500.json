        "summary": "What is it about bacon that gives it that incredibly potent fragrance — the smell so many love to wake up to? turns out researchers have actually investigated this, and chemistry blog compound interest ( get it? ) digs up the results. The smell, the site explains, is the result of 150 different chemical compounds created when bacon is cooked. Those compounds come partially from the maillard reaction, in which sugars react with amino acids in cooking. It's what causes food to turn brown when you cook it, notes a video from the american chemical society featured at time. All kinds of different compounds are created in the process. Hydrocarbons, for instance — hydrogen and carbon atoms linked together — in some cases give off an excellent smell, npr notes. Another key element of cooked bacon's unique smell appears to come from those compounds that contain nitrogen, which add to the \" meaty aroma. \" now you ' ll know why your mouth is watering for that cooked breakfast — but if you want the taste without the calories? try inhaling it.",

Gm ended the ev1 line in 1999, stating that consumers weren't happy with the limited driving range of the car's batteries, making it unprofitable to continue production. Many skeptics, however, believe gm killed the ev1 under pressure from oil companies, who stand to lose the most if high-efficiency vehicles conquer the market. It didn't help that gm hunted down and destroyed every last ev1, ensuring the technology would die out.

Jaber, who wants the drone strike that killed his family members ahmed salem bin ali jaber and waleed bin ali jaber to be declared unlawful, filed the suit against the obama administration in 2015. It was dismissed by the lower courts in february of this year, but jaber appealed — making this the \" first ever us appellate court hearing in a case brought by a civilian victim of the covert drone program, \" per uk-based human rights organization reprieve, which is backing the suit. Jaber appeared before a us appellate court on tuesday in washington dc, but before the hearing, he wrote to obama to ask for an apology and an acknowledgement that his relatives were innocent. If that had been issued, he would have dropped his suit. An attorney with reprieve has called the suit \" a last resort to get something that should be very simple: an acknowledgment that his relatives were wrongly killed, and a public apology for their tragic deaths. \" jaber also wants obama to release more details about civilians killed by drone strikes. \" the only thing that can prevent the mistakes of the past from repeating themselves in the future is accountability, \" jaber wrote in his letter to obama.

She's now polling about evenly with both women and men.

A family of gray wolves — two adults and five pups — were yesterday confirmed to be living in the state. The last time the state hosted a pack was the early 1920s, after which the animals were completely eradicated from california, the los angeles times reports. Biologists first got wind of the so-called shasta pack, currently roaming remote siskiyou county near mount shasta, in may and june when trail cameras photographed an apparent adult wolf; biologists then found wolf feces and photographed the five pups in recent weeks. The shasta pack joins 31 wolf packs in washington and oregon and another 282 in montana, idaho, and wyoming. Biologists suspected the wolves to the north would make their way into the state, but found themselves \" really excited if not amazed \" at how quickly that happened, per a department of fish and wildlife official. \" they have beat us to the punch. \" not everyone shares the excitement, the sacramento bee reports. Hunters and ranchers, who opposed the 2014 addition of gray wolves to the state's endangered species list, worry the animals will eat elk, deer, and livestock. The state is currently hustling to finish its plan on how to manage the animals, a plan it didn't think it would need quite so soon. According to the bee, the plan was started after a lone male gray wolf, or7, in 2011 became the first wolf spotted in california since 1924. He's since returned to oregon.",

It is the first confirmed sighting of a gray wolf pack in modern california history. The development caught state biologists by surprise – and they're now scrambling to revise and finalize a wolf-management plan that had been under development since another gray wolf, known as or7, wandered into california from oregon in late 2011. Or7's arrival marked the state's first confirmed wolf sighting since 1924. At the time, biologists said it was only a matter of time before wolves became established in california – but they didn't expect it to be so soon. \"they have beat us to the punch on a couple of occasions now, \" eric loft, chief of the department's wildlife branch, told reporters thursday during a phone briefing.

Karen kovacs, who has been monitoring the wolves for the state, said the adult wolves in the shasta pack are not likely the progeny of or7, the lone male who wandered oregon and california in 2011. That male was the first confirmed wolf in california since 1924. Or7 now has a mate and is part of a pack in oregon. The oregon-washington region is home to an estimated 145 wolves in 31 packs. Kovacs said biologists will try to place a radio collar on at least one of the shasta pack adults. Wolves in the west have generally thrived since they were reintroduced in yellowstone national park in 1995. Wolves were afforded federal protections in 1973, after being hunted to near-extinction.

Or7's arrival marked the state's first confirmed wolf sighting since 1924. At the time, biologists said it was only a matter of time before wolves became established in california – but they didn't expect it to be so soon. \"they have beat us to the punch on a couple of occasions now, \" eric loft, chief of the department's wildlife branch, told reporters thursday during a phone briefing.

Karen kovacs, who has been monitoring the wolves for the state, said the adult wolves in the shasta pack are not likely the progeny of or7, the lone male who wandered oregon and california in 2011. That male was the first confirmed wolf in california since 1924. Or7 now has a mate and is part of a pack in oregon. The oregon-washington region is home to an estimated 145 wolves in 31 packs. Kovacs said biologists will try to place a radio collar on at least one of the shasta pack adults. Wolves in the west have generally thrived since they were reintroduced in yellowstone national park in 1995. Wolves were afforded federal protections in 1973, after being hunted to near-extinction. Their presence in a now-urbanized west has been controversial and states have successfully petitioned to manage the animals, creating a sometimes confusing legal patchwork. Wolves do not"

The first involved a boy said to be 12 or 13, who died after falling off a cliff at the avoriaz ski resort, report the bbc and mirror. Per lci news, the boy and his 10-year-old brother had taken a ski lift up the mountain on saturday, with their dad and 6-year-old sister by their side, but when they got to the top, the father opted to take the little girl down and let the boys descend on their own. It's not clear exactly what happened after that, but the boys seem to have gotten lost, taken off their skis, and wandered into the woods; at some point they both plunged 500 feet off a cliff hidden by trees. When they didn't show at the resort, the cops were alerted, and they were found at the bottom of the cliff early sunday. The older boy was dead at the scene. His younger brother, whose fall was apparently softened by tree branches, survived with a broken pelvis and is being treated at a nearby hospital, with a local police official calling his survival a \" miracle, \" per the bbc. The telegraph reports on a separate incident at the oz en oisans resort, where on saturday a british man died after he and two friends, all said to be in their 20s and good skiers, went off a marked ski run and got lost. A member of the mountain rescue unit says as the men tried to make their way back to the marked slope, they climbed a part of the mountain that was \" very unstable, made up of ridges and a mixture of snow and rocks. \" all three fell at different points of their ascent, between 325 and 650 feet, and one man \" died instantly. \" one of his friends walked away unhurt, while the other suffered just minor injuries.",

        "summary": "It's a victory for international agreement, but not for consumers: opec nations and russia have managed to overcome their differences because of their common desire to drive up oil prices, reuters reports. They have agreed on their first joint output cut since 2001, a move that sent the price of crude oil up around 10 % on wednesday. The russians and saudis announced a deal earlier this year, but skeptics found it hard to believe fellow opec members iran and iraq would come on board. They did, though they ' ll be giving up less than other cartel members. In total, opec says it will cut its output by 1.2 million barrels a day, while the russians say they ' ll cut theirs by 300,000. A roundup of coverage: the ap reports that even with the cuts, there's likely to be more supply than demand, meaning that the return of $ 100-a-barrel oil is not on the horizon, though us consumers may see small rises soon. \" the average joe filling up his tank may notice in the next week or two that gas prices move higher by 5 to 15 cents a gallon just on the psyche of the deal, \" says gasbuddy analyst patrick dehaan. The wall street journal reports that the deal will cut world oil production by around 1 % if all parties stick to the agreement — and that is a big if. Enforcement of the agreement is expected to be a big problem, and analysts say the russians in particular might not cut or even freeze production, especially not if prices keep going up. Analyst chris weafer tells cnbc that the announcement of the deal was \" very weak in detail, \" and it appears that russia will be able to simply reduce its stated 2017 production targets and pass it off as a cut. Shares in us shale oil producers soared after the deal was announced, reports fortune, which notes that the agreement \" will effectively end the price war started by saudi arabia two years ago in its efforts to wrest market share back from us. \" saudi energy minister khalid al-falih said before a deal was reached that the country was willing to take a \" big hit \" on production. \" i think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry, \" he told reporters wednesday, per reuters. \" it should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth. \" an editorial in the independent says the deal \" may have done the world a good turn \" by bringing historic enemies saudi arabia and iran together, and by",

And \" while amazon may be the worst thing to have ever hit the book business, \" writes michael wolff at usa today, dealing with the predominant booksellers ( barnes &amp; noble, anyone? ) of the past \" was hardly a walk in the park. \" book publishers have been out of the book-selling business for so long that they've allowed those doing the actual peddling to virtually write their own tickets. Now, with amazon's writing on the wall, writes wolff, it's time for publishers to seize their destinies — with brick-and-mortar independent bookstores that deal in \" artisanal selling, a kind of brooklynization of the book business. \" \" amazon does not care about books, \" he argues, but rather books as vehicles for \" new technology and hardware and entertainment products, \" which ultimately leave \" books and publishers as cultural detritus. \" but to prevail, publishers need to focus on the physical book, \" the true book, \" and stop flooding the market with garbage. In a dueling column in the new york times today, paul krugman also looks at whether amazon is wielding \" robber-baron-type market power \" in the industry, answering \" definitely. \" but rather than acting as a monopoly to jack prices, he says that, thus far, amazon \" is acting as a monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down. \" which brings us to the heart of the matter: \" what matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is. \" click for wolff's full column, or for krugman's full column.",

Hachette books weren't banned outright from amazon's site, but amazon began delaying their delivery, raising their prices, and/or steering customers to other publishers. You might be tempted to say that this is just business — no different from standard oil, back in the days before it was broken up, refusing to ship oil via railroads that refused to grant it special discounts.

Some of the homeless have been hospitalized as the result of the beatings, and men have suffered broken ribs and a dislocated jaw, according to the suit. A homeless advocate became suspicious months ago when he saw several men on local streets with limps, bruises, and split lips. The shefights website boasts of men in \" excruciating pain \" after their beatings by buff young women in scanty gym clothes. \" what kind of a society would allow this to happen? \" asked lawyer neil chonin. Victims desperate for cash are taken to a film spot where they were beaten sometimes while in handcuffs or shackles, chonin said. An owner of the company said the charges would be \" disproved, \" but offered no details.

Much as you may wish to think me a compound of the most misogynistic, ignorant, sexist and antediluvian pig who ever trod the planet i can truly report that i know and love enough women to be quite assured of the fact that women do indeed enjoy sex.

        "summary": "What divers found in a florida sinkhole may help overturn a long-held theory — that people first colonized the americas thousands of years ago by crossing the bering strait, the guardian reports. Scientists say that fossilized dung, mastodon bones, and a stone knife discovered at the site near tallahassee suggest people lived there roughly 14,500 years ago. That's about 500 years before the ice-free corridor — land sandwiched between ice sheets in the us and canada — appeared, allowing those who crossed the bering strait land bridge to travel throughout the continent, smithsonian notes. \" so the ice-free corridor is not our answer for how the americas were initially colonized, \" says jessi halligan, an anthropologist whose team went searching in the aucilla river sinkhole between 2012 and 2014. They pulled out a few stone tools, including one known as a \" biface \" that halligan says was \" absolutely \" made by people. They also re-analyzed a mastodon tusk retrieved earlier at the site and say deep marks in its surface were cut by humans. Other animal bones found at the sinkhole include dire wolf, mammoth, horse, camel, giant armadillo, sloth, and even dogs, who may have accompanied or trailed the hunters, discovery reports. So if these people didn't come by bering strait, how did they? \" the only logical way people could have come to florida [ from asia ] 14,600 years ago is if their ancestors entered the americas by boat along the pacific coast, \" says anthropologist michael waters, who worked with halligan. \" they could have traveled by boat to central mexico, crossed and come along the gulf coast. \" published in science advances, this is one of a few finds challenging the notion that people first came to the americas about 13,000 years ago.",

            "Knife, bone, and dung cast doubt on bering strait theory and indicate humans spread through americas 1,500 years earlier than thought, researchers say a stone knife, mastodon bones and fossilized dung found in an underwater sinkhole show that humans lived in north florida about 14,500 years ago, according to new research that suggests the colonization of the americas was far more complex than originally believed. Archaeologists have known of the sinkhole in the aucilla river, south of tallahassee, for years. But they recently dived back into the hole to excavate what they call clear evidence that ancient mankind spread throughout the americas about 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. Almost 200ft wide and 35ft deep, the sinkhole was \"as dark as the inside of a cow, literally no light at all \", according to jessi halligan, lead diving scientist and a professor at florida state university at tallahassee. Halligan dived into the hole 126 times over the course of her research, wearing a head lamp as well as diving gear. In the hole, the divers found stone tools including an inch-wide, several inch-long stone knife and a \"biface \" – a stone flaked sharp on both sides. The artifacts were found near mastodon bones; re-examination of a tusk pulled from the hole confirmed that long grooves in the bone were made by people, probably when they removed it",
            "Dna testing carried out from naia's upper right third molar indicates paleoamericans and native americans descended from the same land in beringia, a now partially submerged landmass including parts of siberia, alaska and the yukon. The researchers found that naia belonged to a mitochondrial lineage common to modern native americans and is found only in the americas. The presence of a genetic marker indicates that the girl was maternally related to living native americans, and traces her ancestry to the same source population as contemporary native americans. According to the researchers, the craniofacial divergences are probably the result of evolutionary changes that happened in beringia over the last 9,000 years. Shown is naia's upper right third molar, which was used for both radiocarbon testing and dna extraction. Naia does not feature the broader and rounder skulls of today's native americans. She bore a long and high cranium, a pronounced forehead, a low and flat nose. Her teeth projected outward from her small face. Such different faces, skulls and teeth have led speculations that prehistoric americans might represent an earlier migration from southeast asia or even europe via a submerged land mass where the bering sea is now. But mitochondrial dna testings -- maternally inherited dna -- suggest a different scenario. Here, diver susan bird works at the bottom of hoyo negro and carefully brushes naia"

The rapper donated $ 150,000 to help the family of jemel roberson, a bar security guard who was killed by a white officer while holding a shooting suspect at gunpoint in robbins, around 20 miles south of chicago, fox reports. \" jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short... As he tried to save others from senseless violence, \" the fundraiser states. Witnesses say jemel was wearing a hat and shirt that said \" security \" and they shouted at police that he was a security guard. Friends say the 26-year-old hoped to become a chicago police officer and he was planning to take the entrance exam next month. Numerous lawmakers have spoken out about the nov. 11 shooting, cnn reports. \" jemel roberson was a young father and a security guard who aspired to one day become a police officer, \" tweeted sen. Cory booker. He \" was doing his job, subduing a shooter, when he was killed by a police officer. Words can't begin to describe my horror and outrage. \" relatives have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit and the officer who fired the fatal shot has been placed on administrative leave. Roberson had a 9-month-old son with partner avontea boose, and they had been preparing to announce a second pregnancy to their families. ( lawyers say that when he was shot, roberson was working overtime to support his family. )",

For one, the dead woman's fingernails were long; williams ' mom, ella mae rutledge, always had short nails. But when williams pulled back the woman's wig to reveal dark hair ( her mom had white hair ), she knew a terrible mistake had been made: rutledge's body had been mixed up with another, the chicago tribune reports. Staff at leak &amp; sons funeral home quickly shuffled williams into the body-prep room and showed her three other deceased women, per cbs — williams tells the chicago sun-times they put her mom's dress on at least one of the bodies — but none of them was rutledge. Then the worst possible news: due to an employee mistake in tagging the bodies, her mother had apparently been buried that day by another family. \" eighty-three years in business, and this is the first time dealing with someone erroneously interred, \" spencer leak sr., the owner of the funeral home, tells the tribune. What had helped the mistake stand was that the other deceased woman's daughter had mistakenly said the body of 74-year-old rutledge was her own mom. Instead of a funeral, rutledge's family held a casket-less memorial service saturday. \" it was absolutely devastating, \" an attendee tells the tribune. \" she's originally from alabama, so there were a lot of people who came from there to pay their last respects. \" but despite rutledge's body being exhumed ( her remains are now back at leak &amp; sons ), williams says she has no plans for a new funeral. \" my father is totally distraught, \" she tells the tribune. \" he and my mother bought a prepaid policy a long time ago, but... He told me, ' no way in hell let my body go there when i die. ' \" she tells cbs she's planning legal action. ( a rhode island woman had a similar experience with her mother. )",

The 19-year-olds had been married the day prior. The wichita eagle describes theirs as a whirlwind romance: the two met while on mission trips in wesson's native south africa in february, and were engaged by june. Bouma's mother, rachel bouma, says the two married in a courthouse ceremony friday that was conducted with wesson's immigration status in mind; a wedding celebration, with wesson's south african relatives present, had been planned for next month. The couple intended to move to grand rapids, michigan, for college. Kwch reports the crash occurred at 6: 30pm, with evidence suggesting wesson, who was behind the wheel, lost control of the ford f-150 pickup. It left the road, and was found against a tree, on its side. Wesson was pronounced dead at the scene, while bouma died early monday in the hospital. The crash remains under investigation. On facebook, rachel bouma writes, \" she is with the lord that she loved so deeply and so joyfully and she is with her husband of just one day, austin wesson, whom she loved with all her heart. We thank god that they are together while grieving their loss so very deeply. \" ( this bride was killed in a crash minutes after her wedding. )",

At one point, they even lost their footing and began sliding down the mountain, popolizio tells cbs news. \" i was freezing. The fall pushed all of the snow up my jacket, into my gloves, in my boots.

After two days of searching, rescue crews finally located the couple on tuesday, 265 feet below algonquin's 5,115-foot summit, the albany times union reports. Both were hallucinating by that point, but they knew the choppers they were hearing were real, and they started screaming, drawing rescuers to them.

Meanwhile, alois may lose toes due to frostbite; he's still in the hospital. \" we made an agreement early on when we got trapped that neither one of us could die, \" popolizio tells cbs. \" because we couldn't leave the other one alone.

        "summary": "Iran went to the united nations ' highest court monday in a bid to have us sanctions lifted following president trump's decision earlier this year to re-impose them, calling the move \" naked economic aggression. \" iran filed the case with the international court of justice in july, claiming that sanctions the trump administration imposed on may 8 breach a 1955 bilateral agreement known as the treaty of amity that regulates economic and consular ties between the two countries. At hearings that started monday at the court's headquarters in the hague, tehran asked judges at the world court to urgently suspend the sanctions to protect iranian interests while the case challenging their legality is being heard — a process that can take years. The ap has much more: background: trump said in may that he would pull the united states out of a 2015 agreement over iran's nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don't cut off iranian oil imports by early november. Us response: in a written statement, secretary of state mike pompeo called the legal move an attempt by tehran \" to interfere with the sovereign rights of the united states to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security. \" the united states, which argues that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case, is to present its legal arguments to judges on tuesday. More on iran's argument: iranian representative mohsen mohebi told the court the us decision was a clear breach of the 1955 treaty as it was \" intended to damage, as severely as possible, iran's economy. \" mohebi said the re-imposition of sanctions was unjustified as iran was abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal. He said sanctions are already having damaging effects on iran's economy and society and threaten to further destabilize the volatile mideast. More background: the 1955 treaty was signed when the us and iran were still allies following the 1953 revolution — fomented by britain and the us — that ultimately cemented the rule of shah mohammad reza pahlavi. Iran and the us have a history of litigation at the international court of justice, in cases covering crises including the tehran embassy hostage-taking and the shooting down of an iranian passenger jet mistaken by a us warship for a fighter jet. Rulings by the world court, which settles disputes between nations, are final and legally binding.

Obama described it as a \" candid and constructive conversation \" and putin called it \" substantial and constructive, \" according to the ap, even though neither changed their mind. \" we stuck to our guns, \" putin said. \" we do not agree with those arguments, but still we can hear them. … everybody understood one another. \" more developments from the conference: obama also did his best to win other leaders to his side. He said that the majority of them were \" comfortable with our conclusion \" that bashar al-assad had used chemical weapons, and agreed something should be done — but many believed the un should approve any action, the washington post reports. But putin said china, india, brazil, south africa, and indonesia were with him, and that germany was \" cautious. \" he also said italy was behind him, but italy has signed a statement publicly backing the us. Obama met with chinese president xi jingping as well, again with little success. \" a political solution is the only right way out for the syrian crisis, and a military strike cannot solve the problem from the root, \" xi told him, according to reuters. \" we expect certain countries to have a second thought before action. \" the state department, meanwhile, has ordered all non-emergency personnel to evacuate the us embassy in beirut, lebanon, citing \" threats to us mission facilities and personnel. \" it also warned us citizens not to travel to lebanon, or to iraq, npr reports; non-emergency personnel may also leave adana, turkey, if they wish. Obama will talk syria in an address to the american people tuesday night, the ap reports.",

But thanks to a joint initiative via slate, vice news, and a company called votecastr, how exit polls are handled this time around will be a \" dramatic departure, \" politico reports. This \" unprecedented election day experiment, \" as slate puts it, will offer real-time projections of who's ahead in the polls at any given time in seven battleground states. \" we're hoping to fill in the 24-hour void between the last pre-election poll analysis and the counting of the votes with data that can begin to answer the heretofore unanswerable question: who's actually voting? \" sasha issenberg of votecastr tells politico. The effort will cover florida, iowa, new hampshire, nevada, ohio, pennsylvania, and wisconsin, as well as a modified look at colorado's results. But votecastr is courting controversy, as experts fret that word of who's pulling ahead minute by minute could affect voter turnout. \" i ' m profoundly uncomfortable with characterizing election results during election day, \" a member of the abc news \" decision desk \" told the new york times in september, when the project was announced. But slate notes that feared alteration of voter turnout is an \" unproven theory, \" and issenberg says voters keeping an eye on votecastr — manned by both democratic and gop data experts — are already bombarded by pre-election day polls and stats. \" why should information on election day itself be held to a different standard than on the day before it? \" he tells politico.

Walker, who's been with the gratwick hose fire company in north tonawanda for two years, is the only black firefighter there, and on monday he received a letter in his home mailbox that read \" n ----- s are not allowed to be firefighters \" and demanded he resign or \" you will regret it, \" per wgrz. Walker, 28, alerted the fire department and the police that night. Then, early wednesday afternoon, the fire started in walker's apartment. Neither he nor his wife and two young daughters were home; two other tenants in the four-unit building escaped unharmed, though all of the building's tenants are now displaced. North tonawanda's fire chief, who says he's \" appalled \" by the \" sickening \" note walker received, says the blaze is under investigation; both local cops and the fbi are involved. Walker, meanwhile, says the community has stepped up to lend its support — including a donation drive sunday set up by his firefighter colleagues, per the new york daily news, and a gofundme page arranged by a firefighter in a neighboring town — that he won't be cowed by whomever sent the letter, and that he hasn't decided whether he's going to step away from the fire department, though he adds, \" i am going to do what i have to do to protect my family. \" ( harassing online posts may have driven a virginia firefighter to take her own life. )",

After 55 % of scottish voters rejected independence, a higher margin than suggested by the final opinion polls of the campaign, salmond, who has dominated scottish politics for the past decade, said he would quit in november. Looking drained after a grueling night, salmond said it was time to move on. \" the last seven years as first minister of scotland has been the privilege of my life but i think that's a reasonable spell of service, and i think that we have to understand and recognise when it is time to give someone else a chance to move that forward, \" salmond said in his resignation statement delivered at the first minister's residence at bute house, in edinburgh.

        "summary": "The musician known as jered threatin definitely gets points for ambition and creativity. But that likely isn't endearing him, nor his heavy metal band threatin, to venue managers in the uk, where the california group kicked off a tour promising loads of headbangers and delivering — well, in the case of one concert site, a grand total of four fans. The telegraph reports on what appears to be an elaborate scheme on threatin's part, involving fishy social-media likes, allegedly fake industry contacts on the band's website, accusations of doctored concert videos, and even now-deleted youtube videos of jered threatin interviewing … himself. \" essentially, the entire history of threatin is a lie, \" writes one band that opened for the group. The member of another band noted: \" in all the years i've been involved in music, i've never known anything like this. \" the uk tour, which alternative press reports began nov. 1, immediately raised suspicions when, despite threatin's promises of advance ticket sales, very few people showed; sometimes it was just the opening bands ( part of a nov. 7 concert at a manchester location can be seen on youtube ). Still, per the bbc, one review described a threatin performance as \" energetic, despite the empty room, \" with \" very good \" session musicians. At least two of those musicians — a bassist and drummer — have since quit, and a sunday show in belfast was nixed. \" it's a really extreme version of ' fake it till you make it, ' \" one venue manager tells the telegraph. The guardian, meanwhile, calls it \" a tale of our times — a fake band belonging to this era of fake news and sinister online maneuvers. \" no word yet from threatin himself.

        "summary": "As befitting one of the most talked-about crimes of the past decade, the meredith kercher murder and ensuing amanda knox saga are the subject of a new true-crime documentary. Amanda knox, released friday on netflix, has a 91 % fresh rating on rotten tomatoes. It opens with knox herself looking at the camera and stating: \" either i ' m a psychopath in sheep's clothing, or i am you. \" it goes on to recount knox — an american college student in italy — being twice convicted and acquitted of killing her roommate, kercher, over a span of eight years. Here's what the critics are saying about amanda knox: rogerebert.com says amanda knox won't change anyone's mind about her, but it shows how a \" seemingly sweet naive girl was accused of something she didn't do \" and \" how something like this could happen to anyone. \" the film also helps explain how knox was so easily turned into a \" tabloid villainess, \" according to the wall street journal. \" it's the curse of our media-driven age that anyone seeking a sympathetic hearing needs to have a convincingly sympathetic persona. \" entertainment weekly calls amanda knox a good refresher \" for everyone who lost track of the trials, appeals, and independent investigations amid tabloid tales of a sex-torture party gone wrong. \" the guardian laments that the conclusion the film reaches is the obvious one: \" the italian police and judiciary were guilty of grotesque incompetence, panic, misogyny, and misplaced national pride \" resulting in their turning knox into an \" evil witch. \" amanda knox — \" equal parts alfred hitchcock and patricia highsmith \" — seems to be \" the last word in this most divisive of cases, \" the los angeles times writes. \" like too many recent documentaries, [ amanda knox ] is filled with missed opportunities, \" according to the village voice. Those missed opportunities include too little time spent on knox's time in prison or with the lawyer of rudy guede, the man eventually convicted of kercher's murder.",

        "summary": "President obama will today outline a new course against terror, including two big goals: cutting down on drone strikes and attempting, once again, to close the guantanamo bay prison. The speech comes after the administration yesterday admitted killing four us citizens with drones. Under new drone rules, strikes on foreign enemies will follow the same rules applied to strikes on us citizens labeled terrorists, the new york times reports. For a strike to be authorized, targets must present \" a continuing, imminent threat to americans \" and be effectively impossible to capture, eric holder told congress in a letter. Thus, \" signature strikes \" — drone attacks on groups based on suspected links to terror organizations — could be over, the times notes. Such attacks have taken much heat for killing civilians. Strikes will also be shifted from cia control into military hands. Meanwhile, the white house will again begin transferring guantanamo detainees out of the detention center in an effort to shut it down, the wall street journal reports. The plan includes an end to the ban on relocating detainees to yemen. What else can we expect from the speech? well, pundits would love to hear a clearer definition of what constitutes a drone-worthy terrorist, notes jon terbush at the week. Adds his colleague marc ambinder: it's time for obama to acknowledge past us mistakes and explain accountability procedures. And it wouldn't hurt to tell us al-qaeda's status today.

        "summary": "Jahi mcmath, the 13-year-old girl declared brain-dead not long after having her tonsils removed in december, has been kept on feeding and breathing support at saint peter's university hospital in new brunswick, nj. Now the oakland, calif., girl's family says jahi is once again showing brain activity, and they're asking a bay area court to walk back its declaration that she is dead, reports the san jose mercury news. The newspaper notes that were this to happen, it would mark the first time an individual declared brain-dead was found to regain brain activity. One prominent physician says such a reversal would be miraculous and \" would force us to re-examine the whole nature of death in america. \" then he added, \" but i don't believe it. \" the family's attorney, meanwhile, says he has \" medical experts, including world-class experts on brain death, who will testify she is not brain-dead. \" in court documents filed tuesday, christopher dolan also cited an mri and claimed jahi now responds to commands given by her mother. He says the determination of brain death occurred when there was swelling in her brain, and he says that swelling has subsided. While family members haven't disclosed who is privately paying for jahi's care, they've acknowledged that by reversing her status as dead, she'd be eligible for state benefits just like others who are on ventilators and not brain-dead, reports the san francisco chronicle. A hearing is set for thursday. ( back in march, jahi's uncle said that not only was jahi alive, but that she knew where she was. )",

Unionen says mansplaining can make women seem less competent, and it contributes to the gender wage gap and glass ceiling. So far, callers have sought advice for what to do when male colleagues talk over them, ignore them, or take credit for their work. Men have also been calling the hotline, asking how they can know if they're guilty of mansplaining.",

Some 27.5 % of american households are solo households, reports usa today, which notes that the figure stood at 5.1 % in 1900 and 17 % in 1970. Researchers are in part blaming the rise on the habits of the young, who are waiting longer to get married, thereby extending the years of bachelor/bachelorette living. To wit, 71 % of households were married in 1970; last year, 49 % were. Reason no. 2 has to do with the elderly: they're living longer and they're healthier, allowing them to spend more years in their own home, rather than with a family member or in an adult-care facility. If you're thinking, \" the economy stinks, shouldn't people be bunking up? \" you're not, well, alone. The los angeles times notes that the increase \" might seem puzzling in light of the recession and its enduring effects. \" to that end, it shares a pew report that found there was indeed a slight dip in the percentage of people ages 18 to 31 living alone ( from 8 % in 2007 to 7 % in 2012 ).",

In fact, the rate of \" unprovoked \" shark attacks has been steadily rising for the last century. No, sharks aren't developing a particular taste for humans: it's the expanding human population that's actually to blame. \" if we look at the number of shark attacks in any given place in any given year and compare that to population growth in those areas, we find that shark attacks match the growth curve of the human population in that region, \" shark researcher george burgess tells nbc news. Meanwhile, the human population will near 11 billion by 2050, while some shark species are also growing in number in light of efforts to thwart overfishing. At the same time, water activities are more popular than a generation ago, sending humans into shark turf, burgess writes at the conversation. \" more sharks and people are likely to be in close proximity to one another, leading to more attacks, \" a florida state university researcher says, noting the number of attacks per 100,000 beach visitors remains stable. Of 72 unprovoked attacks in 2014, 52 occurred in the us, though less than one person dies in the us from shark attacks each year on average, compared to six deaths worldwide, livescience reports. Burgess says he's \" confident \" attacks will become more common in the next 15 years. If you'd rather avoid a shark encounter, don't swim at dusk, dawn, nighttime, or near where someone is fishing. And leave flashy jewelry on the beach; sharks may confuse shiny pieces with fish scales. ( a fisherman's rare catch: a shark with 300 teeth. )",

        "summary": "An already bleak future for polar bears may have just gotten worse. A study published this week in science found the endangered species may need much more energy to survive than previously believed. Scientific american reports researchers used radio collars and blood samples to track the energy needs and movements of nine female polar bears in the beaufort sea off the coast of alaska last april. They found the bears ' metabolic rates were about 60 % higher than scientists had previously assumed. During the study, five of the nine bears lost body mass, and four lost at least 10 % of their weight over a span of 10 days or so. The study is bad news as sea ice continues to disappear — in december it was at its second lowest level since 1979, cnn reports. Polar bears rely on seals for their immense caloric needs — the four bears that lost 10 % of their weight didn't catch a single seal during the study and relied on scavenging — and sea ice is pretty much a requirement for polar bears to catch seals. As sea ice recedes, bears will have to travel further and expend more energy to catch seals or resort to scavenging calorie-poor foods. That could explain the 40 % decline in polar bear population in the southern beaufort sea between 2001 and 2010 as noted by an earlier study. And the authors of the current study predict \" higher mortality rates \" for polar bears as sea ice continues to disappear.",

While scientists were quick to caution that the causes of the animal's condition remain unknown — disease, injury or any number of other factors could potentially have spelled its demise — experts are worried that starving polar bears may soon become a more common sight as the sea ice they rely on for hunting grounds continues to melt away. New research published yesterday in science adds fuel to those concerns.

        "summary": "Chile, britain, and even nasa have joined the search for a submarine that disappeared two days ago with at least 44 people on board. The submarine — which the guardian notes is one of three in the argentinian navy — was traveling from the south of argentina to its base hundreds of miles to the north. Cnn reports it was last heard from wednesday while in the san jorge gulf, about 268 miles off the east coast of argentina in the atlantic ocean. Officials are denying an emergency or that the submarine is lost. \"the latest official and reliable information is that the submarine has not yet been found, \" navy spokesperson enrique balbi says. \" it's not that it's lost: to be lost you'd have to look for it — and not find it. \" the submarine has not activated its emergency beacon. Balbi says the submarine is likely to continue its journey in the event of a communication problem, reuters reports. He adds: \" the submarine knows that if it does not have communication with land for this long, it has to surface. \" so far a search from both air and sea has been fruitless. Nasa has committed a p-3 orion aircraft, which a spokesperson says was \" already in argentina on a scientific mission, \" to the search. The argentinian navy denies reports of a fire on board the submarine, which was bought from germany in 1985, and says it has plenty of food and oxygen. \"we are praying to god and asking that all argentinians help us to pray... That they can be found, \" the brother of one crew member says. The submarine's crew includes argentina's first female submarine officer.",

        "summary": "At least 17 people have been confirmed dead in the devastating wildfires raging in california — including a couple who died together after having been married for 75 years. Charles rippey, 100, and sara rippey, 98, died sunday night when a fast-moving wildfire engulfed their napa county home. Mike rippey, the oldest of their five children, tells abc that his mother was paralyzed from a stroke years earlier and would never have made it out. He says his father died about halfway to her room but \" even if he had made it, there was no way he was gonna leave her. So neither one of them was getting out. \" \" they lived a long life, \" he says. \" it was a great life and they were happy right up until the last minute. \" in other developments: president trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the state, where at least 115,000 acres have burned, cnn reports. Forecasters say that with strong winds and no rain forecast this week, conditions will be extremely challenging for firefighters battling 17 large fires across california. State rep. Mike thompson said he believes the wine country blazes will be the \" worst fire disaster in california history \" after seeing the devastation in northern california on tuesday, reports the san francisco chronicle, which has a list of the evacuation orders. Most of the fatalities were in sonoma county, where large parts of the city of santa rosa burned. The death toll could rise sharply: the los angeles times reports that sheriff's officials in the county have found only 45 of the 200 people reported missing since sunday night. Fire officials say the \" unprecedented \" spread of the northern california fires was caused by wind gusts of up to 60mph sunday night, the guardian reports. \" we see 20 to 30 new fires a day, it's just that these winds really caused these fires to grow rapidly, \" says cal fire rep heather williams. Some first responders lost their own homes to fire while they were fighting the blazes and evacuating residents, the san francisco chronicle reports. They include mill valley fire chief tom welch, who lost his santa rosa home. Michael honig, chairman of the napa valley vintners trade association, tells the ap that at least five wineries have been destroyed and nine others damaged, and the group has yet to hear from wineries in some hard-hit areas. \" that's been the biggest problem — the information — you can't access these areas, \" he says. \" we don't have a good idea of how the vineyards have been impacted. \"",

A new study, however, suggests that may not be necessary. Why? the risk of early death from sitting for long periods is essentially erased with regular exercise, researchers say, per mashable. The study \" indicates that the problem lies in the absence of movement rather than the time spent sitting itself, \" a researcher says in a release. \" any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing. \" one thing to note: the nhs based its recommendation on a study of almost 800,000 people, whereas this latest study surveyed data from about 5,000 uk civil servants. As the participants used london's public transportation, they spent twice as much time walking as the average briton. They recorded how much time they spent sitting at work and elsewhere, including in front of the tv, over 16 years, making the study \" one of the longest follow-up studies in this area of research, \" per the release. Researchers found no link between sitting and mortality risk. \" our findings suggest that reducing sitting time might not be quite as important for mortality risk as previously publicized and that encouraging people to be more active should still be a public health priority, \" the lead author says.

        "summary": "Recipes can't be copyrighted, but videos can, which is why the food network may now find itself in a pot of hot water. In a lawsuit filed in california on thursday, food blogger elizabeth labau of sugarhero.com claims the network not only stole her \" signature recipe \" but made a \" shot-for-shot \" reproduction of her video showing how to make it, reports the washington post. Labau's recipe for \" snow globe cupcakes \" with gelatin domes first went viral in 2014 before she revisited it this past december, posting a tutorial video on facebook that received 5.7 million views. But the food network was perhaps a little too sweet on her recipe. Labau says it copied the video less than three weeks later, using the same camera angles, colors, lighting, and text. Several commenters demanded the network acknowledge labau, who spent \" several weeks \" crafting the recipe, per the suit. Labau says she was prompted to file the copyright infringement suit when the network refused. While a recipe usually isn't protected under copyright law, \" a description, explanation, or illustration \" of a recipe can be, notes the hollywood reporter, adding that the suit poses an \" interesting legal question \" about how-to videos. Labau argues the food network's video, which has received more than 11 million views, stole \" business and attention \" from her site. In addition to lost advertising revenue, she says she also suffered \" severe distress \" and damage to her brand. She's seeking up to $ 150,000 in damages. The food network hasn't commented.

The only other person on the property at the time was shacknai's brother, adam, and jurors in the civil trial found adam shacknai responsible for her death. This though there was no dna or fingerprint evidence connecting shacknai to zahau's hanging, which occurred the day after jonah shacknai's 6-year-old son fell from a second-story landing in the home. The boy died days later, and in their wrongful death suit, zahau's family alleged adam confronted zahau over the boy's fall, reports fox 5 san diego.

Police say security camera footage from a restroom in carson elementary school shows a fellow student knocking the boy to the floor, leaving him unconscious.

The school system agreed thursday to release the video after blurring the children's faces. Lawyer jennifer branch, hired by the boy's mother to find out what really happened to her son, says the school told the mother he had fainted. She says the boy vomited the evening of the assault. His mother took him to the hospital, where she was told he'd probably come down with the stomach flu. He didn't go to school the next day and hanged himself after coming home from school on jan. 26. Branch says the mother would have taken the boy to the hospital immediately and would not have let him return to carson if she'd known he had been assaulted and was unconscious on the bathroom floor for so long. \" mom is really heartbroken that she didn't know what she needed to know to protect her son, \" she says.

Moscow said the us \" has done everything in its power to destroy the atmosphere of trust which could have encouraged cooperation, \" citing among other things sanctions placed on russia over its role in ukraine. Syria: the us, meanwhile, suspended contacts with moscow in regard to syria. The decision means the us will no longer negotiate with russia over the resumption of a ceasefire or move ahead with plans for joint military operations, reports the washington post.

        "summary": "A strange sea creature's embarrassment is over. More than a century after the now-extinct hallucigenia was first found, scientists say they've discovered which end is its face and which is its butt. In hallucigenia's defense, all fossils of the tiny creature — which was thinner than a hair when it roamed the world 500 million years ago, notes the bbc — seemed to be missing a head, which made imagining the creature pretty difficult. For the first time, though, scientists have found samples in canada that show the entire creature intact, according to a nature study. In addition to a body covered in spikes, 10 pairs of clawed limbs, and three pairs of tentacles, per reuters, scientists can identify a spoon-shaped head, \" a tiny pair of eyes looking back at us \" and \" beneath them a really cheeky semi-circular smile, \" says researcher martin smith. \" surreal. \" behind the smile sits two sets of teeth, a circle of teeth in the mouth, and needlelike teeth that run down its throat. Smith suggests hallucigenia probably sucked up its food — possibly tiny particles in water or bits of sponge — \" like a plunger, \" while the teeth helped move the food toward its stomach, reports livescience. The ring of teeth could link hallucigenia to ecdysozoans like spiders and worms, smith says. Some ecdysozoans have similar \" o \" -shaped mouths with rings of teeth, but others, like spiders, don't. Smith guesses an early ancestor probably had a toothy mouth that some descendants kept, while others evolved a simpler mouth. The new research also helps scientists explain an orblike spot in hallucigenia fossils that was once thought to be its head. Smith says it is instead \" a blob of decay fluids that oozed out of the anus during decay and burial. \" ( this ancient sea creature was the size of a motorboat. )",

        "summary": "Humans aren't the only species to speak baby talk, apparently. A new study published in the journal peer j finds our closest living relatives communicate using high-pitched calls or \" peeps \" strangely similar to the sounds made by human babies before they can talk. Researcher zanna clay of the university of birmingham was studying 39 bonobos in the democratic republic of congo when she first heard the noises, made when the great apes ' mouths are closed, per cnn and the christian science monitor. Like most animals, bonobos use different \" fixed calls \" that relate to an event ( like mealtime ) or a mood ( like fear ) to communicate, but clay and her team noticed the identical bonobo peeps were used in \" just about every context you can imagine, \" whether it be positive, negative, or neutral, according to a press release. \" they peep when they're traveling, feeding, grooming, resting, nest building, playing, aggression, alarm — you name it, \" clay says, noting you have to understand the context of the situation to understand a particular peep. One way to look at the apes ' communication is to compare it to that of human babies. A baby's cry and laughter are much like fixed calls. But babies also make other sounds, known as protophones, which \" are the building blocks of speech, in that they vary in function across different emotional states and contexts, \" clay says. It appears the bonobos ' peeps serve the same function, and this ability to communicate shows \" many capacities thought to be uniquely human actually have their foundations firmly rooted in the primate lineage. \" ( bonobos also give away food to strangers. )",

Owens is now suing new york city and 11 nypd officers for wrongfully arresting him in the early hours of oct. 23, 2012, as well as for the six weeks he languished at rikers island until his case was dropped for lack of evidence. Owens says in the suit that his trouble started when he clocked out of his stock clerk job at macy's at 3am, then headed home on the no. 1 subway, per newsweek. But several cops got on the train at the 50th street station, \" demanded \" owens ' id, removed him from the train, and searched him. The problem: a crying \" caucasian woman \" who said her backpack had been stolen at a train station at 2: 30am. \" the woman's description of the culprit was limited at best — i.e., a young african american male with a dark hoodie, \" the lawsuit states. Owens had no backpack, offered up his punched timecard, and gave cops contact info for his supervisor, but police took the word of the witness — described in the police affidavit as \" erratic, possibly intoxicated, and definitely hysterical, \" per the daily news — and carted owens off. He was charged with grand larceny and thrown in jail, where he stayed for six weeks because he couldn't pay the $ 3,500 bail — a stint that cost him his job. \" he became a victim of the worst stereotype there is: a young african-american male in a hoodie up to no good, \" his lawyer says.

Defense secretary chuck hagel speaks during the first plenary session of the 12th international institute for strategic studies ( iiss ) asia security summit: the shangri-la dialogue, in singapore june 1, 2013. ( edgar su/reuters ) defense secretary chuck hagel took china to task saturday for alleged cyberespionage, drawing a sharp response from a chinese general who questioned whether the united states ' growing military presence in asia is anything more than a challenge to beijing's rise. Delivering the keynote speech at the annual security summit here known as the shangri-la dialogue, hagel said the united states is \"clear-eyed about the challenges in cyber \" and echoed past assertions by the obama administration that multiplying cyberattacks on u.s. Government and industry portals \"appear to be tied to the chinese government and military. \" it was the latest public charge by the administration, which has concluded that calling out china publicly could curb what u.s. Officials call a brazen and sophisticated quest for american secrets stored online. The obama administration has repeatedly sought to engage china in a dialogue on the issue. In a visit to china in april, secretary of state john f. Kerry won agreement from beijing to set up working group discussions on cyber issues. \"we are determined to work more vigorously with china and other partners to establish international norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace, \" hagel said in his remarks"

Per the local fire chief, the home's resident puppy got its collar stuck on an unused laundry-room gas valve ( the same exact height as the pup's collar, investigators note ), which opened the valve and allowed gas to stream through a vent and into the attic, wlox reports. Which maybe would have worked out ok if a human had noticed the leak in time — but then either the water heater or the furnace clicked on, igniting the explosion. The ap notes laporsha simmons and her three kids weren't at home at the time, and the firefighters removed four dogs from the home, which had a hole blown into one side.

The bbc reports on just how big a deal this is: the 28-year-old's relationship with the company began when she was just 11; the two signed a $ 70 million, 8-year contract in 2010, and she has her own clothing line with the company.

Porsche, whose contract with sharapova runs through 2016, has \" chosen to postpone planned activities \" with her \" until further details are released and we can analyze the situation. \" the drug in question is described by the ap as the \" little-known \" meldonium. Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, has been taking it for a decade; it only this year became a banned substance as per world anti-doping agency code, due to its potential to bolster oxygen uptake and endurance. The drug promotes blood flow, and the new york times quotes sharapova's description of why she started taking it: \" i was getting sick very often. I had a deficiency in magnesium.
