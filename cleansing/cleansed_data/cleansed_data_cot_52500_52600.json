        "summary": "Each day, more than 3,000 children under age 5 die from preterm birth complications — meaning that, for the first time ever, premature birth is the biggest killer of young children around the globe. A new study in the lancet finds that of the 1.1 million such deaths in 2013, 965,000 of them were a direct result of being born too early, with the child dying within 28 days of birth. But another 125,000 deaths happened between the age of 1 month and 5 years, according to a press release. Meanwhile, the overall mortality rate for children under 5 has declined since 2000, as vaccines, antibiotics, and other advances have reduced deaths from pneumonia, measles, and other causes. \" the success we've seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth, \" says a researcher. The first step, which is already underway with $ 250 million in new funding: figure out what causes preterm births. Obesity, high blood pressure, and later-in-life motherhood are all risk factors, but the exact trigger for premature labor remains a \" mystery, \" the telegraph reports. The countries most affected are often poor: india has the highest number of deaths from preterm birth complications, followed by nigeria and pakistan. But even in the us, 28 % of under-5 deaths are caused by such complications, which is above the global average of 17.4 %; the us has \" one of the worst preterm birth rates of any high-resource country, \" the press release notes. Among the new research initiatives: identifying the electric signals that trigger labor and figuring out whether that process is initiated by the mother or the fetus.

Janet and jeremy mcgee bought the dresser specifically for ted, their first child after each had kids in earlier marriages. On the day ted died, janet was checking on him and noticed his empty bed, but figured he was just hiding somewhere during nap time. That's when she found his lifeless body under the fallen six-drawer dresser. Now the family's lawyers — who have already sued ikea for the other two families and started a website about the crisis — are readying a lawsuit for the mcgees.

William whitley, 61, pleaded guilty this week in federal court to sex trafficking of a minor and will likely serve 10 years to life. Prosecutors leveled federal charges partly because his condoms — lifestyles and trojan magnums — were manufactured outside of illinois, meaning he engaged in interstate commerce, the kansas city star reports. His use of a cellphone to snap sexually explicit photos of two girls and paying them with money also hit the \" federal nexus, \" prosecutors say. The condom brands were included in the fbi's criminal complaint the way guns often are. \" the gun traveling is analogous to the condom traveling, \" says a law professor and former federal prosecutor. \" the person who pulled the trigger may not have traveled, but the gun did. This police officer may not have traveled, but an aspect that he used to commit the crime did. \" whitley claimed he didn't know one of the girls was 14 when they had sex over a four-month period in 2015, but investigators suggested that her braces could have tipped him off. He met the other girl, a 16-year-old runaway, at a party where runaways prostituted themselves to older men. She says she gave him oral sex five times for $ 60 to $ 65 each.

One option — and probably the least likely to be adopted — is scrapping the program altogether, while the other three involve taking the vast amount of phone data currently being gathered out of the nsa's hands. Sources say the director of national intelligence and the justice department have presented obama with the following options for shifting the phone data: having phone companies retain the data. Under this option, the nsa would contact phone companies when it needed specific searches of phone records. Telecommunications firms, however, are firmly opposed to this plan. Having another government agency retain the data. The fbi has been spoken of as a possibility for this role, though the foreign intelligence surveillance court is also being considered.

        "summary": "Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in dc: the house has passed legislation to delay obamacare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry reid is expected to table the anti-obamacare amendments with a simple democratic majority and quickly send it back to the house — but if any opportunity arises for senate republicans to use delaying tactics, expect ted cruz to lead the way, the wall street journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the house, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight — which appears to be the likeliest scenario — the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? neither reid nor john boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on obamacare, politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month — and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the gop hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon — but polls show the public will blame his house republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \" like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water, \" quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In washington, dc, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $ 200 million a day — and affect basic services like trash collection. \" this is serious, \" the director of george mason university's",

The company has rolled out \" limited edition \" body wash in the uk packaged in bottles of various shapes, the idea being that women come in various shapes, too. \" every woman's version of beauty is different and, if you ask us, these differences are there to be celebrated, \" says a company statement on the real beauty bottles campaign.

Police say they first tried to subdue flores, 41, with a taser and shield before shooting him, per the san antonio express-news. It isn't clear how many shots were fired or how many times flores was hit. Police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head, holding a baby who may have been injured, per ksat.

Louis jury awarded more than $ 70 million in damages on her claim, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. The 63-year-old californian said those j&j products contributed to her developing ovarian cancer. The jury voted against j&j 10-2 — one of the dissenters actually didn't think the award was enough — with an award of $ 575,000 in medical damages, $ 2 million in compensatory damages, $ 2.5 million in compensatory damages against imerys talc ( the producer of the talcum powder ), and $ 65 million in punitive damages against j&j. About half of the punitive damages will go to the missouri crime victims ' compensation program, per jim onder of onder law, which has handled all three cases with awarded damages so far. Memos from inside j&j show the company knew for decades about research tying the use of talc powder to ovarian cancer, onder says — though cnbc says \" much \" of that research has been \" weak. \" giannecchini, however, had no clue of possible risks. \" there isn't a way to describe how you feel... When you're told you probably won't make it beyond the next year, \" she says of receiving her stage 4 cancer diagnosis in 2012. Per her lawyers, giannecchini has about an 80 % chance of dying within the next two years, bloomberg reports. Not that onder expects j&j to cede to the nearly 2,000 state and federal complaints against it; instead, he believes the company will take a \" scorched-earth legal policy \" and not settle \" until they absolutely have to. \" in a statement, a j&j rep says the company will appeal because it's \" guided by the science, which supports the safety of johnson's baby powder. \"",

But a university of california-davis study has some bad news: researchers have discovered a hybrid \" super mosquito \" that seems to be resistant to the treated nets. The study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences indicates that anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes in mali that cross-bred with the a. Gambiae variety created the superinsect — \"'super ' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides, \" says gregory lanzaro, the study's lead author, in a press release. Although he's not surprised insecticide resistance is rising, it's still worrisome: \" it is resulting in the failure of the nets to provide meaningful control. \" there were about 584,000 deaths from malaria in 2013, 90 % of them occurring in africa, according to the world health organization; every 60 seconds a child there dies from the disease, nothing but nets adds. But inroads have been made: intervention tactics, including insecticide-treated nets, helped cut the mortality rate 54 % in africa between 2000 and 2013, the who notes — and in 2013, 49 % of all african residents at risk for the disease ( up from a mere 3 % in 2004 ) had access to insecticide-laced nets.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: slash film argues you can't blame spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by roald dahl. In fact, only one film based on a dahl book — tim burton's charlie and the chocolate factory — has made more than $ 34 million in us theaters. The wrap has a list of seven reasons the bfg bombed, from \" roald dahl is no jk rowling \" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The bfg might be proof it's time for spielberg to step away from family films, according to the hollywood reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like lincoln and bridge of spies. The wall street journal details spielberg's history of being able to \" bounce back \" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an indiana jones sequel. But the \" reason this stings \" is because every other time spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \" good for you \" film, according to forbes. Whereas the bfg was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, movie pilot argues that the failure of the bfg shouldn't count against any future spielberg or dahl movies. \" the main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous. \"",

            "A narrow stairwell at florida memorial university leads to rooms filled with collages and paintings from around the country. While the artwork varies in style, there's one common theme: almost all of the pieces depict a young man in a hooded sweatshirt. This is the headquarters of the trayvon martin foundation, established by martin's parents after the miami gardens teen was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman. Zimmerman was acquitted last year after a racially charged, contentious trial. The historically black university hosted a ceremony thursday that started and ended with prayer and was filled with spiritual references. The second floor of the school's library quickly became crowded as people filed in. The short program included remarks from the university president, martin's parents and comments from the director of the foundation. Afterward, martin's family used scissors to cut a large blue and orange ribbon. About 100 people attended the ceremony, including local politicians, state representatives, foundation members and miami residents. Martin's mother, sybrina fulton, stood in front of a group of solemn young men from the university's black male college explorers program, a college prep program for at-risk black males. \"as i look at the young men behind me, they remind me of trayvon, \" she said.

Sanford - george zimmerman has no job, no home, no income but spends $ 100 a month on vacations and $ 200 a month on psychological counseling, according to a financial affidavit he recently filed in his divorce case. Immediately after the shooting - feb. 26, 2012 – he quit his job and went into hiding with his wife, shellie, but two months after his acquittal, she filed for divorce, saying he had taken to the road and would not tell her where he was and what he was doing. As part of the divorce case, zimmerman filed a financial affidavit last week, spelling out his income, assets and debts. According to it, he spends $ 3,304 a month, despite having no income. He listed his total assets at $ 14,000 – most of that is his 2008 honda pickup. His debts total $ 2.5 million, most of that is money he owes criminal defense attorneys mark o ' mara and don west. According to his paperwork, zimmerman has no job, pays nothing for rent or a mortgage and has no health insurance"

Richard sackler, whose family owns oxycontin-maker purdue pharma, is one of six inventors behind a new medication that could help people get off drugs including opioids. It would be a new kind of buprenorphine — a gentle opiate that curbs drug cravings — which is already fda-approved in film-strip or tablet form and now would come in wafers disintegrating quickly under the tongue, per the financial times. The best-selling version of buprenorphine, suboxone, made $ 877 million in us sales for the british pharmaceutical company indivior. The patent application says the new drug would help ease crime caused by addicts, but doesn't mention the thousand-plus lawsuits filed against purdue pharma for allegedly spurring the opioid epidemic. \" it's reprehensible what purdue pharma has done to our public health, \" says the director of an addiction treatment center in staten island, new york. He adds that sackler's family \" shouldn't be allowed to peddle any more synthetic opiates — and that includes opioid substitutes. \" the sacklers, known mostly for philanthropy before the opioid epidemic, deny fueling a crisis that killed 42,000 people in 2016. In related news, julia roberts is starring in the new film ben is back about a mother dealing with an opioid-addicted son who comes home for christmas, per usa today.",

        "summary": "Does your toilet paper seem smaller to you these days? well, you're not crazy: it is. As the washington post reports, toilet paper squares used to be 4.5 inches by 4.5 inches. Nowadays, they're up to a half-inch narrower, shorter — or both. ( apparently, it's enough of a difference to be noticeable to the naked eye: last week, a reader wrote in to the los angeles times complaining about a \" 26 % reduction in surface area. \" ) and, as consumer reports noted last year, the cardboard tubes are also increasing in diameter as the number of sheets per roll decreases. But the price is not falling: in 2012 and 2013, the unit price rose about 2 % per year. ( in 2013, the wall street journal explained that the process of selling less paper for the same price is known as \" desheeting. \" ) \" a standard roll is much smaller than it used to be, so now they're selling double rolls. So, without being scientific, i think a double roll is pretty well equivalent to what a standard roll was perhaps a decade ago, \" a research analyst tells npr. One not-as-obvious reason for the tp trend is that companies that make toilet paper also make products like paper towels and napkins. Though toilet paper is essential — americans are estimated to use an average of 46 sheets per day, and that's probably not set to change any time soon — paper towel and napkin sales are falling. In particular, large companies, like offices and restaurants, are moving toward things like air dryers or, the analyst explains, rationing how many napkins they dole out to customers. But they ' ll never cut down on their tp orders in an attempt to ration that particular product, so orders will remain steady. ( as for those hand dryers, you might not want to use them. )",

        "summary": "Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself. Jamaica's parliament last night approved a law decriminalizing small amounts of pot, the ap reports. People found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket — not a crime on their record — and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed. A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking us sanctions, the guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by national security minister peter bunting as an \" elephantine, \" nearly 40-year effort, abc australia reports. \" [ the law ] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records, \" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the guardian notes. International exporting, however, remains a no-no. A us counternarcotics official told the ap in an email that \" jamaican law is of course jamaica's own business, \" but warned that drug trafficking into the us is still illegal.",

        "summary": "Politico has an interesting article on what it's calling \" the democrats ' wage problem, \" a major takeaway of which is that the average american income has actually gone down during obama's years as president. The median household income in 2014 was more than $ 1,600 lower than it was in january 2009, according to census data. And while a recent survey says median household income is finally above its 2009 level this year, it's barely 1 % above it. Politico calls this \" one of the biggest weaknesses in the obama economic recovery \" and says it could be a big problem for hillary clinton since she was part of the administration. However politico reports none of that is to say republicans know how to fix stagnant wages or have even shown themselves able to capably address the issue. \"it's a bit awkward if republicans are talking about the need for wage growth and opposed to a minimum wage increase, \" one political scientist tells politico. Only one gop presidential candidate — rick santorum — has a proposal to raise the national minimum wage, and it's more modest than similar proposals from any of the democratic candidates. The majority of the other republican candidates favor fixing stagnant wages through tax cuts and deregulation, policies that only exacerbated the problem under george w. Bush.

It is unclear how the ruling would apply to the rest of the industry. The ruling detailed the experiences of two wells fargo customers who used their debit cards for multiple small purchases, and were then charged hundreds in overdraft fees because the order the purchases were cleared by the bank depended on the amounts.

Nationwide, banks and credit unions collected almost $ 24 billion in overdraft",

To change what he called \" unfair and deceptive business practices \" that led customers into paying multiple overdraft fees, and to pay $ 203 million back to customers. In a decision handed down late tuesday, u.s. District judge william alsup accused wells fargo of \" profiteering \" by changing its policies to process checks, debit card transactions and bill payments from the highest dollar amount to the lowest, rather than in the order the transactions took place. That helped drain customer bank accounts faster and drive up overdraft fees, a policy alsup referred to as \" gouging and profiteering. \" wells fargo adopted the policies beginning in 2001, and they became widespread across the banking industry. It is unclear how the ruling would apply to the rest of the industry. The ruling detailed the experiences of two wells fargo customers who used their debit cards for multiple small purchases, and were then charged hundreds in overdraft fees because the order the purchases were cleared by the bank depended on the amounts. The judge found the customers, who were part of a class action, were not properly informed of the bank's policies on processing payments and were unaware the bank would allow debit purchases to go through when their accounts were overdrawn. \" internal bank memos and e-mails leave no doubt that"

        "summary": "About six years ago, scientists discovered a huge ring around saturn that also happened to be invisible to the naked eye. Now, they've learned that it's much bigger than they thought, and their theory on how it came to be might change some thinking about planetary rings and moons. Scientists previously estimated the ring to be about 200 times the radius of saturn, but now they say it's 30 % larger, or about 270 times the radius, they write in nature. It stretches more than 10 million miles, which a post at phys.org puts into perspective: \" if saturn were merely the size of a basketball, this new outer ring would extend nearly two thirds the length of a football field away from it. \" or as lead author douglas hamilton puts it in the los angeles times: \"it is 10 to 20 times larger than the second-biggest ring, so this thing is absolutely gargantuan. \" researchers also found that the ring is made of up surprisingly small particles, with only about 10 % of them larger than a soccer ball. They suspect the material, which is quite spread out within the ring, comes from the saturn moon phoebe, but it was previously believed that debris ejected at such a distance would form a moon rather than a ring. \" now it appears such theories will have to be rethought, \" says the phys.org post. The ring can be detected only in infrared wavelengths. Based on all this, it's possible that jupiter, uranus, and neptune have similar rings, reports wired. \"maybe ring isn't even the right word anymore, \" says hamilton, \" maybe we should call them clouds. Those are much harder to detect and convince yourself that they're real. \" ( another of saturn's moons might be able to support life. )",

        "summary": "It's been more than half a century since francis tully found the monster that has since defied classification. Now, scientists say they know where the prehistoric oddball that lived some 308 million years ago fits on the tree of life: \" the tully monster is a vertebrate, \" according to research published wednesday in nature. That's a big step for the creature tully discovered when he was hunting for fossils in the mazon creek geological deposits southeast of chicago in 1955. Previously the tully monster, with its torpedo body, hammerhead-like eyes, and long proboscis filled with sharp teeth, had been categorized as \" problematica \" — \" creatures that defied ready classification, \" the chicago tribune reports. Some have speculated that tullimonstrum gregarium — which, despite its name, is only about a foot long — was related to snails, worms, or insects and crabs, reports the new york times. \" if you put in a box a worm, a mollusk, an arthropod, and a fish, and you shake, \" one paleontologist tells the tribune, \" then what you have at the end is a tully monster, \" some have even floated the idea that the tully monster was a tiny version of the loch ness monster, per smithsonian. However, the researchers found that tully is related to the lamprey, an \" underwater bloodsucker, \" as the times puts it. Using a synchrotron x-ray machine, researchers were able to determine that what was previously thought to be the creature's gut was actually a notochord, \" the primitive backbone, \" study lead victoria mccoy tells the times. \" the coolest thing is finding out that as weird as it looks it is part of a familiar group of animals. \" check out a graphic of the tully monster.

Much as the people of metropolis wondered whether superman flying overhead was a bird or a plane, scientists have struggled to classify these fossils that showed traits associated with several disparate animal types and such abnormalities as eyes mounted on an external bar and a long, toothy proboscis. \" if you put in a box a worm, a mollusk, an arthropod and a fish, and you shake, then what you have at the end is a tully monster, \" said carmen soriano, a paleontologist at argonne national laboratory. The tully's renown stretched even to the illinois state legislature, which named it the official state fossil in 1989, some 308 million years after it inhabited the shallow salty waters that turned into the state's mazon creek geological deposits, in grundy county, one of the richest fossil troves on earth.

They published their findings on wednesday in nature. To come to their conclusion, team members first pored over 1,200 tully monster specimens from museums. They closely examined the creature's features, like its torpedo-shaped body and triangular tail, the proboscis that looks like an elephant's trunk with sharp teeth, and the eyes on the side of its head, which resemble a hammerhead, but are similar to eye stalks found in crabs and insects.

Clinton's campaign is doubling down, however, with a rep accusing the discovery process of being tainted by \" bureaucratic infighting \" and a state department spokesman proclaiming that \" classification is rarely a black and white question. … at this time, any conclusion about the classification of the documents in question would be premature. \" the \" top secret \" designation, signed off on by president obama in a 2009 executive order, is bestowed on info that, if revealed, \" could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to … national security. \" but clinton herself backed up her rep's assessment, telling the ap yesterday in iowa that \" there is always a debate among different agencies about [ whether ] something should be retroactively [ marked classified ]. \" when asked why she isn't offering up any direct apologies, she added, \" what i did was allowed.

He smashed the previous record time for the trek, set by frank giannino in 1980, by four days, though guinness world records has yet to confirm the time. Kostelnick, who started running several years ago to lose weight, fell twice, per espn, but the only real casualties were the eight pairs of shoes he burned through running 15 hours per day, starting at 3: 30am, with two 15-minute breaks. A financial planner and two-time winner of the 135-mile badwater ultramarathon, per competitor, kostelnick drew comparisons to forrest gump, not only because of his bubba gump hat.

They \" sit down on church steps, eat their food, and leave rubbish strewn on them, \" with no respect for \" our cultural heritage, \" nardella tells the guardian.

That way, if tourists sit down, \" they ' ll get wet, \" nardella said in announcing the strategy wednesday. Shortly after the announcement, the steps of both the basilica of santa croce and the chiesa di santo spirito were doused. In the future, this will be a daily occurrence, reports the telegraph. \" instead of imposing fines, we thought this measure was more elegant, \" nardella tells the guardian, adding other areas might eventually get a wash as well. While some social media users joked that a free shower might be nice in the heat of summer, others have accused city officials of being \" elitist \" in targeting tourists who choose not to eat in florence's restaurants, per the local. Nardella counters that the city has plenty of outdoor seating for tourists. Churches, however, are no place for a picnic, he says. ( barcelona has an issue with its tourists, too. )",

            "On wednesday, the kansas house of representatives took a step back to the 1890s with a shameful bill that borrows from jim crow to legalize discrimination against gay couples. Approved by a vote of 72 to 49, house bill no. 2453 would allow businesses and government employees to deny service to same-sex couples on the basis of their religious beliefs.

The doctor realized the mistake afterward and tried to get as much of the detergent out of hannah's lung as he could, but hannah's lawyers say the grandfather's condition deteriorated and he died the next day. In a statement to people, the hospital's medical director acknowledges that hannah \" did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on. \" the bbc cites an internal hospital report that found what happened to hannah was due to various factors, including poor communication and staff training, a container without a label, an equipment cart that wasn't adequately stocked, and \" distraction by other life critical tasks. \" an inquiry into the exact cause of hannah's death will take place in early 2019.

The hackers reportedly infiltrated the controls for the facility — ided by journal sources as the bowman avenue dam near rye — in 2013 through a cellular modem, per an unclassified homeland security document. And while the interlopers didn't wrest control of the dam, it appears they poked around quite a bit — underscoring how easy it is to break into the more than 57,000 systems for us power grids, pipelines, bridges, and dams, many of which are antiquated and virtually unprotected, the journal notes. In fact, per a separate ap investigation, \" sophisticated foreign hackers \" have accessed about a dozen power networks here, attacks that the ap says the us public is rarely informed about. Us infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe. But, \" against the advice of hacking gurus, \" as the journal notes, many companies started connecting their systems to the internet without adequately securing them. And the number of such hacks has been creeping up since. Per homeland security data, over the 12 months ending sept. 30, it took in and responded to 295 incidents, up from 245 the year before, per the journal. Possible consequences: hackers causing a flood, explosion, or even bumper-to-bumper traffic, either by accident or intentionally. A homeland security official recently told energy execs at a conference that even isis \" is beginning to perpetrate cyberattacks, \" per the hill. In the bowman dam incident, the white house was informed because officials initially thought the hack was against oregon's larger arthur r. Bowman dam, per the journal.

        "summary": "The most recent planet of the apes trilogy started with a bang. It's going out the same way. Critics are raving about war for the planet of the apes, directed and co-written by matt reeves; it currently has an impressive 94 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: it's a \" consistently intelligent, morally thoughtful and often beautiful picture \" with a \" coherent and credible \" story that's just as impressive as the action, writes charles taylor at newsweek. He adds the \" special effects are used to support the story rather than supplant it. \" one downside: each scene featuring woody harrelson's colonel \" feels strained, not least because this usually terrific actor has been saddled with one of the film's few caricatures. \" but brian lowry says harrelson \" is at his wild-eyed best \" in what he calls \" the summer's best sequel, \" and \" a stirring, soulful conclusion to a trilogy that has brilliantly evolved from its original source. \" this is \" one of those rare instances of a movie billed as a ' climactic chapter'that actually possesses the feeling and majesty of one, \" he writes at cnn, also commending andy serkis ' intense portrayal of the ape caesar. Serkis is not only \" brilliant \" but his appearance is \" so lifelike that you forget you're looking at a visual-effects triumph, \" writes chris klimek at npr. The film itself, wrapping up a \" shockingly good series of prequels, \" is \" suspenseful, mournful, grand, \" with \" gravitas and commitment \" that give it \" a place of pride in our current apocalyptic renaissance, \" klimek adds. Sara stewart feels \" the imagery and the nonstop horror are a little too heavy-handed. \" but the flick still shines with \" an epic and heartbreaking second half that broadly references the holocaust, internment camps, refugees and even the bible, \" she writes at the new york post. \" apologies to charlton heston loyalists, but war for the planet of the apes is a good example of how today's movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies, \" she adds. \" it seems wrong to even group them in the same franchise. \"",

Doctor who evaluated american and canadian diplomats working in havana diagnosed them with conditions as serious as mild traumatic brain injury, and with likely damage to the central nervous system. The diplomats complained about symptoms ranging from hearing loss and nausea to headaches and balance disorders after the state department said \" incidents \" began affecting them beginning in late 2016. A source familiar with these incidents says officials are investigating whether the diplomats were targets of a type of sonic attack directed at their homes, which were provided by the cuban government. The source says reports of more attacks affecting u.s. Embassy workers on the island continue. The doctor, one of several who reviewed their cases, included a warning in the medical records about the health risks of future exposures. The diplomats underwent comprehensive audiological evaluations and a battery of other tests. In a statement received by cbs news from the university of miami health system, they confirmed its physicians were \" consulted \" by state on its diplomats in cuba. \" like any top-notch academic medical center in the nation, the university of miami is often consulted regarding complex health care issues or emerging diseases.

He also caused trouble in school and was known as a \"holy terror, \" says linda hooper, a teacher who first encountered cruz in the early '80s, when he was 12 years old. But then an amazing thing happened: he started spending more time with hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, cruz's mother asked if he could stay with the hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \" he never left \" after that, hooper says. \" i had him from then on. \" he became a part of the hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the hooper family — but he wanted to make it official by asking the hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. \"he said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor, \" hooper tells today. \" i've always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us. \" the adoption went through in 1998, but cruz \" was my son from the day i kept him, \" hooper says.

Climate scientist gordon hamilton, a 50-year-old scotsman, died saturday when his snowmobile plunged into a crevasse in an area known as the \" shear zone, \" 25 miles south of the mcmurdo research station, according to the national science foundation, which describes the area as a \" three-mile wide and more than 125-mile long swath of intensely crevassed ice \" where two ice shelves meet. Hamilton and his colleagues spent years trying to map the region, using robots and ground-penetrating radar, the washington post reports. Hamilton fell 100 feet into the ice after hitting a crevasse that may have been covered in snow and hard to spot. When he wasn't carrying out research in frozen parts of the world, hamilton was a research professor at the university of maine's climate change institute, specializing in glaciology. His work, which focused on the contribution of ice sheet shifts to sea level rise, \" was second to none, \" university president susan hunter said sunday in a statement, per the new york times. Hamilton's body was recovered and will be returned to his wife and two children in maine. Kelly falkner, director of polar programs for the nsf, called the death a \" tragic reminder of the risks we all face \" in field research. ( a worker at the south pole needed to be rescued a few months ago. )",

The us, britain, germany, and france temporarily removed hundreds of advisers from afghanistan over the weekend in the wake of several retaliatory attacks — four us troops have been killed by afghan comrades since the protests began — and some fear that afghan security forces will not be able to protect the few western advisers who will remain in afghanistan after the withdrawal is complete. One adviser says he expects that upon their reinstatement, shifts will have to be shortened for the advisers ' protection. Recent months have seen a number of incidents involving afghan security forces turning on nato personnel — and only some out of those incidents arose out of loyalty to the taliban, the washington post notes. Most involved afghan troops who felt insulted in some fashion, such as after the koran burning came to light, and military experts think there could be an even higher risk of such attacks after the military withdrawal.

Obama's exact location at any given point during the day is also often kept on the down-low, and certain parts of the white house are off-limits to the press, the hill adds. Besides the white house scheduling and press offices, others who use the hacked system include the general counsel's office and the budget and legislative liaison offices, abc news reports. The hackers are believed to have accessed the white house network by first hacking state department files, according to investigators, which leads to the fear that hackers have gotten back into the state department system. One official tells cnn that the hackers have \" owned \" the network \" for months. \" \" there's always vulnerability, \" deputy national security adviser ben rhodes noted at a press conference, per cbs news. \" the fact is that's why we have a classified system because there's less risk in the classified system, and that is secure. \" ( the fbi is going after one russian hacker in particular. )",

        "summary": "\" no president has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the jewish, christian, and muslim faiths all on one trip, \" says national security adviser hr mcmaster — and president trump's critics say there are probably good reasons why. Trump departs friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include saudi arabia, israel, and the vatican, a nato meeting in belgium, and the g7 summit in sicily. A roundup of coverage: trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be saudi arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 muslim countries, cnn reports. Mcmaster says trump's goal is \" to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity, \" and his speech in riyadh will focus on the need to \" confront radical ideology \" and allow a \" peaceful vision of islam \" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be israel, where his plans include visits to the western wall and the west bank town of bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of masada after israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the jerusalem post that trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to israeli settlement expansion. The president's european stops will include meetings with pope francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new french president emmanuel macron, who will meet trump for a working lunch may 25. Sources tell the new york times that trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen j. Hadley, george w. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \" remember, trump is a nothing if not a showman, \" hadley says. \"he's been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media. \" heritage foundation foreign policy expert james carofano tells the washington post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in dc. \" the great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access, \" he says. \" if you fumble on one of these trips, it's",

One of the first blunders may have been allowing his political consultant, mike murphy, to hold senior staff meetings in a hotel inside the dallas/fort worth airport — odd for an almost-campaign that's technically based in florida. The awkwardness that created is just one example of the splintered nature of the upcoming campaign: there have been conflicts, for instance, between longstanding staffers and newer ones, and disagreements over dividing funding between bush's super pac and the campaign itself. \"these things are always tug of wars, \" bush ally thomas d. Rath says. \"it's almost like the first day of school, everyone trying to get to the right place and find the right seats. \" the first day of school may have been more like musical chairs, as republican party strategist danny diaz was named campaign manager earlier this week over the more expected choice — david kochel. The selection of diaz just a week before bush declares his candidacy monday is evidence that his team is still working out serious kinks, write ed o ' keefe and robert costa; their piece traces bush's other apparent problems, including shortfalls in both fundraising and the polls, and of course, that iraq blunder. \" in interviews this week, dozens of bush backers and informed republicans...

Mike murphy, bush's political alter ego, decided early on to hold regular senior staff meetings at an unusual location: a hyatt hotel inside a terminal at dallas/fort worth international airport. The idea was that it was a central and relatively inexpensive gathering place for a team scattered from los angeles, where murphy lives, to miami, where the would-be candidate resides. It went fine at first but quickly became an awkward routine. Donors and other republicans found the setup ungainly for a campaign-in-waiting that was supposed to be based in florida. Older bush hands also grew unhappy with rapid hiring by new advisers, and relationships frayed, according to bush associates. And as the former florida governor began to founder on the trail and in the polls, the discussions flared into arguments about how to divvy up money and resources between bush's allied super pac and his official campaign. \"these things are always tug of wars, \" thomas d.

Bush called danny diaz, his new campaign manager, \"a grinder. \" he added that david kochel, who had been expected to lead the political operation, was best suited to serve as chief strategist, with a focus on states like iowa that hold caucuses and primaries in the early part of the campaign.

Mike murphy, bush's political alter ego, decided early on to hold regular senior staff meetings at an unusual location: a hyatt hotel inside a terminal at dallas/fort worth international airport. The idea was that it was a central and relatively inexpensive gathering place for a team scattered from los angeles, where murphy lives, to miami, where the would-be candidate resides. It went fine at first but quickly became an awkward routine. Donors and other republicans found the setup ungainly for a campaign-in-waiting that was supposed to be based in florida. Older bush hands also grew unhappy with rapid hiring by new advisers, and relationships frayed, according to bush associates. And as the former florida governor began to founder on the trail and in the polls, the discussions flared into arguments about how to divvy up money and resources between bush's allied super pac and his official campaign. \"these things are always tug of wars, \" thomas d. Rath, a bush family friend in new hampshire, said of the initial sessions. \"it's almost like the first day of school, everyone trying to get to the right place and find the right seats. \" in a speech delivered in berlin during",

In his first remarks about the reshuffling, mr. Bush, a former governor of florida, pleaded for patience and played down the idea that he was displeased with his standing in a crowded republican field. He is expected to formally enter the race next week. \"it's june, for crying out loud, so we've got a long way to go, \" he said during a news conference held outside his hotel here on the second and final day of meetings and speeches in the german capital. \"i just urge everybody to be a little more patient about this. \" mr. Bush called danny diaz, his new campaign manager, \"a grinder. \" he added that david kochel, who had been expected to lead the political operation, was best suited to serve as chief strategist, with a focus on states like iowa that hold caucuses and primaries in the early part of the campaign. That \"is where his skills sets are, \" said mr. Bush, who called mr. Kochel \"a great strategic mind. \" pressed on"

Two suspected terrorists were shot dead in the series of raids, and another 15 were arrested in belgium and france, the guardian reports. Authorities were working to take down what they say was an active terror cell rooted in the two countries; the two gunmen killed in verviers — and a third one who was wounded and among those detained — are believed to have been part of a \" homegrown cell of jihadists \" just recently back in europe from syria. Police found ammo, weapons including explosives, police uniforms, communication devices, and cash; they say the terrorists ' plan also targeted buildings in belgium, and several jewish schools have been closed after warnings they could be targets. More: the gare de l ' est train station in paris was also evacuated after a bomb scare today, and europe is on high alert for potential attacks. Officials say there is no link between the belgium raids and last week's paris terror attacks, but one notes that \" a second potential paris has been averted \" with these raids. ( another 10 suspected terrorists allegedly linked to the charlie hebdo attacks were arrested in paris today. ) a western intelligence source tells cnn that as many as 180 people in as many as 20 sleeper cells are primed to attack france, germany, belgium, and the netherlands. And european security services have gotten tips that isis may be telling europeans who have joined up in syria and iraq to launch attacks on their home soil; security agencies are investigating people recently returned from those countries. Separately, germany arrested three men suspected of being involved with isis, but none appear to have been planning attacks.",

The country's kpl news agency, via the bbc, reports that the collapse of an auxiliary dam attached to the main xepian-xe nam noy hydropower dam led to flash floods in the southeastern laos province, sending locals to the roofs of their houses and boats out to rescue survivors. The new york times notes that 175 billion cubic feet of water gushed out and flooded the area; sky news notes that's about the amount that would fill 2 million olympic-size swimming pools. The dam, which was on schedule to open in 2019, is a joint project run by two south korean companies, including sk engineering and construction, as well as thai and lao lenders. An sk e&c official quoted by the yonhap news agency says a deluge of rain that's about three times more than usual had flooded the auxiliary dam. Yonhap says officials are still trying to figure out if the dam overflowed or simply gave way. The dam in laos, one of asia's most poverty-stricken nations, was set to bring in billions of dollars for the country by helping to generate electricity that would mostly be exported to thailand.",

Dawnta anthony harris is awaiting a bail hearing. Amy caprio, a four-year veteran of the baltimore county police department, was responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle in perry hall when she stumbled on what police think was a burglary. Witnesses describe seeing police encounter a black jeep down a dead end street, per cbs baltimore. \" i heard, ' get out of the car! '... And then a pop, \" a man tells the ap. A neighbor says his son also heard a pop after seeing the officer confront the jeep's occupants with her gun drawn. He says the jeep then hit her, throwing her about 20 feet, per the baltimore sun. Caprio was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly before 3pm; the sun has more on her here. An autopsy and body camera footage will provide more details, say police, who launched a manhunt after recovering a jeep they believe was involved in the crime, reports the sun. On tuesday, officers said that the land and air search continues for three suspects considered armed and dangerous. A local councilman describes the search zone as \" a densely populated area with a lot of stream valleys and places where people can hide, \" per the sun. Nearly 2,000 students remained at area schools into the evening monday before an order to shelter in place was lifted. Cpl. Shawn vinson said monday the investigation would continue \" throughout the night \" and \" all day tomorrow. \"",

        "summary": "\" why do sheep get frisky in winter? \" isn't the beginning of a bad joke, but rather the question that jump-started a joint study by researchers at the university of nottingham and the university of bristol. The guardian reports that scientists may now have an answer, one that could help farmers better control the breeding season. That answer, laid out in the journal pnas, is a bit complicated. It's been known for some time that sheep's fertility is tied to production of the hormone melatonin, but how melatonin communicates with the pituitary gland, which shoots off sex hormones, has been a mystery. \" no one has been able to find what the link is, \" says co-author david bates. Until now, perhaps. Press releases from nottingham and bristol explain what may solve this 30-year-old puzzle: a protein made in the pituitary gland called vascular endothelial growth factor. It's made in two different forms, and scientists say melatonin controls which one surfaces. In the summer ( when melatonin is in shorter supply ), vegf makes blood vessels grow and serves as a sheep-sex buzzkill of sorts. But in the winter, vegf blocks blood vessel growth — and also appears to trigger a sex hormone spike. \"now we know what that link is we can start to understand how it can be controlled, \" says bates. In addition to helping farmers, the study could lead to developments in studying hormonal and seasonal patterns in humans in regard to endocrine diseases.

            "Animals need to measure the time of year so that they can anticipate and adapt to the arrival of a new season to align reproduction, as well as other vital functions critical for survival. A new study, conducted at the university of bristol, has identified how animals measure annual time to control seasonal fertility. In birds and mammals, this process of adaptation is mediated by the release of hormones from the pituitary gland that control multiple functions such as reproduction, the response to stress, and when the animals grow a new coat. The measurement of day length, however, and consequently time of year, is mediated by the hormone melatonin, which is released from the pineal gland during the night. Until now, how melatonin could signal to the pituitary was not understood and has been the subject of a 30-year quest. The study, published in the journal proceedings of the"

Following obama's reelection, americans trusted him over congressional republicans on the economy by 18 points; now the gap is just four points in obama's favor, 44 % to 40 %, the post reports. Obama's 50 % mark puts him behind most modern presidents at this moment in their second terms — with the exception of george w. Bush, who also had a 50 % approval rating. As for the sequester, a slight majority opposes it, but some three-quarters say it hasn't had an effect on them. On the other hand, most believe it will eventually hurt the economy. Some 47 % say congressional republicans are to blame for it, while 33 % say obama is to blame. But 68 % say they want the two sides to cooperate to end the cuts.

In december, just after he won a second term, obama held an 18-percentage-point advantage over congressional republicans on the question of whom the public trusted more to deal with the economy. Now, it's a far more even split — 44 percent to 40 percent, with a slight edge for the president — but the share of those saying they have confidence in \"neither \" has ticked up into double digits.

Almost two weeks into the automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, a slim majority of americans dis­approve of the reductions. At the same time, nearly three-quarters say they are feeling no impact on their lives, and fewer than half expect a toll on their family finances if the cuts continue. Still, large majorities expect that the sequester will eventually damage the economy, the military and the government's ability to provide basic services.

        "summary": "It's long been known that the predecessors of modern humans and neanderthals lived side by side, but it wasn't until 2010 that it was discovered the two species interbred. In fact, as much as 4 % of the dna of modern humans with european or asian ancestry comes from neanderthals, reports the guardian. That intermingling is bound to have consequences, but researchers who've been looking for them were surprised to find a dozen traits specifically linked to neanderthal genetic variants — including risk for nicotine addiction, artery thickening, heart attack, and depression. Researchers arrived at their conclusions, published in the journal science, after cross-referencing neanderthal dna with a database of 28,000 people of european ancestry that pulls together biological samples and electronic health records. \" the brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences, \" lead author corinne simonti says in a vanderbilt news statement. Case in point: the researchers found neanderthal dna increases blood clotting, which would have helped seal wounds more speedily; but for modern man, hypercoagulation ups the risk of miscarriage, stroke, and more, reports live science. Oh, and the popular idea that neanderthal dna influences skin tone is probably bunk, the researchers add, noting skin color differences likely emerged much more recently.

            "Neanderthal dna has subtle but significant impact on human traits sharelines tweet hooked on cigarettes? your neanderthal dna might be to blame tweet neanderthal dna linked to dozens of human traits and diseases since 2010 scientists have known that people of eurasian origin have inherited anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of their dna from neanderthals. The discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans, ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism … generating dozens of colorful headlines including \"what your neanderthal dna is doing for you \" and \"neanderthals are to blame for our allergies \" and \"did europeans get fat from neanderthals? \" now, the first study that directly compares neanderthal dna in the genomes of a significant population of adults of european ancestry with their clinical records confirms that this archaic genetic legacy has a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology. \"our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans: we discovered associations between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits, including immunological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric and reproductive diseases, \" said john capra, senior author of the paper \"the phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and neanderthals \" published in the feb. 12 issue of the journal science. The evolutionary geneticist is an assistant professor of biological sciences at vanderbilt university. Some of the associations that capra and his colleagues found confirm previous hypotheses.

            "Neanderthal dna has subtle but significant impact on human traits sharelines tweet hooked on cigarettes? your neanderthal dna might be to blame tweet neanderthal dna linked to dozens of human traits and diseases since 2010 scientists have known that people of eurasian origin have inherited anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of their dna from neanderthals. The discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans, ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism … generating dozens of colorful headlines including \"what your neanderthal dna is doing for you \" and \"neanderthals are to blame for our allergies \" and \"did europeans get fat from neanderthals? \" now, the first study that directly compares neanderthal dna in the genomes of a significant population of adults of european ancestry with their clinical records confirms that this archaic genetic legacy has a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology. \"our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans: we discovered associations between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits, including immunological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric and reproductive diseases, \" said john capra, senior author of the paper \"the phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and neanderthals \" published in the feb. 12 issue of the journal science. The evolutionary geneticist is an assistant professor of biological sciences at vanderbilt university. Some of the associations that capra and his colleagues found confirm previous hypotheses. One example is the proposal that neanderthal dna affects cells called keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and pathogens.

In what could be a last-ditch effort to save the mission, scientists with the european space agency say they ' ll try to make the philae lander essentially hop to a different spot — one in which it might get more juice in the form of sunlight for its solar panels, reports the guardian. Researchers still don't know exactly where the lander is, only that it's surrounded by rocks blocking most sunlight, perhaps next to a cliff, reports the bbc. In the meantime, the lander has begun drilling about 10 inches deep into the comet to collect samples that scientists would love to analyze, given that they are presumably billions of years old, reports the ap. The question is whether the battery will hold out long enough to transmit any data, while the very act of drilling is draining it further. \" maybe the battery will be empty before we contact again, \" says stephan ulamec, head of the lander mission. The battery isn't expected to last beyond tomorrow, but if esa is able to shift the lander to a sunnier locale, the data collection could go on for months.

        "summary": "Remember the hubbub over this trailer with nsfw puppets? well, the happytime murders is out friday, starring melissa mccarthy as a detective probing a series of puppet murders with her puppet partner. Critics, meanwhile, are busy investigating why the r-rated film is, in their opinions, downright awful. ( the film has a 26 % \" fresh \" rating on rotten tomatoes. ) what they're saying: while \" there's a cheeky freshness in the early scenes, \" the film \" too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long … probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless, \" james berardinelli writes at reelviews. Mccarthy surprisingly doesn't help, he writes. She \" has the life of a piece of background furniture. \" brian truitt argues \" mccarthy is as sharp-witted as ever, \" but his praise basically ends there. With gags that \" make fozzie bear a comedic genius by comparison, \" this \" scattershot comedy isn't nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is, \" he writes at usa today, adding \" there are much better uses of your time than this travesty. \" \" there's more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks, \" johnny oleksinski writes at the new york post, noting the film is \" as stale as a neglected saltine. \" the prevailing problem: \" it's not funny, \" oleksinski writes. In fact, \" the only cast member who earns some giggles is maya rudolph. \" mara reinstein is just relieved her viewing experience is over. \" the happytime murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end. And those 90 minutes in between are excruciating. Let me put it in italics for emphasis. Excruciating, \" she writes at us weekly, calling out the \" lazy use of gross-out humor. \"",
