        "summary": "On july 2, 1937, record-setting aviator amelia earhart, along with navigator fred noonan, likely ran out of fuel and crashed into the pacific ocean somewhere between new guinea and california and disappeared forever, according to the smithsonian. Not so, says writer wc jameson. In amelia earhart: beyond the grave, out tuesday, jameson builds on the existing theory that earhart was a spy and was shot down by the japanese ( or captured after a crash or forced landing ) and taken prisoner while on a mission to photograph japanese military installations in the pacific, fox news reports. Fdr knew about the whole thing, per jameson, but kept it quiet. Released by the japanese in 1945, he claims, earhart returned to the us and lived under the name irene craigmile bolam until she died in 1982, when she would have been about 86. The theory that earhart was a spy and that she and noonan were taken prisoner has been around for some time. Early last year a group of men traveled to the marshall islands ( which was held at the time by the japanese military, red orbit notes ) to hunt for evidence to back up the claim, wkyc reports. They found about six pieces of metal they believe came from earhart's plane. They were having the items tested for authenticity, but there's been no word on the results. For his book, jameson reportedly interviewed the nephew of a former us army official who said it was common knowledge in \" high-ranking intelligence circles \" that earhart was \" involved in an intelligence-gathering operation. \" jameson also claims that flight logs from the last coast guard station she communicated with were altered after her disappearance.

The agency's director tells the paper that more than 1,000 agents have already logged all the work and overtime hours they're permitted for 2017. The related payment cap is set at $ 160,000 per year, and director randolph alles is trying to get congress to bump that to $ 187,000. A trio of points: he says if that doesn't happen, agents won't be paid for some of the hours they've already put in; even if it does, roughly 130 agents still won't get full compensation; the size of the trump family is part of the reason for the issue. \" the president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law, \" alles tells the paper, which describes him as saying the number of white house protectees — 42 — has never been so high. Under former president obama, it was 31; of the current 42, 18 are president trump's family members. The timing of the revelation isn't great: september will see world leaders gather in nyc for the united nations general assembly, an event that requires very heavy secret service protection.

Some of the oldest galaxies visible appear as light from nearly 12 billion years ago, almost as old as the universe, but nasa says the most exciting part of the image is the use of ultraviolet light, which reveals the \" missing link \" of galaxies 5 billion to 10 billion years old — the chunk of time when most of the universe's stars came to be. A caltech astronomer likens the previous lack of information from ultraviolet light to studying \" families by first studying infants, and then studying grown-ups after they've gone to college, but completely missing everything in between and not knowing about school.... The addition of the ultraviolet fills in this missing range. \" the light shows up in the photo as bright blue. The image, 11 years in the making, was taken over 841 orbits of the telescope. Many of the approximately 10,000 galaxies it shows \" are distorted, victims of collisions with other galaxies, their mutual gravity pulling them into weird shapes like taffy quadrillions of kilometers across, \" writes phil plait at slate. But as amazing as hubble's latest image is, the infrared-friendly james webb telescope is expected to send back even greater deep-space shots after its launch in 2018, notes chris taylor at mashable. \" use this one as your desktop for now, but be prepared to blow your mind with a lot better shots than this in a few years'time, \" he writes.

The columnist says his suspicions were confirmed when he raised the question on facebook and was met by a barrage of comments from liberals along the lines of this one: \" much of the 'conservative ' worldview consists of ideas that are known empirically to be false. \" kristof runs through stats showing how difficult it is for conservative professors to find teaching jobs, adding that \" this liberal bias on campuses creates liberal privilege. \" the whole notion of \" ideological diversity \" in academia \" seems a liberal blind spot, \" he writes, one that's overdue for a long look.

That's the longest such journey ever recorded of a mammal, surpassing the humpback whale's migration of about 10,000 miles, reports usa today. Varvara began her journey off the coast of russia, made her way to mexico — her apparent birth place — and then returned to russia, researchers say in the journal biology letters. Varvara is thought to be a western north pacific gray whale, a species considered critically endangered, but the journey to breeding grounds of her more plentiful eastern cousins is causing researchers to wonder whether the two species are as distinct as once thought. \" the ability of the whales to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive and suggests that some western gray whales might actually be eastern grays, \" says lead study author bruce mate of oregon state university, as quoted in nature world news. Previously, scientists thought there were about 180 western gray whales alive, but the study raises the possibility that \" true \" westerns are already extinct or at least exist in even smaller numbers than thought, reports the bbc. Researchers hope to tag more whales and follow more journeys to get a clearer picture. ( in other whale news, a whale fossil has given up clues about our own origins. )",

According to contestants, vehicle add-ons were removed after filming or didn't work, \" pimping \" kept cars in garages for months, and labor under the hood was so shoddy that vehicles had mechanical issues; one literally burst into flames, albeit years later. But a pimp my ride co-executive producer defends the show, saying some items ( like a pop-up champagne holder ) were removed \" out of abundance of caution \" and many cars \" were so old and rusted \" that problems were unavoidable. \" the car shops worked their butts off to get parts for these cars, \" he says. Among other complaints, a contestant wrote on reddit of being \" fat-shamed \" ( they gave his car a cotton candy machine ) while another was allegedly told to dump his girlfriend to seem more in need of \" pimping. \" others say reactions were faked: one guy was quietly stunned by work on his car but says a big man on set told him that \" we expect you to be a little more f --- ing enthusiastic. \" so the contestant went \" ape s -- t \" in a reaction that \" became a bit of a meme, \" says huffpo. On the bright side, contestants say their pimped-up vehicles attracted attention or sold at good prices. One got around mtv's no-sell contract by gifting her revamped car to her boyfriend, who then sold it for $ 7,500: \" a clever gambit ( if i do say so myself ) that mtv's lawyers didn't find quite so charming, \" she writes at dailyworth.

It also helped that it premiered before the glut of fall shows started competing for viewers.

Jcf capital, which bought the 65-story hotel and condo complex earlier this year, has paid the trump organization to exit its management contracts and remove the trump name from the building. Sources tell bloomberg that the \" breakup fee \" was around $ 6 million and the president's name will be gone from the downtown tower within weeks. The trump organization licensed the name but never owned a stake in the tower, which opened in 2012 and suffered from problems including low occupancy rates and huge cost overruns. The tower became a target for protesters after donald trump became president, though investors complained about poor returns on the project long before trump launched his political career.

Surrey nanosystems has created a new \" super black \" coating that absorbs 99.96 % of light, which is to say, all light the human eye can detect, the company announced last week. The engineer explains that it can be \" applied to flat and three-dimensional structures in precise patterns with sub-micron resolution, \" and the independent gives an example: scientists applied the material, which the company calls \" vantablack, \" to sheets of aluminum foil. While the foil is visibly crinkled around it, within the area covered by the coating, those crinkles and contours disappear. If you made a dress out of it \" you would lose all features of the dress, \" chief technology officer ben jensen says. \" it would just be something black passing through. \" it would also be a \" very expensive \" dress, jensen adds, without disclosing the material's cost. Vantablack is made out of carbon nanotubes 10,000 times thinner than a human hair. It's 10 times stronger than steel, and more than seven times more conductive than copper. Unlike past efforts at such a material, it can be manufactured at low temperatures, allowing it to be directly applied to sensitive electronics without melting them. All of which makes it not just a curiosity, but a material rife with practical uses for things like imaging systems. \" for example, it reduces stray-light, improving the ability of sensitive telescopes to see the faintest stars, \" jensen explains.

The virus can be expected to spread more, as the mosquitoes that carry it can be found across the region.

Health experts are unsure why the virus, which was first detected in africa in 1947 but unknown in the americas until last year, is spreading so rapidly in brazil and neighboring countries. Although research is still underway, significant evidence in brazil shows a link between zika infections and rising cases of microcephaly, a neurological disorder in which infants are born with smaller craniums and brains. \"we'd like to suggest to all the women of fertile age that they take steps to plan their pregnancies, and avoid getting pregnant between this year and next, \" said deputy health minister eduardo espinoza.

Jan. 23, 2016, 12: 03 am gmt / updated jan. 23, 2016, 12: 03 am gmt by maggie fox the zika virus has now spread to 20 countries in latin america and the caribbean, including some popular tourist destinations, and it's likely to spread farther, international health officials said. And evidence is strengthening that the virus may cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly. The virus can be expected to spread more, as the mosquitoes that carry it can be found across the region. It's now spreading locally in barbados, bolivia, brazil, colombia, ecuador, el salvador, french guiana, guadeloupe, guatemala, guyana, haiti, honduras, martinique, mexico, panama, paraguay, puerto rico, saint martin, suriname, and venezuela. Samoa, in the south pacific, is also reporting zika for the first time. The u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention on friday repeated its recommendation that pregnant women avoid travel to affected countries until more is known about whether it can infect unborn babies. Related: as zika spreads, so do fears about birth defects but a team of brazilian researchers published early results of a study of 35 babies affected",

Reuters/jose cabezas san salvador ( reuters ) - el salvador on thursday urged women in the central american nation to avoid getting pregnant until 2018 to avoid their children developing birth defects from the mosquito-borne zika virus which has rampaged through the americas. The zika virus is transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry the dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. Health experts are unsure why the virus, which was first detected in africa in 1947 but unknown in the americas until last year, is spreading so rapidly in brazil and neighboring countries. Although research is still underway, significant evidence in brazil shows a link between zika infections and rising cases of microcephaly, a neurological disorder in which infants are born with smaller craniums and brains. \"we'd like to suggest to all the women of fertile age that they take steps to plan their pregnancies, and avoid getting pregnant between this year and next, \" said deputy health minister eduardo espinoza. He said the government decided to make the announcement because 5,397 cases of the zika virus had been detected in el salvador in 2015 and the first few"

        "summary": "If you're looking for another reason to just say no to cigarettes, researchers are offering up more evidence that the habit has negative repercussions — not just for the smoker, and not just for the smoker's children, but for the smoker's grandchildren, too. Coming on the heels of several years of research into how smoking changes the genes of a smoker's offspring, researchers at the university of bristol reviewed 14,500 participants of a large study from the 1990s and write in the journal scientific reports that girls whose maternal grandmothers smoked during pregnancy are 67 % more likely to display certain autism-like traits, and 53 % more likely to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. The thinking is that the smoking damages the eggs developing in a smoker's female fetus. \" we know smoking can damage the dna of mitochondria, \" one researcher says. Mitochondrial dna are present in every cell and power our bodies, and they're only passed down from mothers, via the egg. While the initial mutations don't appear to impact the smoker's own health, their impact can swell when passed down to her children. An outside researcher tells healthday news that while there is a link, women who smoke or had mothers who smoked \" should take some comfort in knowing that their risk of having a child with an autism spectrum disorder is still very low. \" ( asthma rates are higher in grandkids, too. )",

On sunday, muqtada al-sadr announced online that he was closing \" all offices and libraries in all religious, social, and political fields \" in a bid to protect his family's reputation, reports the christian science monitor, which adds that sadr's statement pointed to corruption within his own offices. Today, he made the move official in a scathing televised speech. \" politics has become a gateway for injustice and carelessness, for abuses by a dictator and tyrant, \" he said, a clear reference to pm nouri al-maliki. The speech seemed designed to establish sadr as an influential figure above \" the everyday political fray, \" the afp observes, as sadr urged iraqis to vote in april's elections and insisted he was still dedicated to them. \" i will remain for all — not for sadrists only. \" sadr's party was a major force, and analysts say maliki, who is gunning for a third term, will benefit from his exit come april. \" it is a disaster for us, but we are obedient, \" one party official said. \" everyone is confused. \" but gulf news warns that it would be \" premature to write off sadr completely, \" and notes that his exit coincides with a period of rising shiite militia power. Writing for time, karl vick writes that sadr has bowed out before, and says \" the opacity surrounding the rationale for sunday's announcement...

        "summary": "Hillary clinton has dodged a huge bullet ahead of the convention: the fbi chief said tuesday that after an exhaustive review of her use of a private email server as secretary of state, the agency will not recommend criminal charges. James comey did criticize clinton and her staff for being \" extremely careless. \" but he said no \" reasonable prosecutor \" would bring charges. Comey also stressed that the department of justice would have the final say on the matter. As the new york times notes, attorney general loretta lynch — who had controversial meeting with bill clinton last week — already has said she would defer to the recommendation of the fbi and her own department's investigators. The fbi reviewed more than 30,000 clinton emails and identified 110 in 52 email chains that had information deemed classified at the time the emails were sent; of those, eight contained \" top secret \" information, said comey, per the washington post. In previous cases that resulted in criminal charges, investigators found evidence of \" clearly intentional and willful \" mishandling of information, and \" we do not see those things here, \" said comey, per the hill. \"although we did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information, \" he said. Donald trump was quick to pounce: \" the system is rigged, \" he tweeted. \" general petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! as usual, bad judgment. \" in another, he wrote that \" crooked hillary \" escaped charges despite compromising national security. \" wow! \"",

The restaurant chain announced tuesday that its customers will soon be able to order their preferred pie with nary more than a tweet and an emoji. No, seriously.

Or, if that's too many keystrokes for you liking, simply insert the pizza emoji into your tweet instead. Either way, you ' ll soon get a direct message confirming the order and a piping-hot pizza shortly thereafter. You can give #easyorder a whirl today, though unfortunately the emoji method won't to be available until next wednesday, may 20th.",

Law enforcement officers tracked sweat down near constable, ny — which borders the canadian province of quebec — despite heavy rain and a national weather service flood-watch warning extending through tomorrow morning. A new york state trooper shot sweat twice in a field, cnn reports; sweat was taken to hospital, but his condition hasn't been revealed. No officers were wounded in apprehending him. Meanwhile, an autopsy shows that matt, 49, who was shot and killed friday, suffered three semiautomatic-weapon bullet wounds to the head. He was also scruffed up from his time fleeing a manhunt that included some 1,300 officers by today: he had blisters and bugbites on his legs, the autopsy found, along with \" minor abrasions consistent with living in the woods for three weeks. \" ( see why sweat was considered highly dangerous. )",

The smell of your armpits is a result of a clash between sweat and bacteria that creates what npr calls \" the mothership of body odor. \" odorless molecules in your sweat are \" broken down inside the bacteria, \" a scientist says. The result is thioalcohols, which are \" very, very pungent \" as they evaporate from your underarm. So pungent, in fact, that they smell even when they account for just one part per trillion of a substance, the university of york reports. To determine which bacteria caused the worst smell, scientists tracked the amount of thioalcohol spawned by different kinds of bacteria. Among the most unpleasant: staphylococcus hominis, npr reports. Researchers didn't stop there: they noticed that a gene in s. Hominis was also present in other smell-producing bacteria, and when they inserted the gene into e. Coli, that bacterium started to smell, too. So what's the point of the odorous research, which left the scientists \" not that popular \"? \" we have opened up the possibility of inhibiting body odor formation using compounds designed to target the specific proteins controlling the release of malodorants, \" the scientist notes. In other words, the findings could lead to a better deodorant, perhaps one that stops the production of thioalcohols, npr notes. In fact, unilever helped fund the project.

So why was it so devastating? three factors: depth, geography, and age. Depth is pretty straightforward: the quake was a shallow one, at six miles down, which exacerbates the surface shaking. As for geology, it's complicated, report live science and the new york times. The area where the quake hit is the site of a \" complex interaction \" of two tectonic plates, the african and eurasian, whose movement is causing the basin of the tyrrhenian sea ( part of the mediterranean ) to expand. That extension is causing tension in the apennine mountains, where the quake took place. And then there's the age of buildings. New buildings are subjected to earthquake-related building codes that are actually \" state-of-the-art in the field, \" an earthquake engineering expert tells time, but retrofitting italy's century- and even millennia-old buildings ranges from the costly to the impossible.

She's referring to charming bowels, a book whose name is not a metaphor ( it's out next week in english under a different title ). Guilia enders, a 25-year-old microbiology student, \" is utterly, charmingly obsessed with the gut, gut bacteria and poo, \" writes barbieri, who talks to enders about the reality of how we relieve ourselves: we're doing it wrong, but that's fixable. Five ways to rectify things, per enders and others: squat: sitting, as we do, isn't optimal based on our body's design. When in that position the \" hatch \" doesn't fully open. But while squatting, there's less pressure and squeezing. In fact, those who do squat in other parts of the world escape such issues as diverticulosis. To get the effect in an americanzied way, enders recommends keeping a stool by the toilet. Place your feet on it and lean forward. Get to know your inner sphincter: it turns out we all have an inner sphincter, which essentially ( and unconsciously ) tests the waters. A \" sample \" enters an area between the inner and outer sphincters. There, sensor cells make a call: good to go ( ie, you're at home ) or not ( ie, you're waiting in line at starbucks ). If no, the sample retreats. But \" ignore \" or deny it too often, and it can stop working effectively, leading to constipation. Be kinder to your gut: in an interview with the independent, enders argues that if we understood just how much our gut does for us, we might care for it better. Our gut houses more than 4 pounds of bacteria that, yes, digest food, but also fight disease and even, possibly, alter our mood. Reset your expectations: livescience explains that the line we've heard — that we should defecate daily — isn't actually true. It cites gastroenterologists who say three times a week is ok, as is three times a day. What matters most is consistency: that however often you do it is how often you continue to do it. If you notice a change, there could be a health problem at play. Speed it up: taking our sweet time ( with a book or smartphone in hand ) may actually be bad for us, as that time could be filled with more instances of straining. Livescience points",

The industry has filed a federal lawsuit demanding that the us fish and wildlife service reinstate a no-otter zone off part of the coast, reports courthouse news service. It seems the sea otters love to hoover up shellfish, and the fishermen are afraid their livelihoods will be wiped out. \" we're not attacking sea otters, \" one of their attorneys tells the los angeles times. \" it's just that without a sea otter management zone, the fisheries our clients rely on will be decimated in 10 to 20 years. \" some background on the zone he's talking about, from a blog at earthjustice: congress authorized it in the 1980s. The idea was to relocate the otters from those fishing grounds to the more isolated san nicolas island, a move that was supposed to help both the otters and the fishermen. The problem is that the otters never took to the island and kept trying to return to their original waters. They would often get injured while being trapped and relocated. The fish and wildlife service finally scrapped the no-otter zone in january, and the fishermen say the agency had no authority to do so. Environmental groups worried about the otters'stagnant population ( about 2,800 for several years now ) are stepping up to defend them in court. \" if the fishermen's lawsuit were to prevail, our concern is that harm, injury and even death to sea otters would follow, \" says a rep from the nonprofit friends of the sea otter.

They are also key to the health of california's kelp forests and the many other marine critters — including shellfish and finfish — that depend on kelp forest habitat. But being a cute keystone predator hasn't protected the sea otter. Consider the history. An estimated 16,000 sea otters once populated california's shorelines. The species was decimated by russian and spanish"

It appears about 10 members of the tribe were out gathering eggs last month when they encountered gold miners by a river in the remote javari valley, the new york times reports. The victims were found after the miners boasted in a bar about killing them and displayed trophies such as a hand-carved paddle they bragged they took from the victims. \" they even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river, \" says a rep from the indigenous affairs agency funai, which reported the incident to authorities. Federal prosecutor pablo luz de beltrand says the investigation is \" difficult work \" because the \" territories are big and access is limited. \" two gold miners were arrested, per survival international, which warned one-fifth of the small tribe may have been killed in what it says was a \" genocidal massacre, \" if confirmed. Beltrand says if confirmation is received, the attack would be the second reported slaughter this year of tribespeople, proving that indigenous people are increasingly at risk. Survival international's site notes that brazilian president michel temer's government is \" fiercely anti-indian, \" beholden to business interests seeking to develop remote areas, and has slashed funding to protect tribespeople. Budget cuts have shuttered five of 19 funai bases, per the times, three of them in the isolated west where the killings took place.

Noting that one in every five women is a victim of sexual assault, the high school students developed a discreet plastic straw that could test for colorless, odorless, and tasteless substances used for \" drug-facilitated sexual assault. \" it's \" brilliant, \" according to a judge at the miami herald's business plan challenge, where the straw beat out ideas from more than 200 other high school applicants to take the top prize. \" we were really passionate about this so we kept on pursuing it, \" says cappello. The students initially thought to create a jewelry pendant that could be dipped in a drink, but changed courses after noticing all three were drinking with straws; classmates refer to them as \" the straw ladies, \" says cappello. Their final product is the patent-pending smart straw, with chemical test strips at one end that turn blue when they come into contact with common date rape drugs like roofies, ketamine, and ghb, reports forbes. The students, who plan to fund their invention through kickstarter, hope to see the straws become widely used.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that. Go do it. Go do it. Go do it. And go in faith, \" said pearsons, whose father is televangelist kenneth copeland.

        "summary": "Starting july 1, if you're pregnant and use drugs while living in tennessee, you can be charged with a crime for causing harm to your unborn baby. Gov. Bill haslam signed the controversial law yesterday, the tennessean reports. Civil and reproductive rights groups had opposed it, saying it would scare women away from getting treatment for drug addiction, but haslam said he talked to \" experts including substance abuse, mental health, health, and law enforcement officials \" before signing the legislation, and will closely monitor its impact. Critics also say the law disproportionately affects low-income and non-white women, thinkprogress notes. Using drugs while pregnant was previously criminalized in the state, but decriminalized two years ago as lawmakers moved toward programs encouraging pregnant women to get treatment. But the law is back as the number of babies born dependent on drugs is on the rise. Pregnant drug users can avoid criminal charges if they enter a treatment program, and haslam is asking doctors to encourage women to enter treatment programs before delivery to avoid being charged. If they don't enter treatment, women charged under the law could face as many as 15 years in jail, npr reported last week.",

But one of the sayings on the wall by the tidal basin is incorrect — or incomplete — in its attribution. \"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. \" according to david remnick's biography of obama, that is the president's \"favorite quotation. \" obama brought the idea back into present-day parlance and even had it sewn into the rug in the oval office when he redecorated last year.

Delivered a haunting sermon at atlanta's ebenezer baptist church about a eulogy that might be given in the event of his death. \"if you want to say that i was a drum major, say that i was a drum major for justice, \" king told the congregation. \"say that i was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. \" the sermon was so powerful that the designers of the martin luther king jr. Memorial in washington selected those lines to be inscribed on the memorial's towering statue of the civil rights leader. But because of a design change during the statue's creation, the exact quotes had to be paraphrased, and now one of the memorial's best-known consultants, poet and author maya angelou, says the shortened inscription is misleading and ought to be changed.

        "summary": "It's long been speculated that saudi arabia played a major role in 9/11, and the so-called \" 28 pages \" that have been locked up for years in the capitol's basement may soon shed light on the matter if they are released by president obama — a move that's now expected, the ap reports. The papers detail the findings of a congressional inquiry into what foreign entities provided support to the 9/11 hijackers while they planned the attacks. Former sen. Bob graham, who helped lead that inquiry, notes a white house official told him intel officers are reviewing the docs. \" the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is: did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported? \" he said on sunday's meet the press, adding he finds it \" implausible \" they could have carried out such a plan without outside aid, per the hill. \" all the evidence points to saudi arabia, \" he said. Graham isn't alone: the 28pages.org website has been lobbying for the pages to be brought \" out of the shadows, \" while other lawmakers and some 9/11 victims ' families are similarly quizzical regarding saudi involvement. Then-president george w. Bush had ordered those pages stripped from the original 838-page report, warning that us intelligence secrets could be at risk. When asked how declassifying these pages would impact the strained relationship between the us and saudi arabia, graham said \" 7.838 \" on a scale of 1 to 10, per the new york daily news — i.e., a \" high-level negative impact, \" as chuck todd put it. Saudi arabia, meanwhile, says it's been \" wrongfully and morbidly accused of complicity \" and that it wants those 28 pages publicized so it could \" respond to any allegations in a clear and credible manner. \" graham says he expects an answer by june.",

The 30-year-old won the prize for damn., his raw and powerful grammy-winning album.

Lamar, who has won 12 grammys, has been lauded for his deep lyrical content, politically charged live performances, and his profound mix of hip-hop, spoken word, jazz, soul, funk, poetry and african sounds. Since emerging on the music scene with the 2011 album section.80, he has achieved the perfect mix of commercial appeal and critical respect. The pulitzer board has awarded special honors to bob dylan, duke ellington, george gershwin, thelonious monk, john coltrane and hank williams, but a popular figure like lamar has never won the prize for music. In 1997, wynton marsalis became the first jazz act to win the pulitzer prize for music. Other notable pulitzers went to reporting on roy moore, harvey weinstein, and the trump-russia investigation.",

        "summary": "The words \" travesty, \" \" outrageous, \" and \" mystifying \" feature heavily in editorial columns on a grand jury's decision not to indict nypd officer daniel pantaleo in the death of eric garner, despite the fact that the officer was captured on video using a banned chokehold on the asthmatic man. The decision not to charge pantaleo with \" even new york's least serious homicide count — criminally negligent homicide — is beyond mystifying, \" writes the new york daily news, saying the decision has the \" glaring earmarks of a gross miscarriage of justice \" and is harder to understand than the equally controversial ferguson decision. To indict, the grand jury would only have needed to find indications that the officer failed \" to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk \" of death from using the chokehold. \" african american men are being taught a lesson about how this society values, or devalues, our lives, \" writes eugene robinson in a blistering column at the washington post, saying that as with ferguson, he finds it impossible to believe that the result would have been the same if the victim was white. Garner \" didn't even fit into the ' young black male ' category that defines this nation's most feared and loathed citizens, \" he writes. \" he was an overweight, middle-aged, asthmatic man. Now we're told that the man who killed him did nothing wrong. \" garner, he writes, \" committed a capital offense: he was the wrong color. \" the imbalance between garner's fate \" and his supposed infraction, selling loose cigarettes, is grotesque and outrageous, \" writes the new york times, describing the incident as \" vicious policing \" and calling for pantaleo to be fired. Any police force that tolerates conduct like pantaleo's needs to be reformed, the nyt writes, and the justice department \" is right to swiftly investigate what certainly seem like violations of mr. Garner's civil rights. \" at slate, justin peters takes a look at new york city's \" broken windows \" policing policy and concludes that it not only doesn't work, it may have killed garner. The policy of cracking down hard on minor violations of the law has returned to new york city as the use of stop-and-frisk declines, he writes, but since violent crime is already declining across the country, regardless of policing tactics, he suggests a new nypd policy: \" first, do no harm. \"",

            "Photo by slaven vlasic/getty images on july 17, 2014, an unarmed 43-year-old black man named eric garner was standing near the staten island ferry dock when he was approached by several police officers. The cops suspected that garner was selling untaxed cigarettes. A struggle ensued, and an officer named daniel pantaleo put garner in a chokehold. Garner died, and the new york city medical examiner eventually ruled it a homicide. But on wednesday afternoon, a staten island grand jury declined to indict pantaleo. Why was garner approached at all? because of the emphasis on \"broken windows policing \" under nypd commissioner bill bratton. As mayor rudolph giuliani's police commissioner in the 1990s, bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement, on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. There's little evidence that theory",

Despite the american dental association touting the benefits of flossing since 1908 and the federal government pushing flossing since 1979, there's actually very little evidence it does anything to stop cavities or gum disease. The ap looked at 25 studies over the past 10 years and found only \" weak, very unreliable \" evidence in support of flossing. Even studies organized by the nearly $ 2 billion-a-year floss industry didn't show results. And the few studies that did confirm the benefits of flossing appeared to be majorly flawed. For example, one study cited by floss-backers looked at only 25 people after a single round of flossing. This news is, understandably, perplexing the internet. \" every single time i floss ( at least once a day ), i notice that i have removed particles from my teeth... It's impossible to say that flossing does not make your teeth, gums, and mouth cleaner, \" writes jordan sargent at gawker. \" while liberating, this news is intuitively baffling. Even a single instance of flossing seems to have a noticeable impact on the amount of debris in your mouth, which must be good for something, right? \" adds hannah keyser at deadspin.

            "On october 15, vermont inmate roger brown died of metastatic cancer at the prison infirmary in camp hill, pennsylvania. He wrote in his diary that prison medical staff provided him with ibuprofen, tylenol and gel shoe inserts to manage his pain and never told him about the cancer that was causing it. Here's a diary entry he wrote on sept. 23: \"saturday. Awake all night again. Back pain real bad. Breakfast, lunch, waiting for yard. Agony still. So much ibuprofen starting to scare me, not taking care of the pain. Supper. \" brown was one of more than 200 vermont inmates sent to state prison in pennsylvania due to a shortage of beds in vermont. According to his diary, he spent weeks asking staff in pennsylvania for medical care and receiving little more than over the counter drugs. There's no evidence in the diary that roger brown knew he had cancer. \"can't sleep at night. Hip on fire. Painful. I think it's broken, \" he wrote on sept. 25. The diary was mailed to vpr, and brown's widow confirmed that the handwriting in the diary belonged to her late husband. \"this is government-funded suffering, and death in some ways, \" says anna stevens, the outreach director for the advocacy group vermonters for criminal justice reform. \" you know, he did not get the medical treatment or care that he clearly, clearly needed. \" corresponding with current and former inmates and their families, stevens says she's heard similar stories. \"seeking help, seeking support, be it medical, be it mental, be it about addiction, anything - is kind of a very slow very arduous, relatively unattentive process, \" she says. State corrections officials refused to comment on roger brown's specific case because they haven't yet completed a required review of his death. Benjamin watts",

( ap ) — a vermont inmate who died of cancer at a pennsylvania prison wrote in a diary that he repeatedly asked for medical care but was denied and given ibuprofen and tylenol for his pain. Sixty-eight-year-old roger brown died oct. 15 at the state prison in camp hill, pennsylvania. The pennsylvania department of corrections is reviewing the death. The vermont department of corrections will do the same. In a diary obtained by the associated press, brown wrote about burning pain in his rib cage, back and hip that prevented him from sleeping and became unbearable. Vtdigger first reported on the diary.

Teeth: there used to be plenty of room for all of the molars, but then our brains got much bigger. Now our wisdom teeth are pretty much useless, except for causing us pain. Knees: ever get hit on your knee from the side? if you have, you know it just doesn't bend that way ( it only moves forward and back ). That's a problem. Pelvis: women have been enduring the birthing process for eons — and yet the width of the pelvis hasn't evolved in 200,000 years, rowe says.

Army commandos quickly responded and began trading fire with the gunmen, who, according to local media, initially gained access by scaling a rear wall. All were ultimately killed after an eight-hour battle, during which hostages were reportedly held in the school's auditorium. The school's 2,500 students range from ages 4 to 16. \" my son was in uniform in the morning. He is in a casket now, \" wailed one parent collecting the body of his 14-year-old. \" my son was my dream.

The slaughter comes on the heels of the nobel peace prize for 17-year-old activist malala yousafzai — herself the victim of a taliban attack — and she reacted swiftly, saying that \" i am heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror, \" and that \" i, along with millions of others around the world, mourn these children, my brothers and sisters — but we will never be defeated. \"",

Ronald williams ii, of suitland, md., was arrested late last week by maryland state police after they followed a tip indicating that child pornography was being shared by a particular isp address. Troopers then used that information to obtain a warrant to search williams ' home, where they found several files containing pornography on his cell phone, abc reports,. He faces 11 counts of possession and distribution of child pornography, the washington post reports. Williams had been assigned to the election commission by the office of the special counsel.

That year, the holiday fell on the first saturday of spring break for students at ohio state university, where 27-year-old shaffer was a medical student, and he'd spent it on a bar crawl with friends. Columbus ' ugly tuna saloona was the first and final stop. But when the lights came on at the end of the night, his friends couldn't find shaffer anywhere, reports mel magazine. Nor could anyone else in the days that followed. Then police discovered something odd: an entrance camera showed shaffer entering the ugly tuna saloona around 1: 15am, but not leaving. Another camera showed he hadn't slipped out an emergency exit, either. In fact, every single person who entered the bar that night was seen leaving, except shaffer. It's possible he escaped through an unwatched freight elevator, but security cameras from nearby bars should have spotted him afterward. Tips later claiming shaffer was killed or living in the virgin islands turned out to be hoaxes. Apparent sightings of shaffer as far away as sweden went nowhere. But every night, shaffer's girlfriend — whom shaffer had planned to make his fiance during a spring break trip to miami — would call his phone. Normally, it went straight to voicemail. But six months after shaffer disappeared, it rang, pinging a tower in a columbus suburb. That helps keep hope alive.
