Cosby put the generator on his website, then tweeted a link to it with the note, \" go ahead. Meme me! \" and the hashtag #cosbymeme. Well, challenge accepted: many people did indeed create cosby memes... About the fact that the comedian settled a 2006 lawsuit with a woman who accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her, usa today reports. As vulture reported in september, that lawsuit mentioned 13 other women who alleged similar experiences. After cosby's tweet yesterday, pictures of him were overlaid with words like: \" i just googled ' bill cosby ' and ' rape. ' \" \" define'drugged. ' \" \" over a dozen women have accused me of being hilarious. \" \" 14 allegations of rape?! zipzopzubittybop! \" \" didn't even say hello to get in her jello. \" both the generator ( which offered pictures of cosby that could be used to make memes ) and cosby's tweet about it have since been erased, the los angeles times reports. The new york post notes that the allegations against cosby first resurfaced earlier this year while nbc was said to be considering a new cosby sitcom.

            "Photo: splash news/corbis thirty years ago this fall, the cosby show debuted on nbc, and its star was catapulted into the comedic stratosphere. The timing is prime, then, for the release of a sprawling biography. Written by former newsweek editor mark whitaker, cosby: his life and times documents the man's rise from the philadelphia projects, while also detailing the creation of his family sitcom and the murder of his son ennis in 1997. The book is notable, however, for its complete avoidance of sexual abuse allegations that have dogged cosby for more than a decade. In a statement to buzzfeed's kate aurthur, whitaker says, \"i didn't want to print allegations that i couldn't confirm independently. \" regardless, their absence is glaring. Consider the following timeline an appendix to the book. November 2002 andrea constand, director of operations for temple university's women's basketball team, allegedly met with bill cosby. Constand claims that cosby, who had been a member of temple's track and field and football teams, assumed a role as her mentor. January 2004 according to constand, she visited cosby at his cheltenham, pennsylvania, home to discuss career advice, and after allegedly ( according to a civil lawsuit she would later file ) giving her \"herbal \" pills to ease her anxiety, cosby \"touched her breasts and vaginal area, rubbed his penis"

During testimony yesterday, robert sullivan suggested the juror had \" a moral purpose... To save ( holmes ) from the death sentence \" but was deceptive about her beliefs. \" i would like to see the court go after that juror, \" he said, per the ap. Judge carlos samour jr. Shot down his remarks, noting there was no evidence of deception. But sullivan wasn't the only one upset by the jurors'decision. A woman whose daughter was injured in the shooting argued a sentence of 12 life terms was \" absurd \" and \" the judicial equivalent of beating a dead horse. \" it shows \" colorado values a mass murderer more than the lives of those he murdered, \" she said. About 40 people gave victim impact statements yesterday, though 100 are expected to speak before samour formally delivers holmes'sentence tomorrow, reports cnn. While not all have taken issue with the coming sentence, many described holmes as a monster. A police officer said he and other officers \" were subjected to nothing less than the trauma of war \" and suffered emotional trauma, per the denver post. He added holmes should be locked away and forgotten. \" i hope that every day is painful for him. I hope that prison is not kind to him, \" he said. \" the past haunts you to the point of exhaustion, \" added a father who lost his 23-year-old daughter. \" nothing brings you a sense of happiness.

Under the revised regulations, which are more in line with cdc guidelines, people quarantined at home will be able to have visits from family and friends, and those who were not in direct contact with ebola patients will not be quarantined; people in quarantine will be visited by health workers twice daily.

The team tracked 41 college students ' moods for a week before they downloaded a survey app on their smartphone and were divvied into three groups: those asked to take a selfie every day, those asked to take a daily photo of something that normally makes them happy, and those asked to take a daily photo of something they thought someone else would enjoy and send it to that person. By the end of the month everyone reported improved moods. The researchers were tracking a broad range of mood measures — 2,897 in all, ranging from comfortable to reflective and appreciative — that the students documented throughout the month, reports mother jones. Specifically, they found that the selfie takers became more confident, the people who photographed objects that made them happy became more appreciative, and the people who took photos for others became calmer and more connected. The overall results did not surprise the team, the lead researcher tells live science, though \" we were surprised to find that participants who took photos that made other people happy and sent the photos became significantly calmer. \" one possibility: feeling more connected to others has been shown to increase calmness.

You could even argue people hate political rants more than selfies, but we don't agree. The selfie — when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on a social media platform — is the most annoying habit by users. Now a new study reveals that not only is this behavior horrible, it might be alienating your friends. Way to go, idiots. The selfie is reprehensible because it's two levels of narcissism.

Before his election, french president emmanuel macron vowed to create a \" defined \" first lady position for his wife, which would mean giving brigitte macron her own office and staff, reports reuters. But that plan isn't sitting well with many in france for a couple of reasons. Firstly, tradition: the first lady of france typically promotes charities from elysée palace, with help from one or two assistants and protection from security guards, reports the bbc. Secondly, timing: macron's campaign rival, françois fillon, was dogged by allegations that he paid hundreds of thousands of euros to his wife in a sham role as a parliamentary assistant. In response to the scandal, macron said he would bar politicians from employing relatives, which his party is now working to do. But though macron says his wife will not receive a salary paid for by the taxpayer, some call him a hypocrite. \" we cannot sanction the creation of a special status for the spouse of president macron … during a time when ethical behavior needs to be reasserted in french politics, \" the petition reads, per france 24. \" brigitte macron currently has a team of two or three aides, as well as two secretaries and two security agents, \" it adds. \" that's enough. \" some 280,000 people have signed the petition as of this writing, but it may be all for naught.

According to kero, logan is recovering after traveling across the country to california to have a 130-pound growth removed from his abdomen. ( the californian says it was 140 pounds. ) doctors say the benign tumor, which started growing about 12 years ago, probably began as an ingrown hair. But it kept growing until it was massive and had its own blood supply. Logan had spent most of the past five years living in an armchair, unable to run his antique store or go fishing. After false starts and depression, logan and his wife finally found a specialist in california to perform the surgery. Logan left mississippi in the back of a cargo van with his armchair bolted to the bottom. Despite being given only a 50 % chance, the surgery was an apparent success. And on thursday, logan walked for the first time in years. He's now looking forward to getting his life back. While logan's tumor was big, it wasn't even close to the biggest ever removed. Yahoo reports a man in china had a 242-pound tumor removed from his back in 2014. ( another man's tumor caused a five-day bout of hiccups. )",

It says the nsa is trying to build a quantum computer that \" could break nearly every kind of encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government records around the world. \" the $ 80 million research program has a code name, of course: penetrating hard targets. But how close the nsa actually is to building the thing is very much unclear; it would be a \" revolutionary \" leap forward in technology, and the story quotes experts speculating that such a breakthrough could be decades away. The post's explainer: \" the basic principle underlying quantum computing is known as ' quantum superposition,'the idea that an object simultaneously exists in all states. A classical computer uses binary bits, which are either zeroes or ones. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, which are simultaneously zero and one. \" a quantum computer, then, is a \" holy grail \" of tech innovation, a machine that would have \" exponentially more power \" to crack encryptions than ordinary computers, writes adam clarke estes at gizmodo. The thought of the nsa working on one for code-breaking purposes is \" terrifying, \" he adds. \" but it's hardly surprising. \" such a machine would theoretically threaten \" all security on the web, \" adds gregory ferenstein at techcrunch.

They asked the teachers to look for challenging behaviors, but the kids were all actors, reports the washington post, and the footage showed no challenging behaviors. Turns out the teachers all looked at the black kids more, and the boy especially, and when asked which kid needed the most attention, 42 % said the black boy, 34 % said the white boy, 13 % said the white girl, and 10 % said the black girl. \" implicit bias is like the wind: you can't see it, but you can sure see its effects, \" gilliam says.

        "summary": "Obama-era guidelines encouraging colleges to increase diversity on campus by using race as a factor in admissions will be rescinded by president trump's administration, two sources tell the wall street journal. The guidelines, published in 2011 and 2016 by the justice and education departments, gave legal recommendations to schools wanting to use race in admissions decisions. Trump administration officials argue that those recommendations are misleading, making it seem as if it's easier to achieve a legal form of affirmative action than it actually is. The supreme court has weighed the issue of affirmative action several times, most recently reaffirming it in 2016 but leaving an opening for future legal challenges. But a justice department official tells cnn the obama-era guidelines \" go beyond or are inconsistent with the constitution and federal law. \" the head of civil rights enforcement in schools in the obama justice department tells the wsj that's not the case: \" the law on this hasn't changed, and the supreme court has twice ruled reaffirming the importance of diversity. This is a purely political attack that benefits nobody. \" a formal announcement of the move, which is being decried by civil rights groups, is expected soon, the ap reports. It comes as a lawsuit against harvard university is making its way through the courts; filed in 2014, the suit alleges harvard discriminates against asian-american applicants by holding them to higher standards and limiting the number it admits. With the retirement of justice anthony kennedy, who has ruled to uphold affirmative action, conservatives are seeing \" a fresh opening to end affirmative action through a changing supreme court, \" per politico.",

            "The buffalo bills have agreed to pay up to $ 3 million – largely in the form of debit cards redeemable only at the team store – to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the team of sending too many alerts to fans who signed up for a text-messaging service. Jerry wojcik, a bills fan and area native now living in florida, contended in his october 2012 suit that the team violated the terms of its text service by sending him 13 messages over two weeks when it promised to send no more than five per week. The lawsuit was panned as frivolous by some sports fans, media commentators and legal experts. But in a settlement filed last week in federal court in tampa, fla., the bills agreed to provide up to $ 2.5 million in debit cards to people who had signed up for the text service, along with $ 562,500 to wojcik's lawyers and $ 5,000 in cash to wojcik as class representative. The estimated value of the debit cards that will be issued to class members who received more than five alerts in a given week is $ 2,487,745. The cards can be used at the bills store at ralph wilson stadium in orchard park or online at the team's website. They can't be redeemed for cash. The debit cards are worth $ 57.50, $ 65 or",

        "summary": "People lie, satellite images don't — hence why the us and south korea are closely monitoring a new suspected missile site near north korea's central border with china. The facility in hoejung-ni, \" one of the most likely sites for deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the united states, \" shows pyongyang is continuing to improve its missile capabilities even as it presents a very different picture to the world, reports the new york times, quoting two experts. Citing new satellite images obtained by cnn, jeffrey lewis and david schmerler of california's middlebury institute of international studies at monterey say the site featuring possible missile shelters is the ideal spot to \" house long-range missiles, \" as its location \" backed up against the chinese border \" reduces the risk of preemptive strikes from the us. News of the construction, perhaps an expansion of the active yeongjeo-dong missile base 7 miles away, follows a november report identifying at least 13 hidden missile bases in north korea. Lewis and schmerler argue missiles are still being mass-produced and deployed throughout the country, in contrast with president trump's claims of progress on denuclearization. Indeed, satellite images show the hoejung-ni site was still under construction as of august, two months after trump said there was \" no longer a nuclear threat from north korea. \" \" they have not lived up to the commitments so far, \" national security adviser john bolton said tuesday, per cnn. \" that's why i think the president thinks that another summit is likely to be productive. \" per the times, trump has said the meeting with kim jong un could come in january or february.

            "Seoul, south korea — north korea is expanding an important missile base that would be one of the most likely sites for deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the united states, two experts on the north's missile programs said thursday, citing new research based on satellite imagery. The activities at the yeongjeo-dong missile base near north korea's border with china and the expansion of a new suspected missile facility seven miles away are the latest indications that north korea is continuing to improve its missile capabilities, said jeffrey lewis and david schmerler of the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey in california. And they come despite president trump's repeated claims of progress in efforts to denuclearize the north. Dr. Lewis and mr. Schmerler said they were still not sure whether yeongjeo-dong and the new facility under construction in nearby hoejung-ni, both in the mountainous area near north korea's central border with china, were separate bases or parts of a larger single operation. But their geographic locations make them ideal to \"house long-range missiles, \" they said in a report they were preparing.",
            "Washington ( cnn ) new satellite images obtained exclusively by cnn reveal north korea has significantly expanded a key long-range missile base located in the mountainous interior of the country, offering yet another reminder that diplomatic talks with the us have done little to prevent kim jong un from pursuing his promise to mass produce and deploy the existing types of nuclear warheads in his arsenal. The satellite imagery offers evidence that the yeongjeo-dong missile base and a nearby, previously unreported site remain active and have been continuously upgraded, underscoring the reality of just how far apart washington and pyongyang are on the issue of denuclearization despite five months of sporadic talks. While the base at yeongjeo-dong has long been known to us intelligence agencies and analysts, researchers at the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey told cnn that the images reveal construction on a new facility just seven miles away from the older site that had not been previously publicly identified. The site's unique location makes it a strong candidate to receive north korea's newest long-range missiles, including those that can carry nuclear weapons and can strike the united states, lewis and schmerler said.

            "The apartments in waldorf towers feature high ceilings, large marble bathrooms and generous-sized rooms that could prove attractive. \"this relationship represents a unique opportunity for our organizations to work together to finally maximize the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown manhattan, \" christopher j. Nassetta, the president and chief executive of hilton worldwide, said in a statement. Earlier this year, hilton had indicated it was considering a sale of the property. Two other groups quickly offered to buy it for around $ 2 billion, but anbang ultimately signed the contract. Five-star hotels in cities like london, paris and new york are a coveted commodity for international buyers. The current owner of the plaza on central park west is the sahara group of india, but it has passed through the hands of israelis and saudi arabians along the way. Another indian company, taj hotel resorts, runs the pierre hotel on fifth avenue, at 61st street. And the carlyle hotel, at madison avenue and 76th street, is owned by new world development of hong kong. Constellation hotels, an investment group based in qatar and luxembourg, bought 80 percent of the intercontinental hotel on 48th street. But chinese companies, in particular, have made a splash of late by buying new york real estate. Fosun international bought one chase manhattan plaza, the downtown office building, for $ 725 million last year. Soho china and a brazilian billionaire bought a 40 percent stake in the general motors building. And in brooklyn, greenland holding group bought a 70 percent stake in the 22-acre development now called pacific park that had been known as atlantic yards. The original waldorf-astoria hotel was on a parcel now occupied by the empire state building. It started with the 13-story waldorf hotel at the corner of fifth avenue and 33rd street in 1893. Four years later, john jacob astor iv opened the 17-story astoria hotel next door. The corridor between the two hotels became known as the waldorf-astoria. By the 1920s, the astoria was dated and out of favor. The astor family sold it to the developers of the empire state building."

            "Image caption slow internet download speeds have been a frustration for cuban internet users a high-speed fibre-optic cable connecting cuba to the global internet appears to have finally been activated, monitoring experts have said. Cubans currently rely on satellite connections - which are expensive and slow - to get online. But the cable, which has been in place since 2011, has shown the first signs of activity, renesys said. Curiously, researchers noted traffic via the cable seemed only to be flowing into the country, not out of it. \" in the past week, our global monitoring system has picked up indications that this cable has finally been activated, although in a rather curious way, \" wrote doug madory, renesys'senior researcher. He explained that in the past week it had been noted that telefonica, the spanish telecoms company, had begun appearing in their data for cuba. When contacted by the bbc, telefonica was not able to confirm that the activation had taken place.

Further investigation revealed subtle differences in color between the species, and a dna sequencing confirmed the rinjani scops owl was a different species — which has since been named otus jolandae. \"we're realizing there's a lot more diversity in plants and animals than we might have expected, just based on their physical appearance, \" said one ornithologist.

        "summary": "Meet razanandrongobe sakalavae, the giant dinosaur-killing crocodile that roamed what is now madagascar 165 million years ago. Razana, as it's known for short, was first discovered a decade ago, but due to limited fossilized remains, little was known about the creature until recently. Thanks to research published tuesday in peerj, we now have a picture of — as gizmodo describes it — \" an enormous, land-striding relative of crocodiles with a nightmare where its face ought to go. \" razana is believed to have been 23 feet long and weighed up to 2,200 pounds, cnn reports. Its head was the size of a washing machine, and its serrated teeth were the size of bananas. According to a press release, its teeth, which rival those of tyrannosaurus rex, could likely crush bone and tendon. Razana is further evidence that dinosaurs weren't quite the untouchable rulers of their world as once believed. Researchers, who describe razana as a \" one-ton, terrifying bone crusher, \" say it would have been at the top of the food chain in prehistoric madagascar and eaten dinosaurs. While razana has the front-facing nostrils, bony palate, and teeth sockets of modern crocodiles and alligators, it differs from its descendants in some pretty startling ways. For one, it was more suited to life on land, as evidenced by the positioning and shape of its legs, which gave razana the ability to sprint after prey. ( tyrannosaurus rex had a bite so powerful it's hard to fathom. )",

At the same time, other catholics have expressed dismay over the pope's statements about homosexuality and his remarks that the church is \"obsessed \" with some social issues. Some news accounts contend that the pope's popularity has created a \"pope francis effect, \" producing a \"significant global rise in church attendance, \" based on reports by catholic clergy in italy, britain and and other countries of a recent rise in mass attendance.

So it may not come as a surprise that roughly half of americans have hearts that are at least five years older than their actual age. So reports the centers for disease control and prevention, which calculates heart age by looking at risk factors for heart disease, including age, weight, smoking status, and systolic ( the top number ) blood pressure. The major finding is that half of men have hearts at least five years older than their actual age, while almost half of women do. Two examples given: a 50-year-old obese male smoker with an untreated systolic blood pressure of 140, without diabetes, has a predicted heart age of 72, while a woman with the same risks has a heart age of 74. One cardiologist tells webmd that people should try to maintain a healthy blood pressure, cholesterol level, and body weight, as well as engage in regular physical activity and avoid smoking to help turn back the clock. But that's easier said than done. \" changing behaviors is well known to be one of the hardest things to do, \" another cardiologist tells usa today. \" it's a lot easier to get someone to take a pill. \" the hope is that people will be more proactive about making lifestyle changes if they learn how old their heart age is, a number that can serve as a \" wake up \" call, one doctor says. Another isn't so sure that heart age does the trick, calling the calculator a \" gimmick. \" either way, concludes the cdc, us adults have hearts that are seven years older than they should be.

The mayor of the austrian town, perched in the alps, thought it was just the spot for vanuytrecht, too. Vanuytrecht, a bearded, pipe-smoking catholic deacon from belgium, beat out 49 other applicants to nab the unpaid post as part-time hermit of the 350-year-old cliffside dwelling, which is without running water, heat, and internet, reports the guardian. But vanuytrecht couldn't care less about the lack of amenities. The 58-year-old divorcee and former artillery officer says he's previously lived in poverty and is looking forward to a life of solitary peace when he takes up his new post on april 30. But vanuytrecht won't be too isolated during his seasons at the hermitage, open from april to november, as visitors are known to hike up for a chat and some counseling, per the bbc. Vanuytrecht, who speaks fluent german, says his experience working with the homeless, addicts, prisoners, and psychiatric patients will help him deliver meaningful advice. \" it's important just to listen without talking oneself and without judging, \" he says, per the telegraph. Though vanuytrecht adds he thought he \" didn't have a chance, \" saalfelden's mayor says he \" radiates calm and comes across as well-anchored. \" outside reports the job listing called saalfelden home to one of the last \" tenanted hermitages \" in central europe.

Mehr says the faulty belief stems mainly from a since-debunked \" mozart effect \" study that found improved performance on spatial tasks after listening to music. And so he set out to test the music lesson-related angle himself: mehr taught two randomly selected groups of children and parents either music or visual art, then tested cognition, vocabulary, math, and two spatial tasks; in the second study, the children and their parents either studied music or nothing. \" there were slight differences in performance between the groups, but none were large enough to be statistically significant...

In the 2013 case, the court ruled that asaram raped the teen and forced her to perform sex acts in a room while her parents chanted prayers outside, believing the guru was \" curing \" her of \" supernatural ghostly powers, \" per the bbc. While asaram is expected to appeal wednesday's verdict, the bbc reports jodhpur \" is on high alert because of concerns there could be violence from the guru's supporters \" — and not without reason. Not only were 38 people killed and 200 injured in clashes following another guru's rape conviction in haryana state last year, per cbs news, but asaram's victim and her family accuse the guru's supporters of attacking nine witnesses in cases against him over the last five years, including three who died. Asaram has denied he and his followers are responsible, though many supporters believe the guru has been imprisoned on false charges. Cbs reports security was tight at the prison complex where the verdict was read wednesday, and in other areas home to many of asaram's devotees.",

        "summary": "Being on the run as the world's most wanted drug lord apparently wasn't enough fame for joaquin guzman: authorities in mexico, where \" el chapo \" was recaptured on friday, say they were able to track him down because he wanted to make a biopic about his life and his people had contacted actors and producers about the project, the guardian reports. Attorney general arely gómez says guzman — whose daring prison break six months ago would presumably have been a big part of the biopic — was captured in the town of los mochis in his native sinaloa state with the help of investigators who had been watching his lawyers. In other developments: gomez says that for now, guzman is being returned to the altiplano maximum-security prison that he escaped from in july, the ap reports. He escaped from another prison in 2001. Authorities say guzman was recaptured in the coastal town early friday after a firefight with mexican navy marines that killed five of his bodyguards and injured one marine, cnn reports. He escaped through tunnels — as he has done many times before — and managed to steal a car before he was stopped on a highway outside of town, authorities say. In the us, the drug enforcement administration praised the capture, which many thought would never happen, as a \" victory for the rule of law \" and a \" significant achievement \" in the shared fight against drug trafficking, the los angeles times reports. The dea and mexico will \" continue to work together to respond to the evolving threats posed by transnational criminal organizations, \" the agency said in a statement. The us does, however, want to see guzman in an american prison instead of a mexican one this time and there have been calls for immediate extradition, the ap reports. \" given that ' el chapo ' has already escaped from mexican prison twice, this third opportunity to bring him to justice cannot be squandered, \" said florida sen. Marco rubio. Mexican president enrique pena nieto called the recapture a sign that mexicans can trust national institutions and the rule of law, though experts tell nbc that the president will probably sign off on extradition to avoid the potential humiliation of having guzman escape once again.",

The first three transplants failed over lack of blood flowing to the organs, donated by unrelated women aged 35 to 60. Those organs have been removed from the patients, who are recuperating, per cnn. The fourth patient, however, is \" showing good blood flow to the uterus. There are also no signs of rejection or infection at this time, \" the hospital says. \" she could ultimately become the first uterine transplant recipient in the us to make it to the milestone of uterine functionality, \" the hospital adds. If the transplant is successful, the patient can undergo in vitro fertilization in six months to a year. A natural pregnancy is impossible since the uterus isn't connected to the patient's ovaries. Baylor's team — including two swedish doctors who've performed nine living donor transplants since 2012, including five who've since given birth — plan to perform six more transplants this year.

Help politifact raise $ 15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. After taking the reins of power from spain, the united states faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 american combatants, more than 20,000 filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 filipino civilians, according to the state department",

A new study based on analysis of tree rings in its wood reveals that the ship likely got built in 1773 in philadelphia — and with the same white oak used to build parts of independence hall, live science reports. After the skeleton of the ship was discovered in 2010, researchers excavated it and began the task of unraveling its origins. Scientists matched the ring patterns to those found in both living trees in philadelphia and to wood samples dating back to the days when the city had a thriving shipbuilding industry. The rings patterns, shaped by climate, constitute a sort of tree \" birth certificate, \" explains the maritime executive. But the keel of the ship was really the key to narrowing the search — it was made of hickory, which grows only in the eastern us and eastern asia, and researchers say the latter wasn't much of a possibility. So how did the 32-foot hull end up where it did? one theory is that it was a merchant ship that sailed for years along the atlantic and in the caribbean and eventually got buried by 1797 in a landfill being used to extend the shoreline of manhattan, reports dna info.

All the data was uploaded to the bit torrent file sharing network late sunday afternoon, meaning anyone from dallas to dbruvnik to djibouti can have a look. The pbs newshour has learned that a select sub-list of what appear to be e-mail addresses and passwords of employees from federal, state and local government agencies were parsed separately for potential future attacks. They may have been used as part of operation payback, or another one of the initiatives launched by the so-called \" anonymous \" cyber movement that has grown in scope since the release of secret documents by the web site wikileaks. The fact that the list has now been made public may give government agencies and individuals a chance to change their password information and diminish the damage. The list appears to include a wide range of government agencies from king county in washington state to mission controllers at nasa to a chief of staff for a member of congress.

            "By: hari sreenivasan gawker media, one of the web's largest publishers, has been hacked. The insides of the multiple websites within their portfolio, their 1.3 million user names, e-mail addresses and passwords, are now splayed all across the internet for anyone to see. All the data was uploaded to the bit torrent file sharing network late sunday afternoon, meaning anyone from dallas to dbruvnik to djibouti can have a look. The pbs newshour has learned that a select sub-list of what appear to be e-mail addresses and passwords of employees from federal, state and local government agencies were parsed separately for potential future attacks. They may have been used as part of operation payback, or another one of the initiatives launched by the so-called \" anonymous \" cyber movement that has grown in scope since the release of secret documents by the web site wikileaks. The fact that the list has now been made public may give government agencies and individuals a chance to change their password information and diminish the damage. The list appears to include a wide range of government agencies from king county in washington state to mission controllers at nasa to a chief of staff for a member of congress.

        "summary": "About 30,000 holocaust survivors living in new york city and three surrounding counties are at or below the poverty line, the wall street journal reports. After enduring nazi horrors, fleeing their homelands, and struggling to make new lives in america, advocates say the plight of these survivors grows more serious as they age and require increased medical care, money for basic living needs, and other assistance. Now a coalition of groups led by the survivor initiative is trying to get $ 1.5 million from the city council to help those survivors who need it the most — including those who lived through the double ( or triple ) whammy of 9/11 or 2012's superstorm sandy. \" it's very tough, \" 75-year-old jose urbach tells the newspaper. Urbach lost his job to downsizing at age 62, has fought prostate cancer, and sometimes has to borrow money for food and medical bills. Survivors like urbach \" live close to desperation, \" the uja-federation of new york says. A selfhelp report updated in 2013 predicts that nearly 24,000 survivors will be living in the new york area in the year 2025 and that 35 % of them will be dealing with serious or chronic illnesses, many linked to the poor living conditions and torture they endured from the nazis, per the journal. They also may not have a strong support network if family members didn't make it through the holocaust.

No criminal history: police in mesquite say they've had no previous contact with paddock, while police in las vegas say there's been nothing beyond a minor traffic violation, reports the new york times. Isis claims responsibility: the islamic state, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for the attack and said paddock converted several months ago, but it provided no evidence to back up the assertion, reports the ap. The fbi later made clear it has found no connection between paddock or any terrorist organization. Pilot: nbc news reports that paddock had his pilot's license and owned two planes. He also had a hunting license in alaska. Police found more than 10 guns in his hotel room at the mandalay bay resort and casino. Companion: police tracked down a female companion named marilou danley, 62, but they say she has been cleared in the shooting. Paddock checked into the hotel through danley's id, reports the atlanta journal-constitution. She has been described as paddock's roommate or girlfriend.",

        "summary": "Monopoly was more than a game for many world war ii pows, who used tools hidden in the boxed sets to help them escape. The story's been told before, but christian donland at eurogamer looks deeply into the life of a high-strung, eccentric british intelligence officer named clayton hutton, who designed the escape tools and had them shipped to pows in monopoly games. The boxes arrived from phony charities with clues in their letterhead, like the biblical lines, \" ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you. \" pows could also spot them by the red dot on the free parking space, notes the atlantic. Inside, they found shears, metal files, a silk escape map, mini-compass, and money in the local currency. Experts think some 35,000 allied pows escaped and made it back home, some presumably with the help of rigged monopoly sets. But who knows? hutton was forbidden to mention his ingenious tools, which were government secrets, after all. Hutton had a nervous breakdown and later died in 1965, most of his work unacknowledged. His greatest brush with fame likely came as a young man in meeting harry houdini, who bet he could escape from a box built by hutton's colleagues. Houdini won by bribing a carpenter into adding an escape hatch, but hutton \" learned that, when it comes to escape, every trick counts, \" writes donland. \" eventually he would put this knowledge... To work for him in the second world war. \" click for donland's full, engrossing article, or click to read about coded letters from a pow that have finally been decoded.",

            "On 29th april 1913, christopher clayton hutton, who earned his pay manufacturing boxes, wrote a letter to harry houdini, who earned his own by getting out of them. Clayton hutton was 20 at the time, a self-confident, ingenious, and perhaps rather eccentric young man working at his uncle's lumber yard in saltley in the west midlands. He loved games and showmanship and magic, but he was also somewhat sceptical by nature - possessed of an engineering mentality that sought to understand how things worked and to separate the possible from the impossible. He'd seen houdini perform an escape act in birmingham several years previously, and he was struck that the packing crate the magician triumphantly broke free of at the climax of the evening had been in his possession for two whole days before the show. Clayton hutton's letter was a challenge. Would houdini attempt an escape from one of the lumber yard's packing crates the next time he was in town - a crate that would be constructed live on stage, by clayton hutton's colleagues, in the middle of the performance? houdini received this sort of letter every day, but clayton hutton's was different. Clayton hutton was different. By accepting his challenge - by promising clayton hutton the considerable sum of £ 100 if the packing case"

In one test, researchers say a quiz to identify odors correctly predicted which people already suffering mild memory problems would go on to develop the disease, though they stress that not everyone with a lousy sense of smell is at risk. Two other tests in the works involve scanning the eye for beta-amyloid, a protein which is a key alzheimer's biomarker, cbs reports. Tests using curcumin, a chemical found in the spice turmeric, to highlight the protein spotted alzheimer's patients with a high degree of accuracy. \" what makes it unique is that the retina is actually an extension of the brain and so we think that a lot of the pathology that is occurring in the brain may also be occurring in the retina, \" a neurologist explains.

While other studies have shown that angry or anxious drivers are more likely to get into an accident, previous researchers \" have not explored the relationship between emotional information processing and driving behavior, \" according to the chinese researchers. Here's how the experiment worked: researchers recruited 38 drivers with at least three years ' experience. The drivers were split into two groups — 23 safe drivers and 15 dangerous drivers — based on driving-record penalty points accrued during the previous year. Participants were asked to identify whether a photograph had a red or blue border; the images inside those borders were meant to evoke negative, positive or neutral emotions. Drivers in the dangerous group took a bit longer ( a few hundredths of a second ) to identify the color of the border when the image was negative, per pacific standard, which writes that the negativity bias \" strongly correlated with the number of crashes each driver had been in during the previous three years. \" negativity bias was not detected in the safe drivers ' group. \" the influence of negativity bias provides one possible explanation for the effects of individual differences on dangerous driving behavior and traffic crashes, \" the researchers write.

            "There goes mr. Driver, a crazed lunatic roaring down the road, weaving through traffic, just a twitch away from killing somebody. What makes mr. Driver such a menace? sure, anger has a lot to do with it, but chinese driving researchers have identified something perhaps more fundamental: negativity bias, the tendency to focus on what's bad in the world around us. Past research has shown angry driving can lead to accidents in a number of different ways. For one, angry people have a harder time paying attention to the road. A 2012 study showed that people more prone to angry outbursts tended to focus on sources of frustration — a jaywalking pedestrian in the rear-view mirror, for example — than what was going on in front of them. Similarly, a 2011 study showed emotional conversations can lead to \" visual tunneling, \" where drivers stop scanning the road ahead for potential hazards. The broader lesson is that anger makes it harder to think clearly and quickly, and to process what's going on, making for dangerous driving. Within those observations, however, is a key point that may have been overlooked in previous efforts, explain jing chai and her colleagues at the chinese academy of science's institute of psychology in beijing: angry people also tend to focus on the worst things"

The complaint alleges that when cops arrived on the scene of the greek life competition and tried to resuscitate nelson on march 30, 2017, the pancake mush in her mouth was like \" concrete, \" and that the inside of her mouth was \" compacted with pancakes, almost to her teeth. \" despite cpr efforts, first responders couldn't get all the pancakes out of her breathing path; nelson, who the new york post notes was a member of the kappa delta sorority, died of asphyxia a few days later, per an autopsy. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages, but nelson's mom also wants to alert people to the perils of shoving large amounts of food down one's throat for fun. \" these contests are significantly more dangerous than people realize, \" the complaint notes, adding that whipped cream or ice cream would be better items for such amateur contests if they must be held, as they ' ll melt away before becoming a choking hazard. The suit also alleges that sacred heart didn't have staff nearby during the contest to keep participants from \" chipmunking \" ( storing too much food in their cheeks ), or medical workers to assist in case of any problems, per the ap and the wall street journal. What brought an extra dose of tragedy to nelson's death: her dad, james nelson, was a port authority cop who'd died in the 9/11 attacks at the world trade center.

Well, now a team of european chemists has discovered that those last two things are even better together than you thought. Normally meat grilled at high temperatures produces a lot of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ), which have been linked to cancer, birth defects, and reproductive problems in lab animals, fox news explains. But marinating meat in beer can greatly mitigate that effect, the researchers found. Researchers grabbed some pork loin and tried marinating it in a pilsner, a non-alcoholic pilsner, and black ale. Their control loin, cooked unmarinated, wound up having pah levels well above the european food safety authority's guidelines, but the ones soaked in beer for four hours first came out below, pacific standard reports. Black ale performed the best, dropping the count 53 % — researchers theorize that ales work better because of their \" higher antioxidant capacity. \" the non-alcoholic pilsner actually outperformed the standard pils, dropping the content 25 % to the pilsner's 13 %.

One posted on r/ultrahardcore began \" tonight, i am taking my life. \" in that post and the second, he relayed his eight-year struggle with depression and called himself \" an unliked outcast at school, \" \" unloved in my family and not appreciated in any other groups, \" \" inadequate and meaningless, hated and worthless. \" he added, \" even my mother told me she doesn't want me in her life \" and said, \" i just want to know what it's like to be appreciated. To be liked. To be loved. \" the reddit community gave him the chance to experience those feelings by rallying to his support on both the suicidewatch and ultrahardcore subreddits, offering words of encouragement and imploring him to seek help. One user created a minecraft homage to notaromanguy's avatar, while more than 50 others joined a voice conference to talk him out of it, according to mashable. The next day, he expressed his gratitude in a couple of follow-up reddit posts: in one he mentions his \" extremely tough \" night, adding, \" thanks for all the support; it was overwhelming and it saved my life. I love you all. \" meanwhile, in his second online \" thank you, \" he assures other posters he ' ll be consulting with a school counselor about selecting a psychiatrist and tells others to \" ask people how they're doing before it's too late, because it was almost too late for me. Everyone fights their own battles. \" read his heartfelt messages in their entirety here and here. ( meanwhile, a 29-year-old is planning to take her own life for a very different reason. )",

Desnard calls it a \" descent into hell \" that left him \" destroyed \" and constantly crying, the local france reports. \" i was depressed, and ashamed of being paid for doing nothing, \" he says.

Now he's taking his case to an employment tribunal that began monday. Desnard is seeking about $ 413,000 in damages and compensation, including missed holiday pay, and says the company bored him intentionally so they could ditch him without paying unemployment compensation. But the company's lawyer, jean-philippe bénissan, says desnard has \" no proof \" and changed his complaint from \" burn out \" to \" bore out \" as a tactical ploy. \" he never said anything about being bored during the four-year period, \" says bénissan. France's higher court has already recognized 244 cases of workers \" intentionally sidelined \" and deemed it \" moral harassment, \" while a researcher says up to 30 % of french employees are suffering from \" bore out, \" france info reports.",

The japan-based automotive manufacturer just unveiled the kirobo mini, a small, humanoid robot designed to \" invoke an emotional connection, \" according to chief design engineer fuminori kataoka. Toyota's robot is one of a \" growing list \" of companion devices coming out in the country, which is suffering population contraction due to a plethora of social factors, including a general lack of interest in marriage and children among young japanese, reuters reports. With a lack of caretakers for an increasingly elderly population, the country is turning to robots to fill the gap. The kirobo mini itself doesn't offer any functionality beyond companionship, though the palm-sized robot \" wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself, \" kataoka says. It also comes with a \" cradle \" of sorts, designed to fit in the cupholder of one's car. According to digital trends, the kirobo mini was inspired by a larger robot toyota made as a companion for a japanese astronaut aboard the iss. Toyota's betting the concept will be a hit down here on earth, too, and it must be confident, as the device is priced at a whopping 39,800 yen ( roughly $ 392 ), plus a $ 3 monthly subscription.

Toyota's non-automotive venture aims to tap a demographic trend that has put japan at the forefront of aging among the world's industrial nations, resulting in a population contraction unprecedented for a country not at war, or racked by famine or disease. \"he wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself, \" said fuminori kataoka, kirobo mini's chief design engineer. \"this vulnerability is meant to invoke an emotional connection. \" toyota plans to sell kirobo mini, which blinks its eyes and speaks with a baby-like high-pitched voice, for 39,800 yen ( $ 392 ) in japan next year.

Speaking to us public radio host terry gross on npr's fresh air program about the 2016 american presidential election, clinton said she was also probing what happened with kenya's election, and why the supreme court decided to call the election \"invalid. \" the former us secretary of state has been making a round of media interviews promoting her book \"what happened, \" in which she recounts her 2016 election experiences. Clinton, who won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote count, also said she would not rule out questioning the credibility of the us results if new information showed that the russian-led cyber intrusions were deeper than currently known.

        "summary": "The us military knows firsthand the effectiveness of a relatively simple tool in saving lives — the tourniquet. Consider the eye-opening stat in one military study that 90 % of those who died from a potentially survivable wound did so specifically from \" uncontrolled blood loss, \" notes the atlantic. Its use of tourniquets has worked so well in dealing with trauma victims that law enforcement around the country have begun to follow suit. And because so-called field tourniquets fashioned out of, say, one's own shirt are notoriously inferior, the department of homeland security last month launched the stop the bleed campaign in an attempt to get tourniquets into as many schools, stadiums, airports, and other public places as possible. The \" drum-beat of large-scale violence, including school shootings and terror attacks \" further demonstrate the utility of a simple device that can save lives, reports the wall street journal. In the past 20 months, dallas police saved 15 people thanks to tourniquets; in 2013, a police officer was saved in san diego after a chase; and last month, a policeman in wisconsin used a tourniquet to save a teen after an ice-skating accident. The mayo clinic already offers tourniquet education to farmers at minnesota's annual farmfest agricultural show, while more than 3,000 teachers in one wisconsin community have been trained to apply them. \" someone needs to ask the question: ' with all of the shootings going on, why doesn't every school in the country have hemorrhage-control devices?

Now, a major find related to the little-known philistines, some of the hebrew bible's \" most notorious villains, \" as national geographic puts it, with goliath and delilah ( of david and samson infamy, respectively ) among their ranks. To unlock the mysteries of the philistines, archaeologists needed to find bodies, not just artifacts, but until now human remains have been elusive. \" archaeologists who study the philistines began to joke that they were buried at sea like the vikings — that's why you couldn't find them, \" one archaeologist tells national geographic. Sunday brought the news that the expedition has for three years been excavating the first philistine cemetery to be found. From the time the ashkelon expedition team first discovered a human tooth in 2013 until this week, when the year's final expedition came to a close, archaeologists have counted at least 145 sets of human remains in several burial rooms, reports the bbc. Most are buried without any objects or ornamentation, though some perfume, food, jewelry, and weapons were unearthed, and the small number of children and infants buried were found covered in a \" blanket \" of broken pottery. Dna analysis and carbon dating will hopefully shed light on some long-running mysteries about the philistines ' origins and whether they have a connection to the mysterious sea peoples who tore across the mediterranean in the 13th and 12th centuries bc; the remains date to the 11th to 8th centuries. \" so much of what we know about the philistines is told by their enemies, \" says the expedition's co-director. \" we ' ll really be able to tell their story by the things they left behind for us. \" ( check out where these philistine pottery shards were discovered. )",

        "summary": "Another cautionary tale in the midst of america's battle against opioids: that of george elwood tschaggeny. The military veteran helped tackle a bank robber armed with a knife in 2010 and was awarded a civilian medal, and it wasn't tschaggeny's first turn as a good samaritan. More than a decade prior, he also came to the aid of a motorcyclist after a crash, putting the bike in his truck and driving the biker to the doctor, reports the oregonian. But drug addiction set in and may have had a hand in propelling tschaggeny to his latest set of headlines: he was arrested june 2 for allegedly stealing the wedding ring and backpack from rick best as he lay dying in the wake of the high-profile max attack in portland, oregon. Police believe tschaggeny took the ring off best's finger, though they aren't exactly sure how. Video caught the perpetrator calmly walking away from the scene, and tschaggeny was arrested following a tip from a domino's pizza worker who said she recognized the 51-year-old and pointed police to the homeless camp where he lives, report koin. He was allegedly wearing best's ring. In charting tschaggeny's path, the oregonian spoke with his ex-wife, who described a good life filled with dogs, mountain biking, and westerns; she describes a man who made her lunch daily, and then dropped her off at work. But the painkillers prescribed for a knee injury turned into an addiction, followed by heroin. Multiple stints in rehab didn't have a lasting impact. Koin notes best's wallet remains missing.",
