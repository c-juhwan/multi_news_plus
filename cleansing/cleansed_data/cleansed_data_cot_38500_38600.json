But tesla can do a lot between now and 2018 ( or thereabouts ) when faraday plans to bring out a real car. \" finally, tech insider has a little something for the graphic designers, discussing the faraday future logo, which has garnered reactions from \" fiendishly clever \" to \" looks like a fish \" to \" a bit derivative of the police's album ghost in the machine. \"",

So they took him to the hospital, but doctors couldn't find anything. Yet for decades, he's suffered from sniffles and headaches he thought were a result of allergies. Now, more than four decades later, it turns out his childhood doctors were wrong, the guardian reports. In what must have been a powerful sneeze — accompanied by what he calls \" a very uncomfortable sensation \" — the suction cup emerged from a 51-year-old easton's nose. \" i started a sneezing fit and it came out of my left nostril, \" the british man says. \"i thought, ' what's this? where the hell has this come from? ' and pulled out this rubber sucker. \" easton called his mom, who told him about the hospital visit — which he had apparently forgotten. Doctors at the time said perhaps she was mistaken about her son inhaling the suction cup, she notes. \" i knew it wasn't [ a mistake ] and it's always worried me, and now it has suddenly shot out. We are all shocked. \" easton's current doctor doesn't think the dart caused any problems.

The transportation nonprofit estimates a 4.8 percent increase from last year among americans journeying more than 50 miles from home to celebrate the thanksgiving holiday. \"higher wages, more disposable income and rising levels of household wealth are fueling a busy holiday travel week, \" said aaa spokesman robert sinclair jr. The vast majority of commuters, an estimated 48.5 million americans, will travel by automobile, a nearly 5 percent uptick from 2017, according to inrix, a global traffic data and analytics firm. And with millions of additional vehicles comes even more traffic, especially for those looking to flee the big apple. Drivers in new york, new jersey and connecticut should anticipate a gridlock nightmare, particularly between 6 and 8 p.m. On tuesday, as commuters look"

Six weeks later, he lost sight in the eye; less than a year after that, he lost the eye completely. Now he's warning others about a little-known yet very serious danger of contact lenses. According to cbs news, carthew, who says he always took proper care with his contact lenses, originally thought he had a common eye infection. Then came the \" absolutely shocking \" pain and sensitivity to light. It was like having a toothache on an entire side of his face, metro reports. He spent weeks just lying in the dark, only leaving his house for hospital visits. He had to retire after more than 30 years as a paramedic. It turns out carthew had acanthamoeba keratitis, a rare infection caused by an amoeba. While the amoeba is found in lakes, soil, and more, 85 % of infections happen with people wearing contact lenses that are contaminated — typically because they were worn while bathing or rinsed with tap water. In the us, acanthamoeba keratitis usually infects just one or two contact lens wearers out of every million, but nbc news reports there was an outbreak of it in 35 states in 2007. As for carthew, antibiotics and even a corneal transplant were ineffective. Doctors had to remove his eye before the infection reached the optic nerve, which could have been fatal. He says he wants people to start paying attention to contact lens care to make sure the same doesn't happen to them. The cdc estimates 90 % of people with hard contact lenses sometimes rinse them with tap water. ( not to mention all the other gross things we do with our contact lenses. )",

            "The three men convicted in the united kingdom on monday of a plot to bomb several transcontinental flights were prosecuted in part using crucial e-mail correspondences intercepted by the u.s. National security agency, according to britain's channel 4. The e-mails, several of which have been reprinted by the bbc and other publications, contained coded messages, according to prosecutors.

            "Fda reveals new guidelines on gay, bisexual blood ban civil rights groups say the fda's new guidelines are ' unacceptable ' for retaining restrictions on blood donations by sexually active gay and bisexual men. And for transgender donors, there's also a change in the works. The u.s. Food and drug administration today issued a recommendation signaling the first significant change to a 33-year ban on blood donations by gay and bisexual men, but it maintains restrictions that civil rights groups say make it still unacceptable. If approved, the draft guidelines revising that controversial ban on men who have sex with men will give blood collection centers across the country the green light to accept blood donations from everyone — except for gay or bisexual men, who must affirm they have abstained from sex with other men for one year. However, sexually active gay and bi guys will still be banned for life",

The recommendation changes the current guidance, which is that any man who have ever had sex with another man in his entire life should never be able to donate blood.

Variety and the los angeles times report on the \" netflix collection, \" 12 different types of weed hawked in branded glass jars. Disjointed gets three varieties all to itself: the omega strain, eve's bush, and rutherford b. Haze. Other netflix series that earned their own cannabis add-on include bojack horseman ( which inspired the prickly muffin ), arrested development ( banana stand kush ), and orange is the new black ( poussey riot ). The netflix-tied marijuana was sold in a temporary pop-up store at alternative health herbal services in west hollywood, calif., over the weekend, meaning the sale is already over. Per a press release, the type of pot matched with each show was carefully thought out, with \" sillier \" shows linked to weed that was more \" indica dominant, \" and \" dramedies \" tied to more \" sativa dominant [ varieties ] to help the more powerful scenes resonate \" ( the difference between the two strains is explained here ). Fortune notes it's an \" interesting time for a big company like netflix to be dallying with mary jane, \" as attorney general jeff sessions has insinuated he may try to crack down on marijuana legalization. Netflix says it didn't make money off the pot sales, that only qualifying individuals with medical cards were able to buy the branded weed, and that this initiative was for pr purposes only — which the times notes is an important distinction, since weed is still illegal on a federal level.

Since then, the team has discovered the fort and more than a million artifacts in the ground. Jamestown unearthed is a recurring feature in wydaily exploring the latest discoveries in and around james fort. In addition to discovering the buried secrets of jamestown, the jamestown rediscovery project also focuses on educating the public about the first days of english settlement in north america. It does so via tours of the james fort site, web outreach and museum exhibits at its nathalie p. &amp; alan",

Archaeologists at the historic james fort site of jamestown in southern virginia may be closing in on a well that was dug by the site's early colonists during the formative years of america's first successful english colony. The prospect is tantalizing because, in the years that archaeologists have been conducting investigations and research at the site, several wells have been uncovered that yielded hundreds of thousands of artifacts, many of them among the most important and spectacular finds of the more than two-decade long excavation project. Like historic trash middens ( garbage dumps ), wells often yield a motherlode of finds for archaeologists, because these are the concentrated places where the long-gone inhabitants deposited the refuse of their daily lives, from discarded belt buckles and broken pottery to whole pieces of body"

Instead they work with suppliers to set artificially high starting prices that will still yield the desired profit once they take, say, 50 % off. The \" discount \" price is, in effect, the real intended price. Since 2009, both the number of discounts and size of discounts at 31 major retailers have shot up, yet profit margins have remained completely flat. Some stores even increase prices right before the holidays; a journal analysis showed prices rising an average 8 % in the weeks before thanksgiving last year for about one-fifth of the products analyzed. Customers are mostly rewarding the behavior, although a handful have sued, saying that items weren't offered at their list price \" for a reasonably substantial period of time, \" the vague standard mandated by the ftc.

        "summary": "A long-dead diplomat's family has urged president trump to release still-secret files on john f. Kennedy's assassination ahead of the deadline trump set to do so, in hopes it changes the story of their father's suicide. After 18 years with the state department, charles thomas saw it all come crashing down. The department's 1960s \" up-or-out \" policy meant one was promoted or \" selected out, \" and thomas found himself in the latter category. Two years later, in 1971, the 48-year-old shot himself in the head while his wife was downstairs. The guardian reports that months later came a \" terrible discovery \": a portion of his personnel files had been misplaced and was the reason for him being erroneously \" selected out. \" president ford apologized, and the department's policy was changed. But the family thinks what happened with the files was no accident. Their theory is that there was an intentional effort to see thomas removed from the department due to what the guardian calls his \" persistent, unwelcome, and ultimately fruitless effort \" to reopen the investigation into jfk's death. Thomas was stationed in mexico in the mid-1960s and in 1965 learned more about lee harvey oswald's 1963 visit to mexico city. In one memo thomas wrote that has been made public, he noted that what he had learned \" threatened to... Damage the credibility of the warren report. \" slate in 2013 noted that thomas in 1969 sent a memo to the secretary of state beseeching him to look into the trip; six days later, thomas was out. Many of the documents that remain classified hail from the cia station in mexico city, and thomas ' family thinks they could flesh out thomas'theories.

        "summary": "If you drive a volkswagen diesel model, your car might be getting recalled — though not for safety reasons. The obama administration has ordered the carmaker to recall about 482,000 cars because, it claims, volkswagen put illegal software in those cars designed to get around environmental standards, the new york times reports. So-called \" defeat devices \" are able to detect when the car is getting tested for emissions; during those times, it turns on its full emissions control systems, but those systems remain off otherwise. Therefore, while the car is actually being driven, it pollutes much more than the manufacturer is reporting, the epa says, thus creating ozone and smog. The epa says defeat devices were installed in 4-cylinder volkswagen and audi vehicles between model years 2009 and 2015; the recall would include diesel models of the volkswagen jetta, the volkswagen beetle, the volkswagen golf, the volkswagen passat, and the audi a3. \" using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health, \" says an epa official. It's part of the government's efforts to more aggressively ensure the auto industry sticks to environmental regulations, analysts say. \" they want to make it clear that they're going to crack down, \" says the president of clean air watch. \" they want to lay down the law, enforce the law, and show they're not going to tolerate cheaters. \" the epa says owners of the affected vehicles do not need to take any immediate action, the ap reports.",

The epa says the controls are turned off during normal driving situations. The epa called the company's use of the device illegal and a threat to public health. The epa called on vw to fix the cars ' emissions systems, but said car owners do not need to take any immediate action. Vw said in a statement it is cooperating with the investigation.",

        "summary": "If nfl team owners obeyed president trump's call to fire players who protested during the national anthem, they would now be looking for more than 200 players. After trump's remarks, the ap counted over 200 players kneeling, sitting, or raising their fists at sunday's games. That's up from just six players last week and accounts for an eighth of the league's 1,696 players, with one more game to go on monday. The seahawks, titans, and almost all of the steelers didn't take the field for the anthem. \" sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country, \" trump tweeted. \" nfl should change policy! \" a roundup of coverage: even two anthem singers took a knee in protest ahead of sunday's games, reports people. Rico lavelle took a knee after his performance in detroit at the lions-falcons game, as did the voice runner-up meghan linsey before the titans-seahawks game in nashville. The america first policies group, which has close ties to trump, is planning a social media ad campaign urging people to \" turn off the nfl \" for \" disrepecting \" the country. Viewers should choose something that \" honors the great men and women who make sacrifices to protect our freedom, \" a draft version of an ad shared with buzzfeed states. There was no sign of any anthem protest at a nascar event at the new hampshire motor speedway, usa today reports. Some team owners who spoke to the press said they would fire any employee who protested the national anthem, though andy murstein of richard petty motorsports says he wouldn't fire anybody for expressing their opinion. \" great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country, \" trump said in another tweet after players and team owners at some games stood with their arms locked during the anthem. \" standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. \" players and team officials, however, say they locked arms to show support for protesting players, not trump, the new york times notes. Bernice king, daughter of martin luther king jr., was among many people who responded to trump's remarks by sharing photos of the civil rights leader and hundreds of others kneeling during a protest in 1965, the washington post reports. \" people didn't approve of the way my father protested injustice either, \" she tweeted. In an opinion piece at slate, singer john legend argues that the protesting players are actually very patriotic. With their calls for racial justice, they are showing their \" allegiance to the",

It all started on may 25 when sally bergesen, ceo of sports apparel brand oiselle, took to twitter to describe the time her dad body shamed her when she was 12: \" keep eating like that and you're going to be a butterball. \" she then encouraged others to share their stories using the hashtag #theysaid, and mashable reports many such stories followed. \" you should wear a girdle, \" one woman says her grandmother told her when she was 5. \" fat women cannot be happy, \" a stranger told a teen at 16. \" you have such a pretty face. It's a pity you're so fat. No man will ever marry you, \" one woman says her mother told her around age 12. Some women also wrote about being shamed for being thin, reports huffpost. \" i bet my leg weighs as much as you \" was one. That same day bergesen asked people to recommend how to respond to body shaming, and offered up her own advice using the hashtag #shereplied: \" fueling the miracle machine you gave me, mom, \" bergesen suggested to one woman whose mother chided her for her eating habits. Another woman's reply: \" well i can't lose weight to fit into someone's narrow mind! \" bergesen has also taken some heat for starting a thread about body positivity while running an apparel company whose sizing only goes to 12. She promised to add more options for plus-sized women by 2018. ( research suggests that people who are fat shamed gain weight. )",

        "summary": "With israel-palestine talks potentially beginning next week, israel will release some \" heavyweight ( palestinian ) prisoners in jail for decades, \" says top minister yuval steinitz. Details are fuzzy, but it's possible 350 prisoners could be released over several months, a palestinian official tells the bbc; some 100 of them have been in detention since before 1993. That's out of 4,817 palestinians in israeli prisons, by an israeli human rights group's count. The prisoners'release sees israel taking action on one of three roadblocks standing in the way of talks, the new york times notes. Palestine also wants negotiating to center on israel's 1967 borders and is seeking a freeze on israeli west bank settlements. But \" there is no chance that we will agree to enter any negotiations that begin with defining territorial borders or concessions by israel, nor a construction freeze, \" steinitz says. John kerry has \" gotten them into the pool, \" an expert tells the times. \" right now they're in the very shallow end, and they're going to have to swim in deeper waters — and they can be treacherous. \"",

But a retired female army colonel and an author of a book on military gender integration who obtained 380 pages of research from the study and offered them to the washington post say the study is \" inherently flawed \"; that the \" limited information \" released hid study design problems, a small volunteer pool, and overgeneralizations; and that better measures, such as physical screenings before entering the integrated unit, \" would have all but eliminated the rates of injury for women, \" per their online essay posted wednesday. \" the fact that the marines felt confident \" in accepting these results \" indicates a clear intent to keep women out, \" ellen haring and megan mackenzie wrote. Navy secretary ray mabus, a vocal advocate for women in the military, feels the same way, noting to npr that any generalizations don't showcase the individual women who actually did excel. \" when you start out with [ a ] mindset [ of men thinking this is not a good idea ], you're almost presupposing the outcome, \" he says. The study also mentions seven sexual assaults that were reported by service members in the integrated unit, the post notes. But it's unclear whether the alleged assaults were committed against men or women, if they took place while the marines were on duty or on leave, and whether they even took place while the troops were in the integrated unit — marines were simply asked if they had been assaulted over the past six months, which could have included a period before the integrated unit was formed last october.

His bet came after a rep this week said tesla could build a battery farm with 100 to 300 megawatt-hours of storage, which the rep said would fix the power problem \" within the next 100 days or so. \" after hearing that, australian billionaire mike cannon-brookes wanted to hear it from musk, and asked in a tweet thursday if the company were serious. \" tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free, \" musk replied. \" that serious enough for you? \" musk indicated tesla would charge $ 25 million for the storage system, and the government sounds interested in at least exploring the idea, reports reuters. It could be marketing bluster, observes abc australia, but it notes that musk built a similar system in california. No word on when the government might make a decision, but cannon-brookes is apparently interested in helping.

Activists are celebrating this victory, with one calling it \" a dream that has come true \" when a royal committee recommended such a move two months ago. It still must undergo a vote in parliament to be passed, reports the bbc. It's not an infrequently invoked loophole, according to government stats cited by the independent: 159 rapists reportedly used the law to avoid jail between 2010 and 2013, with an average 300 rapes being reported each of those years ( activists believe underreporting occurs due to the taboo nature of rape in jordan ). Supporters of article 308 say it preserves the honor and reputation of the victim, but critics believe the opposite occurs in most cases. The bbc has one such story, that of noor, the pseudonym given by a woman who at age 20 was drugged and raped by her employer. She says she reported the rape only after discovering she was pregnant. \" with all the hatred i have in my heart, my family forced me to marry him so as to save the ' family's honor, ' \" she says. They decided to divorce, but she has been unable to register the child in his name, which would allow for the recognition of the child, as she desires. Similar protections for rapists have been abolished in morocco, egypt, and ethiopia, while activists in countries like lebanon and bahrain are currently seeking solutions to repeal such laws.",

        "summary": "A power surge caused several cars of a moscow subway train to fly off the tracks at the height of the morning's rush hour, killing at least 20 people and injuring at least 150, reports the ap. At least 50 of those are thought to be injured seriously. About 200 people have been evacuated from the train, which is stuck between two stations in russia's capital. Although russian news agency itar tass is quoting the russian health minister as saying one person is still trapped in the wreckage, emergency services personnel at the scene are speculating there are more. Photos on twitter show a grisly scene, with bloodied passengers being carried out on stretchers and laid out on the ground for medical attention as helicopters transported the more seriously injured to nearby hospitals. Reports say that the power surge triggered an alarm, which caused the train to come to an abrupt halt between slaviansky boulevard and park pobedy stations in the western part of the city, according to the bbc. Hindering rescue efforts is the fact that the park pobedy station is the deepest station in moscow, nestled 275 feet underground, says the ap. The tunnel where the crash took place was about 10 years old; the metro itself opened in 1935. Critics say that officials have spent too much time and money expanding the subway system and not paid enough attention to maintenance, the bbc report. There have been 13 emergency events on the metro so far this year, but no previous injuries, according to usa today.

        "summary": "Divers searching the sunken sewol ferry found the bodies of 48 girls inside a single cabin with a capacity of 30, officials announced today. They believe the passengers all rushed into the same room as the ship began to sink, cnn reports. Like most of the bodies found in the wreck, all the girls were wearing life vests — which may have actually hurt passengers ' chances of escape. As the boat tilted, many exits would have been below them and/or underwater. The confirmed death toll is now at 185, but it's expected to rise, with 117 still missing and little hope any survived. Divers are now attempting to reach a dorm-style cabin where they expect as many as 50 more girls may have perished. In related news: so far rescuers have been aided by favorable weather, but the coast guard has warned that a storm might hit the area this weekend, the afp reports, and that currents are sure to strengthen. Prosecutors have officially identified three causes of the disaster: the sharper-than-expected turn that forced the ship to tilt; the recent addition of upper-deck cabins that hurt the ship's ability to right itself; and poorly-stowed cargo that shifted to the side and further helped drag the ship over, the new york times reports. Investigators also took a look at the sewol's sister ship, the ohamana, and found a host of other security problems. Forty of its life rafts didn't work, nor did its emergency slides. Its equipment for tying down cargo containers is unreliable, and there is none to tie down cars. The ohamana has been out of operation since the sewol sank.",

The emails were released with an announcement by wikileaks on twitter that linked readers to a wikileaks page inviting visitors to \" search the dnc email database. \" a search box sits underneath a one-paragraph introduction: \" today, friday 22 july 2016 at 10: 30am edt, wikileaks releases 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the top of the us democratic national committee — part one of our new hillary leaks series, \" the introduction says. \" the leaks come from the accounts of seven key figures in the dnc, \" including communications director luis miranda ( 10770 emails ), national finance director jordon kaplan ( 3797 emails ), finance chief of staff scott comer and others. The newly released emails cover the period from january 2015 through may 25, 2016. Friday's digital document dump follows a report last month by the washington post that russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the democratic national committee, gaining access to an entire database of opposition research. Dnc and clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment friday as reporters and campaign staff began to assess the situation. The post's ellen nakashima goes over the events, and discusses the two hacker groups responsible. ( jhaan elker/the washington post"

The washington post reports that in two days'time, 276,000 people preordered its latest vehicle, adding for context the fact that popular cars such as the honda accord also reach close to the 300,000 mark — each year. \" we've never seen anything quite like this in the auto industry, \" says an edmunds.com analyst. \" it is unprecedented. \" and even if all of those model 3 hopefuls don't end up behind the wheel — the post notes some may cancel, or tesla may have a hard time producing that many, per a forbes warning and even ceo elon musk's own recent tweet — it's still an indicator that electric cars can sell, and sell well. \" tesla is putting together the idea a vehicle needs to be cutting edge and cool, more like an iphone than like a model t, \" says a forrester auto analyst. The popularity of the model 3 — around $ 35,000 for the most basic version, closer to $ 42,000 for a typical tricked-out model — is likely due to a combination of factors, including better battery life, more charging stations, and even the appeal of musk himself. And what one blue book analyst says is a \" big wake-up call for the rest of the industry \" has definitely caught other manufacturers ' attention. \" we're certainly pleased to see such strong demand for affordable long-range evs, \" says a rep for gm, which is coming out with its own electric car, the bolt, later this year; nissan's ceo tells automotive news the tesla preorders are \" good competition. \" in the meantime, tesla is getting most of the accolades. \" years from now we ' ll look back and say tesla started an electric vehicle revolution, \" the forrester analyst tells the post.

The daily beast notes that the film remains unreleased because it's been \" in legal limbo without a distributor for the past year \" thanks to a litany of lawsuits. In 2015, the adaptation of a martin amis novel was supposed to be one of the big movies at the toronto international film festival, but ultimately the cast and director didn't show up to support it, claiming the producers had cut certain scenes and inserted others ( including the sex scenes ) in the final cut. \" desperate people say desperate things.

On the one side, there were the economic conservatives. These were people that anybody following contemporary republican politics would be familiar with. They spent a lot of time worrying about the way government intrudes upon economic liberty. They upheld freedom as their highest political value. They admired risk-takers. They worried that excessive government would create a sclerotic nation with a dependent populace. But there was another sort of conservative, who would be less familiar now. This was the traditional conservative, intellectual heir to edmund burke, russell kirk, clinton rossiter and catholic social teaching. This sort of conservative didn't see society as a battleground between government and the private sector. Instead, the traditionalist wanted to preserve a society that functioned as a harmonious ecosystem, in which the different layers were nestled upon each other: individual, family, company, neighborhood, religion, city government and national government.

A recent new york times magazine article on the increased demand for twin reductions highlights this discomfort. In reactions to the piece, a blogger wondered if such a practice were \" morally wrong \"; the former president of catholics for choice asked whether women who would make such a choice would be better off forgoing fertility treatment entirely; even an abortion rights website writer was bothered by one particular scenario presented in the article. In slate, william saletan attempts to unravel the reasons behind the discomfort. At least two pro-life writers have expressed befuddlement: if you are ok with abortion, why aren't you ok with selective reduction? \" after all, a reduction is an abortion, \" saletan writes. But it all comes down to the \" bifurcated mindset [ that ] permeates pro-choice thinking. Embryos fertilized for procreation are embryos; embryos cloned for research are ' activated eggs. ' a fetus you want is a baby; a fetus you don't want is a pregnancy. \" with a reduction, you can no longer have that distinction, because both a wanted and an unwanted fetus exist in the same pregnancy.

Among those generating attention is tom brady, who voiced his disagreement with president trump on the kirk and callahan radio show on boston's weei. \"yeah, i certainly disagree with what ( trump ) said. I thought it was just divisive, \" brady said. \" like i said, i just want to support my teammates. I am never one to say, 'oh, that is wrong. That is right.

How this began: in the new york times, eric reid of the san francisco 49ers writes about joining teammate colin kaepernick in the early days of the anthem protests over police brutality. \" we chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy. \" he adds that he's angry trump \" referred to us with slurs but the neo-nazis in charlottesville, va., as'very fine people.

        "summary": "As the chair of stanford university's department of radiology, sam gambhir had studied a specific type of brain tumor called a glioblastoma multiforme. So it was a shock when his own 14-year-old son, milan, was found to have one — a \" brutal \" coincidence, per the stanford medicine diagnostics journal, which tells the story of his family's cruel discovery. It was especially stunning as milan had had a clear ct scan just nine months earlier after a rafting accident. Gambhir knew that fewer than 5 % of patients with gbm were still alive five years after diagnosis — but it was his son, and so there was no option of giving up. \" i knew the chances of beating it were so small, especially because by the time milan's gbm was caught it was already quite spread, \" he says. \" it is more frustrating and anxiety-provoking when you know what the outcomes of patients with gbm are. … and yet, you try. \" he tapped into colleagues ' expertise and turned to \" precision medicine, \" a custom-made treatment regimen for each cancer patient. It turned out milan had an extremely rare genetic mutation called li-fraumeni syndrome, which his mother also tested positive for. Milan's oncologist tells the journal that gambhir \" obviously wanted progress for milan's sake, but he also knew that any progress that helped his son would also be for the greater good. \" milan battled the tumor for nearly two years, but he died in may 2015 at the age of 16. Yet his brain cells, culled during surgery during the early days of his illness, are now being used in global research against the disease. And a wearable device he'd been working on to detect cancer recurrence was granted a patent right after his death. \" i think i was always empathetic toward illness, \" his dad says. \" but not as empathetic as i am now, knowing what it's like to have a sick child. \" ( read the gambhirs ' heartbreaking yet inspiring story here. )",

What's regarded as the most heated exchange, per the ap: macron reacted vigorously when le pen accused him of being in favor of muslim swimwear — essentially suggesting that her rival isn't really committed to france's secular values and policies. \" i don't need a ventriloquist, \" he retorted. \" when i have something to say, i say it clearly. \" he, in turn, accused le pen of using islam to divide the french. Le pen wants all visible religious symbols worn by people, including muslim headscarves and jewish kippahs, banned from public. \" the trap you are falling into, madame le pen, with your provocations is to divide society, \" macron said. The financial times reports that two online surveys taken after the debate put macron in the lead with about 30 % support; le pen took second or third. In its list of five takeaways, politico reports that it was waiting for a \" wow \" from the 39-year-old macron, and while he \" passed the presidential test, \" that pop never came. \" his insistence on the pragmatic platform overshadowed the unique selling point of his campaign — that he is meant to represent youthful optimism. \"",

The conservative candidate largely appeared calm and statesmanlike. But he was more subdued than in previous debates, when he had stood out with more masterful performances. The two leftist candidates, jean-luc mélenchon and benoît hamon, avoided attacking one another and instead focused on the other candidates, mainly the frontrunners macron and le pen. Here are",

( associated press ) paris ( ap ) — the two front-runners for the french presidency clashed spectacularly in the campaign's first televised debate between leading candidates monday night. All five candidates landed punches during vigorous discussion on the big issues for france: jobs, terrorism, immigration, europe. But the faceoff between independent centrist emmanuel macron and far-right populist marine le pen provided political theater, even moments of high drama in pitting two opposing visions of france. Macron's performance, in particular, was being closely watched. One of the big surprises of the election has been the success of the former economics minister's new-look campaign, positioning himself as a centrist alternative to france's traditional left-right politics. But le pen, the anti-immigration, anti-european union leader of the national front, was looking for opportunities to pounce. With polls suggesting"

Two archaeological teams have dug up new evidence pointing to the fate of english colonists who mysteriously vanished from the north carolina island 425 years ago, national geographic reports. One collection of items appears to support the long-held theory that some colonists moved to hatteras island, about 50 miles southeast of roanoke. \" the evidence is that they assimilated with the native americans but kept their goods, \" says chief archaeologist mark horton. Among the hatteras island finds: a small bit of a slate writing tablet marked by the letter \" m, \" a rapier hilt likely dating to the late 16th century, and pieces of iron, ingot, and stoneware apparently dating to the same period. What's more, the name of a native american settlement on hatteras island — \" croatoan \" — was found etched into a post in 1590 when all the colonists had vanished. For the second find, archaeologists used a map drawn by colony governor john white in 1585. The map includes an \" x \" obscured by a patch and may have been a \" ' cover-up '... To keep information from the public and from foreign agents, \" a historian told national geographic two years ago. The \" x \" marked a site on albemarle sound, an estuary in north carolina, where archaeologists recently discovered dozens of pottery pieces that resemble others found on roanoke island. So is this finally proof? not really, because it's hard to date items precisely or know how they got there. \" what we've found is tantalizing, \" a volunteer says. \" i would love to see some definitive evidence, but what we have is fragmentary. \" ( in other us history news: archaeologists have pinpointed a key location in the hatfield-mccoy feud. )",
