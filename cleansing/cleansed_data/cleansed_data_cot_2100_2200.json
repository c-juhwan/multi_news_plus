Brazilian police say the assault occurred, but a rape kit — meant to be completed within 72 hours — was only done after five days and didn't give conclusive evidence, reports cbs news. \" traces were lost because of time, \" the police chief says. But if a video showing men surrounding the woman's unconscious body \" is true, and it looks to be true, there is no doubt it was rape. \" so far only two men have been arrested. Police are searching for four others, though the victim says 33 men and boys were involved. \" i am waiting for the justice of god, \" she says. \" if i have to wait for the justice system, they've already shown that nothing is going to happen. \" she adds that the lead investigator — who has since been replaced — asked her if she often had group sex. Others say she should've expected the assault because she was in a slum controlled by a drug gang. \" they tried to incriminate me, as if it was my fault i was raped, \" she says, per the washington post. \" it not only hurt me, it hurt my soul, \" she adds. \" nobody deserves this. It doesn't matter if i was wearing short clothes or longer clothes, it doesn't matter where i was. \"",

Some fake news media, in order to marginalize, lies! \" he doesn't elaborate, but politico notes that it follows a saturday night live sketch in which steve bannon ( seen as the grim reaper ) is depicted as the person truly running the show. The new york times, meanwhile, has a lengthy article on life in the white house that strikes a similar chord: it says that trump was angry because he signed an executive order giving bannon a seat on the national security council without being \" fully briefed on the details. \" to remedy problems like that — and an increasingly loud backlash against other initiatives, including the travel ban — trump is moving to check the powers held by bannon and another top aide, stephen miller, according to the story. One change is that chief of staff reince preibus has made a \" 10-point checklist \" for the rollout of new directives to make sure that the president, the communications office, and others are looped in earlier in the process. The times story has much more, with details on trump's evening routine, which involves him heading upstairs about 6: 30. \" when mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. \"",

It's unclear whether the students will be disciplined. Notes a blogger at last real indians: \" the fighting sioux-esque 'siouxper drunk'tees worn at und's springfest by und students are proof positive that native mascots are harmful and degrading to native people, and that retiring all race-based mascots is not only appropriate, but necessary. \"",

        "summary": "Harvey weinstein's fall from grace has been dizzying — and the movie producer's fate was sealed after what insiders describe as an \" explosive \" board meeting sunday afternoon. A source tells the hollywood reporter that weinstein was fired by the weinstein company, which he co-founded, after he rejected an offer to settle with the company and leave voluntarily. The source says weinstein argued that his sexual harassment scandal would blow over, but directors, including brother robert weinstein, disagreed. A roundup of coverage: plenty of hollywood figures praised the firing on social media, including guardians of the galaxy director james gunn, who said \" good ( expletive ) riddance, \" deadline reports. The guardian looks back at the career and the downfall of weinstein, noting that unlike other celebrities who have faced similar accusations of sexual misconduct, recently, weinstein \" has long presented himself as a supporter of women within liberal hollywood. \" the wall street journal reports that democrats who have received hefty donations from weinstein, including sens. Chuck schumer and elizabeth warren, are trying to distance themselves from him and making charity donations equivalent to his campaign donations. Crisis management experts tell variety that weinstein delivered one of the worst responses they had ever seen. They say he made matters worse for himself by offering a narcissistic apology while also threatening to sue the new york times for exposing his behavior. \" this was his one opportunity to speak to victims, \" says crisis pr expert richard levick. \" it was one of the worst written apologies i've ever seen in a crisis situation. \" john oliver slammed weinstein and his apology on his sunday night show, mediaite reports. Weinstein's excuse that he came of age in the ' 60s and ' 70s \" isn't an excuse, \" the last week tonight show host said. \" in fact, it isn't even an excuse for that behavior in the ' 60s! \" another allegation against weinstein surfaced over the weekend, the new york daily news reports. Producer elisabeth karlsen says a young exec who had been staying in a house rented by miramax in the late ' 80s or early ' 90s told her that weinstein had showed up naked in her bedroom. Karlsen says the exec left the company after an out-of-court settlement. A third of the weinstein company's board has stepped down in recent days and although the company has promised to carry on, it may be difficult to do so amid accusations that directors turned a blind eye to weinstein's conduct, the ap reports.",

Workman claimed in a police filing from last month that she found winter in bed with an 18-year-old in september, celebuzz reports. The incident report, filed oct. 6, claims that the man — winter's boyfriend of five months, according to her mom — was engaging in \" possible unlawful sex with minor. \" in a statement yesterday, workman claimed that this incident was the real reason winter filed for a restraining order and asked to be removed from her home and placed under the care of her sister. But workman didn't file the police report until three days after ariel contacted the department of child and family services alleging abuse. Because of that, authorities doubt workman and think she's just making up a story in order to get custody back, tmz reports. Sources tell the gossip site that the first time workman mentioned the supposed 18-year-old was during a guardianship hearing last month, and say they doubt there was ever any sexual relationship. But e! notes that winter has publicly confirmed a relationship with 18-year-old actor cameron palatas. In another statement to celebuzz, workman claims that winter's sister, shanelle gray, has no real relationship with winter and only came \" out of the woodwork \" after winter started making big bucks on modern family.

In a 5-3 decision on wednesday, the us supreme court put a hold on the decision of a lower court that would have allowed grimm, a transgender male, to use the boys restroom at his school in virginia. According to the los angeles times, an appeals court ruled in april that the school board was in violation of title ix when it barred grimm from the boys restroom. Grimm's lawyer says the supreme court's decision means grimm will continue to be \" stigmatized and isolated from the rest of his peers just because he is transgender. \" however, politico reports it's likely the supreme court will hear grimm's case when it reconvenes in the fall. And that's good news for grimm and transgender students like him: a hearing on the issue will probably result in a 4-4 tie, which will uphold the appeals court's earlier ruling and allow grimm to use the boys restroom — albeit months from now, according to the times. The appeals court's ruling will also be upheld if the supreme court decides not to hear the case. Grimm used the boys restroom for a few weeks in 2014 until a number of parents complained. The virginia school board says it wants to \" protect the basic expectations of bodily privacy. \"",

            "Richmond, va. ( ap ) — a virginia school board can block a transgender male from using the boys restroom when school starts next month, the u.s. Supreme court ruled wednesday. In a 5-3 decision, the high court put on hold a lower court ruling that ordered the gloucester county school board to let gavin grimm use the bathroom that matches his gender identity. The school board is expected to ask the justices to further intervene in the case later this month. The decision means grimm will be barred from using the boys bathroom for at least the first half of his senior year, said josh block, an attorney with the american civil liberties union who's representing grimm. The school board says it plans to formally ask the supreme court to review 4th u.s. Circuit court of appeals decision in grimm's case by the end of august and then it will be months before the justices decide whether to do so. Block said he's disappointed the teen will have to begin another school year being \" stigmatized and isolated from the rest of his peers just because he is transgender."

If regulators approve the deal, the acquisition of nyse euronext ( which owns the nyse ) by deutsche börse ag ( which owns the frankfurt stock exchange ) would create the world's largest financial exchange. The move is bound to face intense scrutiny from regulators in europe, where the new operation would dominate trade, and in washington, where acquisition by a foreign company will pique nationalist sentiment, reports the wall street journal. Deutsche börse would own 60 % of the combined company, estimated to be worth some $ 25 billion, while nyse euronext shareholders would hold 40 %. The operation's incorporation papers would be filed in the netherlands, and its headquarters would be split between new york and frankfurt. The ap notes that while the nyse is already the world's largest stock market, nyse euronext isn't the largest exchange company in the us. That title belongs to the $ 20 billion cme group, which runs the chicago mercantile exchange. \" the real motivation here is really about competing with the cme group, \" said the head of a financial markets'research and strategic advisory firm.

        "summary": "Hurricane matthew left more than devastation behind on its rampage from haiti to north carolina. Experts are worried the storm created conditions that could unleash the zika virus from southern florida up the atlantic coast, reports mcclatchy. Pools of standing water left in the storm's wake make prime breeding ground for mosquitoes, and damage to homes and screens means the insects have an easier time reaching humans. \" it knocks a lot of stuff down so you just have a lot more things in which the mosquito can breed, \" said philip stoddard, a biology professor and the mayor of south miami. \" a damaged rain gutter, for instance, now becomes a rain collector. Every little object that blows off a house or even a chair flipped over on a porch becomes a container for mosquitoes to breed. \" most mosquitoes are no match for hurricane-force winds and flooding. Peter hotez, dean for the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college, told the atlantic that the storm surge could have a \" beneficial effect in terms of washing away mosquito breeding sites. \" but in the coming days, as the waters recede, offspring from the most hearty of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes ( one of the main carriers of zika ) will hatch, stoddard tells mcclatchy. Since july, there have been 141 cases of zika in southern florida, reports cnn, but fears that it could spread post-matthew are well-founded. After hurricane katrina in 2005, cases of neurological disease from west nile virus jumped by 50 %, per the atlantic. Still, matthew's appearance late in the season could mitigate things. \" we might not see this effect, \" hotez said.",

The decision has been closely watched, given comey's controversial role in the election: hillary clinton supporters say he cost her the election with a last-minute inquiry into her email that ultimately yielded nothing, while trump had criticized his earlier decision not to bring criminal charges against her over the email. Comey still has about six years left in his term if he serves it in full, and the fbi has two important investigations under way related to trump, notes the post: it's looking into russian hacking of the election and into whether any trump associates had improper contact with moscow. This week, for instance, the wall street journal reported that trump's national security adviser, michael flynn, is under scrutiny for phone calls he made to the russian ambassador on dec. 29, the day the obama administration announced new sanctions on moscow.",

Either way, a guy who broke into a maryland takeout restaurant on sept. 20 was likely nursing a nasty head bump the next day. Nbc new york reports on the attempted burglary in suitland, in which the would-be burglar did manage the first step of getting into the eatery by smashing the front window and stepping into the venue's waiting area. His next task: to break the window leading to the locked-down back room. As surveillance footage shows, that's when things hit a snag. The suspect threw what appears to be a brick ( wjla says it may have been a large rock ) two times at the window, which was made of bulletproof material. On the third try, as seen in the video, the brick once more bounces off the window, but this time it smacks the \" bad luck bandit \" ( cbs philly's name for him ) right in the head. He falls to his hands and knees in what was surely a good amount of pain, and nbc notes he stretched out on the ground for a few minutes before getting up and leaving.

Lucasfilm also fought development of a housing subdivision nearby, and residents of that subdivision became the biggest foes of the proposed 264,000-square-foot production complex, arguing that it's inappropriate for the area. Critics hailed lucasfilm's latest decision, but stunned county officials and others are now scrambling to change the director's mind, reports the marin independent journal. George lucas is \" one of the best neighbors anyone could ever have, \" says a local supervisor. \" and the loss of millions in revenue we would have coming from this key targeted industry is unfathomable. \"",

        "summary": "On esther island in alaska, a motion-detecting camera was set up in a bear den as part of a joint three-year study between the us forest service and the alaska department of fish and game. What that camera captured has now led to felony and misdemeanor charges against a palmer father and son, who authorities say shot dead a sow black bear and her two just-born cubs, then tried to cover it up once they saw the mother bear was collared, the anchorage daily news reports. Per court documents, andrew renner, 41, and owen renner, 18, were charged after video clips showed them skiing past the bear den on april 14, when the sow caught their eye. Per an alaska state troopers dispatch, owen renner then shot at the mother bear twice, and when the baby bears started \" shrieking, \" andrew renner shot and killed them. Additional clips are allegedly said to show the renners skinning and butchering the sow for meat, discussing getting the collar off her, and owen renner declaring, \" they ' ll never be able to link it to us. \" the men are also reportedly seen coming back to the site two days later to pick up empty shells and retrieve the cubs ' bodies. Troopers say later that month, andrew renner brought the bear skin and collar to adf&g in palmer and said he, not his son, had shot the sow, and that once he saw she had teats, he looked for but didn't see any cubs. It's illegal in alaska, except at certain sites, to take cubs or sows with cubs. Andrew renner now faces felony charges of tampering with evidence, as well as unsworn falsification and contributing to the delinquency of a minor ( owen renner was only 17 in april ). The men also face misdemeanor charges, including unlawful take of a sow with cubs and the cubs themselves.",

            "Good friday is about to get better for publicans in the republic of ireland. Why? because they can finally toast the easter holiday with a pint. For almost a century, selling alcohol had been banned on good friday - a legacy of ireland's christian traditions. But in january 2018 the irish parliament passed new legislation which means this year will be different. So what's the story for 2018? and who stands to gain from the change? what's different this year? pubs in the republic will welcome easter revellers from 10: 30 until closing time at 00: 30. Off-licences may see some changes too, with fewer booze-desiring customers stocking up a day in advance. Good friday is traditionally a popular time for house parties in the republic, as friends and loved ones gather at home instead of the local boozer. But with the pub doors suddenly open, some may decide they'd rather skip the washing-up. It's good news for tourists seeking a tipple too. On good fridays past, hapless foreigners unaware of the drinks ban could be found wandering the streets of dublin in a futile search for a pint. The most dedicated were even spotted boarding trains or ferries to exploit an infamous loophole - the on-board bar. Why did the law change? easter is a busy tourist",
            "The rattle of stainless steel kegs can be heard echoing down capel street as the cold early morning mist rises above dublin's city centre. Nearby, the chatter of workers from the victorian fruit and vegetable markets mixed with the sound of church bells wafts through the air as a key turns in the lock of slattery's pub and owner brian conlon pushes open the door. He sticks his head briefly outside and exchanges a few words with doorman cristian ichim before retreating to the cosy confines of his capel street pub. So far, the only customers on schedule for this historic 7am good friday opening are journalistic hacks, eagerly awaiting the thursday night rollovers to begin streaming in. Pierce bunch, haley wells, bethany ferraro, lauren thalheimer, alexandra kononenko, faison bunch, on a spring break from maryland, origan and new york, arrive at slatterys pub on capel street direct from the airport to become some of the first customers to enjoy a pint on good friday. Photograph: alan betson/ the irish times the first arrival is far less conspicuous. Shane mcshea is already digging into his breakfast and taking a sip of his first ever ( legally poured ) good friday pint when approached for a chat. He's a regular to the pub and often stops by for a bite on his way to work."

            "Good friday is about to get better for publicans in the republic of ireland. Why? because they can finally toast the easter holiday with a pint. For almost a century, selling alcohol had been banned on good friday - a legacy of ireland's christian traditions. But in january 2018 the irish parliament passed new legislation which means this year will be different. So what's the story for 2018? and who stands to gain from the change? what's different this year? pubs in the republic will welcome easter revellers from 10: 30 until closing time at 00: 30. Off-licences may see some changes too, with fewer booze-desiring customers stocking up a day in advance. Good friday is traditionally a popular time for house parties in the republic, as friends and loved ones gather at home instead of the local boozer. But with the pub doors suddenly open, some may decide they'd rather skip the washing-up. It's good news for tourists seeking a tipple too. On good fridays past, hapless foreigners unaware of the drinks ban could be found wandering the streets of dublin in a futile search for a pint. The most dedicated were even spotted boarding trains or ferries to exploit an infamous loophole - the on-board bar. Why did the law change? easter is a busy tourist",
            "The rattle of stainless steel kegs can be heard echoing down capel street as the cold early morning mist rises above dublin's city centre. Nearby, the chatter of workers from the victorian fruit and vegetable markets mixed with the sound of church bells wafts through the air as a key turns in the lock of slattery's pub and owner brian conlon pushes open the door. He sticks his head briefly outside and exchanges a few words with doorman cristian ichim before retreating to the cosy confines of his capel street pub. So far, the only customers on schedule for this historic 7am good friday opening are journalistic hacks, eagerly awaiting the thursday night rollovers to begin streaming in. Pierce bunch, haley wells, bethany ferraro, lauren thalheimer, alexandra kononenko, faison bunch, on a spring break from maryland, origan and new york, arrive at slatterys pub on capel street direct from the airport to become some of the first customers to enjoy a pint on good friday. Photograph: alan betson/ the irish times the first arrival is far less conspicuous. Shane mcshea is already digging into his breakfast and taking a sip of his first ever ( legally poured ) good friday pint when approached for a chat. He's a regular to the pub and often stops by for a bite on his way to work."

But india's supreme court has now dismissed the case against priya prakash varrier, the bbc reports. Varrier, 18, was dubbed india's \" national crush \" after a song from her upcoming film, oru adaar love, was released in february and a scene from the video, in which varrier winks at a male character in the movie, quickly went viral. A conservative muslim group argued that the wink was blasphemous, and police charged varrier, who then petitioned the high court. The complainants argued that the song, \" manikya malaraya poovi, \" made reference to the prophet mohammed's wife and was thus \" sacred, \" global news reports. But the supreme court ultimately dismissed the blasphemy case against varrier as well as the film's director and producer, finding that there had been no malicious intent. \" somebody in a film sings a song and you have no other job but to file a case? \" said the chief justice in the ruling, per ndtv. He also reportedly added, \" it's only a song! \" the film's planned march release was delayed until the case was resolved; it will now be released this month.",

Here's what you need to know: lifehacker has a lengthy explainer of \" everything... That actually mattered \" at \" made by google. \" that list includes google's new pixel phones, google assistant, google home, and chromecast ultra. On the other hand, cnet discusses everything \" we didn't get \" at \" made by google, \" including a tablet or laptop and andromeda — an operating system rumored to combine chrome and android. As for the aforementioned pixel phones, cnet reports they're google's \" best shot at making history again \" by taking on the iphone directly in a \" showdown between two of the world's most powerful tech titans. \" techcrunch focuses on google home, the company's version of amazon's echo that goes on sale tuesday. The wireless speaker picks up voice commands to give you the weather, play music, queue up youtube videos, and more. The verge gives a quick review of some of the other hardware announced by google, including the daydream view virtual reality headset and google wifi, google-made routers that can give maximum wifi coverage around the house and even let parents kick their kids off the internet when it's time for bed. Usa today reports that google assistant — which is integrated into both google home and the pixel phones — was the \" star \" of the event. Google ceo sundar pichai says he wants assistant to be a \" personal google for each and every user. \" finally, the verge concludes that the major takeaway of \" made by google \" was one of imitation: \" the overriding thing that google will try to sell us is its vision of integrating that multiplicity of physical gadgets and trinkets into its digital empire of software and services. Just like apple. \"",

        "summary": "More than a decade ago, scientists established a link between schizophrenia and the rare ability to tickle oneself. Now researchers in france have expanded on the findings, reporting in the journal consciousness and cognition that the behavior can be found not just in those with full-blown schizophrenia but in otherwise healthy people who score high on tests that look for schizophrenic-like traits. Examples of the latter might include a vivid imagination or mild paranoia, explains the the british psychological society's research digest. After studying 397 healthy students, 27 of whom scored highly on the schizotypal personality questionnaire and 27 students of whom scored very low, researchers observed all students being tickled by someone else with a feather and trying to tickle themselves with a feather. Those with the high scores weren't more ticklish in general, but they were more vulnerable to self-tickling. The results don't mean such people are doomed to develop schizophrenia, but \" they are consistent with the idea that the same brain processes ( involved in movement control and monitoring ) that may contribute to the symptoms experienced by patients with schizophrenia, may also contribute to schizophrenia-like beliefs and experiences in healthy people, \" says bps. It turns out that fmri scans have revealed most of us can't get away with tickling ourselves because our brains can predict what the sensation will be, and thus we are not fooled, reports medical daily. This is good; we're better able to distinguish between external threats such as an incoming jaguar's jaw and internal ones we have invented. That the ability to self-tickle is linked to, for instance, a higher rate of feeling controlled by outward forces may help psychologists better understand the brain mechanisms at play in a schizophrenic hallucination. ( scientists may have found the disease's genetic trigger. )",

The unexpected sensation makes us sensitive to this touch, but do we have the ability to shiver and giggle and tickle ourselves? according to a recent study, people with schizophrenic-like traits may be able to tickle themselves. A team of researchers in france, led by anne-laure lemaitre, analyzed a total of 397 healthy students including 27 students who scored highly on the schizotypal personality questionnaire, and 27 students who scored very low. The questionnaire included questions on unusual beliefs and strange perceptual experiences. Students also completed a questionnaire about whether they ever felt passive, or \"a robot or zombie without a will of your own. \" the two groups took part in different tickle tasks involving a brush. The students either tried to self-tickle their forearm with the brush, or had the researcher tickle them with it. Afterward, they rated how ticklish the brush movements felt on their arm. The findings published in the journal consciousness and cognition revealed those who scored high in schizotypal traits were no more ticklish in general than the low schizotypal students. However, the highly schizotypal students found the self-tickling experiment more ticklish than their counterparts. Moreover, they also found the self-tickling experiment was just as ticklish as when the researcher did the tickling, unlike the low",

As observed in a previous study involving psychiatric people with auditory hallucinations and/or passivity experiences our results showed that self-applied tactile stimulations are felt to be more ticklish by healthy individuals high in schizotypal traits. In contrast, there were no significant intergroup differences in the mean tickle rating in the externally-produced tickling condition. Furthermore, more successful self-tickling was associated with more frequent self-reports of unusual perceptual experiences ( such as supernatural experiences ) and passivity experiences in particular ( such as a feeling of being under the control of an outside force or power )."

According to prosecutors, smith, 24, was hosting upward of 100 people at his home last june when someone pulled a gun on the party's bartender, the san francisco chronicle reports. Smith decided it was time to break up the party — and toward that end, fired a.45 caliber handgun into the air. Far from taking the hint, the partygoers refused to leave; one instead pulled a knife and stabbed smith twice. Smith's then-teammate delanie walker grabbed smith's gun and fired it in the air again — only this time another person shot back, hitting two guests. When police arrived, they found five guns, including assault rifles, which are illegal in california, and high-capacity magazines. Smith is expected to surrender himself later this month; he's already on an indefinite leave of absence from the 49ers thanks to a drunk driving incident, according to espn.",

The santa clara county district attorney's office said in announcing the charges that smith, 24, is expected to surrender later this month. He is on an indefinite leave of absence from the defending nfc champion 49ers while undergoing treatment for substance abuse at an in-patient facility following a dui arrest sept. 20. \" we've been aware of the incident, the serious nature of it. We're all accountable for our actions, good and bad, \" 49ers coach jim harbaugh said wednesday. \" there's a process, due process, that will take place. I don't feel any need to comment further on it. \" when asked whether smith -- who set a franchise record with 19.5 sacks last season -- would play again this season, harbaugh said only, \" i don't have any need to further comment on it. \" on monday, the coach said he had traded a few text messages with smith, saying, \" heard that things are going very well, very positive reports back. \" if convicted, smith could face up to four years and four months in jail",
            "49er aldon smith hit with felony gun charges 49ers linebacker aldon smith had his off-field troubles deepen wednesday when he was charged with illegally possessing three assault weapons he bought over the counter in arizona - including two rifles he allegedly purchased a day before a road game in 2011 during his rookie season. Santa clara county prosecutors also charged smith with misdemeanor drunken driving wednesday in connection with a sept. 20 crash in san jose - an incident that reportedly prompted him to enter a treatment facility and step away from the team indefinitely. Smith, 24, is expected to surrender this month to face the felony gun charges filed in county superior court. If convicted, he could face a sentence ranging from no time in custody to four years and four months behind bars, authorities said. How the cases will affect smith on the field remains unknown. In the past, nfl players have returned to successful careers after convictions for criminal charges including drug dealing, obstruction of justice and dogfighting. The three gun counts leveled against smith stem from a party at his house in the foothills east of san jose during which he was stabbed and two people were shot. Investigators who responded to the violence and searched the rented home found the prohibited firearms, according to santa clara county prosecutors.

The santa clara county district attorney's office said in announcing the charges that smith, 24, is expected to surrender later this month. He is on an indefinite leave of absence from the defending nfc champion 49ers while undergoing treatment for substance abuse at an in-patient facility following a dui arrest sept. 20. \" we've been aware of the incident, the serious nature of it. We're all accountable for our actions, good and bad, \" 49ers coach jim harbaugh said wednesday. \" there's a process, due process, that will take place. I don't feel any need to comment further on it. \" when asked whether smith -- who set a franchise record with 19.5 sacks last season -- would play again this season, harbaugh said only, \" i don't have any need to further comment on it. \" on monday, the coach said he had traded a few text messages with smith, saying, \" heard that things are going very well, very positive reports back. \" if convicted, smith could face up to four years and four months in jail",
            "49er aldon smith hit with felony gun charges 49ers linebacker aldon smith had his off-field troubles deepen wednesday when he was charged with illegally possessing three assault weapons he bought over the counter in arizona - including two rifles he allegedly purchased a day before a road game in 2011 during his rookie season. Santa clara county prosecutors also charged smith with misdemeanor drunken driving wednesday in connection with a sept. 20 crash in san jose - an incident that reportedly prompted him to enter a treatment facility and step away from the team indefinitely. Smith, 24, is expected to surrender this month to face the felony gun charges filed in county superior court. If convicted, he could face a sentence ranging from no time in custody to four years and four months behind bars, authorities said. How the cases will affect smith on the field remains unknown. In the past, nfl players have returned to successful careers after convictions for criminal charges including drug dealing, obstruction of justice and dogfighting. The three gun counts leveled against smith stem from a party at his house in the foothills east of san jose during which he was stabbed and two people were shot. Investigators who responded to the violence and searched the rented home found the prohibited firearms, according to santa clara county prosecutors.

Four years later on march 24, a prosecutor announced mccullough had been wrongly convicted as he was actually 40 miles away from sycamore at the time of the crime, reports the daily chronicle. A new lead happened to arrive in the mail that same day. A typed, unsigned letter sent to illinois state's attorney richard schmack gave the name of a potential suspect, now the focus of an active investigation, reports cnn. Illinois state police say they've \" conducted an investigative workup \" and are trying to locate the individual. The revelation comes via a police affidavit in response to a public-records lawsuit from mccullough's son-in-law, who's asking for the case files to be released. What has been revealed about the case: a man who identified himself as \" johnny \" approached ridulph and a friend as they were playing outside on dec. 3, 1957, offered to give them piggyback rides, then disappeared with ridulph as her friend ran home to get mittens. Ridulph's body was found five months later near the iowa border. The suit specifically asks for any late 2010 files related to that friend, kathy chapman, \" in association with the investigation \" of mccullough. The affidavit states that releasing those 23 pages \" could impair [ the ] current investigation into the march 24th anonymous tip \" as they contain information that only chapman and the killer know.

A state bill cracking down on prostitution originally scrapped an exemption allowing undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes, but it was controversially restored after police testimony, the ap finds. Police won't say how often the exemption is used, but critics argue that it leaves the system wide open to abuse, noting that there have been many cases nationwide of police officers extorting sex from prostitutes. The chief of honolulu's vice squad argued the exemption is necessary because prostitutes and pimps are otherwise \" going to know exactly how far the undercover officer can and cannot go. \" a former fbi agent who trained vice squads around the country for 20 years, however, says he doesn't know of any other state or federal law that allows undercover officers to do what the hawaii law allows. \" isn't one of the biggest questions here just why, exactly, hawaii needs a exemption like this for their sex sting operations and none of the other law enforcement agencies in other states need one? \" asks rebecca rose at jezebel. \" they seem to be able to bust prostitutes and pimps in other states just fine without allowing their officers to engage in sexual acts. \"",

Nanjiani stars in the big sick, which tells the true story of how the pakistan-born muslim courted his wife, a white woman who ends up in a medically induced coma. Critics are raving, giving the michael showalter-directed film an impressive 97 % rating on rotten tomatoes. What they're saying: \" you're not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer, \" writes lindsey bahr at the ap, calling the big sick \" the must-see romantic comedy of the year. \" the film is \" sweet-natured, funny, and genuine, \" yet also \" entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre, \" she writes. Though nanjiani's wife remains a bit of a mystery, even minor characters are \" given distinct and memorable personalities, \" she adds. Nanjiani \" mines the comedy of cultural difference in the big sick with a light, sharp touch, \" helping to produce a movie that, despite its serious subject matter, remains \" very funny, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times. The film as a whole \" tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze, \" she adds. \" i fell hard. \" \" it's not your conventional romantic comedy \" — it's \" an immigrant story as much as it is one about falling in love \" — but that's what makes it \" so good, \" writes alison willmore at buzzfeed. The flick \" considers marriage not just as a relationship between two people but between two families, \" she writes. \" and, you might think after watching the big sick, why don't more rom-coms do this? \" joe morgenstern predicts it will be \" a cockeyed classic. \" the film takes on a lot but \" pulls it off with unquenchable humor and ineffable grace, \" he writes at the wall street journal. The dialogues is smart and funny, nanjiani has a \" sweetly soulful presence \" and zoe kazan, playing his wife, is brilliant, he adds.

            "Kabul, afghanistan — president hamid karzai of afghanistan on thursday ordered the release of dozens of prisoners accused of having american blood on their hands, saying there was not enough evidence to hold them and intensifying his showdown with obama administration officials after weeks of warnings that he risked losing american troop support. The move threatened to plunge relations to a new state of crisis even as a broader, long-term security agreement between the two countries has been held up for weeks. American officials have said that the prisoners to be released are dangerous taliban militants and that freeing them without trial would violate an agreement on detainees reached last year. That detention authority deal was considered a prerequisite to the security pact, known as the bilateral security agreement, which would allow for a continued american troop presence and aid past 2014. Still, just a week after some american officials insisted that such a prisoner release would prove that mr. Karzai could not be trusted to honor a security deal, the initial american response on thursday was cautious. Officials were critical of the release, but also careful to say that the move would not harm the security deal and that they were still trying to get a full accounting for the decision. \"we don't tie it to b.s.a., \" one obama administration official said, referring to the security agreement and noting that it was a \"separate deal, \" while speaking on the condition of anonymity. The suddenly tempered language from the administration raised the prospect that mr. Karzai had again called an american bluff, or that the americans might be sending mixed signals about the white house's intent. Mr. Karzai has been increasingly successful in pushing his demands past the point of american resistance in recent years, including the issue of detention. That has led some afghan officials familiar with his thinking to say that the afghan president has concluded that the united states was willing to bend as far as he wanted it to in order to keep troops here. That calculation was on clear display in november, when just a few days after giving his tentative approval to the troop agreement's wording, mr.

In a unanimous decision, the court ordered a lower court judge to reverse himself and deny the state's appeal of a freedom of information commission decision that ordered the items released. \"since the day of the massacre at sandy hook elementary school, the courant has worked to advance the understanding of how so heinous a tragedy could happen and we applaud today's decision as we feel these documents are necessary for us to tell a complete story in our reporting, \" said andrew julien, the courant's publisher and editor-in-chief. \"understanding what a mass killer was thinking not only paints a clearer picture of the individual, it helps us identify and understand red flags that could be part of a prevention formula for future mass shootings. \" the state attorney general's office declined comment tuesday. The state could ask the connecticut supreme court to reconsider or ask the u.s.",

        "summary": "Before you freak out that your dog may be suffering from canine conspecific coprophagy, know that it's probably not that serious — though you will likely be grossed out. Scientific american reports on a study in the veterinary medicine and science journal that looked at the result of two web-based surveys of about 3,000 dog owners in the us and canada, with a finding that 16 % of the owners said they'd witnessed their pups eating dog poop, either their own or that of other dogs, on at least six occasions. The second survey, which focused exclusively on poop-ingesting dogs, revealed that 62 % of those pets ate stool daily, while 38 % did so weekly. The uc-davis researchers couldn't pinpoint definitive links among the poop eaters, such as age, gender, diet, or how easily they'd been house trained. The scientists did find clues as to what separates feces feasters from those that don't partake. Coprophagic canines more often live with other dogs ( pointing to a possible social factor ), and they also tend to be \" greedy eaters \" that \" wolf down food. \" that 85 % of the poop eaters preferred fresh stool ( not more than two days old ) led researchers to speculate that the habit traces back to dogs ' wolf ancestors, which may have eaten parasite-infected poop near their dens before the parasite eggs hatched, per the washington post. Although dogs often suffer no ill effects from poop consumption, vets say some could be hit with diarrhea or be exposed to disease. As for trying to put a halt to the habit, dog owners in the study said trying products designed specifically for that task had a success rate of 2 % at best; behavior modification techniques didn't help much, either.

N+1 editor keith gessen had driven the truck from the ingram warehouse in pennsylvania earlier in the day, accompanied by an n+1 intern that he'd been \" mentoring. \" there were six pallets. As usual, the issue's contributors had been invited to the box-unloading party, and so we staggered, box-laden, past the likes of little ben kunkel, wearing his noticeably-heeled boots even for this athletic activity. Probably more people came later for the beer-drinking part of the evening. But we missed that part because, when the truck was fully unloaded, we hopped into it with keith to return it to the budget lot in brooklyn.

At 6: 56pm, children were still allowed to sit in the driver's seat; by 7: 03pm, the captain was navigating whitecaps and making a hand-held radio call that's inaudible on video. At 7: 05pm, the bilge alarm was sounding to indicate water being pumped from the boat. With water occasionally splashing into the passenger compartment, the video comes to an end before 7: 09pm. As survivors have said, ride the ducks likely knew the forecast because the company altered its 70-minute itinerary to see the water first. That jibes with the video, which shows an individual boarding briefly at 6: 28pm to announce they would start on the water. At 6: 29pm, the captain said something about checking the weather radar before leaving.

        "summary": "The jury may be out on intelligent extraterrestrial life, but this we know: we are not alone. At least, we are surrounded by our own junk. In an effort to raise awareness about the dangers of the hundreds of millions of pieces of debris currently orbiting planet earth, an interactive art project backed by london's royal astronomical society called adrift is allowing us lowly earthlings to adopt a little piece of space junk and let it tweet at us ominously every time it passes overhead, reports motherboard. Choose from one of three tagged objects: the vanguard i, the first solar-powered satellite launched by the us in 1958 and the oldest object still in orbit; the suitsat, a russian spacesuit full of trash that was ejected from the international space station in 2006; and a piece of fengyun-1c, a chinese weather satellite intentionally destroyed by china via a missile in 2007. \" tackling the problem of space debris is one of humankind's greatest environmental challenges, but is also perhaps the one that is the least known, \" hugh lewis at the university of southampton tells phys.org. For starters, even a millimeter-sized speck of junk can inflict damage at high velocity. Get up to one centimeter and it could disable a satellite's critical flight system, the european space agency reported in may. And there are nearly 30,000 pieces larger than 10 centimeters, each of which could shatter a spacecraft. It's even possible that a chain of collisions could increase the amount of space debris in orbit exponentially, a potential called the kessler syndrome. So go ahead, adopt a little piece of the problem so that you can be reminded of it every time it passes by. ( here are five weird examples of space junk falling to earth. )",

Garden grove resident marcos gurrola, 42, has been charged with shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Click here to watch a video about the shots fired at fashion island. Police say gurrola stood in the macy's parking lot and fired about 50 rounds from a semiautomatic handgun into the air, stopping to reload the weapon with multiple magazines. Gurrola is a licensed security guard, according to state records, whose firearm permit expired in 2001. As shots rang into the air saturday, holiday shoppers scrambled for their lives. The weekend included what is usually one of the busiest retail days of the year. Some shoppers sunday expected heavier crowds just nine days before christmas. Garden grove residents cesar and holly morales, both 31, said they noticed many empty parking spaces in one garage. \" i was kind of a little bit curious to see how people were going to react, \" cesar morales said. \" just walking in we tried to take notice of what security measures were in place. Everyone is just going about their business. \" holly morales said she felt more protective of their two children, who attended a chargers game sunday with a relative. \" maybe if that shooting didn't happen on friday and then yesterday, i wouldn't be so nervous, \" she said.

However, film studios and record labels are cautious about the growth of amazon. Not only does the online retailer want to sell its products for a lower price than they do, but there are concerns that online platforms do not allow a film studio or record label to promote their products in the same way as a high street store.

            "A message from the amazon books team dear readers, just ahead of world war ii, there was a radical invention that shook the foundations of book publishing. It was the paperback book. This was a time when movie tickets cost 10 or 20 cents, and books cost $ 2.50. The new paperback cost 25 cents — it was ten times cheaper. Readers loved the paperback and millions of copies were sold in just the first year. With it being so inexpensive and with so many more people able to afford to buy and read books, you would think the literary establishment of the day would have celebrated the invention of the paperback, yes? nope. Instead, they dug in and circled the wagons. They believed low cost paperbacks would destroy literary culture and harm the industry ( not to mention their own bank accounts ). Many bookstores refused to stock them, and the early paperback publishers had to use unconventional methods of distribution — places like newsstands and drugstores. The famous author george orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if \" publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them. \""

        "summary": "Shrews have a bonkers and heretofore undiscovered ability that gizmodo states sounds like \" some cruel, recurring witch's curse \" but that scientists say is most likely a survival mechanism. According to a study published monday in current biology, the wild common shrew shrinks its skull — by up to 20 % — during the winter before regrowing it in the spring. And that's not all. Nature reports shrews also shrink other parts of their bodies, including their spine, heart, lungs, and spleen. Their brain mass drops by 20 % to 30 %, and overall body mass can shrink by more than 17 % during the winter, according to the guardian. As gizmodo puts it, it's \" obviously awesome and weird as hell. \" scientists had noted the discrepancy in shrew head size between winter and summer as far back as the early 1900s, but the common explanation was that large-headed shrews were simply dying off in the winter. The real reason appears to be much stranger. Researchers caught, x-rayed, tagged, and released numerous german shrews, which live 14 months or so on average. They ended up recapturing and x-raying 12 shrews in three key seasons. They found the skulls, brains, and bodies of those shrews actually shrank and regrew depending on the season. This could be a way to conserve energy when food is scarce as \" the brain is energetically so expensive, \" biologist javier lazaro says. Researchers now hope to discover if wintertime shrews are cognitively impaired compared to their summertime selves. ( meanwhile, the brains in spain are small because of rain. )",

            "The animals reduce the size of their brains and skulls as winter approaches and regrow them in the spring, say researchers they use echolocation to explore their habitat and produce an unpleasant scent to avoid being eaten by cats. But the common shrew has another survival trick: as winter approaches, its skull shrinks and then regrows in the spring. Dubbed \"dehnel's phenomenon \" after the scientist who first spotted the effect, the shrinkage has previously been studied by looking at the skulls of shrews that died at different times of year. But since the changes weren't followed in the same animals, it was not clear whether other factors might be responsible, such as smaller shrews being better able to survive the winter months. Now researchers say they have finally shown the phenomenon is real. \"now for sure we can say this is happening [ within ] individuals – we can really talk about the shrinkage and regrowth, \" said javier lázaro, co-author of the research from the max planck institute for ornithology. The phenomenon, he adds, appears to be an unusual way to prepare for the harsh months of winter. \"these animals cannot hibernate [ and ] they cannot migrate and they live in a very seasonal environment – so they need some alternative strategy to deal with winter, \" said lázaro, adding the shrews need to",

New research shows that the skull of at least one variety of shrew actually shrivels in size every winter. The research team, led by scientists at germany's max planck institute for ornithology, not only discovered that the shrews sport this surreal, skull-wilting ability, but that they shrink their skulls repeatedly and on a seasonal cycle. The shrews'skulls shrink during the winter, but then miraculously grow back nearly all their original mass in the spring and summer, according to new research published today in the journal current biology. This sets the shrews up to do it all over again at the end of the year, which honestly sounds like they've been saddled with some cruel, recurring witch's curse. There was some initial inkling that a seasonal pattern was at play. Scientists had previously described an odd relationship between skull size and season in some shrew and weasel species, where winter was full of individuals with smaller skulls, and summer was dominated by animals with comparatively voluminous noggins. This observation — termed \"the dehnel phenomenon \""

As scientific american explains, that's the name of a newly discovered nerve receptor that apparently has one job — to make us itch. Or at least to make mice itch. When johns hopkins researchers turned off the receptors in mice and then exposed them to itchy stuff, the mice did not scratch. \" our current study has shown experimentally for the first time the existence of itch-specific nerves, \" says one of the researchers. Assuming this is found to apply to humans as well, the baltimore sun notes a big potential upside: some life-saving drugs have a side effect of chronic itching, so much so that people stop taking them. The finding raises the possibility of developing drugs to block the itch receptors.",

They have even wondered whether itching is mostly psychological ( just think about bed bugs for a minute ). Now a study rules out these possibilities by succeeding where past attempts have failed: a group of neuroscientists have finally isolated a unique type of nerve cell that makes us itch and only itch. In previous research, neuroscientists liang han and xinzhong dong of johns hopkins university and their colleagues determined that some sensory neurons with nerve endings in the skin have a unique protein receptor on them called mrgpra3. They observed under a microscope that chemicals known to create itching caused these neurons to generate electrical signals but that painful stimuli such as hot water or capsaicin, the potent substance in hot peppers, did not. In the new study published in nature neuroscience, the researchers used genetic engineering to selectively kill the entire population of mrgpra3 neurons in mice while leaving all the other sensory neurons intact. These mice no longer scratched themselves when exposed to itchy substances or allergens, but they showed no changes at all in responding to touch or pain-producing stimulation.

It was the first \" execution \" of its kind by the islamic state ( is ) group in syria, which has proclaimed the establishment of an islamic \" caliphate \" straddling syria and iraq. \" the islamic state carried out its first sentence of death by stoning against a woman in tabaqa, accusing her of adultery, \" said the britain-based observatory, referring to a town in raqa province, most of which is under is control. An activist in the province confirmed the report, and said the stoning took place in a public square in the tabaqa market area on thursday evening. \" this is the first time that this has happened here, \" added abu ibrahim. A second activist in raqa, hadi salameh, said the woman was reportedly in her thirties, but that few details were known about her except that she was killed after sentencing by an is religious court. \" the situation is unbearable. Stoning is the worst punishment history has known. A quick death is more merciful, \" salameh told afp via the internet, using a pseudonym for security reasons. \" the woman's family did not know the sentence",
            "Beirut ( ap ) — a cleric read the verdict before the truck came and dumped a large pile of stones near the municipal garden. Jihadi fighters then brought in the woman, clad head to toe in black, and put her in a small hole in the ground. When residents gathered, the fighters told them to carry out the sentence: stoning to death for the alleged adulteress.

Using 16 years of data from the satellite-based lightning imaging sensor ( lis ), scientists determined lake maracaibo averages about 233 lightning flashes per square kilometer every year; during its peak rainy season, it can experience 28 strokes per minute. The researchers published their findings in february, and nasa discussed the results in a press release this week. The previous record-holder, africa's congo basin, averaged approximately 160 flashes per square kilometer per year, the international business times reports. Lake maracaibo's high amount of lightning activity is due to its \" unique geography and climatology. \" various breezes meet over the warm lake waters, causing thunderstorms around 297 nights a year. Despite being unseated from the top spot, africa still has more lightning than any other continent. The most lightning-heavy spot in the us is the florida everglades near orangetree, florida. But it's doesn't rank very high overall: it's no. 14 on north america's list, and 122nd globally. \" better understanding of lightning activity around the world enables policy makers, government agencies, and other stakeholders to make more informed decisions related to weather and climate, \" says richard blakeslee, an lis project scientist for nasa.

Officials were called to a mobile home in amarillo around 5am monday after an individual arrived and found a family of 10 sick. Officials found one child dead at the scene while three others died at a hospital. After ruling out a carbon monoxide leak, they discovered a family member had sprayed an aluminum phosphide pesticide beneath the home to get rid of mice, then sprayed it with water in an attempt to get rid of an odor on sunday. The combination created \" a very lethal chemical \" known as toxic phosphine gas, which seeped into the home overnight, a fire official tells amarillo globe-news. As phosphine gas can cause respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, when the lungs fill with fluid, aluminum phosphide pesticide is \" only sold to people that have a license to apply it, \" another official tells kfda. In this case, however, it appears to have been purchased on the \" black market \" by a family member who \" didn't know enough about the chemical. \" autopsies are expected to be performed tuesday on the deceased, identified as siblings felipe balderas, 7; johnnie balderas, 9; josue balderas, 11; and yasmeen balderas, 17, per klew.

According to reuters, a government source says the officers were specifically targeted in the attack on the champs-elysees. A witness describes the gunman firing multiple shots with a machine gun, and a government spokesperson calls the gun used a \" war weapon. \" the gunman was shot and killed as he attempted to run away, the telegraph reports. While a interior ministry spokesperson says it's too early to say if the shooting was a terror attack, prosecutors have opened a terror investigation, and french president francois hollande is \" convinced the motive is likely to be terrorism. \" the islamic state is reportedly claiming responsibility. The apparent name of the shooter was known to security services. An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for a second suspect. Early reports of a second officer dying, as well as reports of a second shooting, were incorrect. Abc news reports president trump responded to the news of the shooting with condolences for france. \" what can you say? it just never ends, \" the president said.

Sarah park, per the ap, explaining the effects of rat lungworm disease. According to abc news, the worm lives in the lungs of rats, but its larvae are expelled in the rats ' feces and infect slugs and snails, which in turn pass the larvae on to humans. The larvae can survive for months in humans, growing into worms an inch long. The parasite can cause a rare form of meningitis, which comes along with serious headaches, vomiting, temporary facial paralysis, and more. There's no treatment for the disease, and it can cause permanent brain damage, though it is rarely fatal. Six cases of the disease have been reported on maui in the past three months. The island had only two cases in the decade before that, and the entire state of hawaii averages just 10 cases per year. Park says officials are \" concerned that something has changed \" to increase the risk on maui, hawaii news now reports. Officials encourage people to wash their fruits and veggies well before eating and to avoid eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs. According to live science, the parasite has historically been found in southeast asia and the pacific islands, but it's recently been expanding to the us, africa, and beyond.

The tunnel below the site around 30 miles away from mexico city was discovered in 2003 after having been sealed for around 1,800 years, and remote-controlled robots explored it before human archaeologists got to work, reports reuters. Among the artifacts uncovered: obsidian blades, seeds, shells, carved stone, and jewelry. A large offering found below the \" temple of the plumed serpent \" has led researchers to believe that three chambers, which have yet to be excavated and sit just beyond the items, could be the tombs of the city's mysterious rulers. \" because this is one of the most sacred places in all teotihuacan, we believe that it could have been used for the rulers to... Acquire divine endowment allowing them to rule on the surface, \" the project leader tells the ap. No written records of the inhabitants of the once-dominant city — whose name means \" abode of the gods \" in the aztec language — exist, and no remains of its rulers have ever been found, leaving its leadership structure unknown. Remains could indicate, for example, if rule was hereditary, notes the bbc. To date, the team has excavated about 2 feet into the chambers; getting all the way through is expected to take a minimum of a year.

        "summary": "A scandal involving alleged underage sex, suicide, and possible murder is exploding within the oakland police department. The san jose mercury news reports it all started when irma huerta lopez killed herself with a gun belonging to her husband, officer brendan o ' brien, in 2014. Huerta lopez's family believes o ' brien, who was suffering from ptsd and drinking heavily, killed her. The coroner's office found her death suspicious, but it was ultimately ruled a suicide, according to the east bay express. Then last september, o ' brien killed himself. In a suicide note, he reportedly admitted to exchanging inappropriate messages with the underage daughter of a police dispatcher, which damaged his marriage, cbs sf bay area reports. He also named three other officers involved with the woman, including a sergeant he claimed had sex with her. An internal investigation into the note's allegations — what the police chief calls \" an unfortunate series of off-duty incidents \" — went nowhere. But in march, a judge ordered a new investigation over \" irregularities. \" sources tell cbs multiple officers admitted to lying during that first investigation. And the woman, no longer underage, has recently been posting details of the alleged affairs on facebook under the name celeste guap. \" the only officer i ever messed with underage is sadly gone now, so i don't know why this is still being brought up, \" the mercury news quotes a post from wednesday as saying. Three officers were put on leave this week in connection with the alleged sexual misconduct. And oakland's mayor called for the district attorney's office to open its own investigation into the alleged misconduct, as well as both o ' brien's and huerta lopez's suicides.",
