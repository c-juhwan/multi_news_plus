During an msnbc town hall on wednesday, rubio said he's \" not looking to be anyone's vice president \" and that he would \" absolutely \" say no to donald trump, who had said earlier in the day that he would definitely consider rubio, if he dropped out this week. Rubio also shot down the idea of teaming up with ted cruz to defeat trump, describing it as \" house of cards stuff. \" \" those kinds of things rarely work, \" he told the town hall. \" i can just tell you i ' m a candidate for president. \" during the town hall, rubio admitted that he was ashamed of how his attacks on trump had descended into playground taunts about tiny hands, the new york times reports. \" my kids were embarrassed by it and i, you know, if i had to do it again i wouldn't, \" he said. Rubio — who failed to pick up a single delegate in tuesday's gop votes — said he felt \" very positive \" about winning florida on march 15, though polls show him well behind trump in the winner-take-all state.

According to tax records, the jared fogle healthy lifestyle nationwide school grant program spent an average of just $ 73,000 annually between 2009 and 2013 and never issued a grant. This despite fogle's promise to give schools and community organizations $ 2 million to battle the condition that so affected his own life. \" my goal is to help children avoid the physical and emotional hardships i went through living with obesity, \" he said at the time, per a press release. The 2008 release outlined a plan to offer $ 20,000 grants to up to 50 schools ( for a total of $ 1 million ) in that same year. Seems 60 % of the non-profit's documented expenditures went to executive director russell taylor, 43 ( now jailed on child pornography charges ), and 26 % went who knows where. What's more, records show that his organization hadn't paid a $ 5 yearly registration fee to the state of indiana since 2008, when the non-profit was slated to begin operations. In fact, indiana dissolved the jared fogle healthy lifestyle nationwide school grant program three years ago, although it's still recognized by the irs. \" as with a lot of celebrities, the charity appears to be more about image-enhancement than charitable deeds, \" says a charity analyst. Fogle, who has apparently pleaded guilty to child porn charges, was outed by an ex-journalist who secretly recorded him for years.",

Hbo debuted its first teaser trailer for game change, the film due in march that's based on the mark halperin-john heilemann book about the 2008 presidential election. Neither ed harris as john mccain nor woody harrelson as top adviser steve schmidt sound much like their real-life counterparts, notes david jackson in usa today, but moore's palin is spot-on: numerous publications including people, new york, the huffington post, and jezebel are fairly impressed. Moore's palin is also scary. Some observations: \"it's nice to finally see mccain's decision to unleash palin on america set to tense, frightening music, just like it is in our nightmares, \" writes margaret hartmann on jezebel. Jon bershad concurs: \"the clip is edited to treat julianne moore's palin basically like the shark in jaws, \" he writes on mediaite. \"seriously, the only way this thing could be more on the nose would be if they played a record scratch right before she started talking and showed a dog reaction shot right after. Seriously, woody harrelson even gets in a 'spielberg face ' look of awed horror when he glimpses the candidate. \" last but not least, from jim newell on gawker: \"this clip suggests that, well, sarah palin may not be portrayed very nicely? it's a dark, frightening affair, backed by ominous music, all serving as a build-up to palin's speech at the republican convention, as though it's the first wave in a global alien invasion or perhaps the dawn of a nuclear winter.

No one knows what babylonians listened to — the tunes are long-lost — but singer/composer stef conner says she relied on the natural stresses and rhythms in babylonian poetry. \" we have the text of lots of poems from ancient mesopotamia, and it seems likely that some were originally songs of a sort, \" she tells slate. \" i thought it would be exciting if we could listen to these poems as they were meant to be heard. \" so she teamed up with andy lowings, who had already organized a project to construct a replica golden lyre that mesopotamians would have played 4,550 years ago. Lowings \" asked me to compose music for the lyre, and last year we recorded the result — an album of contemporary music, sung in babylonian, called the flood, \" conner says. \" you can't perfectly reconstruct a mesopotamian song in this way. But i think if you could go back 3,000 years and play it to babylonians, they would say: ' oh, that sounds a bit like our music. ' \" so what are the songs about? they cover everything from insults to come-ons to eroticism, romance, lullabies, and misery. One tells the story of a woman who \" married a malicious husband \" and \" bore a malicious son, \" then found that \" an unhappy heart was assigned to me. \" a preview is available on conner's website, and itunes will release it next month.

        "summary": "In a study of nearly 100,000 norwegian children, those whose mothers reported having a fever or two at some point during their pregnancy were 1.3 times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, according to a report published tuesday in molecular psychiatry. Medical news today reports approximately 1.5 % of us children have asd. But the study found the rate was closer to 3.7 % for children whose mothers had a fever during pregnancy, the washington post reports.. The timing and number of fevers appear to play a part. According to a press release, a fever in the second trimester raised the odds of asd by 40 %; three or more fevers after the 12th week of pregnancy raised them by 300 %. The study out of columbia university gives more credence to a theory that infectious agents lead to immune responses in pregnant women, which in turn lead to issues with brain development in their fetuses. Researchers say it's not the initial infection but the fever response that impacts brain development, possibly through molecules created by the woman's immune system making their way into the fetus ' neurological system. Interestingly, the study found no cases of asd among the children of mothers who took ibuprofen for their fevers during pregnancy. However, there were too few women in the study who reported taking ibuprofen to say anything for sure. ( new hope for diagnosing autism in babies. )",

Two sources confirmed to the ap that sadler made the insensitive remark, leaving them \" shocked and stunned. \" the white house didn't dispute reports of the comments, but it said in a statement: \" we respect senator mccain's service to our nation and he and his family are in our prayers during this difficult time. \" mccain, 81, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer last year and is being treated in arizona. Wife cindy mccain fired back at sadler, tweeting: \" may i remind you my husband has a family, 7 children and 5 grandchildren. \" but sadler wasn't the only one making offensive remarks about mccain on thursday, the washington post reports. Fox business network host charles payne apologized after a guest, retired air force lt. Gen. Thomas mcinerney, claimed that mccain's time as a pow in vietnam showed that torture works. \" that's why they call him'songbird john, ' \" mcinerney said, though there's no evidence that mccain betrayed his country. Payne tweeted an apology for the guest's \" false and derogatory remark. \" ( mccain doesn't want president trump at his funeral. )",

Ada guan, 23, was flying to japan on air canada when she got moved to first class \" somewhere over russia, \" as the cbc puts it, because of incredible stomach pains. Boyfriend wesley branch comforted her as her contractions became stronger, until what was going on suddenly hit, both metaphorically and literally. \" she said, ' babe, something just fell out of me, can you check?

Unluckily, the new parents were hit with around $ 2,000 in medical bills when they landed and went to a hospital in japan, so they've started a gofundme site. While one vancouver obstetrician says it's rare to get all the way to labor without having a clue you're pregnant — \" it's pretty hard to deny a large mass in the front of your abdomen, \" she tells the cbc — others point out it's possible if women are obese, have irregular periods, or in essence ignore the pregnancy for psychological reasons. \" it doesn't make any sense, but we're very happy, \" branch says.

No arguments were actually heard, however. The defense argued that the trial should be open to the public, a request the judge denied. Charges were then read, and the trial adjourned until thursday, when opening arguments will take place. But first, the court will hear a defense motion seeking to move the trial, with the defense arguing that the accused can't get a fair trial in the city the alleged rape took place in, the telegraph reports. But even as this trial begins, another brutal gang-rape is grabbing headlines. Yesterday, a 26-year-old nurse was reportedly abducted, drugged, and gang-raped, with her attackers allegedly filming the entire affair, the times of india reports. She was found semi-conscious by the side of the road, and admitted to the hospital. The incident took place in patiala, the same state where a gang-rape victim killed herself last month. These cases have made rape culture a hot-button issue in india, prompting the government to create six fast-track courts to handle crimes against women.",

Both china and south korea lay claim to a submerged rock between the countries — one that's the subject of korean legend. In english, it's called socotra rock. Koreans call it ieodo, while the chinese know it as the suyan rock. China's newly established air-defense zone covers the rock — as does south korea's planned air-defense zone expansion. China says it \" regrets \" south korea's decision to expand, reuters reports, though a chinese official says the rock itself doesn't pose a problem: \" there currently does not exist a territorial dispute between china and south korea on this issue. \" still, china said no when korea asked it to leave socotra out of its air-defense zone, quartz notes. The rock sits some 178 miles from china and 92 miles from south korea. It's 171 miles from japan, which isn't trying to claim it. All those distances fit within the 230 offshore miles the un designates as a country's \" exclusive economic zone. \" but the un also says countries can't claim underwater rocks, and socotra is 15 feet under the surface. Still, south korea has a maritime research station positioned on it. Some believe socotra holds natural gas and mineral resources. Meanwhile, korean tales hold that dead fishermen's spirits live there, and that if its top is spotted among the waves, there's trouble ahead.",

The carrera gt was going between 80mph and 93mph when rodas lost control and crashed in a 45mph zone, a los angeles county sheriff's department spokesperson said yesterday, according to nbc los angeles. Neither walker nor rodas had alcohol or drugs in their system, the spokesperson added; both were wearing seatbelts and the airbags deployed normally. Investigators also revealed that the car's exhaust system had been modified in a way that could allow it to hit higher speeds; its tires were nine years old — five years past the time the owner's manual suggests changing them, but cnn notes that the car was mostly displayed, not driven; and its left rear brake rotor was worn below manufacturer specifications, but that was determined not to have contributed to the accident. Investigators also noted that there was no evidence to support the theory that rodas may have been racing another vehicle.",

Zakarin also points out, however, that burnett has donated to democratic candidates — including obama.",

Co-chair harvey weinstein, for one, predicted rock would \" annihilate \" hollywood, per the hollywood reporter ). This anticipation was spawned by the #oscarssowhite controversy, a protest not only against the fact that nominations in the award show's major categories don't adequately represent people of color or those in the lgbt community, but also that the film industry overall is lacking in its opportunities for minorities. And rock addressed the issue as soon as the opening scenes from this year's nominated films came to a close. \" man, i counted at least 15 black people in that montage! \" he exclaimed, per the washington post. He explained that he didn't boycott the show as some black luminaries were doing because the \" last thing i need is to lose another job to kevin hart \" and that \" jada [ pinkett smith ] boycotting the oscars is like me boycotting rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited! \" he also wondered aloud why there hadn't been as big of a protest during the previous 87 award shows. His conclusion? black people have had bigger things to worry about. \" we were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer, \" he said. \" when your grandmother's swinging from the tree, it's really hard to care about best documentary foreign short. \" but he turned serious as he summed up the issue in hollywood: \" we want opportunity.

Jpmorgan is accused of turning a blind eye to the $ 20 billion scam, with executives raising concerns internally but continuing to serve as his banker and failing to alert authorities. The settlement with federal prosecutors will include a deferred-prosecution agreement and the government plans to use a sizable chunk of the penalties to compensate madoff's victims, sources say. Jpmorgan chief executive jamie dimon has called the case \" meritless \" but signaled the bank will pay up to get the matter behind it. One person who predicted the payout: bernie madoff. The bank \" doesn't have a chance in hell of not coming up with a big settlement, \" he told the financial times in 2011 from the federal prison where he is serving a 150-year sentence. Five former madoff employees, meanwhile, are on trial in manhattan for their part in the fraud. Madoff's former finance chief frank dipascali, who is working with prosecutors, testified earlier this week about the day he learned that the shady deals they had worked on for decades were part of a ponzi scheme that was about to collapse, bloomberg reports. \" he turned to me and said, crying, ' i ' m at the end of my rope, ' \" dipascali told the court, saying that when he expressed confusion, his boss shouted, \" i don't have any more goddamned money — don't you get it? the whole goddamn thing is a fraud! \"",

        "summary": "Ace history students might remember that hannibal led his carthagian army across the alps around 200bc and soundly defeated the roman army in one of the most epic military maneuvers of all time. But not even actual historians can tell you with any degree of certainty where hannibal crossed those mountains — until now. Researchers think they've solved the mystery after finding a \" mass animal deposition, \" they write in a press release out of queen's university in belfast. In other words, they found a lot of manure, they're nearly certain it's from horses, and they can date it to the time that hannibal was making his crossing with 15,000 horses, not to mention 37 elephants and 30,000 troops. The answer to future trivia questions: hannibal crossed at a pass known as col de traversette, near grenoble in france and turin in italy. The locale has been floated as a possibility previously, but without proof. The search team did their digging near a pond, \" one of the few in the area that could have been used for watering large numbers of animals, \" writes researcher chris allen in the conversation. The terrain also generally matches the landscape described in ancient history texts. Further genetic testing is being done to confirm that the manure is from horses, and scientists also plan to conduct a radar survey to find evidence of humans and the famous elephants as well. \" my sniffer tells me some will turn up, coins, belt buckles, sabres, you name it, \" study leader bill mahaney tells the guardian. This wouldn't have been the easiest route for hannibal's army, but allen writes that he likely picked it because he was afraid of being ambushed on easier routes. The findings have been published in archaeometry.",

But then something went very wrong, the new york times reports. The hunley proceeded to sink, killing its 8-man crew and sinking to the bottom of charleston's harbor. The submarine had encountered disaster before, killing 17 crewmembers in two training accidents, history reports, but this time it stayed down until being found in 1995 and raised and returned to harbor in 2000. The discovery team analyzed the vessel, marveling at its engineering and graceful lines. But what on earth caused it to sink? one theory notes that while the sub's torpedo sat at the end of a 17-foot spar, the vessel may have been only 20 feet away when the explosive went off, sending the hunley and its unconscious crew to the bottom.",

            "The following article is entirely the opinion of toni matthews and does not reflect the views of the inquisitr. Dr. Kristen lindsey has been fond of \"killing things or trying to kill things \" for some time, as her old blog reveals. After completing a recent post about lindsey, i was referred to a 2011 blog she maintained called life writings from the lazy boot. It appears she abandoned it a short while before she began her journey to become a licensed veterinarian. The final blog post is about her grandfather, but it's what is written beneath her blog post that's particularly chilling. At least, when one considers the photo lindsey took of herself with a dead cat. \"current interests: living my days to the fullest, finding the meaning of happiness, killing things or trying to kill things ( animals, a full glass of whiskey, hangovers,",
            "The texas state board of veterinary medical examiners has opened an investigation into the brenham veterinarian who was fired after bragging on facebook about killing a cat with a bow and arrow, according to the american veterinary medical association. The board, which issues veterinarians a license to practice in texas, has said it is aware of the incident but will not confirm or deny whether there is an investigation. Kristen lindsey was fired friday by the washington animal clinic. The austin county sheriff's office is investigating her for possible animal cruelty. The amva released a statement about the incident. It reads, in part: \"we, too, were shocked and appalled by this image when we saw it.

A team of scientists that once laid out nine \" planetary boundaries \" that should not be crossed says humans have managed to cross four of them already, reports reuters. The bad grades come in the categories of rapid species loss, deforestation, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous ( think fertilizer ) flowing into oceans. We're still ok on ozone depletion, ocean acidification, freshwater use, microscopic particles in the atmosphere, and chemical pollution, write the 18 international researchers in science. But they warn that the long-term trend — going back to 1950 and the start of rapid economic growth around the world — doesn't bode well. \" for the first time in human history, we need to relate to the risk of destabilizing the entire planet, \" says one of the authors. Bottom line? lead author will steffen tells the washington post that at our current pace, the \" earth system \" could unravel in anywhere from \" decades out to a century. \" the researchers concede their boundaries are squishy, and the post illustrates an example involving carbon dioxide levels: the boundary we weren't supposed to cross was 350 parts per million. But we're now well past that and into a \" zone of uncertainty \" that extends to 450ppm. And after that? \" the unknown — planetary conditions unfamiliar to us. \" steffen tells scientific american that the boundaries and our understanding of them continue to evolve, and the next step is to get a better handle on how they interact with each other.

What a press release calls the \" largest study of opioid deaths \" was published tuesday in the american journal of psychiatry. Researchers started with 13,089 adults who were under age 65, in the medicaid program, and died of an opioid overdose between the years 2001 and 2007. A review of their medical histories and filled prescriptions resulted in a couple of big takeaways. As bloomberg puts it, the numbers confirm \" america's opioid epidemic began at the pharmacy. \" the researchers found about two-thirds ( 61.5 % ) of those who died had been diagnosed with non-cancer chronic pain and prescribed an opioid. Many had also been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and lead investigator dr. Mark olfson sees two lessons in that. First, that there's an opportunity for \" clinical intervention, \" whereby clinics that treat chronic pain or mental health issues could pair those services with substance abuse treatment. Second, this group was more likely to have filled prescriptions for both opioids and anti-anxiety benzodiazepines; the combination promotes respiratory depression, \" the unusually slow and shallow breathing that is the primary cause of death in most fatal opioid overdoses, \" says olfson. Doctors should avoid prescribing the two together. ( read about how opioid patients ' urine became \" liquid gold. \" )",

            "It's been conventional wisdom for some time now that america's opioid epidemic began at the pharmacy. Now there are numbers that put any doubt to rest. More than half of all people who succumbed to an overdose between 2001 to 2007 were chronic pain sufferers who filled an opioid prescription and sometimes even saw a doctor in the month before they died. Only 4 percent were ever diagnosed as having an abuse problem, said dr. Mark olfson, one of five researchers who conducted a massive study of the crisis and its causes for columbia university medical center. The findings of the new study, published tuesday in the american journal of psychiatry, split the epidemic into two groups: those who were diagnosed with chronic pain and those who weren't. In the year before they died, about two-thirds of those studied were diagnosed with chronic pain and prescribed an opioid. ( many would also get a prescription for anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines, which can make for a deadly combination. ) the other third among those who died had no diagnosed chronic pain but became addicted to opioids in another way. \"those are different populations, \" olfson said in a telephone interview. \"understanding those things puts us in a better position to combat the epidemic. \" one out of every six emergency room visits in the u.s.

The study, led by researchers at columbia university medical center ( cumc ), is the first to determine the proportion of those who died of an opioid overdose with chronic pain. The findings were published online today in the american journal of psychiatry.

The researchers analyzed clinical diagnoses and filled medication prescriptions for more than 13,000 adults in the medicaid program who died of an opioid overdose. During the last year of life, more than half of these individuals had been diagnosed with chronic pain. Many had also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. \" the frequent occurrence of treated chronic pain and mental health conditions among overdose decedents underscores the importance of offering substance use treatment services in clinics that treat patients with chronic pain and mental health problems.

Meanwhile, the fbi today provided the most detailed account to date of the attack on the naval reserve center that left five service members dead. It began when abdulazeez smashed his car through the center's gate and exchanged gunfire with a service member, reports the washington post. The latter fired several rounds but was unable to stop abdulazeez, reports nbc news. After entering the building, he fatally shot one victim inside and killed four others outside as they were trying to climb a fence from the motor pool area. Amid the chaos, two service members \" attempted to provide cover \" and help others escape, says the fbi's ed reinhold. \"the legacy that day is one of valor, \" says maj. Gen. Paul brier, commander of the 4th marine division. \"i can tell you that our marines reacted the way you would expect.

Mansour says it is time to \" stop our industry of making tyrants \" and end \" worship of the ruler, \" calling for new elections for a \" brighter future. \" he called on egyptians to continue protesting as he saluted the military, to applause, calling it \" the conscience of the nation and the guarantor of its security and safety. \" so what can we expect from mansour? his court predecessor isn't sure: \" i can't attest to whether or not he will be up to the responsibility, \" maher el beheiry tells the wall street journal. But the head of a judges ' organization, abdullah fathi, calls mansour \" a pillar of the judiciary \" who is \" known in judicial circles for his integrity and his impartiality. \" fathi says mansour helped make key rulings against hosni mubarak and morsi — who appointed him.

As per a study published in pediatrics, scientists studied more than 1,000 7- and 8-year-olds living in two areas of sweden and found that children in households where dishes were hand-washed had a 40 % lower risk of developing allergies such as eczema or asthma, compared to those with dishwashers, livescience reports. The results appear to be another notch for the \" hygiene hypothesis, \" which contends kids in developed countries often live in excessive cleanliness, which shelters them from low bacteria levels that could naturally build immunity, npr notes. The scientists also looked at other behaviors, such as whether kids consumed fermented foods or fare from local farms ( both of which are said to have higher bacteria count than other types of food ); the allergy risks of kids eating off hand-washed dishes seemed to dip even lower with those factors included, livescience notes. Researchers point out, however, that disparate other factors — such as lower income levels, having older siblings, and living on a farm as children — have also been linked to lower allergy levels, per livescience. \" it's very intriguing and lends one more ' x ' on the column for the hygiene hypothesis, \" an allergist and american academy of pediatrics member tells npr, though he acknowledges more study is needed and that people shouldn't necessarily stop buying dishwashers.

        "summary": "The small town of hampton, fla., has caught the attention of state lawmakers — who want to see it dissolved. That's because it's wildly corrupt, per a 42-page state audit of its books released last month, which cnn reports \" reads like a primer on municipal malfeasance. \" the town of 477 people about 20 miles north of the gainesville essentially functioned as a glorified speed trap, with 17 officers ( roughly one per every 25 residents ) known for sitting on lawn chairs or taking cover behind recycling bins along a 1,260-foot stretch of well-traveled highway us 301 armed with radar guns. That's not illegal — though aaa has gone so far as to put up billboards warning about it — but from there, things have allegedly taken a turn for the criminal. Cnn reports that on friday, state and bradford county investigators descended on city hall as part of a criminal investigation, taking the door to the police chief's office off its hinges in the process. This after the audit revealed 31 law violations. Hampton didn't pay bills on time, or withhold employee payroll taxes. It allegedly made thousands in dubious expenditures and kept cash from water customers in a bag intermingled with petty cash. Some of its records were \" lost in a swamp, \" auditors were told, per time. And it's unclear where all the ticket money — $ 616,960 between 2010 and 2012, until pressure forced the town to pack up its speed trap — went. The florida times-union reports that the town has about three weeks to prove it's making progress on turning things around; otherwise, the legislature will very likely dissolve hampton, which would then become part of unincorporated bradford county. The town's acting mayor thinks its possible to save the town; she took over for the former mayor, who is in jail after allegedly dealing oxycodone. ( in other florida news, this may be the dumbest thing ever said during a dui stop. )",

The english king, who was killed in battle in 1485 and found under a parking lot in leicester in 2012, was placed in a coffin on sunday for the first time since his death, in preparation for a grander burial at leicester cathedral next week, the bbc reports. On sunday, a procession will carry the coffin of the last plantagenet king from the city's university to the cathedral, where the archbishop of canterbury will lead a service before the king is finally buried, reports cbs. The ceremony will happen \" at dusk as the sun sets and as the thoughts of people always turn to the night and to the possibility of death, \" the bishop of leicester tells the york press. Items including a rosary and a piece of embroidered linen were placed in a lead casket along with the king's bones, reports the bbc, which notes that the king's coffin was made his 17th great-grandnephew, canadian carpenter michael ibsen. The 57-year-old is a direct descendant of the king's older sister and his dna was used to prove that the parking lot bones belonged to the king. \" i was touched when they asked me to do it, \" ibsen told the leicester mercury last year. \" i think it has a lovely resonance that i ' m making a coffin for a distant relative. It's a real honor. \" ( in the years out of the ground, richard iii's remains revealed that he wasn't the hunchback shakespeare described, he had a bad case of roundworms, and he had an extremely violent death. )",

        "summary": "After more than a week of fighting, isis militants say they are now fully in control of iraq's main oil refinery. The facility at baiji, some 155 miles north of baghdad, supplies around a third of the country's refined fuel and the bbc notes that its capture is essential for the rebels to supply energy to the areas they have conquered, including mosul, iraq's second-largest city. A rebel spokesman says the facility will be handed over to local sunni tribes while isis fighters continue to push toward baghdad. More: after talks with iraqi leaders in baghdad, john kerry promised that the us would give iraqi security forces \" intense, sustained \" support to allow them to confront isis effectively, reports cnn. He stressed, however, that support would only be effective if iraq's leaders formed a new, more inclusive government to combat the militants now in control of the country's western borders. As he arrived in the north of the country for talks with kurdish leaders, kerry restated his call for a \" broad-based, inclusive government \" that would give more authority to sunnis and kurds, the ap reports. The president of iraq's kurdish region declared, \" we are facing a new reality and a new iraq, \" and suggested the region may seek independence. But while kerry called for unity, sectarian violence is getting worse on both sides of the sunni-shiite divide, the new york times finds. Some 70 sunni prisoners were killed while being transported south yesterday and while officials initially claimed they had been killed in crossfire after gunmen ambushed the convoy, security sources say the men were massacred by iraqi police to avenge isis ' claim to have slaughtered 1,700 captured soldiers. In the north of the country, witnesses say isis returned the bodies of 15 shiite civilians, only to attack the cemetery as families buried them. Iraq has now changed its stance on legal immunity for us troops, the issue that killed talks on leaving a us force behind in the country after withdrawal in 2011, reports the ap. A white house spokesman says the current situation is nothing like 2011. \" we're dealing with an emergency situation — that's the first part — and there is an urgent need for these advisers to be able to do their work on the ground in iraq, \" he says.",

She points the finger at \" a drug company who couldn't care less about a human life. \" she's referring to insys therapeutics, whose former ceo and billionaire founder, dr. John kapoor, stands accused of orchestrating a nationwide scheme in which doctors were allegedly bribed to prescribe subsys, reports nbc news. The spray containing fentanyl, an opioid up to 100 times stronger than morphine, is approved for cancer patients with pain unhelped by other narcotics. But kapoor aimed to provide subsys to as many people as possible, non-cancer patients included, a former insys employee says. Former employee patty nixon tells nbc news she was \" trained \" to trick insurers into thinking subsys — which can cost as much as $ 30,000 monthly — was a \" medically necessary \" drug by using false diagnosis codes or sometimes by pretending she worked for a cancer doctor. But that was just one aspect: cbs news alleges insys executives also bribed doctors to prescribe subsys through 18,000 payments in 2016 totaling more than $ 2 million. Several insys executives are accused, reports the arizona republic, but insys — which does not face charges — denies responsibility.

But that's in part because the companies that can pumpkins didn't hold onto reserves for the following year's crop — that would, of course, be this year's crop, so the experts are howling again about a looming shortage given last year's deficit and continued weather issues. And the lack of pumpkin puree currently available has been a problem for brewers trying to churn out pumpkin beers, reports draft magazine. Multiple brewers have been scrambling to source their pumpkins, with one resorting to brewing five times while waiting for more puree. Another calls it \" pumpkageddon. \" weather is again an issue, reports fortune. Last year the biggest producer of pumpkins in the country, illinois, dealt with heavy summer rains that washed out the crops, which like dry heat in the middle of the summer followed by a few good days of rain in august, as farmers over in new york tell syracuse news. \" in august, when pumpkins are gaining most of their size, is when we need rain, \" one farmer says. But now large swaths of the us are suffering from droughts, including illinois and california, the second largest producer of pumpkins. With some pumpkin beers already on the shelves, brewers seem to be finding a way. We ' ll have to wait until 2017 to see what two consecutive years of shortage do to the pumpkin beer supply.

Democrats discussed the issue during a caucus luncheon but left the final decision to senate majority leader harry reid ( d-nev. ). Late thursday, reid spokesman jim manley said, \" we will come back in november and stay in session as long as it takes to get this done. \" the senate's second-ranking democrat, richard j. Durbin ( d-ill. ), acknowledged earlier that the party lacked the votes to extend the cuts for middle-class families. \" harry will make the final decision on this, but the reality is we are not going to pass what needs to be passed to change this either in the senate or in the house before the election, \" durbin said before manley's statement. \" there's no evidence of any bipartisan spirit to deal with the bigger issues. We're hoping to get a continuing resolution passed -- that's it -- to continue [ running ] the government until we return after the election. \" the senate left for the weekend thursday afternoon and will not return until early next week, when reid has scheduled a vote on a bill to prevent firms from sending jobs overseas and reward those"

A new independent study, however — funded in part by none other than the koch brothers — has confirmed that climate change is very real, and the daily show host wonders where the networks are. Physicist richard muller, formerly a leading skeptic, led the project and declared \" global warming is real \" in a recent wall street journal op-ed, stewart noted. \" climategate was a huge story, \" he said. \" i bet debunking climategate is going to be huger! \" turning to cable news coverage, however, he found that the networks had devoted a total of 24 seconds to the story — and infinitely more time to the return of the mcrib.",

            "Are you a global warming skeptic? there are plenty of good reasons why you might be. As many as 757 stations in the united states recorded net surface-temperature cooling over the past century. Many are concentrated in the southeast, where some people attribute tornadoes and hurricanes to warming. The temperature-station quality is largely awful. The most important stations in the u.s. Are included in the department of energy's historical climatology network. A careful survey of these stations by a team led by meteorologist anthony watts showed that 70 % of these stations have such poor siting that, by the u.s. Government's own measure, they result in temperature uncertainties of between two and five degrees celsius or more. We do not know how much worse are the stations in the developing world. Using data from all these poor stations, the u.n.'s intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates an average global 0.64ºc temperature rise in the past 50 years, \" most \" of which the ipcc says is due to humans. Yet the margin of error for the stations is at least three times larger than the estimated warming. We know that cities show anomalous warming, caused by energy use and building materials; asphalt, for instance, absorbs more sunlight than do trees. Tokyo's temperature rose about 2ºc in the last 50 years. Could that rise, and increases in other urban areas, have been unreasonably included in the global estimates? that warming may be real, but it has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect and can't be addressed by carbon dioxide reduction. Moreover, the three major temperature analysis groups ( the u.s.'s nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and the u.k.'s met office and climatic research unit ) analyze only a small fraction of the available data, primarily from stations that have long records. There's a logic to that practice, but it could lead to selection bias. For instance, older stations were often built outside of cities but today are surrounded by buildings. These groups today use data from about 2,000 stations, down from roughly 6,000 in 1970, raising even more questions about their selections. On top of that, stations have moved, instruments have changed and local environments have evolved. Analysis groups try to compensate for all this by homogenizing the data, though there are plenty of arguments to be had over how best to homogenize long-running data taken from around the world in varying conditions.

The man accused of her murder tells a very different story. Mccauley — a stand-in in the film step up — told friends she was on her way to a christmas party at 4: 30pm sunday but then disappeared, reports abc news. It isn't clear what happened next, though mccauley's brother says a dish she made for the party was left on her counter, per wjla. Her 2013 toyota scion iq was found early tuesday outside a cvs. Adrian duane johnson was inside the store with the keys and told police he'd recently met mccauley and the pair had sex on a curb. Johnson said mccauley then told him he could have all of her belongings and hanged herself in her car as he stood outside, police say. Johnson — who couldn't say what mccauley used to hang herself, per abc7 — then admitted to driving around in her car, using her credit cards, and picking up a prostitute while mccauley's body was concealed on the floor of the back seat, her legs restrained by a seat belt, according to police documents. When officers asked why he'd kept mccauley's body, he said he thought she might have been asleep, police say. At one point, he also asked, \" if someone is suicidal and gives you all their stuff, is that illegal? \" according to police documents. Wusa9 reports johnson spent three days in jail due to a theft charge before he was released on dec. 20. He was to be fitted with a gps monitoring device the next day, but he never arrived at the scheduled appointment. A warrant was never issued. He's due in court for the murder charge on jan. 13.",

        "summary": "A boy doing what any kid does on a snow day — digging around in the snow — met a tragic end when the tunnel he had burrowed collapsed and suffocated him. The 10-year-old was playing on his grandparents ' farm in upstate new york wednesday when his father, who was clearing the driveway, suddenly realized his son was nowhere to be seen, reports the new york daily news. After a frantic search in and outside the house, they found benjamin wasik under two feet of snow, called 911, and were instructed to begin cpr. Paramedics arrived at the pendleton home and rushed him to the hospital, but were never able to restart the boy's heart; he'd been under the snow, suffocated, for a total of about 20 minutes. A similar tragedy occurred in the area 15 years ago, reports the buffalo news. Now, niagara county is in mourning as news of the fourth-grader's death spreads. \" he was a sweet, gentle soul, \" his aunt says. He loved star wars, legos, and baseball. The news reports benjamin was found in a snow bank that had been created by a plow. Sheriff james voutour says the boy's father had told him not to play on the piles, and says that while he advises parents to be watchful of their kids, what happened in pendleton was truly a freak accident. \" the parents did everything they could to keep an eye on him, \" says voutour. Benjamin's funeral will be held on sunday in lockport, ny. ( this pre-teen died when city workers dumped snow on his fort. )",

The conspiracy theory, repeated after world war ii, is now officially debunked, according to officials at denmark's sea war museum jutland. They say german u-boat u-3523 was found earlier this month in the skagerrak strait between denmark and norway, nine miles west of where it was reported to have been sunk by a british bomber on may 6, 1945, reports the copenhagen post. It rests roughly 400 feet below the surface at a 45-degree angle, with its nose stuck in the seafloor, according to the museum, which has helped find 450 vessels in the region. \" after the war, there were many rumors about top nazis who fled in u-boats and brought nazi gold to safety, and the u-3523 fed the rumors, \" the museum says, noting the type xxi \" could sail submerged for a prolonged time \" and \" had a range that would have allowed it to sail non-stop all the way to south america. \" but though the museum says the sub was probably fleeing when it sank five days after hitler's death was announced, it's not clear if we ' ll ever know what was onboard apart from 58 crew members: there are no plans to raise the sub because of its depth, the post reports.

The discovery seems to prove that u-3523 never took hitler, any nazis or any treasure to argentina.

        "summary": "For the first time in history, a ship was able to traverse the northern sea route through the arctic without the help of an accompanying icebreaker thanks to new tanker technology — and climate change. The new york times reports the christophe de margerie, carrying liquefied natural gas from norway to south korea, traversed the northern sea route in a record 6.5 days — part of a 19-day trip from europe to asia that would have normally taken 30 % longer going through the suez canal. The christophe de margerie was built with a reinforced steel hull that allows it to get through ice up to 4-feet thick. \"it's very exciting that a ship can go along this route all year round, \" the guardian quotes a spokesperson for the russian tanker's owner as saying. But fancy internal icebreaker or no, the christophe de margerie wouldn't have been able to make the trip just a few years ago. The telegraph reports arctic ice hit an all-time low earlier this year due to \" polar heatwaves. \" in the past, the northern sea route was only usable for four months of the year, and then with the help of an icebreaker. In the busiest year, there was still only 15 crossings of the route, and fewer than 500 crossings have ever been made. Due to climate change and new tankers, russia expects there will be 150 annual crossings by 2020. Vladimir putin calls the christophe de margerie's voyage \" a big event in the opening up of the arctic. \" but environmentalists are worried what increased traffic will mean for the future of the arctic.",

Her keeper, kay buffamonte, says kenda was a peacekeeper among the other lions, calming everyone down when there were fights over toys or space. \"she was the one that held everyone together, \" buffamonte says.

The us fish and wildlife service is set to announce monday that as of jan. 22, lions in africa will be protected under the endangered species act, with lions in central and west africa deemed an \" endangered \" species, while lions in southern and east africa will be categorized as \" threatened, \" the new york times reports.

The new rules are likely to \" dramatically change the equation for american trophy hunters who have been killing lions by the hundreds each year, \" wayne pacelle, ceo of the us humane society, said in a statement, per time. Although the us wildlife agency cites \" newly available scientific information on the genetics and taxonomy of lions \" for the sudden change, conservation groups have been lobbying for years to have lions designated as endangered, with a recent study noting the lion population in east, west, and central africa may be halved over the next 20 years without intervention, per the times. The drop has been linked to habitat loss, farmer and herder killings, and the decline of prey, but also to poorly regulated trophy hunting, both papers note. Some pro-hunting groups claim the stricter rules will actually harm lions, as they say money from legal sport hunting goes toward conservation in impoverished countries. But most conservation groups are applauding. \" this is going to be a very exciting announcement for those who want to see greater protection for lions, \" an international fund for animal welfare director tells the washington post.

            "Like his older brother bill, jim studied economics at the university of massachusetts amherst and moved to ashfield, ma after graduating. An avid researcher, jim gained an additional bachelor's degree in holistic health. After joining bill's stonework company he spent many hours researching local stone structures, with particular focus on unusual new england stoneworks that he believed to be built by a lost native american civilization. His research into stonework eventually led jim to the mystery of giants when he stumbled across an account of a giant skeleton being unearthed in the neighboring town of deerfield. His giant quest has made him something of a local celebrity and he is often called on"

The doctor, jacob rosenberg, says the topic grabbed him on a long flight when he saw his empty water bottle expand due to low pressure and crumple when the plane landed; the same happens to stomach gases when we fly, causing bloating and flatulence. \" since then, i've noticed just how much flatulence you have on a flight, \" he says. \" which is very much. \" so he studied the science of human gas, which includes a 1969 study warning that astronaut farts could cause fireballs, research that men actually don't fart more than women, and a look at why farts are so reviled ( an anthropologist says they are \" invisible \" and \" we cannot actively avoid them, \" reports smithsonian ). So what to do on planes? well, as rosenberg learned interviewing airplane engineers, charcoal absorbs a variety of odors, and several airlines already spruce up their air conditioning with charcoal filters. But rosenberg says charcoal could also be put in plane seats ( which another study doubts, saying skirts and pants redirect fumes away from seats in a \" tunnel effect \" ) and fliers can buy flatulence underwear made along similar lines. People can also eat food that creates less stomach gas, like rice, fish, and strained fruit juice. In fact, airlines already make their meals high carb and low fiber, which calms the digestion. \" beyond that, mostly just try to keep it quiet, \" says uproxx in a report on rosenberg's paper. \" really, there's no need to torment your seatmate. \" ( one inventor says he can make farts smell like chocolate. )",

The lawsuit is against douglas phillips, who resigned last year as leader of vision forum ministries after admitting to an affair. The case is generating headlines because phillips preached a brand of christianity known as \" quiverfull \" or \" patriarchal \" that emphasizes female submission and constant child-bearing, and the duggars ot tlc fame were followers and friends. In fact, \" it's hard to underestimate the importance of phillips in the small world of extreme fundamentalists, \" writes amanda marcotte at the daily beast. Phillips is being sued by lourdes torres-manteufel, now 29, who says she first met phillips when she was 15. The lawsuit alleges that he \" methodically groomed \" and manipulated her for years in the guise of a spiritual mentor, until she moved into his house as a sort of nanny around age 21. At that point, the suit says he coerced her into sexual encounters, and her lawyers maintain that she was so brainwashed she was incapable of consent. \"women within this movement are perceived to exist only for the end-goals communicated by the male leaders that perceive themselves as the 'patriarchs ' of this world, \" the lawsuit reads.",

The boudoir poses that started off as a gag gift for his wife's birthday created such a response on social media that the british columbia father with a lot of hair and a bit of a belly landed an unusual modeling gig for american eagle: a real video advertising its fictitious aerie line of comfy undies for men, reports the vancouver sun. And the professional online poker player who calls himself a practical joker isn't stopping there. \" underwear's kind of where i've made my mark on this world, i guess, \" he says, per cbc news. \" if my butt made it to times square, who knows where it could go next? \" it all started when williams chose masika may photography, which appears to do \" dudeoir \" photos of men on a regular basis, to capture him in various sexy poses for his wife. But his wife actually loved them, and suddenly the private pics were no longer private. Now fans can catch williams in action in the aerie ad on youtube, which was viewed nearly 2 million times in just two weeks. And while williams is clearly playing a role in the ad — he's \" doug \" — he admits the experience has actually improved his self-esteem. \" i don't think i have the greatest body in the world, obviously, but this has made me go a little bit easier on myself, \" he says. And why not? mashable, after all, calls his dudeoir photos \" beyond stunning. \" ( one presidential candidate has his own underwear line. )",
