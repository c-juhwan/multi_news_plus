The new york times says opening speakers actually only had seven minutes, and that at one point muallem told ban, \" you live in new york. I live in syria. \" ban wasn't his only target: muallem added, directly to john kerry: \" no one in the world has the right to confer or withdraw the legitimacy of a president, a constitution, or a law, except for the syrians themselves. \" the divisions between the us and russia also \" immediately came to the fore, \" the times reports.

            "Montreux, switzerland — from its early moments on wednesday, the long-delayed peace conference on syria was marked by acrimony when syria's foreign minister described syrian rebels as \"evil \" and ignored appeals by ban ki-moon, the united nations secretary general, to avoid invective or even to yield the floor. By the end of the day, the sense that the new peace talks were headed for trouble was compounded when the proceedings ended without any hint of progress toward imposing local cease-fires or opening humanitarian corridors for the delivery of food and medicine to besieged towns and cities. In an evening news conference here, syria's ambassador to the united nations, bashar jaafari, said that stopping terrorism, not sharing power, needed to be the priority when syrian government officials sat down with the syrian opposition on friday to discuss a political solution to the bloody conflict, a stance that also appeared to promise more confrontation. Putting the best face on the meeting, secretary of state john kerry told reporters on wednesday night that it was significant that senior diplomats from 40 countries and organizations had gathered in the lakeside swiss city of montreux, to initiate the conference. Mr. Kerry insisted that he had always known that the talks would be \"tough \" and described the conference as a \"process, \" which he implied could last for months or even years",

The opposition and us said president bashar al-assad had no legitimacy and must step down from power. Syria's foreign minister had a terse exchange with the un's ban ki-moon over the length of his speech and said only syrians could decide mr assad's fate. The conflict has left more than 100,000 dead and millions displaced. The summit is discussing the geneva communique which lays out a political transition plan for syria. Analysis this first day of talks was always expected to be somewhat ceremonial, with one formal speech after another. But already predictable fault lines are emerging. Syria's foreign minister walid muallem said his country was engaged in a war against terrorist groups, adding that only the syrian people could decide on president assad's future. The opposition leader ahmad jarba said the human rights violations in syria were reminiscent of nazi germany, and suggested president assad's departure was a precondition for peace. These two men won't be in the negotiating room together until"

            "Montreux, switzerland — from its early moments on wednesday, the long-delayed peace conference on syria was marked by acrimony when syria's foreign minister described syrian rebels as \"evil \" and ignored appeals by ban ki-moon, the united nations secretary general, to avoid invective or even to yield the floor. By the end of the day, the sense that the new peace talks were headed for trouble was compounded when the proceedings ended without any hint of progress toward imposing local cease-fires or opening humanitarian corridors for the delivery of food and medicine to besieged towns and cities. In an evening news conference here, syria's ambassador to the united nations, bashar jaafari, said that stopping terrorism, not sharing power, needed to be the priority when syrian government officials sat down with the syrian opposition on friday to discuss a political solution to the bloody conflict, a stance that also appeared to promise more confrontation. Putting the best face on the meeting, secretary of state john kerry told reporters on wednesday night that it was significant that senior diplomats from 40 countries and organizations had gathered in the lakeside swiss city of montreux, to initiate the conference. Mr. Kerry insisted that he had always known that the talks would be \"tough \" and described the conference as a \"process, \" which he implied could last for months or even years",
            "Media playback is unsupported on your device media caption un secretary general ban ki-moon: \" syrians must come together to save their country, protect their children and find a peaceful path to a better future \" syria's government and main political opposition have traded bitter accusations on the first day of a major peace conference in switzerland. The opposition and us said president bashar al-assad had no legitimacy and must step down from power. Syria's foreign minister had a terse exchange with the un's ban ki-moon over the length of his speech and said only syrians could decide mr assad's fate. The conflict has left more than 100,000 dead and millions displaced. The summit is discussing the geneva communique which lays out a political transition plan for syria. Analysis this first day of talks was always expected to be somewhat ceremonial, with one formal speech after another. But already predictable fault lines are emerging. Syria's foreign minister walid muallem said his country was engaged in a war against terrorist groups, adding that only the syrian people could decide on president assad's future. The opposition leader ahmad jarba said the human rights violations in syria were reminiscent of nazi germany, and suggested president assad's departure was a precondition for peace. These two men won't be in the negotiating room together until"

        "summary": "The latest united nations report on climate change doesn't sugarcoat its findings: climate change is here, with catastrophic effects, and it is going to get worse. But that doesn't mean it's time to give up: the report from the un intergovernmental panel on climate change stresses that the planet will be a much better place both for wildlife and humans if future warming can be limited to a half-degree celsius — 0.9 degrees fahrenheit — instead of the 1.8 degrees f, or 1 degree c, that governments have agreed to work toward, the ap reports. The world is already 1 degree celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial times, and the report warns that there will have to be a massive decrease in carbon emissions by 2030 to have a chance of keeping total warming below 1.5 degrees c. The report, prepared by the world's leading climate scientists, warns that there are only around 12 years left to keep the warming to the lower figure — but if it can be achieved, far fewer people will suffer from food scarcity and water shortages, the guardian reports. The lower figure also leaves hope that the west antarctic ice sheet will not enter irreversible melting and at least some of reefs like the great barrier reef will survive. \" for some people this is a life-or-death situation without a doubt, \" says lead author natalie mahowald, a cornell university climate scientist. The panel warns, however, that limiting warming to the lower figure will require a \" rapid and far-reaching \" transformation of civilization, for which there is \" no documented historic precedent, \" the washington post reports.",

Three days later, both tested positive for zika. High levels of the virus were found in the man's semen and urine, but not in his blood or saliva, while the virus was detected in the woman's urine and saliva, and antibodies to zika were found in her blood. A vaginal swab found no signs of the virus. \" we cannot rule out the possibility that transmission occurred not through semen but through other biologic fluids, such as pre-ejaculate secretions or saliva exchanged through deep kissing, \" the scientists acknowledged in their letter. A cdc epidemiologist says he's \" not particularly surprised \" by the case. \" i don't think this changes anything, but it shows you how elaborate the number of avenues of possible transmission can be, \" the head of preventive medicine at vanderbilt university medical school tells the times.

Evans says the officers entered a home in orient heights at 10: 51pm, after an apparent fight between roommates, and were met by a 33-year-old man wearing body armor who began firing shots from an assault-style rifle, per the boston herald. One officer was hit multiple times while the other was shot one or two times. At least nine other officers then arrived and killed the suspect in a firefight, evans tells the boston globe. \" it sounded like construction equipment, like they were just working on the street, that's how long it went on, \" a neighbor says, estimating at least 50 shots were fired. During the firefight, the officers were able to pull their injured comrades to safety and \" quickly administer first aid, apply a tourniquet. One officer had his hand in one of the wounds, \" evans says. However, the injured officers, described as a 28-year veteran and 12-year veteran of the force, are now in \" extremely critical \" condition at massachusetts general hospital, where they've received blood transfusions and will undergo surgery, evans continues. \" i just want everyone to pray, \" he says. \" let's just hope they pull through. \" a district attorney says there will be \" a very thorough and transparent investigation, \" but \" it's going to take some time because the two individuals who probably know most about what happened … [ are ] fighting for their lives. \"",

        "summary": "Patagonia has accomplished an amazing feat: over the past five years, every single woman who has gotten pregnant while working for the high-end outdoor clothing brand has returned to her job. The national average is 79 %. If the former stat sounds too good to be true, patagonia's hr head understands: \" i wish it was 97.5 % because 100 % just doesn't sound accurate. \" but, as quartz reveals, the company's success is real, and it's part of a corporate culture that was built to value people, not just profits. While patagonia checks all the right boxes in terms of corporate child care and ample maternity and paternity leave, one fringe benefit is the deeper sense of community its approach fosters. One employee tells quartz he doesn't just pop into the childcare center to read his 4-year-old a pre-nap book; his co-workers all know his daughter, and that deepens all their relationships. When the new yorker recently profiled patagonia's founder, yvon chouinard, it called him a \" philosopher king, \" exploring how his passion for living a balanced life that doesn't sacrifice the time spent outdoors for that corner office helped build the company into the quixotic beast it is today: the type of company that ' ll design and manufacture a jacket then market it with a full-page ad telling you not to buy it. But before all that, when chouinard started his company, he did so by hiring his friends. When those friends started families, patagonia worked to support those new parents, and the approach has evolved to comfortable extremes: if a patagonia employee has to go on a business trip, the company will pay to fly a partner or nanny along; if neither is available, one of the child-care center's teachers will go.",

The much-maligned male chicken is banned in cities across the us, and now one woman in a small town in michigan is so fed up with hers that she posted an expletive-ridden rooster rant on facebook last week.

Denell mccaul notes that her \" a -- hole rooster \" is such an \" inconsiderate jerk \" that he wakes her up at 5: 30am every single morning. Even worse, he has no \" snooze button, \" but will quiet down just long enough for her to drift back to sleep before he starts up again \" with his obnoxious cock-a-doodle-doing right outside of your windows. \" mashable jokes that the rooster is the \" pet from hell, \" but many of the 36,000 comments point out that he's simply behaving like a rooster — even if that means being an inconsiderate jerk of an alarm clock. But there's more: mccaul adds that the rooster, who is free to anyone, is \" a perfect rooster if you want to start running... Around your yard... While you're trying to get away from him. \" his third charm is that, while being chased off with a mop, his \" student \" makes him look like \" an instructor of interpretive dance. \" \" so, if you're looking for an alarm clock with the only setting being 5: 30 a.m., a personal trainer and a dance instructor, i have the perfect rooster that is able to fill all 3 of those positions for free! \" mccaul knows a thing or two about chickens; fox news points out that she owns several.

Rumors about the change were circulated yesterday and confirmed to multiple sources today. Interestingly, a walmart spokesperson says the decision has nothing to do with mounting political debate and public pressure over high-capacity weapons used in mass shootings, but is simply about slumping sales. \" this happens to get more attention because of what the product is, [ but ] the decision was completely based on what customers are buying and what they want, \" a spokesperson told quartz. The company will replace the modern sporting rifles with shotguns and other hunting weapons. Forbes reports activist groups were putting pressure on walmart to stop selling ar-15s and other \" assault rifles \" in response to recent shootings. But in the spring, the company won a court case against trinity church, a walmart shareholder, that would have allowed the church and other shareholders to vote on limiting gun sales. According to quartz, walmart had long promised it would continue selling guns as long as people were buying them, but it started scaling back its sales as many as 15 years ago. Modern sporting rifles may be some of the best-selling guns in the country, but gun sales overall are dropping. Fortune reports remington outdoor group and smith &amp; wesson reported a more than 10 % decline in sales in the first half of 2015.",

A spanish couple witnessed the incident saturday and pulled the children, aged 5 and 6, from the cliff edge, then alerted local authorities.

Tourists think they must lead somewhere. They climb the fences — not thinking that they have been erected to protect people's lives — and then terrible things like this happen, \" an official tells the resident.

Trump's new director of communications says it's probably true that the president wants sessions gone as attorney general. Sources close to the situation tell the washington post that trump's advisers are discussing either firing sessions or forcing him to resign, possibly as part of an effort to allow trump to fire robert mueller and end his investigation. Recently on twitter, trump has called sessions \" beleaguered \" and accused him of taking \" a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes. \" this comes after saying he was having regrets about making sessions attorney general, mcclatchy newspapers reports. Trump's attacks on sessions — a longtime and well-liked senator — are upsetting current senate republicans. \" i don't understand it, \" sen. James inhofe says. \" there's no more honorable person i've ever met in my life than jeff sessions. \" still, it appears trump's treatment of his attorney general may not be enough to lose him support in the senate. Inhofe said he's still \" 100 % for the president, \" and sen. Orrin hatch says he doesn't think trump \" means harm with those tweets. \" newt gingrich also warns that dumping sessions could cost trump with his base.

The east coast is once again getting pummeled by snow, with washington, dc, and other mid-atlantic cities expecting between six and 12 inches, accuweather reports. Ice, meanwhile, could reach to charlotte, nc. Virginia, tennessee, and delaware are among states declaring states of emergency, cnn reports, and school closings stretch to dallas. Here's hoping you don't have to travel today: driving is likely to be dangerous, and some 2,000 flights have already been canceled, particularly in new york, philadelphia, and dc, the ap reports. In washington, where federal offices are closed, few are even taking the subway, the post reports, and amtrak has cut service around wilmington, delaware. The weekend, cnn notes, saw two deaths tied to weather: an suv driver hit a wall in arkansas, and a pedestrian died in oklahoma's freezing rain.",

        "summary": "A canadian inmate has lost his fight over powdered milk. The prisoner filed a grievance over the correctional service of canada's policy of using the powdered dairy product rather than liquid milk, which was enacted in his facility in 2015, arguing that it violated his rights. William johnson had claimed that he and other inmates cannot drink powdered milk ( noting that the \" majority of society dislikes and/or are unable to drink mixed powdered milk \" ) and were thus \" being denied their daily nutritional intake. \" johnson stated that he previously used non-powdered milk in his cereal and was now prevented from consuming cereal as well. But a federal court judge last week dismissed johnson's application for judicial review, finding that serving powdered milk to prisoners \" does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, \" as justice alan diner wrote in his ruling. He further found johnson provided no evidence to substantiate his \" alleged medical inability to consume powdered milk. \" the attorney general argued that canada's charter of rights and freedoms \" does not protect against trivial limitations of rights. \" the cbc notes that since a 2014 government decision having to do with lowering prison food costs, there have been many complaints in canada about what is served in prison, how much of it is served, and how high in quality it is. A 2015 cbc article noted that the food was being blamed for causing malnourishment, vomiting, and diarrhea. Vice news reports things came to a head in 2016, when a riot at a saskatchewan prison left one inmate dead; a probe into the incident found \" inmate dissatisfaction with food \" was a triggering cause.

That's certainly gotten plenty of pens wagging, with some arguing that rather than being the world's most valuable tech start-up, uber is problem-dogged, the scourge of cabbies, and insignificant. In farhad manjoo's view, it's anything but the latter. He sees it as potentially being to transportation what amazon has been to shopping: something that could reshape the space, and to the extreme. \" it has the potential to decrease private car ownership, \" argues manjoo in the new york times. He explains that in markets such as san francisco, where uber has a strong foothold, using the service daily is \" already arguably cheaper than owning a private car, \" and competition among it and similar services will serve to drive prices down even more. Studies have found that taxi services actually prod people to use more public transportation, as having varied means to get one's self around leads people to consider ditching a car. One problem, per one study, is that regulation caps the number of taxis in most cities. Uber essentially sidesteps those regulations while, bonus, using technology to \" smartly \" centralize cars where demand is high and making the payment process effortless. All this could have a wide-reaching effect for urbanites: more uber could ultimately mean a lower cost of living, less pollution, and a reduced need for so much parking. And in manjoo's view, \" it wouldn't be a stretch to see many small and midsize cities become transportation nirvanas on the order of manhattan — places where forgoing car ownership isn't just an outré lifestyle choice, but the preferred way to live. \" click for his full column.",

But a study in plos one recently found that the much-talked-about decline in seabird populations is far worse than previously thought — with 69.7 % of the flock, which has soared the globe for 60 million years, disappearing over the course of just 60 years, representing the loss of some 230 million animals. \" i was very surprised with the result, it was considerably greater than i'd expected, \" co-author edd hammill says. \" what we should take away from this is that something is seriously amiss in the oceans. \" seabirds are battling more than the huge double whammy of climate change and ocean acidification that wreak havoc on food sources and nesting sites; they're also threatened by plastic pollution, overfishing and fish nets, oil and gas development, and invasive species in nesting areas. For their calculations, researchers used data on more than 500 seabird populations that represent 19 % of the global seabird population and included all seabird families from every major coastline in the world. \" this is not about going to one location, \" one expert tells cbs news. \" it's about a broad range of threats affecting sea birds. \" plastic pollution is, to hammill, \" the most pressing issue, \" with birds eating large amounts, being poisoned, and having bowel obstructions. But there are some successes, including the group birdlife working with fishermen in south africa to reduce bycatch by 99 %. ( marine life in general is faring nearly as badly. )",

But now seabirds, like so many other species, may have met their match. Conservationists have long known that many seabird populations are in decline, but a recent paper in plos one finds the situation worse than anticipated.

This monitored population represented approximately 19 % of the global seabird population. We found the monitored portion of the global seabird population to have declined overall by 69.7 % between 1950 and 2010.

As for this year's, some reactions have been scathing. \" how sad to replace the savior in the nativity scene, \" posted one person on facebook. \" what kind of church is this??? \" but in the times and bulletin stories, passersby seem more balanced: \" that is brave, \" said a 22-year-old student. \" subtlety isn't at work here.... I will say, it got our attention. \"",

        "summary": "A canadian man is facing trial three years after an exotic python escaped from its enclosure and killed two young boys sleeping in his apartment. Jean-claude savoie, 39, faces one charge of criminal negligence causing death, the cbc reports. The charge stems from the 2013 deaths of connor barthe, 6, and noah barthe, 4, who were attending a sleepover with savoie's son in the apartment savoie occupied above his pet store, reptile ocean. A 100-pound, 14-foot-long african rock python that was being kept in the apartment escaped from its enclosure at some point during the night, and found its way into the building's ventilation system. While the snake was slithering through vents in the ceiling, the ventilation shaft collapsed, and the snake asphyxiated the boys while they slept. It was later euthanized by canadian authorities. Jury selection began on monday in the canadian city of campbellton, the star reports. While 2,000 prospective jurors were called to the pool, many were dismissed because they knew family members of the victims — the community of campbellton has a population of only 7,000, according to the guardian. Despite the rather intimidating nature of such a large snake, ctv news says the animals aren't usually dangerous — and only very rarely do they commit fatal attacks against humans. Still, many professional keepers of such pets use some sort of double-gate system to ensure against escape. Savoie, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

By late afternoon, news of the circle outside chualar had drawn curious onlookers from throughout the salinas valley.

Sen. Chuck schumer wants a federal law to the same effect. A blogger at reason points out that the city's law might conflict with a state law protecting gun rights, while a blogger at gizmodo thinks the focus on 3d guns \" distracts us from the very big problems we still have with conventional weapons. \"",

The washington post reports that according to the crowd-sourced mass shooting tracker, there have been at least 355 mass shootings in the us so far in 2015, which works out to more than one per day. Some days passed without mass shootings, which the tracker defines as shooting incidents in which at least four people are killed or injured, while four days had as many as five mass shootings. The post notes that the san bernardino massacre wasn't even the first mass shooting that day: a woman was killed and three men were injured in an early-morning incident in savannah, ga., involving two shooters, reports the atlanta journal-constitution. Fivethirtyeight finds that while the tracker uses a fairly broad definition of mass shootings, evidence from other sources shows that there were \" more total mass shooting incidents and deaths in the 11 years starting with 2005 than there were in the previous 23 years combined, \" and the fbi has also found a rise in what it calls \" active shooter \" incidents, with shooters \" actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area. \" fivethirtyeight notes, however, that murders committed with firearms are down from a decade ago, as is the overall murder rate.

There's not a \" moment of spontaneous fun or humor, \" and the script is \" a giant pile of nonsense. \" rodriguez is no fan of jared leto's \" cartoonish \" joker, while will smith is simply \" coasting \" as assassin deadshot. The flick actually \" gives villainy a bad name, \" writes adam graham at the detroit news. Among the disappointments: \" a consistent tone is never established, the action is choppy, and the climax reaches green lantern levels of embarrassment, \" he writes. But the biggest sin is \" that in a movie about villains they couldn't get an interesting villain for the squad to fight against. \" andrew o ' hehir at salon offers a silver lining: \" sure, it's terrible. But it's not even close to the worst movie of the summer or the year \" and \" the terrible reviews will have little impact on its opening weekend, \" he writes.

Researchers studying 1,800 people over the age of 100 and another 5,400 over the age of 90 discovered four genes linked to their longevity, live science reports. \" there's a reasonably strong genetic component to becoming a centenarian, and we want to find out what that is, \" researcher stuart kim says. \" we're beginning to unravel the mystery. \" kim's study — published in plos genetics — identified genes related to blood type, cell division, and alzheimer's, as well as one known to make fruit flies live longer, that were either more or less common in the extremely old. In short, centenarians seem to have fewer genes connected to major diseases, according to time. \"it seems intuitively obvious that avoiding disease is part of the strategy of becoming a centenarian, \" time quotes kim as saying. But he notes that conclusion goes against \" really strong dogma in the field. \" most researchers tend to believe undiscovered anti-aging genes are responsible, but kim posits it could be much simpler: centenarians may just get fewer diseases. According to live science, one of the four genes causes type o blood, which is known to be negatively associated with heart disease and cancer. Another of the genes is related to whether organ transplants are rejected or accepted, time reports. According to live science, researchers hope further studies will turn up even more genetic similarities in centenarians. ( this study says young blood can reverse the aging process. )",

Eastern africa and central asia will enjoy the longest view of the event, during which the sun, earth, and moon will perfectly align, casting earth's shadow on the moon and totally obscuring the moon's light for that 103-minute period and turning the moon a red or brownish shade. National geographic explains we only get treated to total lunar eclipses about twice a year due to the moon's orbit. It's \" tilted with respect to the planet, so the lunar orb usually glides above or below earth's shadow, \" not directly in it. ( much more on that, with illustrations, here. ) \" this is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be, \" an astrophysicist tells the bbc, and that's because the moon will travel through the dead center of the earth's shadow, which is where that shadow is widest. As for when north america can next spy a lunar eclipse, mark your calendars for jan. 21.

He won seven states — alabama, georgia, massachusetts, tennessee, virginia, arkansas, and vermont — but ted cruz defeated him in the senator's own home state of texas, in neighboring oklahoma and in alaska, reports cnn. The oklahoma win was a surprise and gives cruz at least as strong a claim to be the \" trump alternative \" as marco rubio, writes nicholas confessore at the new york times. \" this has been an amazing evening, \" trump told supporters, describing himself as a \" unifier. \" \" once we get all of this finished, i am going to go after one person: hillary clinton, \" he vowed. Rubio, meanwhile, scored his first victory with a win in minnesota and finished a strong second in virginia, perhaps buoyed by democrats voting for him in the open primary, notes vox. But overall, he fared poorly in the south, where evangelicals and conservative voters chose trump, reports the washington post. The brightest spot for john kasich was vermont, where he came a close second. He also came a distant second in massachusetts, while ben carson failed to crack the top three in any state.

            "About 6 percent of voters in virginia's republican primary were democrats, according to a cnn exit poll. That jibes with anecdotal evidence of democrats voting in the opposite party's primary strategically — though whether \" strategically \" translated into \" for donald trump \" ( because they thought trump would be easy to beat ) or \" against donald trump \" ( because they were horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency ) isn't yet clear. But this number should be taken with two big grains of salt. First, it's a small sample size from an early exit poll in a state that's still too close to call. Second, democrats crossing the aisle in virginia is a time-honored tradition. In 2012, 5 percent of virginia's republican primary voters were democrats, according to cnn. In 2008, 3 percent were — during a bitterly fought democratic primary when democrats had good reason to weigh in on their own party. Go deeper:"

While it's not surprising that obama has rebounded from those one-termer predictions of a few months ago, it is surprising at how quickly he's done it, writes kornacki. Reagan and clinton also recovered from mid-term swoons, but they needed far more time — and tangible signs of progress — to do so. \" my guess is that obama is now benefiting from memories of the reagan and clinton experiences, \" writes kornacki. Their comebacks were nearly unprecedented. \" but now that we have both the reagan and clinton examples to point to, our instinct is to assume that obama's first term will play out similarly — and to look for evidence that confirms this. Thus, his lame-duck successes and modest gains in popularity have taken on outsize significance.

Zou was competing in the new york city marathon's wheelchair division on sunday when she got a flat around the mile 13 mark in brooklyn.

Valentin draped his police jacket around zou's shivering shoulders as they waited for an athlete support van to come get her, while he, kulesh, and daley ( both bicycle escorts for the wheelchair racers ) communicated with zou via a chinese-english translation app on one of their smartphones. \" it really was a cool new york moment, \" daley says, with valentin calling the 32-year-old zou \" the most humble, sweet person. \" in fact, only later, after zou had left with her ride, did the trio research her online and find out she was actually a rio gold medalist. Zou — who china daily says lost the use of her right leg as a child due to polio and didn't start racing competitively until 2009 — says she wants to eventually return to new york city, noting she hopes to pay a visit to the statue of liberty and finish the 26.2 miles that she started.

The tire couldn't be repaired. Zou was invited to the event after winning the gold medal in the women's marathon at the rio paralympics in the summer, where she narrowly beat tatyana mcfadden, an american marathoner who had swept 17 straight victories in major marathons, including sunday's. \" rio was a surprise to all of us.

As the verge notes, though eagles have extremely strong legs and talons, \" carbon fiber props spinning at full speed can easily cut human flesh. \" it's not yet clear if the birds will need extra protection in order to do the job safely.

The legislation, which would allow a panel of federal judges to review orders to fire the special counsel, was intended to prevent president trump from pushing out mueller before he completes his investigation of russian meddling in the 2016 election. But two different bipartisan proposals have been mired in negotiations for months.

            "Robert s. Mueller iii, the special counsel probing russian interference in the 2016 election, departs capitol hill in washington in june. ( andrew harnik/ap ) republican senators who worked swiftly last summer to help write legislation protecting special counsel robert s. Mueller iii now are showing little urgency to get those measures passed. The legislation, which would allow a panel of federal judges to review orders to fire the special counsel, was intended to prevent president trump from pushing out mueller before he completes his investigation of russian meddling in the 2016 election. But two different bipartisan proposals have been mired in negotiations for months.

        "summary": "It's a day for the history books: two landmark supreme court rulings on gay marriage are coming today, something we know with certainty because it's the last day of the term. The justices will convene at 10am et and issue their rulings shortly thereafter, reports the new york times. A quick primer on what to expect: one case: doma. Doma defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman, meaning that gay couples who legally wed in states that allow gay marriage are denied federal benefits. The high court must decide if the federal government can constitutionally do that. ( more on the lesbian couple the case involves here. ) what could happen here: if doma is struck down, the federal benefits would start flowing to affected couples; if it's upheld, things will remain as they are. The court could also punt by saying that house republicans do not have the standing to defend the law in the first place. The court sounded pretty skeptical during its oral arguments on the case three months ago, with scotusblog putting the chance of doma's demise at 80 %. Second case, prop 8: california's voter-approved prop 8 banned same-sex marriage after the state supreme court allowed it. A federal district judge struck down prop 8, but his decision was stayed until the supreme court could weigh in. What could happen here: there are more possible outcomes in this case. The court could uphold prop 8, determine it is powerless to hear the case ( more on that here ), or strike prop 8 down. Should the justices go with the third option, their ruling could go one of three ways, as explained here. Most narrowly, such a decision would affect only california. Most broadly, they could deem all bans on gay marriage unconstitutional. You may have to wait a few minutes past 10am: the atlanticwire notes that there's a third ruling coming today, and that ' ll likely be first in line. Today's best sidebar: this slate piece on how, and why, the supreme court schedules its decisions the way it does. Interesting side note: the times observes that when the justices heard arguments in the cases in march, gay marriage was legal in nine states, plus dc. In the months since, three more states have joined that group.",

        "summary": "If you've ever been blown away by pink floyd, you ' ll get why scientists just named a similarly thunderous crustacean in its honor. Per a post in the zootaxa journal, a species of pistol shrimp with an intensely colored red-pink claw, found in the pacific ocean near panama, has been named synalpheus pinkfloydi after the british psychedelic-rock band. At least two of the report's authors say the group is one of their favorites. Oxford university's sammy de grave says he's been listening to floyd since the wall came out when he was 14, while arthur anker of brazil's universidade federal de goias says he often cranks up the band's tunes as \" background music \" when he's toiling away on all things scientific, per a press release. The shrimp, also known as a snapping shrimp, boasts a large, brightly hued claw that would give floyd drummer nick mason some competition: when the shrimp quickly slams the claw shut, it creates what's called a \" cavitation bubble, \" which creates a blast of sonic energy so powerful it can actually kill small fish. That factored into the researchers giving the shrimp what gizmodo says is \" the best name ever. \" the shrimp — closely related to the synalpheus antillensis species, also with a glowing claw — isn't the first to pay tribute to famous musicians: there's a spider named after david bowie, a jellyfish named after frank zappa, and a parasitic wasp named after shakira, per the dodo. ( stephen hawking is also apparently a pink floyd fan and helped them out on an album. )",

The state has been covering about two-thirds of the cost for about a year now, in the wake of revelations that the tap water was unsafe to drink, reports npr. No more. Now that state officials have deemed the water safe again, the subsidies disappeared as of march 1. While that designation might sound like good news, plenty of skepticism abounds, and not just from local residents. The water is still \" unsafe to drink, \" pediatrician mona hanna-attisha, who first helped bring the problem to the nation's attention, tells abc news. Not helping ease fears is the state's recommendation that people continue to filter the water before drinking it. What's more, pipe replacement isn't finished. \" for years, flint residents paid the highest water rates in the country for water that was and continues to be unsafe to drink, \" says hanna-attisha. \"the people of flint should not pay for water today nor for years to come. \" the counterpoint comes from a scientist who helped conduct the new tests for the state. Flint's water is \" in the range of other cities with old pipe, \" he says, while acknowledging that a \" horrible infrastructure crisis \" remains to be fixed. A report at wjrt suggests that flint water bills are indeed among the highest in the nation, though the city couldn't provide an average. Anecdotally, the station reported that monthly bills range from $ 60 into the hundreds. ( there's going to be a tv movie with cher about the mess. )",

She says water payments are one of the only revenue streams into the city. The city uses the money to pay for water from the great lakes water authority. That's more than $ 1 million per month. It's also used to cover the kwa pipeline debt, which is another $ 440,000 per month. If people stop paying once the credits are gone, that could have a devastating financial impact.

That's according to the 2017 global passport power rank, a worldwide ranking from advisory firm arton capital, which specializes in investor programs for residence and citizenship around the world. The list ranks passports worldwide based on a \" total visa-free score, \" which assigns passports a point for each country their holders can visit without a visa, with a visa on arrival or by using electronic travel authorization. Singapore scored a 159 based on the metric, meaning its holders can easily visit 159 countries. This is the first time an asian country has had the most powerful passport in the world, with the most superlative spot historically going to european countries, according to arton. Singapore recently surpassed germany in the ranking after paraguay removed visa requirements for singaporean passport holders. The asian country had previously been tied with germany, which now follows in second. Sweden and south korea are close behind with a visa-free score of 157.

            "The singaporean passport leapfrogged germany's in a global ranking to become the most powerful. ( matt cardy/getty images ) passports are often viewed as a ticket to the world, but some may actually hold more power than others. In fact: singapore is now the most powerful. That's according to the 2017 global passport power rank, a worldwide ranking from advisory firm arton capital, which specializes in investor programs for residence and citizenship around the world. The list ranks passports worldwide based on a \" total visa-free score, \" which assigns passports a point for each country their holders can visit without a visa, with a visa on arrival or by using electronic travel authorization. Singapore scored a 159 based on the metric, meaning its holders can easily visit 159 countries. This is the first time an asian country has had the most powerful passport in the world, with the most superlative spot historically going to european countries, according to arton. Singapore recently surpassed germany in the ranking after paraguay removed visa requirements for singaporean passport holders. The asian country had previously been tied with germany, which now follows in second. Sweden and south korea are close behind with a visa-free score of 157. The united states, which has recently undergone extensive policy debate over passports and visa requirements, did not land in the top 5",

Second of all, the tarrant county sheriff told an interesting story after the proceeding was over, wfaa reports. Sheriff dee anderson said that couch has complained about conditions inside the jail where she's being held, specifically, that it's too bright, making it difficult to sleep. His response to her: \" it's jail, not a resort. \" couch has a bond reduction hearing scheduled monday; her bond is currently set at $ 1 million, but her lawyers reportedly want it reduced to $ 15,000. If she ends up making bond, the judge told her she'd be under severe restrictions, including giving up her passport and wearing a gps ankle monitor.

Family and friends had repeatedly tried to help the actor — who was still landing movie roles — with his substance abuse and mental issues. A probation report called his recent behavior \" out of control. \" e! reports that an attorney who represented lewis said it was clear he suffered from delusions. It seems lewis ' mental troubles began earlier this year, when he had a bad experience with an undisclosed drug that caused him to have a \" psychotic break, \" sources tell tmz. He had never been the same since, but was stabilized on medication. The sources believe he stopped taking the medication when he was released from his latest jail stint, days before his death, causing him to become dangerously unstable. Lewis was, at least at one point, very active in scientology and its drug abuse program, narconon, tmz reports. Adding to lewis'recent troubles: he had a daughter, and was upset over a custody battle, e! reports. But, until the morning of her death, lewis had never given his landlady any reason to fear him, a friend of hers tells celebuzz. Many of the songs of katy perry, who dated lewis in 2006, were inspired by lewis, a source tells us. Perry \" had to separate from him \" because she knew \" he was in trouble then and she couldn't help him. \" she's said to be \" devastated \" by his death.",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - u.s. President donald trump is expected to sign executive orders starting on wednesday that include a temporary ban on most refugees and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries, say congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter. Trump, who tweeted that a \"big day \" was planned on national security on wednesday, is expected to ban for several months the entry of refugees into the united states, except for religious minorities escaping persecution, until more aggressive vetting is in place. Another order will block visas being issued to anyone from syria, iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan and yemen, said the aides and experts, who asked not to be identified. In his tweet late on tuesday, trump said: \"big day planned on national security tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! \" more from reuters * commentary: trump's war with the media will damage both * trump to seek ' major investigation ' on voter fraud * how russia sold its oil jewel:",
            "President trump plans to sign executive orders wednesday enabling construction of his proposed wall on the u.s.-mexico border and targeting cities where local leaders refuse to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation, according to white house officials familiar with the decisions. The actions, part of a multi-day focus on immigration, are among an array of sweeping and immediate changes to the nation's immigration system under consideration by the new president. The moves represent trump's first effort to deliver on perhaps the signature issue that drove his presidential campaign: his belief that illegal immigration is out of control and threatening the country's safety and security.

            "Washington ( reuters ) - u.s. President donald trump is expected to sign executive orders starting on wednesday that include a temporary ban on most refugees and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries, say congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter. Trump, who tweeted that a \"big day \" was planned on national security on wednesday, is expected to ban for several months the entry of refugees into the united states, except for religious minorities escaping persecution, until more aggressive vetting is in place. Another order will block visas being issued to anyone from syria, iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan and yemen, said the aides and experts, who asked not to be identified. In his tweet late on tuesday, trump said: \"big day planned on national security tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! \" more from reuters * commentary: trump's war with the media will damage both * trump to seek ' major investigation ' on voter fraud * how russia sold its oil jewel:",
            "President trump plans to sign executive orders wednesday enabling construction of his proposed wall on the u.s.-mexico border and targeting cities where local leaders refuse to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation, according to white house officials familiar with the decisions. The actions, part of a multi-day focus on immigration, are among an array of sweeping and immediate changes to the nation's immigration system under consideration by the new president. The moves represent trump's first effort to deliver on perhaps the signature issue that drove his presidential campaign: his belief that illegal immigration is out of control and threatening the country's safety and security.

The disses didn't let up there. \" it's far from a bad restaurant, \" wells wrote, bestowing a one-star rating. \" it's just not, as my teachers used to say, using its full potential. \" wells issued his share of disparagement — a la \" chocolate mousse that has been repeatedly violated by bits of baked cocoa meringue \" — but adjectives such as \" superb \" and \" virtually perfect \" also find their way in. No matter, as none of it sat well with fakahany, who prides himself on establishments that business insider points out are frequented by the likes of michael bloomberg and david geffen. \" the new york times dining review section is at its lowest point, and the subject of much industry chatter in this regard. Congratulations. You have managed to do a fantastic job of getting it there, \" fakahany writes. He chastises wells for his \" embarrassing lack of knowledge, \" as well as \" an absence of a natural food interest. \" then there's wells ' ranking among esteemed food reviewers: \" you seem so desperately anxious to be relevant...

A trustee for wolfe - who died in 1997 and was also known as randy california - claims the musician deserves a partial song-writing credit on stairway to heaven, the opening cords of which is alleged to be based on his composition.

In their opening statements, attorneys for the two sides offered jurors sharply different views of the 1971 hit that helped catapult led zeppelin into rock stardom. Francis malofiy, the lawyer representing the estate of singer randy wolfe, claimed the opening of \"stairway \" closely mimics parts of \"taurus, \" a song wolfe wrote and played with his band spirit. Experts, malofiy said, would show how the musical structure of \"stairway \" mirrors a unique construction used in \"taurus. \" \"this case can be summed up in six words: give credit where credit is due, \" malofiy told jurors.

In its upcoming international classification of diseases, the who is adding something called \" gaming disorder, \" reports new scientist. A draft makes clear that the label would apply only to those whose habit consumes their lives to an extreme degree — say someone who misses work, gets fired, and continues playing. Under the definition, the \" gaming disorder \" fits those who can't control the habit despite such negative consequences, and this \" pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. \" the playing may be constant or \" episodic, \" and the disorder would typically be diagnosed if the pattern continues for at least year. A post at forbes adds some context: \" before you get too madden about this, keep in mind that this is not saying that playing video games is a mental disorder, \" writes bruce y. Lee. He adds that video gaming can be beneficial, provided it's not done to excess. Lee suggests that those wondering about their own habits might want to take a series of questions designed to detect addictions to drugs or alcohol ( \" are video games usually the first thing you think about in the morning when you wake up? \" etc. ) and as newsweek notes, the disorder has not been recognized as such by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, a better-known guide used by mental health professionals in the us.",

In the washington post, former bar bouncer felix biederman thinks these critics should stuff their tough talk. \" most people in this country cannot fight their way out of a wet paper bag and have no clue what they're talking about when they opine on it, \" he writes. Biederman, a co-host of the podcast chapo trap house, isn't making the case that people should know how to fight better, he's simply pointing out that this kind of bluster usually comes from clueless people.

        "summary": "The repute of the mediterranean diet, considered one of the world's healthiest, took a hit this week: citing methodology errors, authors retracted a landmark 2013 study published in the new england journal of medicine that found people who consumed the diet of fruits, veggies, nuts, fish, and olive oil had a 30 % reduced risk of heart attack and stroke. But believers still have something to cheer: the authors replaced it with a \" re-analysis \" that reached essentially the same conclusion, though with what npr calls \" softer language. \" the key difference: those on the diet did indeed appear to have a 30 % reduced risk of serious health risks, but the authors no longer assert that the diet is the reason — only that they found an association between the two. \" after all this long work, i am more convinced [ of the findings ] than ever, \" study author miguel martínez-gonzález of spain's university of navarra tells the new york times. The big problem in the original study is that it was supposed to be randomized — that is, the nearly 7,500 participants were supposed to be assigned one of three diets in the study at random — but that didn't happen in some cases. One example: a researcher would randomly assign one member of a household to adhere to one of the three diets, but then ask everyone else in the household to follow it as well. That means the other members of the household weren't randomly assigned. \" the evidence is still strong, but not as strong as a randomized study in which the randomization was executed flawlessly, \" says an nejm spokesperson.

        "summary": "Supreme court nominee neil gorsuch is going to be confirmed one way or another, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vowed on sunday — and the democrats appear ready to have it done the hard way. Senate democrats are closing in on the 41 votes needed to block the confirmation, making it almost a certainty that mcconnell will use the \" nuclear option \" and change senate rules to have gorsuch confirmed with a simple majority instead of 60 votes, politico reports. The senate judiciary committee is expected to vote 11-9 along party lines monday to send the nomination to the full senate. A roundup of coverage: some 36 democrats have announced their opposition to gorsuch, along with independent bernie sanders, while just three democrats so far say they will support him, the ap reports. That leaves seven democrats and maine independent angus king undecided. If four of them decide to oppose gorsuch, he will be the first supreme court nominee successfully filibustered since 1968. Senate minority leader chuck schumer tells nbc news that it's highly unlikely gorsuch will get 60 votes, and he wants the gop to change the nominee instead of changing the rules. \" our republican friends are acting like, you know, they're a cat on the top of a tree and they have to jump off with all the damage that entails, \" he says. \" come back off the tree, sit down, and work with us and we will produce a mainstream nominee. \" the chicago tribune sets out the timeline: three days of formal debate will start tuesday, followed by an expected confirmation on friday. Republicans want to have gorsuch on the court by the end of this month. Democratic senators from red states are the most divided on the nomination, the wall street journal reports. Missouri's sen. Claire mccaskill came out against gorsuch friday, but she said it was a tough decision, especially since it is likely to lead to \" a senate rule change that will usher in more extreme judges in the future. \" sen. Joe manchin, a democrat from west virginia, cited the potential rule change as his reason for supporting the nomination, the hill reports. \" people who have been here for a long time know that we're going down the wrong path here, \" he said. \" the most unique political body in the world, the united states senate, will be no more than a six-year term in the house. \" the editorial board of usa today says that despite some questionable rulings, gorsuch is no \" fire-breathing extremist \" — and he has shown the independence that the country is likely to require of him. \" overall",
