        "summary": "Is this the next libor? switzerland's top market regulator has announced a sweeping investigation into an alleged conspiracy to rig benchmark currency exchange rates, the wall street journal reports. The regulator, finma, says it's investigating \" several \" swiss firms, but is also \" coordinating closely with authorities in other countries, as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated. \" british regulators have previously announced a similar investigation, and sources tell bloomberg that they've requested information from deutsche bank and citigroup, the world's top two currency traders. This summer, bloomberg reported that bankers were allegedly rigging the rates by pooling information via instant message and pushing through big trades before and during the 60-second windows in which rates are set, and the activity in these periods has often looked suspicious. But traders say that's a natural time to trade to hedge against client moves. \" if you try to hedge afterwards, you're an idiot, \" one says. But, the journal points out, traders said similar things when irregularities started showing up in libor.",

But kevin lee co of rocklin is making headlines for what he admitted to doing with the cash, a revelation that came as part of his guilty plea, obtained by ars technica. From about may 2008 to march 2015, co made hundreds of unauthorized transactions through holt of california's commercial credit account; the guilty plea explains holt routed all its operating expenses through the account. Co, as controller for the majority of the period in question, oversaw the account, and used it to buy plastic surgery, san francisco 49ers and sacramento kings season tickets, a golf club membership, luxury cars, and, most notably, $ 1 million in game of war purchases. Wtae reports the mobile-phone game is freemium in nature, meaning it costs nothing to play. And yet an april article from venturebeat noted that game of war players fork over an average $ 549.69, putting it atop the heap of highest grossing mobile apps.

Pierson was passionate about debate, but got in an argument with the coach about changes he wanted to make to the team in september and ended up kicked off the team and suspended from school after threatening the coach, says a debate team co-captain who asked pierson to consider coming back on the team monday. But pierson said he still hated the coach and added, \" apparently you get suspended for threatening to kill a teacher. \" the co-captain adds that pierson may have been upset that the team just won first place in a tournament; pierson had been the best debater on the team, according to the co-captain. Pierson was shouting the coach's name yesterday, found him, and \" shot once and missed, \" another student says. The coach escaped and fled the school, and the sheriff tells nbc news that may have saved lives: it was \" the most important tactical decision that could have been made, \" he says, because \" maybe the threat went toward him rather than the school. \" as for the 15-year-old girl who was shot, who remains in critical condition, police say \" there's no reason to believe she was a target. \" friends say pierson was smart, \" slightly geeky, \" into politics and gun rights, and had friends, but was also bullied. \" only those that could cope with his personality became close with him, \" says one student. Another adds that pierson seemed to change after his parents divorced recently.",

        "summary": "It appears the world is about to get familiar with the fascinating story of oney judge. As the new york times explains, judge ( also known as ona ) was one of george washington's slaves until she managed to escape. The president took this as a personal affront — he huffed at her \" ingratitude \" — and tried to recapture her for years, right up until his death. Washington famously freed his slaves in his will, but judge technically belonged to martha washington and thus wouldn't have been affected. Judge's story hasn't been widely told, but it is now included in an exhibition at mount vernon and is also the subject of a book, never caught, by the university of delaware's erica armstrong dunbar. \" we have the famous fugitives, like harriet tubman and frederick douglass, \" says dunbar. \" but decades before them, ona judge did this. I want people to know her story. \" and quite a story it is: judge was born into slavery at mount vernon, and she traveled with the first couple first to new york and then to philadelphia when washington became president. It was in philadelphia that judge learned she was to be given to martha washington's granddaughter and re-shipped south. Instead, she slipped away from the presidential mansion with the help of free blacks and made it to new hampshire. She would marry and have three children there, and though she lived in near poverty, she expressed no regrets in two interviews before her death in 1848, at around age 75, reports philly.com. Washington, for his part, tried to skirt federal rules on the recapture of slaves and enlisted a customs employee to get her back, reports the new york post. Judge, however, evaded all attempts at recapture. ( a kids ' book on washington's slaves didn't go over well. )",

            "Brussels a group of roma camped by a belgian town faced a rude awakening on wednesday: the mayor ordered that they be blasted with music to drive them away. The roma had arrived on sunday in landen, some 50 km ( 30 miles ) east of the belgian capital of brussels. They agreed with a landowner to park 14 caravans there until tuesday, according to landen mayor gino debroux. \" since then, they've said they won't leave and they're there with 30 caravans, \" debroux told reuters by telephone. \" this is an industrial site and is not designed for camping. \" debroux said the group's refusal to leave had led him to hire a dj to play music from wednesday morning, starting around 9 a.m. \" this is a way of putting pressure on them. It was very difficult to negotiate with the gypsy king, as he called himself, \" debroux said. \" it's a non-violent method to ask them to come to an agreement. \" debroux said the music had been limited to a maximum 95 decibels, equivalent to the sound of a pneumatic drill from 50 feet ( 15 meters ) away. Local media said that the dj kicked off his set with dire straits ' \" sultans of swing \". Belgian television showed roma children dancing to the music. \" i want to thank the mayor, \" said one camp resident. \" it's very nice that he sent a dj for us to have a party. \" music played until shortly after midday. The roma then agreed with the police to leave by thursday. The stunt led to a stream of reactions on social media, including some from fellow members of debroux's socialist sp.a party. \" not ok, what happened in landen.

        "summary": "The baffling injuries suffered by us diplomats in cuba resulted in two big moves by the white house on friday: the us is yanking more than half its staff from the embassy in havana, leaving only \" essential \" personnel in place, and it's warning americans not to travel to cuba, reports the ap. The us has 21 confirmed cases over the past year in which people suffered ailments ranging from nausea to hearing loss to motor skills impairment after being exposed to something along the lines of noise or vibrations at their cuban-supplied residences. Nobody's been able to figure out what's been happening, and cuba has emphatically denied being responsible. Details: not cuba? secretary of state rex tillerson had considered shutting the embassy entirely, but he took a lesser step for now because the us is beginning to think that an unnamed third country is to blame for the apparent attacks, and not cuba, reports the new york times. A report at mcclatchy quoted us sources saying the same. \" no one believes the cubans are responsible, \" says one. No visas: the move means that cubans looking to visit relatives in america are out of luck trying to get a visa, reports the miami herald. It's not clear how this will be resolved, but the us might somehow have them get visas from embassies in other countries. American tourists: the warning against travel could hit cuba's tourism industry, notes the washington post. About 615,000 americans visited last year, part of a general uptick in tourism in the nation. Because at least one of the \" sonic \" incidents happened at a hotel, the us doesn't consider the country safe for tourists, period. Tillerson meeting: a meeting this week between tillerson and cuban foreign minister bruno eduardo rodriguez parrilla did little to ease american concerns, reports cbs news. \" there is no evidence so far of the cause or the origin of the health disorders reported by the us diplomats, \" said a cuban readout issued afterward. The readout also denied that cuba had \" perpetrated \" any such attacks and said \" third parties \" would never be allowed to do so on cuban soil either. Rubio angry: marco rubio thinks the us is being too soft on havana, tweeting that it was \" shameful \" the white house did not order cuba to reduce its embassy staff in washington. In another tweet, he blamed the castro regime for allowing the attacks to take place.",

Paul chambers — who lost his job after being arrested earlier this year — will now have to pay a $ 1,600 fine and double that in court costs, the guardian reports. The judge said the tweet, which was reported to police by an airport worker, was \" menacing in its content and obviously so. \" civil liberties groups said the case raised serious concerns, especially since chambers was prosecuted under a 1930s law originally intended to prevent telephone operators from harassment. Actor — and controversial tweeter — stephen fry has offered to pay the fine. Similar trials in future could possibly be prevented if twitter added a \" sarcasm marker \" so people can indicate when they're joking, the washington post suggests.",

            "The man convicted of \" menace \" for threatening to blow up an airport in a twitter joke has lost his appeal. Paul chambers, a 27-year-old accountant whose online courtship with another user of the microblogging site led to the \" foolish prank \", had hoped that a crown court would dismiss his conviction and £ 1,000 fine without a full hearing. But judge jacqueline davies instead handed down a devastating finding at doncaster which dismissed chambers's appeal on every count. After reading out his comment from the site – \" crap! robin hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise i ' m blowing the airport sky high!! \" – she found that it contained menace and chambers must have known that it might be taken seriously. He was also saddled with a legal bill three times higher than his original £ 384 with £ 600 costs, as the court ordered him to pay a further £ 2,000 legal bill for the latest proceedings. Chambers, who lost his financial manager's job after his arrest in january, sent the message to a contact called @crazycolours, a young woman from northern ireland who was among 650 people who regularly followed his 140-character tweets. They had arranged to meet in belfast and chambers told an earlier hearing he was desperate and frustrated that heavy snow might close robin hood, near doncaster, and ruin their plans. He used twitter's private service to joke with her late at night about hijacking a plane, noting wryly that its pilots might expect to be diverted to somewhere more exotic than northern ireland. But his facetious bomb threat was sent on the network's public system, allowing anyone to see it – including staff at robin hood. Chambers's conviction this summer caused huge controversy both on twitter itself and among civil liberties lawyers because of its implications for the cyberworld's freewheeling style. The crown prosecution service caused controversy by using a law aimed against nuisance calls – originally to protect \" female telephonists at the post office \" in the 1930s – rather than specific bomb hoax legislation, which requires stronger evidence of intent.

Top-down efforts to quickly transform entire societies have often come to grief, and urbanization has already proven one of the most wrenching changes in china's 35 years of economic transition. Land disputes account for thousands of protests each year, including dozens of cases in recent years in which people have set themselves aflame rather than relocate. The country's new prime minister, li keqiang, indicated at his inaugural news conference in march that urbanization was one of his top priorities. He also cautioned, however, that it would require a series of accompanying legal changes \"to overcome",

Liu makes up the one-person population of xuenshanshe village in northwest china's gansu province. According to liu, there used to be at least 20 families living in the same village, but they had started to relocate when natural resources became scarce and people started dying from old age. Liu has been living alone since both his mother and younger brother died. Image: @cctv news/facebook by 2006, liu found himself left alone to care for his bedridden mother and younger brother.

The company — the world's biggest spirits maker — says it plans to work with regulators worldwide to add the labels, and they ' ll probably arrive first in the us, reports the wall street journal. The company's many brands include johnnie walker whisky, captain morgan rum, and the purportedly \" good for you \" guinness beer, which has fewer calories than budweiser or heineken, according to the company's website. A diageo spokeswoman tells cnn that the company wasn't previously allowed to put information on things like carbohydrates, calories, fat, and protein content on its labels, and the \" serving facts \" information will be provided based on serving size. \" currently, there is no obligation to provide such information in markets worldwide, but we know that consumers are increasingly discerning about what's in their glass, \" the company's chief executive said in a statement.

Diageo owns guinness as well as johnnie walker, smirnoff and captain morgan, and several brands of beer and wine. It sells in 180 countries around the world. It's the first time information on carbohydrates, calories, fat and protein content in alcoholic beverages will be included on a \" serving facts panel, \" said diageo spokeswoman zsoka mcdonald.

The company said it will label drinks with the amount of alcohol contained in a given serving size, as opposed to the alcohol content per 100 milliliter, the standard for nutrition labels in europe. Measuring alcohol and nutrition content that way is \" misleading \" because drinks vary widely in terms of size, according to diageo. Guinness has 35.2 calories per 100 milliliters, according to the brewer's website. That translates to about 140 calories per u.s. Pint, which is 16 ounces.

I know that donald does not at all subscribe to any racist or anti-semitic thinking. \" but although schwartz actually believes trump probably isn't anti-semitic, she says he appeals to those who are, and she tweeted her boss is missing the point. As for kushner's statement, \" it seems crafted by pr and doesn't address the point of my article in the slightest, \" she tells politico. \" i'd love a real response from mr.

        "summary": "It could be the plot of a hollywood movie, albeit one where apparently nothing goes wrong: on aug. 23, germany announced it had successfully and in secret shepherded half its gold reserves back home, per reuters. Germany's 3,378 metric tons of gold had for decades been stored in new york, london, and paris over fears that the soviets could get their hands on it, cnbc notes; only 2 % of the country's gold remained at home during the cold war. A mission that began in 2013 to bring 1,710 tons back to frankfurt wrapped up well ahead of the scheduled 2020 end date. The bundesbank declined to explain to cnbc the methods by which the transfer of 53,780 bars — each worth $ 519,000, or $ 27.9 billion in total — out of the federal reserve bank of new york and paris ' banque de france took place. The undertaking cost germany $ 9.1 million, per deutsche welle. The financial times reports germany's gold reserves are second only to the united states ' 8,134 metric tons; what remains abroad is held at the federal reserve and bank of england in london, where it can be converted to dollars and pounds, respectively, if an economic emergency necessitates it. Economic emergencies elsewhere — think the us subprime crisis — led some to voice concerns the gold \" might have been tampered with, lent out, or sold off, \" as deutsche welle puts it, spurring the central bank to bring more gold home. \" we've checked every ingot against authenticity, fineness, and weight. We have nothing to complain about, \" says a bundesbank board member. The first repatriation pre-dated even the subprime crisis, notes reuters, with 931 metric tons returned from london in 2000.

        "summary": "Researcher svein magnussen wondered 15 years ago whether newborns can make out people's facial expressions, but says he didn't yet have the tools to investigate. Now, thanks to modern simulation techniques, as well as a wealth of information from previous studies, the university of oslo professor and other swedish researchers say they've accomplished a first: reconstructing how newborns see the world, the telegraph reports. Working with the university of uppsala and eclipse optics in stockholm, magnussen reports in the journal of vision that babies 2 to 3 days old can make out facial expressions up to a foot away — or roughly the distance between the baby and its mother's face while breastfeeding. When examining this question in the past, researchers \" invariably used still photos, \" says magnussen. But as a press release points out, \" it's easier to recognize something that moves, than a blurry still photo. \" so the researchers shot videos of adults making various facial expressions and \" filtered out the information which we know is unavailable to newborn infants, \" per the release. At a distance of four feet, adults watching the video guessed the correct expression at a random rate, but got it right 75 % of the time from a foot away. The conclusion: one foot is about the distance a newborn can make out facial expressions ( because if adults can't make out an expression, newborns can't either ). What it means isn't quite clear: \" it's important to remember that we have only investigated what the newborn infant can actually see, not whether they are able to make sense of it, \" says magnussen.

            "Newborn adult newborn the image formation process in humans can be seen as a combination of these filters, where the aberrations and limitations of the eye's optics, the detector or retina, and all image processing of the brain are included. Since the spatial filtering is linear, these filters can be combined into a single filter, the mtf of the entire system. With this function in hand, any image can be filtered to the same resolution and contrast as that viewed by a newborn infant. However, although the optics of the infant eye can be measured in theory and the retinal contribution to the mtf can be theoretically calculated, the newborn perception of the detected image is not available for analysis. What one can measure, however, is the csf, as shown in figure 1. It describes at what contrast a certain frequency grating becomes undetectable. Both the csf and the system mtf share the same cutoff frequency, beyond which no contrast is transferred — the resolution limit of the system. In order to find the remaining mtf values so as to simulate image formation in infants, we make the following assumption: where mtfand mtfcorrespond to the contrast loss of the entire visual system. That is, we assume that the shift in contrast sensitivity between adults and infants is the same as the shift in contrast reduction"

        "summary": "A ferry accident in the philippines yesterday might result in the grim total of about 200 deaths. So far, 32 bodies have been found, but another 170 are missing, reports afp. Authorities fear most were trapped inside the ferry after it collided with a cargo ship near the busy port city of cebu and sank within 10 minutes. As bad as the numbers are, they could be much worse: the ferry had 831 passengers and crew on board, most of whom were rescued from the water. \" there is a blind spot there, and each ship passing through needs to give way in a portion of that narrow strip, \" says a government official. The ferry was entering the port and the cargo ship leaving, and the official speculates that one of the vessels ventured into the wrong shipping lane. Philippines has an awful track record on maritime safety, and reuters reports that it's not unusual for dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people to die each year in ferry accidents. They're a common mode of travel from island to island, and the one involved in yesterday's accident had been in operation for 40 years.",

        "summary": "Drugs in our sewage are an issue of continuing concern: a few years back, researchers found that treatment plants were only getting rid of about half of them. Now, a new study suggests that the problem goes beyond a failure to eradicate the drugs: researchers found that levels of two drugs appear to end up even higher after treatment, environmental health news reports. How could this be? well, researchers theorize that microbes in the sewage — which act as a tool for treatment plants by breaking down organic material — are also acting like tiny drug makers. By the time drugs exit our bodies, they've already been separated into various substances; once they get into the treatment plant, the theory goes, the microbes take those ingredients and reconstruct the drugs. That could explain why the concentrations of two drugs — carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic, and ofloxacin, an antibiotic — in the water were found to increase by an average of 80 % and 120 %, respectively, after sewage treatment in the milwaukee area. The other 46 drugs the study detected, however, didn't increase after treatment, and more research is needed to explain why. When it comes to pharmaceuticals in drinking water, the world health organization has reported only a \" very low risk to human health. \" other creatures, however, may have more to worry about. Scientists recently found that male minnows who encounter a diabetes drug that's \" ubiquitous \" in our sewage end up with feminized sex organs, environmental health news reported last month. To help reduce the problems of drugs in sewage, the epa has urged people not to flush medicine down the toilet. ( maybe you shouldn't flush coffee, either. )",

        "summary": "We're not so lucky as to have a genetic mutation that keeps us away from sugar — but that's the case with some cockroaches, which scientists reveal have quickly evolved in a way that keeps them away from glucose, a popular ingredient in roach-poison bait. That cockroaches have grown resistant to a poison would be relatively unremarkable, reports the new york times; what makes this a \" fantastic discovery, \" in the words of an entomologist not involved in the study, is that the bugs developed an aversion to any bait with glucose in it. The behavior was first spotted in florida in the 1980s, reports the ap, which marvels that the trait became widespread in as few as five years, or 25 generations of cockroaches; and it's finally been explained by a trio of us researchers. They studied german cockroaches, and found that roaches had evolved such that when their taste hairs encounter the sweet glucose, nerve cells register a bitter taste instead, repelling them. ( interestingly, ap notes that the studied cockroaches actually ate most kinds of bait they were presented with, indicating that manufacturers have tweaked their recipes, which are a trade secret. ) the research, published in science, may help explain the behavior of other pests, like malaria-spreading mosquitoes, which have evolved to no longer \" rest on walls that are treated with insecticide, \" says one of the scientists; he speculates that his cockroach research could serve as a tool in discovering why.",

The way the roach's senses changed, experts say, is an elegant example of quick evolutionary change in behavior, and offers the multibillion-dollar pest control industry valuable insights into enemy secrets, perhaps even revealing some clues for the fight against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, which are far more dangerous to human health than roaches.

        "summary": "In 2004, one in 10 american women under the age of 45 with cancer in one breast opted to have the second, healthy breast removed as well. Just eight years later, it had increased to one in three women, according to a study published wednesday in jama surgery. When looking at breast cancer patients of all ages in 2012, only 13 % opted to have the healthy breast removed with the cancerous one; but that's still a major increase from 4.5 % in 2004. The new york times reports there's no evidence that removing a healthy breast will reduce a person's chances of dying from breast cancer in the future. In fact, the american board of internal medicine and the american society of breast surgeons recommend against it. So, it's unclear why breast cancer patients are increasingly choosing to go that route. Ahmedin jemal, senior author of the study, tells cnn it may be for symmetry or because of the widespread coverage of angelina jolie's choice to have both breasts removed. Or maybe patients just don't believe doctors when they say removing a healthy breast doesn't significantly reduce their risk of developing breast cancer a second time. Jemal also says there was a \" very striking \" — and unexplained — geographical difference in the number of women choosing to have a healthy breast removed, reuters reports. The highest rates were seen in five contiguous states in the midwest; the lowest in hawaii. ( meanwhile, a report found the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer could double by 2030. )",

It filed for bankruptcy in september and announced it was closing 182 stores in january. \" the last six months have been pure hell, \" the journal quotes brandon as saying. Toys r us has been hurt by competitors with better deals like amazon and walmart, and brandon says sales during the most recent holiday season were \" no short of devastating. \" brandon says shoppers who failed to support toys r us in the past year \" will all live to regret what's happening here. \" a group of toy makers — to which toys r us owed over $ 21 million when it filed for bankruptcy — is seeking to buy up to 400 stores to continue operating under the toys r us name.

The mount dora city council unanimously agreed tuesday that lubomir jastrzebski and nancy nemhauser can keep the blue-and-yellow paint swirled on their walls in the style of van gogh's painting the starry night, reports the orlando sentinel. The settlement agreement also says the city must pay them $ 15,000 and remove a property lien to end the nearly yearlong code enforcement case. Mayor nick girone reportedly planned a public apology on wednesday, reports the ap. \" we are absolutely delighted and ecstatic, \" nemhauser tells the sentinel. \" i ' m unhappy that we had to go through all of this, but the ending is a happy ending. \" the artist who painted the murals, richard barrenechea, calls it \" a big day for the arts. \" nemhauser and jastrzebski painted a wall of the house in the likeness of the starry night about a year ago, as a way to \" relax \" their 25-year-old autistic son, who's a fan of the painter. That earned them a citation from the city, which said the house must be painted a solid color and that the van gogh theme was distracting to drivers. The couple then doubled down and painted the entire house in tribute to the starry night.",

The researchers confirmed that the monkeys — which they call the \" couch potatoes \" of the colony — had shed the white body fat linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. They hope to begin human trials of the drug within a year. The monkeys began to put on weight again four weeks after they stopped taking the drug. Its creators say that if it works in humans, it should be used as a way to kick-start a diet and exercise program for permanent weight loss. \" how energizing would it be to lose 11 % that first month, \" one researcher tells msnbc. \"that's going to really get you focused. \"",

Marcin kasprzak, 25, was convicted following a trial at leeds crown court but co-defendant patryk borys, 18, was cleared. The victim was michelina lewandowska, 27, the mother of kasprzak's child. She was placed in a box and buried in the ground in woods near huddersfield, west yorkshire, in may. She managed to escape by scratching at the box with her engagement ring.

The 31-year-old new york man was arrested on dwi charges twice in the same morning, at the same oneonta mcdonald's, wktv reports. Police first arrested him at 12: 56am last sunday after he allegedly hit the car ahead of him in the drive-thru, and charged him with dwi after finding his bac to be 0.25 — more than three times the legal limit, wtsp reports. A sober person came to pick him up, and police probably thought they'd seen the last of him for the day. But they were wrong: they had to arrest him again at 5: 16am, when he allegedly hit the building with his car and fled the scene. Police found his damaged car outside his home and he was once again arrested and then released to a sober person — after being treated for injuries sustained when he allegedly hit the mcdonald's. This wasn't boynton's first brush with the law: he was also arrested on suspicion of dwi, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct back in november.

But that's exactly what happened, with the couple telling the new york times they were \" shocked \" to later find out the skeleton — which they initially thought belonged to a cow — unearthed beneath 7 feet of clay was that of a pleistocene era horse. The horse skeleton is believed to be between 14,000 and 16,000 years old, paleontologist rick hunter tells live science, which notes it's rare to find horse remains in the beehive state because it was underwater about 14,000 years ago, including under the prehistoric lake bonneville ( a precursor to today's great salt lake ). How this particular equine tumbled to the bottom of the lake that used to be on the hills ' property isn't clear, but hunter theorizes the creature may have run into the water to escape a predator and then drowned, or perhaps perished in a nearby stream that eventually dumped its waters into the lake. The erstwhile horse has been through some rough times: landscaping machinery crushed its skull, some of its bones have been damaged from exposure, and spectators have messed around with it. Hunter says the horse, of unknown gender, appears to be an older one that suffered from arthritis and had a cancerous growth on one of its legs. Researchers plan to preserve the remains, then test them further, while the hills decide whether to donate the skeleton to lehi's museum of ancient life.

        "summary": "Skippy peanut butter has been yanked out of the canadian marketplace by parent company hormel, whose spokesman laments the \" incredibly difficult decision \" to discontinue the brand there, leaving just a few, if any, jars on store shelves, per the cbc. Even though skippy is still available in more than 60 other countries, including next-door in the states, hormel says it wasn't doing well in canada on the competition and pricing fronts. A dalhousie university professor points out the brand could have also suffered from high distribution costs: it's expensive to spread skippy across canada's wide expanse to reach its relatively small population of 36 million. Adding labels in french ( the country's other official language with english ) also may have boosted costs. Whispers of the skippy shrinkage started late last year, but with shelves basically empty, skippy devotees are snapping up spare jars wherever they can find them, including drugstore shelves and online. A container on amazon's canadian site can go from $ 7 for a 12-ounce jar to nearly $ 40 for a 40-ounce jar of the \" natural \" version with honey ( the cbc says a reduced-fat version has been seen with a price tag nearing $ 100 ). \" i ' m really mad at skippy, \" jim hazzard of alliston tells the cbc, noting he has to ration his remaining stockpile. So why can't those near the border simply head into the us to stock up as needed? nutritional information reveals what some fans suspected: the us version has more sugar than the canadian one. \" it just changes the whole flavor, \" a disappointed hazzard says.

The brothers, who were being raised by their maternal grandparents, reportedly didn't want to visit their father, and charlie had begun to talk of seeing \" mommy in the trunk \" of the family car. Powell had planned the deaths for days, say police. He had given away all the boys'toys and sent emails to friends, cousins, and pastors telling them how to dispose of his money and house, reports the seattle times. He had just lost another custody hearing, and said he couldn't live without his sons. Grandfather chuck cox said he feared that powell would kill the boys. \" we stated our fear many times, that if he was feeling desperate he would possibly kill himself and the boys, \" said cox, adding that they had shared their concerns with officials. \" they were all aware of our fears — that he would take a cowardly way out. \"",

The main goal is \" to stop the lies about what these drugs do, \" says the district attorney in orange county, where there is a painkiller-releated death every other day, according to the lawsuit. \" it's always been my opinion that big pharma is the head of the snake, \" a father whose son died from an overdose tells the oc register. \" they flood the market with a very powerful opiate that shouldn't be prescribed but for a very small portion of patients.

Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than a newly discovered cave system some 20 feet below montreal, quebec. Suspecting that a cave beneath a montreal park expanded wider and deeper than anyone knew, luc le blanc and daniel caron of the quebec speleological society dug through soft limestone in october and found the \" incredible \" chamber, per the cbc. On the other side was a network of caves stretching the length of two football fields. It was shaped roughly 10,000 years ago as rock was pulled apart by glaciers, evident in rock wall outcrops that would fit like puzzle pieces into those across the expanse, littered by stalactites and stalagmites formed over millennia. As le blanc tells the bbc, it's \" the kind of discovery you make once in a lifetime. \" but it wasn't without challenges. Once through the limestone ceiling of the network, le blanc and caron traversed a rock wall and found themselves at the end of a sloping passageway halted by deep water. \" the walls are perfectly vertical. It's just beautiful, \" le blanc says, per the cbc. \" the walls just opened through the pressure of the glacier above about 15,000 years ago, \" he adds, though officials put the date at 10,000 years ago. Le blanc and caron have since used a boat to explore all but 50 yards of the cave network. National geographic reports they're waiting until february, when the water table lowers, to explore it in full. That's something the public will also be able to do, once efforts are made to protect the stalactites and stalagmites, per the cbc. ( see what cave stalagmites reveal about iran. )",

New york perp walks date to 80 years ago, when weegee -- the legendary tabloid photographer -- and his peers shot their quarry with boxy speed graphic cameras and blinding flashbulbs. Most accused criminals facing a perp walk in new york have trudged gloomily to their turn with the modern equivalent of 30 seconds in the public stocks. On the other hand, mobster john gotti managed to transform his march of shame into a perp strut. Strauss-kahn seemed more angry than abashed during his walk. And now that the allegations against the frenchman have been called into question, sharp criticism of pillorying at the hands of the media has led some to conclude that the old police-media tradition of orchestrated perp walks has run its course. Ban the walk? the national association of criminal defense lawyers says perp walks invite bias against their clients. A brooklyn city councilman, david greenfield, has proposed a local law that would ban them. \" even mother teresa dragged out by detectives would look guilty, \" he says.

Imich, whose research on a polish medium was published in a german academic journal in the 1930s, maintained his interest in parapsychology throughout his life and edited a book called incredible tales of the paranormal in 1995.

Per the report, the self-driving system also failed in identifying the woman, reuters reports, first classifying her as an unknown object six seconds before impact, then as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle ( she was carrying a bike across the road ) before finally, 1.3 seconds before impact, determining it needed to execute an emergency brake. But since those maneuvers had been disabled, the 2017 volvo xc90 ultimately struck and killed elaine herzberg, 49. The safety operator behind the wheel of the vehicle, who can be seen in a video looking down until just before the crash, told the ntsb she was monitoring the self-driving system interface at the time. The report also notes that herzberg, who tested positive for pot and methamphetamine, did not look toward the suv until just before she was hit and was not in a crosswalk at the time. Per the report, uber had disabled the emergency braking system, with which xc90s are typically equipped, while the vehicle was under computer control to \" reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior, \" the wall street journal reports. But uber had not, per the ntsb, programmed the system to alert the driver of the need to brake, usa today reports. \" as their investigation continues, we've initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, \" said uber in a statement thursday. The company suspended its self-driving testing program in arizona after the crash, which was the first time a fully self-driving vehicle has caused a death.

If confirmed, that would make it the \" oldest gold of mankind, \" a title that has been held by gold found in varna, a city along bulgaria's black sea coast, reports discovery news. \" i have no doubt that it is older than the varna gold, \" which dates to 200 years later, bulgarian professor yavor boyadzhiev tells reuters. The 13 pounds of varna gold are still not thoroughly understood, reports smithsonian. Varna's people were thought to have been farmers who had come from the anatolia peninsula just a few centuries before the gold was processed. \" how they were able to master [ that ]... In that short span of time \" remains a mystery. With the new discovery at tell yunatsite, our understanding of man's ability to process gold, and the area over which it occurred, expand. Reuters reports that the excavations at tell yunatsite — first excavated in 1939 and the site of ongoing digs since 1976 — have surfaced what boyadzhiev calls the \" prototype of a modern town \" over some 25 to 30 acres. A website on the excavations notes that only a third of the tell ( an archaeological mound ) has been excavated. A 2012 popular archaeology article about the site notes it \" may have been europe's first civilization, \" and met an unfortunate end. Violence befell the settlement around 4100 bc. \" many skeletons of children, elderly men, and women were found scattered on floors, suggesting a massive massacre. \" ( archaeologists are currently hunting for some legendary gold. )",

His solution: when problems arise, hotel owners and restaurant owners should contact tripadvisor or his association. Tripadvisor is trying to take action, but it's complicated. Blackmailers can be subtle, for one thing: \" these so-called reviewers will complain about the meal or the service and when you ask how to put it right, you can guarantee it will be some sort of freebie, \" says a steakhouse owner.

At last, scientists think they know the cause, but it isn't pretty — the feces of tiny, spider-like mites that live in your pores, reports new scientist. The mites are called demodex, and scientists have known about them a long time. We all have them living in our pores, usually 20 to 30 per square inch of facial skin. They love to hang out around your eyebrows and eyelashes and eat your facial oil. Gross, yes, but even grosser for people with rosacea: they can have up to 10 times the number of mites in their skin. Because demodex mites don't have anuses, they don't poop, and their feces just builds up in their bodies until they die, usually inside our pores. For people with rosacea, when all those critters die, it releases a lot of fecal bacteria all at once, causing an immune reaction and inflammation.

            "Abstract rosacea is a common dermatological condition that predominantly affects the central regions of the face. Rosacea affects up to 3 % of the world's population and a number of subtypes are recognized. Rosacea can be treated with a variety of antibiotics ( e.g. Tetracycline or metronidazole ) yet no role for bacteria or microbes in its aetiology has been conclusively established. The density of demodex mites in the skin of rosacea patients is higher than in controls, suggesting a possible role for these mites in the induction of this condition. In addition, bacillus oleronius, known to be sensitive to the antibiotics used to treat rosacea, has been isolated from a demodex mite from a patient with papulopustular rosacea and a potential role for this bacterium in the induction of rosacea has been proposed. Staphylococcus epidermidis has been isolated predominantly from the pustules of rosacea patients but not from unaffected skin and may be transported around the face by demodex mites. These findings raise the possibility that rosacea is fundamentally a bacterial disease resulting from the over proliferation of demodex mites living in skin damaged as a result of adverse weathering, age or the production of sebum with an altered fatty acid content. This review surveys the literature relating to the role of demodex mites and their associated bacteria in the induction and persistence of rosacea and highlights possible therapeutic options.",

Potentially ugly: the race has gotten increasingly bitter of late — see sanders here and clinton here — a \" stark contrast \" to the campaign's early days, notes cnn.

Clinton strategy: in earlier debates, she's taken the \" uninspiring position \" of siding with sanders in spirit but calling his proposals too unrealistic, says a post at the new york times. \" the debate could be her best opportunity, before the end of primary voting in june, to convey a vision of the presidency more enthralling than the pragmatic pursuit of incremental liberal policy change. \" two big issues: with the debate in new york city, expect questions about wall street and terrorism. At least on the surface, the first plays to sanders'strengths, while clinton can use her foreign policy experience on the latter, notes abc news. Can either turn the tables? that interview: the hill is watching to see whether sanders can recover from the perception that he's big on talk but short on policy logistics following his interview with the daily news editorial board.

In what the new york times calls \" taking a page from jules verne, \" microsoft has tested a prototype of an underwater data center powered by renewable energy generated by ocean movement. One of the big benefits of housing data centers under cold ocean water: you don't need 24/7 air conditioning to cool servers. Another benefit is the relatively close proximity of large urban populations to oceans, as opposed to today's data centers in out-of-the way places with plenty of room. The closer the user is to the data center, the less delay in streaming video or using social media. One microsoft engineer working on the project — dubbed project natick — tells the times his first impression was: \" water, electricity … why would you do that. \" but, he says, \" it actually makes a lot of sense. \" microsoft believes that using mass-produced underwater capsules could cut the time it takes to deploy a data center from two years to 90 days. For now, though, project natick has a single prototype named leona philpot, a character from microsoft's halo. The prototype spent 105 days between august and november in 30 feet of water in the pacific ocean off san luis obispo, calif. Leona performed well, per the times. The next step is building a larger system and testing it next year. While microsoft is going underwater to improve the cloud, google and facebook are taking to the sky to deliver the internet, venture beat reports.

In a secretive project codenamed skybender, the technology giant built several prototype transceivers at the isolated spaceport last summer, and is testing them with multiple drones, according to documents obtained under public records laws. In order to house the drones and support aircraft, google is temporarily using 15,000 square feet of hangar space in the glamorous gateway to space terminal designed by norman foster for the much-delayed virgin galactic spaceflights.

        "summary": "California hasn't executed anybody for more than a decade, but some death row inmates are still being killed by lethal drugs. Records from the coroner's office reveal that between 2010 and 2015, at least six condemned san quentin inmates died with methamphetamine, heroin, or other drugs in their systems, including a man who died with five meth- and pot-stuffed latex glove fingers in his intestines, the los angeles times reports; at least one had burst. Over the same period, at least eight other death row inmates were hospitalized for non-lethal drug overdoses, records reveal. The death row problem mirrors rampant drug abuse throughout the california prison system. So where are the drugs coming from? former san quentin workers tell the times that death row security is so tight that the contraband is likely being supplied by staff members. But there are apparently a few security holes: the marin independent journal reports that on thursday, a los angeles teacher was arrested and charged with supplying heroin to death row inmate bruce millsap, a member of the east coast crips gang. Authorities say teri orina nichols circumvented security measures to bring in three ounces of heroin for millsap, along with 18 cell phones, 18 chargers, and even some food. ( san quentin's death row is running out of room for new prisoners. )",

            "Bruce millsap is on death row for the murders of eight people in southern california in the 1990s. ( san quentin state prison photo ) a los angeles teacher has been charged with smuggling heroin and cellphones to a san quentin inmate on death row for eight murders. Teri orina nichols, 47, of bellflower, is free on bail and scheduled to return for arraignment sept. 13. She could face up to four years in jail under the charges, said deputy district attorney kevin o ' hara. Nichols was arrested at the prison on thursday during a visit with bruce millsap, a member of the east coast crips gang. Millsap, 50, was condemned in 2000 for a series of murders and robberies in los angeles, orange and san bernardino counties. During the visit, a prison officer noticed plastic bags in the trash can of a visiting chamber occupied only by nichols and millsap. The bags were inconsistent with any packaging from snacks available from the vending machines, so officers removed millsap for a strip search. The search turned up no contraband. Officers then asked nichols whether she would consent to a search, according to a prison arrest report. Nichols admitted to bringing food for millsap in the plastic bags. She also produced a large cloth beanie under her clothing that contained 18 cellphones, 18 cellphone chargers, two unidentified blue pills and about 3 ounces of heroin, the prison alleges. Nichols was arrested and booked into marin county jail, then released on bail. On friday morning, the marin county district attorney's office filed a felony charge of bringing heroin into prison and a misdemeanor charge of smuggling cellphones to an inmate. \"we are evaluating how she was successful in circumventing our security measures, \" said prison lt.

Tesla ceo elon musk has already been vocal about this issue, and in a conference call with the press this week acknowledged that the company has already been quietly testing the idea of bundling insurance and routine maintenance into the upfront cost of its cars in asia, reports electrek. \" it's our vision in the future that we will be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer, \" says the president of sales and services. The announcement reveals just how confident musk is in the increased safety and lowered maintenance of his fleet, reports mashable. For the consumer, the lack of monthly insurance bills and unexpected repair costs means that the initial price tag is more meaningful, while business insider notes that insurers like travelers and mercury general have noted in sec filings that driverless cars could threaten their business models. But fewer wrecks means fewer costly claims, not to mention saved lives. On the call, musk sounded confident that insurance providers will eventually \" adjust insurance costs proportionate to the risk of a tesla. \" if not, he says, \" we will in-source it. \" mashable reports there's no word on what the bundle would cost.

Joey salceda, governor of the albay province, ordered the evacuation of everyone within a 5-mile radius of the crater, while the region within 4 miles of the volcano was declared a \" permanent no-go danger zone. \" his order came on the heels of the philippine institute of volcanology and seismology raising the alert status to level 3, indicating that a \" hazardous eruption \" could take place within weeks, yahoo philippines reports. The area had already been experiencing quakes and falling rocks, reuters reports. The volcano, located slightly more than 200 miles southeast of manila, is known around the world for its nearly perfectly shaped cone — but also for its tumultuous temperament. It has erupted 50 times over the past five centuries, notes the ap, including a devastating 1814 eruption that killed more than 1,200 people, the bbc reports. Locals have even taken to putting up white crosses to ward off bad luck, according to the ap, but officials aren't banking on superstition-driven preemptive strikes to keep the lava at bay. \" it's already erupting, but not explosive, \" says an institute official. \" currently, the activity is just lava coming down.
