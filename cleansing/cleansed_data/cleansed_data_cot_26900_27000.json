        "summary": "Pepsico has just made a big investment in a future that sees consumers more likely to reach for a bottle of water than a sugar-filled soda. The company agreed to buy sodastream for $ 3.2 billion as a part of a shift toward healthier products, reports the wall street journal. Sodastream is best known for its countertop device that allows people to convert tap water into carbonated water in their own kitchens with reusable bottles, reports usa today. Sodastream, based in israel, has seen its stock surge over the last few years as it shifted its primary focus to homemade sparkling water, reports cnn money. Prior to that, it billed itself as a maker of homemade soda ( consumers can add flavored syrup to the water if they wish ). \" the transaction is likely the first of several other initiatives to re-orient pepsico's beverage portfolio towards healthier, on-trend categories, \" wrote bmo capital markets analyst amit sharma. \" while sodastream products are sold through 80,000-plus retail locations in 45 countries, it has significant geographic expansion opportunities. \" the deal meshes with market stats: americans bought more bottled water than carbonated sodas for the first time in 2016, and the gap widened to 13.7 billion gallons vs. 12.3 billion gallons last year, according to beverage marketing. What's more, sales growth of sparkling water in particular far outpaced the growth of bottled water overall. The move follows pepsico's february launch of its bubly sparkling waters.",

The comcast service, called xfinity streampix, will be available this week to the company's subscribers. It will cost $ 5 per month, below netflix's $ 8 monthly price for its internet-streaming service. Some comcast customers who pay for multiple services, including high-speed internet access and phone, will get streampix at no additional cost. Although it appears netflix's library is more extensive, streampix could be good enough for some households looking to supplement their cable-tv service with a package that has on-demand video on computers and mobile devices.

It will be free to customers who get their video, internet and phone service from comcast. People who get only their tv from the company will pay $ 5 per month. Netflix streaming costs $ 8 per month. While the new service inevitably drew comparisons to netflix, and spurred a 3 % drop in that company's stock tuesday, there are notable differences. Comcast's initial agreements with walt disney co., sony pictures, warner bros., and nbc universal ( which the cable giant owns ) provide it with less content than netflix currently offers.

That possibility apparently unnerved some investors who have long worried about netflix losing its early lead in internet video as more rivals enter the market. Netflix's stock lost $ 4.45, or 3.7",
            "This post has been corrected, as indicated below. With an eye toward holding onto current subscribers and attracting new ones who may be tempted by netflix, comcast corp. Is rolling out a new subscription streaming service that boasts a mix of tv re-runs and older films. Called xfinity streampix, the service launches this week and allows users to watch content on televisions and internet-connected digital devices like smartphones. It will be free to customers who get their video, internet and phone service from comcast. People who get only their tv from the company will pay $ 5 per month. Netflix streaming costs $ 8 per month. While the new service inevitably drew comparisons to netflix, and spurred a 3 % drop in that company's stock tuesday, there are notable differences. Comcast's initial agreements with walt disney co., sony pictures, warner bros., and nbc universal ( which the cable giant owns ) provide it with less content than netflix currently offers. Xfinity streampix users will get access to television shows like \" 30 rock \" and \" grey's anatomy \" and films like \" brokeback mountain \" and \" ocean's eleven, \" but can't watch tv shows like \" mad men \" and movies like \" drive \" that are exclusively on netflix.

Despite the spokesperson's assurances, politico reported that a commercial flight costing hundreds of dollars departed washington's dulles airport for philadelphia at almost the exact same time that price left washington for philadelphia on a $ 25,000 private flight last week. Previous health secretaries traveled by commercial airline, and price — who supported an 18 % hhs budget cut for fiscal 2018 — \" certainly seems no busier than they were, and certainly no more deserving of special treatment, \" says sen. Richard blumenthal, referring to price's travel as \" potentially improper and perhaps illegal. \" five other democrats from the house and senate have urged the hhs inspector general to investigate. In a letter, they cite federal travel regulations stating chartered aircraft is only an option when it is \" the most cost-effective mode of travel. \" cnbc takes a look back at a 2009 interview in which price referred to a plan by house democrats to buy passenger jets as \" another example of fiscal irresponsibility run amok in congress. \"",

High-resolution photos helped researchers get a closer look at what they now think are drawings added to the 54-page tome after its creation. They were perhaps erased by someone named jaspar gryffyth, who penned his name in the book now housed at the national library of wales. \" it was a living text that was constantly added to, \" but \" this man in the 16th century went through the book tidying it up, \" researcher paul russell tells the bbc. \" the owner erased a lot of material from the left, right, top, and bottom margins.

Having removed between 150 and 200 homeless people from an encampment along the santa ana river in southern california earlier this month, officials were clearing the camp when they discovered a trap door in the ground this week. According to the los angeles times, the plywood door covered in dirt revealed a set of wooden steps that led to a 10-foot-by-10-foot room 6 feet underground. The room, which was empty, was supported by wood beams and tall enough to stand in. It's unclear who built it or what it was used for. \" that someone had a whole downstairs living arrangement … it's weird that they built it without us knowing, \" says a woman living in a nearby condominium. That wasn't the only interesting discovery made by officials since they started clearing the camp earlier this month. More than 1,000 bicycles were found in a tunnel along the concrete river bed. \"i've been doing this job for 20 years and even i was stunned by that one, \" puckett says. It's unclear how many of the bicycles were stolen, but puckett says the public will likely get a chance to see if their missing bikes are among them. \"common sense would usually dictate if you have 1,000 bikes in a tunnel, some of them could be stolen, \" puckett says. Officials also found a.357 magnum handgun with three empty shell casings in it near the camp. They are investigating where it came from.

        "summary": "Having health insurance means saving money on prescriptions, right? not necessarily. A study published tuesday in jama found insurance co-pays for generic drugs were actually higher than the cost of the drug 28 % of the time. For name-brand drugs, it was 6 %. Say your insurance has a $ 10 co-pay for prescription drugs; sometimes you're paying that $ 10 co-pay when the drug only costs $ 7, according to an example in the los angeles times. Charging a co-pay higher than the cost of the drug is known as a \" clawback. \" \"this is money that patients could be saving if they knew about and could avoid the practice, \" lead study author karen van nuys tells reuters. Co-author geoffrey joyce adds to the times: \" you're penalizing people for having insurance. \" the study looked at 9.5 million claims for prescriptions in 2013. It found 2.2 million of those included clawbacks totaling $ 135 million. The average clawback was $ 7.69. The most frequent clawback was on zolpidem tartrate, which is generic ambien. Twelve of the 20 most commonly prescribed drugs were cheaper than co-pays 33 % of the time or more. To avoid clawbacks, health policy researcher stacie dusetzina says people should always ask pharmacists if it would be cheaper to pay directly for their prescriptions rather than using insurance. However, some some insurance plans bar pharmacists from telling patients when they could get their prescriptions cheaper by paying cash.

        "summary": "The number of americans catching diseases from tiny bloodsucking creatures is going up at an alarming rate, federal authorities warn. According to the latest report from the centers for disease control and prevention, the number of reported illnesses caused by ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas more than tripled between 2004 and 2016 — and since many illnesses go unreported, the true total is probably much higher than the 642,602 cases reported over the period. In the case of lyme disease, which is spread by ticks, the number of illnesses may be up to 10 times the 36,429 cases the cdc recorded for 2016, the washington post reports. Lyme and other tick-borne diseases like rocky mountain spotted fever accounted for 75 % of what the cdc calls \" vectorborne disease cases. \" the cdc says tick-borne diseases — including recently discovered ones like powassan virus — are on the rise in the northeast, california, and the upper midwest, the new york times reports. Analysts say warmer weather, which is causing longer tick seasons and expanded insect ranges, has certainly played a role in the rise in infections, though there are certainly other factors: the increase in jet travel is helping disease spread more quickly than in the past, and the reforesting of suburban areas combined with the decline in deer hunting has created a good environment and an ample supply of hosts for the creatures. The times has a guide on how to protect yourself from ticks and mosquitoes. Experts say it's a good idea to steer clear of downed logs and tall, grassy fields.",

            "Conclusions and comments these data indicate persistent, locality-specific risks and a rising threat from emerging vectorborne diseases, which have increasingly encumbered local and state health departments tasked with preventing, detecting, reporting, and controlling them. The overall case number masks two distinct trends. Epidemics characterize the mosquitoborne viruses. Wnv transmission is effectively limited to the continental united states, whereas most dengue, chikungunya, and zika virus transmission occurred in the territories. By contrast, the increasing reports of tickborne disease, which occurs almost exclusively in the continental united states, has been gradual. The area at risk for lyme disease has been expanding ( 14 ). Although lyme disease accounts for 82 % of all reported tickborne diseases, spotted fevers, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis have become increasingly prevalent. Diseases caused by pathogens that were relatively uncommon during the 13-year analysis period remain important because of their historical potential to cause epidemics ( e.g., st. Louis encephalitis virus ), their high case fatality rates ( e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus ), or their potential as bioterror agents ( e.g., plague and tularemia ). The reported data substantially underestimate disease occurrence. Nndss relies on a person seeking care, a clinician requesting appropriate tests, and providers or laboratories reporting to public health authorities. Recent data from clinical and laboratory diagnoses estimate that lyme disease infects approximately 300,000 americans yearly, eight- to tenfold more than the number reported ( 15,16 ). Many arbovirus infections result in minimal symptoms. It has been estimated that 30 – 70 nonneuroinvasive arboviral disease cases occur for every wnv neuroinvasive disease case reported ( 17 ). Based on the number of neuroinvasive disease cases reported in 2016, between 39,300 and 91,700 nonneuroinvasive disease cases of wnv would have been expected"

        "summary": "The fix is in on wall street, and high-speed trading firms are reaping the rewards — at least according to moneyball author michael lewis. Pitching his new book, flash boys: a wall street in revolt, lewis tells 60 minutes that big firms beat smaller companies to the punch by thousandths or even millionths of a second with sophisticated computer software, reuters reports. The firms \" are able to identify your desire to buy shares in microsoft and buy them in front of you and sell them back to you at a higher price, \" he says. How so? via high-frequency trading ( hft ), a practice involving gobs of simultaneous orders submitted at amazing speeds. Lewis based his book on brad katsuyama, a canadian trader who discovered that his stock orders were visible to big trading firms — which rapidly bought up lots of shares and sold them to his bank at a higher price. So katsuyama started iex, a company that successfully shopped new software around wall street to prevent smaller equity-market players from getting bilked. Some firms are trying to destroy iex, cbs news reports, but new york attorney general eric schneiderman is meeting with us exchanges to discuss reforms. Advocates say hft brings liquidity to markets, bloomberg reports, but barry ritholz writes at bloomberg view that \" their claims of added liquidity laughable.

Here's what to look for on the cnn stage: how ted cruz recovers from recent losses. Cruz is likely a bit nervous after losing to donald trump and marco rubio in south carolina and nevada. What could decide his comeback or his undoing: which \" face, \" as npr puts it, shows up in his home state — the \" softer side \" he's shown recently to senate colleagues and others, or the \" embattled and all-but-martyred conservative champion \"; if he can combat the \" liar \" label that's been thrown at him in recent days, per the los angeles times; and whether he turns his fire more on trump or rubio on the debate stage. If rubio can finally stand out as the clear establishment choice. The same dilemma applies to rubio and who he ' ll focus his attacks on: trump, cruz, or both. Either way, as new york times political reporter michael barbaro puts it, rubio can't settle for a decent debate. \" he has to have the biggest night of his campaign, cutting mr. Trump down to size, inflicting real damage [ cruz ], and showing republican voters that [ he ] is both angry and sane enough to be their standard-bearer. \" whether trump, as cnn puts it, will \" go in for the kill. \" he's already claimed victories in new hampshire, nevada, and south carolina, despite sometimes \" shaky \" debate performances and a frontrunner target on his back.

Jimmy sabatino, who's tied to the gambino crime family and was sentenced monday to 20 years in prison in colorado's \" supermax \" facility after pleading guilty to the $ 10.4 million fraud, had asked that he not be allowed to call, talk with, or even pen letters to anyone during his incarceration.

Sabatino, a 40-something who's been in and out of jail since he was a teen, was accused of running a racketeering ring out of his cell at miami's federal detention center. The man the miami herald has called the city's \" most incorrigible con artist \" cajoled federal corrections officers into smuggling him a handful of cellphones, then used those phones to contact luxury retailers like jimmy choo and tiffany as a fake rep for sony and roc nation; he'd then convince the retailers to \" lend \" their jewelry, handbags, and other items to his associates for use in music videos — except his associates, who weren't shooting music videos, would pawn the items and split the cash among themselves, their mob bosses, and sabatino's commissary fund. Sabatino says the government should be \" embarrassed \" he was able to pull off his scam. He added to lenard in court: \" i don't apologize to nobody. \" ( this con man called himself \" mr.

Sabatino, who has spent most of his life since age 19 in prison, persuaded two federal corrections officers at the detention center to provide him with a total of five cellphones, one samsung and four iphones. The officers lost their jobs but have not been criminally charged. Earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy that involved using the smuggled cellphones to dupe luxury retailers into sending expensive jewelry, watches and other items to his associates. The retailers were told the items were on loan and would be featured in music videos and promotional videos that were being shot in miami.

San juan mayor carmen yulin cruz said many people in the us territory need the water and food they've been getting from fema more than four months after hurricane maria devastated the island, per the ap. The mayor said that in recent days, officials have had to deliver powdered milk and water to some parts of the island, where about 35 % of the population still has no power. \" there is need still, \" she told reporters in washington, where she was attending president trump's state of the union address as a guest of new york sen. Kirsten gillibrand. A letter to fema administrator brock long signed by 30 members of congress said the plan to end deliveries of food and water wednesday would especially hurt people in remote parts of puerto rico. \" many puerto rican localities still face significant challenges accessing basic needs, and fema has played a critical role, \" the letter states, per the orlando sentinel. \" now is not the time to remove this life-sustaining assistance. \" fema says it's ending the food and water shipments because private supplies are available; npr reports that whatever fema-related supplies remain will be given to the local government to distribute. The agency says it distributed more than 65 million liters of bottled water and more than 58 million meals and snacks, worth nearly $ 2 billion.",

He criticized the retired neurosurgeon repeatedly, said hillary clinton is playing the \" women's card big league, \" ridiculed marco rubio as \" weak like a baby \" and vowed to \" bomb the s*** out of ( isis ). \" toward the end of his wide-ranging complaints about the country and competition, trump mocked carson's narrative about his violent temper as a youth that was calmed only when he prayed to god and asked for deliverance, an event that carson describes as a miracle.

He told police during what he recalled as \" very tough \" interrogations that he'd seen someone else start the fire, cnn recounts. Taylor was sentenced to life in prison. But the judge has long expressed skepticism about the case, telling 60 minutes recently that the evidence wasn't strong enough to convict — he's even sent taylor christmas gifts and law books, the ap reports. Forensic experts, meanwhile, have said that the original trial's experts \" used methods no longer valid in the science of today \" to declare the blaze as arson. \" today, all that media scrutiny finally resulted in action, as taylor entered a plea of no contest, in a deal that will see him released from prison at last.",

Among the ingredients: the anti-inflammatory aloe, rhubarb, white tumeric, spanish saffron, and a lot of grain alcohol. Many of the ingredients are linked to better digestion, says an herbalist. \" long life has a lot to do with how healthy our guts are, so it makes sense to see these used back then. \" says chrysalis on its blog: \" we're not expecting the results of our experiment to extend life expectancy or threaten the modern gastroenterologist's salary range, but at least we ' ll show off our chemistry prowess and relive the meticulous work and interesting fragrances of yesteryear's snake oil industry. \" dnainfo has the recipe, if you want to bottle the elixir yourself.

A blood clot caused shaleena hamilton to fall down the stairs and break her neck earlier this month, according to syracuse.com. Buffalo news reports neighbors could hear hamilton's son bryan yelling, \" mom, wake up! i ' m hungry, \" but they didn't do anything, figuring kids are always complaining about being hungry. Police credit taijuan littleton, an employee at a rent-a-center where hamilton was a frequent customer, for rescuing bryan, according to usa today. Littleton grew concerned when hamilton didn't return his calls about an upcoming appointment. On dec. 4 — the third day of calling — bryan answered the phone and said he couldn't wake his mom up. Littleton rushed to hamilton's home, where he could hear bryan talking to his mom, buffalo news reports. Littleton called 911 and, after convincing bryan to open the door, kept the child warm until police arrived. Littleton brushed off praise from police. \"any decent human being would have done the same, \" he says. \" i don't think i did anything special. \" but littleton's wasn't the only good deed.

Opponents of the law have already filed two lawsuits against it, the detroit news reports, and they intend to make it the centerpiece of the 2014 election, which will see all the state's legislative seats up for vote. \" if gov. Snyder thinks that michigan citizens will go home and forget about what happened in lansing today, he is sorely mistaken, \" the state's democratic party chairman said. The lawsuits claim that lawmakers violated the open meetings act by continuing proceedings after police put the capitol on lockdown on thursday. But snyder isn't worried. \" i would expect litigation, but i would say there are strong legal arguments that this law should stand, \" he said last night. The issue has raised some passionate responses. For example: somewhere between 13,000 and 18,000 protesters came out yesterday, far more than the 10,000 projected to be there, the daily beast reports. A former us congressman was among several protesters hit with pepper spray during the demonstrations, the huffington post reports. \" people were exercising their first amendment rights, \" democrat mark schauer said. \" unfortunately, some of us are paying a price for it. \" state rep.

We will relive the battle of the overpass, \" the washington examiner reports. He even tweeted the remark, though he has since deleted it. The fight extends beyond michigan.

Seems they argued with the owner's wife about the fee, so she called her husband, 44-year-old jason mclemore, who arrived with 17-year-old son jacob mclemore. But the dispute only grew worse: \" during this argument, we believe there might have been some pushing and shoving, \" says chief deputy shane tucker, per another sun herald article. \" one of the customers and one of the owners produced firearms, \" adds tucker. \" we don't know who shot first. \" the result: jason and jacob mclemore are dead, while the mccools suffered life-threatening injuries ( michael was stable in intensive care on sunday, but no further word yet on his father ). Officials say michael allegedly used a.40-caliber handgun in the fatal shootings, and jason mclemore was found with a 9mm handgun unholstered by his side, wlox reports. Apparently audy got shot in the back, but details are scant and no charges have yet been filed.

Americans haven't become childlike worshipers of big government. On the contrary, trust in government has declined.

            "Back to full list america's response to mass shootings has long followed a predictable pattern. We mourn. Offer thoughts and prayers. Speculate about the motives. And then — even as no developed country endures a homicide rate like ours, a difference explained largely by pervasive accessibility to guns; even as the majority of gun owners support commonsense reforms — the political debate spirals into acrimony and paralysis. This time, something different is happening. This time, our children are calling us to account. The parkland, fla., students don't have the kind of lobbyists or big budgets for attack ads that their opponents do. Most of them can't even vote yet. But they have the power so often inherent in youth: to see the world anew; to reject the old constraints, outdated conventions and cowardice too often dressed up as wisdom. The power to insist that america can be better. Seared by memories of seeing their friends murdered at a place they believed to be safe, these young leaders don't intimidate easily. They see the nra and its allies — whether mealymouthed politicians or mendacious commentators peddling conspiracy theories — as mere shills for those who make money selling weapons of war to whoever can pay. They're as comfortable speaking truth to power as they are dismissive of platitudes"

Because mri machines use extremely powerful magnets, no such metal objects can be in the room when one is powered up, explains the hindustan times. Police say that maru was sucked toward the cylinder, and the arm holding the oxygen canister became trapped and, by some accounts, mangled. As attendants tried furiously to free him, maru inhaled lethal amounts of liquid oxygen that had begun leaking from the canister he'd been holding, according to an autopsy. Police have launched an investigation of \" death by negligence \" against a doctor and two staffers at nair municipal hospital, reports the indian express. The hospital, too, is investigating, though its initial statement emphasized that signs warn people against bringing metal objects into the room. Maru's family is outraged at what they perceive to be the hospital shirking responsibility, and they complain that nobody stopped maru from entering with the oxygen canister. It remained unclear whether the machine was already on, perhaps unnoticed, when maru entered. The accident reportedly happened as maru was helping hospital staff move his relative from one stretcher to another, which highlights another aspect of the story: the regularity with which understaffed hospitals in india ask relatives for such assistance.",

        "summary": "Apple's \" special event \" is today at 1pm eastern, so tech blogs are, of course, overflowing with predictions. What can you expect? here's what 9to5mac and the verge have to say: iphone 5s: that's what most people are calling the new iphone that is sure to debut. It will probably look very similar to the iphone 5 ( except there will be a new gold color option ) and be priced similarly. It is expected to have a better camera ( including an upgraded flash ), an improved processor and battery, and possibly a fingerprint scanner in the home button that can be used instead of a passcode to unlock the phone. This could mean the home button looks different for the first time, possibly with a sapphire crystal covering for protection and a silver ring encircling it. As for those rumored 6-inch iphones, they're still a ways off. Iphone 5c: this will be the cheaper version, and is expected to be based on the iphone 5 internally, but with a colored plastic back. It is not expected to have any of the improvements present in the iphone 5s, and it could cost as little as $ 100. Ios 7: the new iphones are expected to ship with the new operating system, which was previewed in june, and an official release date should be announced today. Ipads: we may have to wait until next month, but the ipad mini is thought to be getting a retina display, while the full ipad is rumored to be coming in a slimmer version. Ipods: there probably won't be any major announcements, but minor upgrades to the ipod nano and the ipod touch are possible. The ipod classic could even be retired, though that rumor has been around for awhile. Macs: we probably won't hear anything today — expect any announcements on this front when os x mavericks launches next month. But better processors are expected in macbook pro and imac soon. Apple tv: expect a software update. Iwatch and itv: sorry, but you ' ll probably still be waiting for these awhile longer. At time, doug aamoth has a slightly different, and amusing, take. A few of his predictions: \" apple exec phil schiller will be wearing a button-down shirt in the blue/gray/green/tan spectrum. \" \" a video of apple employees in front of a white background will be played. These employees will be talking soothingly about the new iphone( s ). \" \" at least a dozen superlatives will be used. \"",

It is widest beach on this stretch of famous sands and protected by an offshore coral reef, making it a good beach for families with children. This is a safe beach with no known drownings. Official lifeguards are not present, but the beach and pool concessionaires have lifeguard training. The nearby duke kahanamoku lagoon is also a favorite bathing and swimming spot. Public access is via kalia road and pahoa place. Surprising to most visitors, this beautiful beach where smoking is not permitted, was created more than half a century ago by dredging through the shallow reef and importing sand.

Dozens of workers have now retrieved more than 50 tons of fish, and while authorities blame the die-off on a change in temperature, an associate professor of aquatic ecology at a rio university tells npr that the lagoon is \" stressed \" and algal blooms have made it increasingly toxic. She says that while it may be safe — but stinky — to row in, falling in would be bad news. Other scientists say the shortage of oxygen killing off the fish, from a small species called twaite shad, is caused by sewage and chemicals that end up in the lagoon, the bbc reports. Guanabara bay, where the sailing and windsurfing events will be held, also has major environmental issues, including super-bacteria, and brazilian authorities have admitted they won't be able to finish the cleanup in time for the 2016 games. Rio mayor eduardo paes tells npr that he'd swim in guanabara bay's murky waters any time, though he doesn't say whether he would do the same in the lagoon where workers are still cleaning up dead fish.

        "summary": "Every elementary school student knows there are seven continents. Or are there? after more than 20 years of investigation, researchers now say there is an eighth continent: zealandia. The christian science monitor reports zealandia is 1.9 million square miles — about two-thirds the size of australia — but is 94 % underwater, so we can all be excused for not noticing it sooner. Only three segments of zealandia peek above the ocean: new caledonia and the north and south islands of new zealand. That's why researchers, in a study published in gsa today, say it's currently seen as \" islands, fragments, and slices. \" while no one is in charge of determining what is or isn't a continent, researchers say zealandia checks all the boxes: it has obvious boundaries and a wide range of geology, its crust is thicker than that of the ocean floor, and it has a higher elevation than the areas around it. \" if we could pull the plug on the oceans, it would be clear to everybody that we have... A big, high-standing continent, \" phys.org quotes the study's lead author, nick mortimer, as saying. Researchers say classifying zealandia as a continent would not only more accurately reflect the situation, but it could potentially teach us more about how continents move and change. Mortimer says they want zealandia to \" appear on world maps, in schools, everywhere. \"",

It's because he doesn't think any of this is a normal reaction. \" this should be very believable … this should be regular, \" he tearfully said wednesday after atlantic city's city council honored him for his actions, per the ap. The video, which has been shared nearly 725,000 times as of this writing, shows the two young men going at it in the street — until miller, a student and dad of five, happened upon the scene while taking care of an errand, the press of atlantic city reports. Positioning himself between the two, miller implores the kids to knock it off, telling them they're \" almost men. \" he also calls out the spectators giggling and recording the scuffle on their phones, deeming them \" cowards, \" then makes the two teens, after some resistance, shake hands. Jamar mobley, one of the boys in the fight ( and on whose phone the fight was recorded ), offered thanks to miller and tells cbs philly \" it could have gone a whole other way \" had miller not stepped in. Miller, for his part, called the two boys, who stood next to him after the council meeting, \" young men of reason \" and thanked their mothers, as well as his own mom for making him write a story or poem whenever he got into trouble as a kid, per the ap. Miller's kindergarten teacher tells the press he was a mediator even as a 5-year-old. \" he was a peacemaker, \" she says. ( a teen fights gun violence in his town. )",

Now, myfox la has obtained a tape of an interview between the now-deceased boyd and an author in which boyd verifies that he has 20 hours of said interviews — and that watson does indeed confirm manson committed more murders than the infamous 1969 killings for which he is jailed. \" [ watson ] told me about a bunch of other people manson had killed, \" says boyd on the audio recording, adding that watson did not implicate himself in the additional murders. Meanwhile, california gov. Jerry brown has 30 days to decide whether manson family member bruce davis should be released on parole, fox news reports. A state parole panel recommended davis for release last year, and the entire state parole board followed suit friday.

Park spokeswoman jessica ferracane said monday that the man was found on the caldera floor about 250 feet below crater rim trail. Two hikers found a backpack on the trail saturday and alerted officials. Rangers began looking for the owner saturday night, but the search was suspended because of dangerous conditions. The body was found sunday morning by rangers searching by helicopter. Ferracane said it is believed the man died from a fall, but an investigation is ongoing. The area is open to visitors, but officials encourage hikers to stay on marked trails. The site does not have an active lava flow, though kilauea is erupting. Since 1990, four people have died from falls around the crater rim."

        "summary": "Serious space junkies might be able to identify the comet on which europe's rosetta space orbiter landed last year as 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko. Everyone else might remember that it kind of looks like a rubber duck. The odd shape has been a topic of debate among scientists, and a new paper in nature reveals that the rubber duck got its shape in relatively simple fashion: two comets collided and stuck together, reports the los angeles times. The tricky part, however, is that it had to be a relatively low-speed collision, slow enough that the comets wouldn't obliterate each other. \" i would say it's a quite beautiful love story, \" says matteo massironi, one of the scientists on the european space agency's rosetta team, per the bbc. The revelation came after an analysis of the comet found that layers of material in some parts don't match up with others. That dispelled another theory, that the comet had been sculpted by erosion into its funky shape. \" if you put it together, it looks like you have two onions sitting next to each other, not a single onion with a piece taken out, \" says another scientist. The finding could shed more light on how comets and even planets are formed, notes the christian science monitor. One piece of bad news for duck fans: rosetta has spied a crack in its neck, raising the possibility that the two original comets will one day go their separate ways again.

The 6-inch skeleton — nearly 2 inches shorter than the shortest baby ever born — had a cone-shaped head, 10 pairs of ribs instead of 12, and the bones of a 6-year-old, the telegraph reports. According to national geographic, the mummy — nicknamed ' ata ' — was sold to a spanish businessman and became the subject of extraterrestrial-related tv shows and a documentary. Dr. Garry nolan heard about ata from a friend in 2012. \"you can't look at this specimen and not think it's interesting. It's quite dramatic, \" nolan tells the telegraph. \" so i told my friend, ' look, whatever it is, if it's got dna, i can do the analysis. \" nolan and his team published the results of that analysis thursday in genome research. They concluded ata is definitely human — a girl who died before or soon after being born. Rather than ancient, the mummy is likely under 40 years old. Ata's bizarre appearance is due to mutations in seven genes that are connected to dwarfism and deformities of the bones and face. Researchers say it's exceedingly rare to see so many mutations in one person and speculate that nitrate mines in the town could be to blame, cnn reports. Moreover, some of the gene mutations in ata had never been seen before, and that could eventually help modern patients. But not everyone is convinced. \"we don't know what it is, but it most certainly is a not a deformed human, \" steven greer tells natgeo. Greer is out to prove the existence of ufos and was the one who gave nolan access to ata.",

            "Abstract over a decade ago, the atacama humanoid skeleton ( ata ) was discovered in the atacama region of chile. The ata specimen carried a strange phenotype — 6-in stature, fewer than expected ribs, elongated cranium, and accelerated bone age — leading to speculation that this was a preserved nonhuman primate, human fetus harboring genetic mutations, or even an extraterrestrial. We previously reported that it was human by dna analysis with an estimated bone age of about 6 – 8 yr at the time of demise. To determine the possible genetic drivers of the observed morphology, dna from the specimen was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the illumina hiseq platform with an average 11.5× coverage of 101-bp, paired-end reads. In total, 3,356,569 single nucleotide variations ( snvs ) were found as compared to the human reference genome, 518,365 insertions and deletions ( indels ), and 1047 structural variations ( svs )",

            "Abstract over a decade ago, the atacama humanoid skeleton ( ata ) was discovered in the atacama region of chile. The ata specimen carried a strange phenotype — 6-in stature, fewer than expected ribs, elongated cranium, and accelerated bone age — leading to speculation that this was a preserved nonhuman primate, human fetus harboring genetic mutations, or even an extraterrestrial. We previously reported that it was human by dna analysis with an estimated bone age of about 6 – 8 yr at the time of demise. To determine the possible genetic drivers of the observed morphology, dna from the specimen was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using the illumina hiseq platform with an average 11.5× coverage of 101-bp, paired-end reads. In total, 3,356,569 single nucleotide variations ( snvs ) were found as compared to the human reference genome, 518,365 insertions and deletions ( indels ), and 1047 structural variations ( svs )",

Monalisa perez, 19, told authorities she was making a video with boyfriend pedro ruiz iii, 22, outside their home monday night that involved her shooting a book ruiz was holding to his chest. Ruiz thought the book would stop the bullet, and perez says she agreed to the stunt after he showed her another book that had halted a bullet, the st. Paul pioneer press reports. Police say she shot ruiz with a.50-caliber handgun from about a foot away, but the book ( a hardcover encyclopedia, per the minneapolis star tribune ) did not stop the bullet, which entered his chest. Two cameras, both of which were turned over to authorities, recorded the fatal shooting. Emergency workers could not save ruiz, who was later declared dead. Ruiz's aunt says the couple's 3-year-old daughter saw the shooting. Perez, who was charged with second-degree manslaughter, is also currently pregnant with a boy due in september. The couple often recorded youtube videos together — perez's channel can be seen here — and just an hour before the shooting, perez had posted on facebook that they were in the process of making ruiz his own channel, which would be full of \" crazy stuff. \" \" they were in love. It was just a prank gone wrong. It shouldn't have happened like this, \" ruiz's aunt tells wday-tv. \" i wish they wouldn't have done it. I wish he would've just done another prank. \" another aunt says ruiz's family is supporting perez: the death of her partner of six years is \" the worst punishment she can get. \"",

        "summary": "A recent anthrax outbreak in russia seems to confirm what a norwegian town already knew — that dying should remain illegal, wn.com reports. The arctic town of longyearbyen, where 2,100 people brave bitter temperatures, has outlawed death since 1950. The reason: permafrost keeps bodies from decomposing in the town cemetery, so deadly viruses could survive and infect the living if the permafrost thaws. That appears to explain a 2016 anthrax outbreak in siberia, where a heatwave melted permafrost and spread the bacterial disease from a dead reindeer, killing more than 2,300 others, the bbc reported at the time. Scientists have also found traces of the spanish influenza in corpses preserved by permafrost in alaska and longyearbyen. The latter find, in 1950, prompted the town's quixotic law. Terminally ill residents are flown away to die, and those who die unexpectedly in longyearbyen are interred elsewhere. The one exception is cremation, because the intense heat either destroys or deactivates viruses, bustle reports. Residents are also encouraged to give birth elsewhere, because the territory — an archipelago called svalbard that lies between norway and the north pole, the bbc notes — has only a small hospital. And longyearbyen isn't the only place to outlaw death: towns from italy to france to spain have done it, often due to cemetery overcrowding, the guardian reports. The oddest anti-death law may be from 5th-century bc delos, a greek island where all tombs were dug up to satisfy the gods. \" and it was proclaimed that in future, no deaths or births were to be allowed on the island, \" writes the historian thucydides.

Guardian journalist samuel gibbs recently conducted his own experiment and found that after deleting the facebook app and instead using the safari browser to access facebook, his iphone had, on average, 15 % more battery life available at the end of each day. Gibbs made sure to use facebook on safari for the same activities and the same amount of time each day, and he had others repeat the experiment — they all got similar results. Bonus: gibbs also had more storage available, since the facebook app had been using about 500mb. Gibbs carried out his experiment after a similar one by android users. As the guardian reported last week, bloggers and reddit users found that after uninstalling the facebook app on android devices, other apps loaded more quickly. Gibbs himself experimented with an android smartphone and found that deleting the facebook app, in that case, saved 20 % of the battery life on average each day. How about user experience? in the case of the iphone, \" using facebook in safari was almost as good as the app, \" gibbs writes, though some features aren't available.

        "summary": "Newly leaked documents show that commerce secretary wilbur ross, the trump administration's point man on trade and manufacturing policy, has a stake in a company that does business with a gas producer partly owned by the son-in-law of russian president vladimir putin, the ap reports. According to records obtained by the international consortium of journalists, ross is an investor in navigator holdings, a shipping giant that counts russian gas and petrochemical producer sibur among its major customers. Putin's son-in-law kirill shamalov once owned more than 20 % of the company, but now holds a much smaller stake. Commerce department spokesman james rockas said ross \" never met \" shamalov and has generally supported the trump administration's sanctions against russia, according to the icij report. Rockas added that ross has withdrawn from matters related to transoceanic shipping vessels and has met the \" highest ethical standards. \" the details are likely to add to the questions about ties between russia and the trump administration, connections that for months have shadowed the white house and are a focus of an investigation by special counsel robert mueller. Yet it wasn't immediately clear how many partners ross might have or what the profit-sharing agreement might be. Icij disclosed the ross holding as part of reporting on 13.4 million records of offshore entities in tax havens leaked to german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung. The newspaper then shared the records with icij and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries. The new york times is its us partner in this inquiry. It wasn't immediately clear exactly how much of navigator, which is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange, ross personally owns. Icij reported that ross and other investors own four cayman island entities that in turn own 31.5 % of navigator, a stake worth $ 176 million at friday's closing stock price. Ross'stake in navigator is likely a small fraction of that.",

Ross's strategy of scooping up shares in undervalued companies and turning them around. It is a business model that has earned mr. Ross, a 79-year-old ivy league-educated son of middle-class parents from new jersey, the sobriquet of \"king of bankruptcy. \" over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the british banking firm rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering trump casinos in atlantic city, preserving a stake for mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the trump name was \"still very much an asset. \" mr. Ross's business practices have occasionally drawn criticism for moving american jobs overseas in an effort to improve profits. A reuters analysis of labor department statistics found that his takeovers shifted 2,700 jobs in automotive, textiles and mortgage finance to, among other places, china, india, mexico and nicaragua. In the statement to the times, mr. Ross's spokesman said, \"private equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and secretary ross has decades of experience that"

But yesterday, the zoo announced mei xiang has been refusing to let workers switch out the panda cubs since 2pm on monday, leaving the larger cub, which weighed 138 grams at birth, in her pen, and the smaller cub, weighing 86 grams, in the care of veterinarians. Though the larger of the siblings probably isn't in any danger — mei xiang is a \" good mother, \" keepers say — the smaller cub is more of a concern. The newborn's weight has been fluctuating since birth and the cub has had digestive problems, regurgitating some of its food, per abc news. Digestive issues could lead to breathing issues, but experts say there's no warning signs for that yet. The \" panda team \" is bottle- and tube-feeding the cub and administering antibiotics and an electrolyte solution under the skin to provide fluids and nutrition. So far, the little cub is doing well, but this is still a \" high-risk period, \" veterinarians say. Zoo keepers are continuing their attempts to switch out the cubs every four hours, though there's no word yet on whether an attempt in the last 20 hours has been successful.",

        "summary": "To be a professional flute player with uncontrollable shaking of the head and hands is less than ideal, and after years of battling a neurological disorder called essential tremor, anna marie whitlock henry decided she'd had enough. So the 63-year-old underwent brain surgery last week to remedy the tremors — and she played her flute throughout the surgery. Khou reports henry on tuesday underwent deep brain stimulation, a procedure in which electrodes are placed in certain parts of a patient's brain to emit electrical impulses to counter any abnormal impulses. Tmc news notes it's been fda-approved for not only essential tremor, but also for treating parkinson's, ocd, and dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. For doctors to be able to see if henry's surgery was working, however, she had to stay awake during the surgery to perform certain tasks. Henry says she inherited her condition from her dad and started experiencing symptoms in junior high. Everyday actions like writing and sewing soon became difficult, and meds stopped working, but for henry, the most devastating effect was on her flute playing. \" it was frustrating to see that [ control ] disappear gradually, \" she says. As for whether henry's surgery worked, tmc says it was \" like flipping a switch \": after the procedure, she now has handwriting that's readable for \" the first time in decades, \" and her or flute performance proved she's able to once again show off her musical talents. Ctv news has video of henry's cranial concerto, after which medical staff in the operating room gave her a rousing round of applause and cheers. Check out tmc news for a full description of henry's surgery. ( in kenya, the wrong patient's brain was operated on. )",

Section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act allows the nsa to collect from us companies texts and emails of foreign targets, even when those targets are communicating with americans. The legislation was opposed by privacy advocates, and republican rep. Justin amash introduced changes that would have forced authorities to get warrants before obtaining information on americans caught in the surveillance, according to the washington post. Those changes were voted down 183-233. The senate is expected to vote on and pass a section 702 renewal before it expires jan. 19. The vote wasn't without drama. President trump sent house republicans scrambling ahead of the vote when he tweeted that section 702 \" may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others. \" trump's tweet came after the president watched a related segment on fox news and despite the white house's official support for the legislation. About 90 minutes later he reversed course. \" today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land, \" trump tweeted. \" we need it! get smart! \" npr takes a closer look at what trump was talking about in his tweets, determining the president's \" comments throw together a rat's nest of related, semi-related, and unrelated strands. \"",

Usa today reports the total trump ponied up was $ 66.1 million, according to the fec filings. All told, the trump campaign and his allies raised about $ 600 million during the entire election season, while hillary clinton's camp pulled together $ 1.2 billion — meaning, as politico notes, \" trump won with half as much money as clinton raised. \" in the final weeks leading up to election day, clinton depleted $ 132 million in her last-ditch push ( with about $ 840,000 left over ), while trump went through almost $ 95 million ( including $ 3 million paid to his own companies ), with about $ 7.6 million left in the bank. But it wasn't the amount that made the difference in those critical final days, trump's digital director, brad parscale, tells the ap — it was how that money was spent. He says a $ 7 million \" closing \" tv ad paid off, as did trump's campaign and the gop throwing in about $ 5 million toward get-out-the-vote digital ads in michigan, wisconsin, pennsylvania, and florida. \" what if we hadn't spent that? \" parscale says. \" we might not have won. \" parscale's web marketing firm was the recipient of at least $ 29 million of trump's campaign funds for the digital ads and consulting work it did.
