        "summary": "It's not often an obituary needs a nsfw warning, but not everyone is jean oddi, who died monday in ohio at the age of 91. Casey clark tells the columbus dispatch that her mom, known as the \" queen of sass, \" was \" unafraid to offend \" and \" always got the first and the last word. \" that comes through in oddi's obituary, written in her voice by clark and clark's daughter, melissa falter. Oddi, via clark and falter, brags of her \" doctorate in bitchology \" and says it's \" no surprise \" people called her \" the queen. \" her obituary also includes advice, such as \" the middle finger is sign language \" and a suggestion to seek out clark if \" you're looking for random crap \" she used to own. Clark tells the dispatch her mom was a true original. When she was 16, oddi called up three men and said she would marry the one who got there the fastest. She followed through on that bold promise. Later, she took her new boyfriend to her husband's parents ' house to pick up the money her husband was sending home from the war. And there are plenty more stories where that came from. It only makes sense then that oddi's obituary took up a full column in the dispatch — costing clark and falter a cool $ 1,250. Oddi's funeral service was to include krispy kreme doughnuts, pizza, white castle burgers, and liquor. Says falter to abc news: \" she's probably saying,'see i told you i was funny and everybody loved me! ' \" ( this family destroyed an \" evil \" man in a totally brutal obituary. )",

Patrick snay, 69, had sued the school for age discrimination and won $ 10,000 in back wages plus an $ 80,000 settlement. But there was one little condition: snay had to keep the deal secret. Technically that meant he couldn't tell his daughter, but he says he \" needed to tell her something \" — the suit alleged that the school had retaliated against him through her, and he says she has \" psychological scars. \" and telling her might have been fine, had dana not gone on facebook and written: \" mama and papa snay won the case against gulliver. Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to europe this summer. Suck it. \" the school never paid the settlement, saying snay broke his confidentiality agreement, and on wednesday an appeals court agreed. \" snay violated the agreement by doing exactly what he had promised not to do, \" the judge wrote. \"his daughter then did precisely what the confidentiality agreement was designed to prevent. \" bustle says it must be \" the most expensive facebook status of all time. \" ( in another case involving the courts and social media, a woman has sued over her \" attractive convict \" mugshot. )",

Alaskan fishermen say they're increasingly missing out on scores of fish they rely on to make a living because killer whales are making off with their catch. A few years ago, orca sightings in the bering sea were rare, fishermen tell the alaska dispatch news. Now the whales are appearing in large numbers to clear fishermen's hooks and lines of cod and halibut. \" it's gotten completely out of control, \" says jay hebert, who's spent four decades fishing in the bering sea. Not only are the whales undeterred by sonar meant to keep them away, hebert says, but more whales are appearing with increased aggression. Some fishermen believe the orcas target specific boats, which they follow for days. That comes as no surprise to noaa biologist john moran, who says orcas are adept at hunting, can recognize boats by the sound they make, and may also recognize the sound of a hydraulic system lowering fishing gear as a kind of dinner bell. Moran adds orcas are known to pass on the skills they acquire, which explains why juvenile whales have been spotted around fishing boats. The national post notes that orcas have been known to adapt their hunting strategies to particular regions within their \" remarkably complex social structures. \" fisherman have reported losses of up to 30,000 pounds of fish per day, plus the cost of fuel used trying to escape the hungry pods. ( an orca hunting frenzy was caught on film. )",

            "In the bering sea, near the edge the continental shelf, fishermen are trying to escape a predator that seems to outwit them at every turn, stripping their fishing lines and lurking behind their vessels. The predators are pods of killer whales chasing down the halibut and black cod caught by longline fishermen. Fishermen say the whales are becoming a common sight — and problem — in recent years, as they've gone from an occasional pest to apparently targeting the fishermen's lines. Fishermen say they can harvest 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of halibut in a single day, only to harvest next to nothing the next when a pod of killer whales recognizes their boat. The hooks will be stripped clean, longtime bering sea longliner jay hebert said in a phone interview this week. Sometimes there will be just halibut \" lips \" still attached to hooks — if anything at all. \" it's kind of like a primordial struggle, \" fisherman buck laukitis said about the orcas last week. \" it comes at a real cost. \" the whales seem to be targeting specific boats, fisherman jeff kauffman said in a phone interview. Fv oracle captain robert hanson said juvenile whales are starting to show up, and he thinks the mothers are teaching the young to go for the halibut and black cod the fishermen are trying",
            "The orcas will wait all day for a fisher to accumulate a catch of halibut, and then deftly rob them blind. They will relentlessly stalk individual fishing boats, sometimes forcing them back into port. Most chilling of all, this is new: after decades of relatively peaceful coexistence with cod and halibut fishers off the coast of alaska, the region's orcas appear to be turning on them in greater numbers. \"we've been chased out of the bering sea, \" said paul clampitt, washington state-based co-owner of the f/v augustine. Like many boats, the augustine has tried electronic noisemakers to ward off the animals, but the orcas simply got used to them. \"it became a dinner bell, \" said clampitt. John mchenry, owner of the f/v seymour, described orca pods near alaska's aleutian islands as being like a \"motorcycle gang. \" \"you'd see two of them show up, and that's the end of the trip. Pretty soon all 40 of them would be around you, \" he said. A report this week in the alaska dispatch news outlined instances of aggressive orcas harassing boats relentlessly — even refusing to leave after a desperate skipper cut the engine and drifted silently for 18 hours. \"it's gotten completely out of control, \" alaska fisherman jay hebert told the"

Fishermen say they can harvest 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of halibut in a single day, only to harvest next to nothing the next when a pod of killer whales recognizes their boat. The hooks will be stripped clean, longtime bering sea longliner jay hebert said in a phone interview this week. Sometimes there will be just halibut \" lips \" still attached to hooks — if anything at all. \" it's kind of like a primordial struggle, \" fisherman buck laukitis said about the orcas last week. \" it comes at a real cost. \" the whales seem to be targeting specific boats, fisherman jeff kauffman said in a phone interview. Fv oracle captain robert hanson said juvenile whales are starting to show up, and he thinks the mothers are teaching the young to go for the halibut and black cod the fishermen are trying",
            "The orcas will wait all day for a fisher to accumulate a catch of halibut, and then deftly rob them blind. They will relentlessly stalk individual fishing boats, sometimes forcing them back into port. Most chilling of all, this is new: after decades of relatively peaceful coexistence with cod and halibut fishers off the coast of alaska, the region's orcas appear to be turning on them in greater numbers. \"we've been chased out of the bering sea, \" said paul clampitt, washington state-based co-owner of the f/v augustine. Like many boats, the augustine has tried electronic noisemakers to ward off the animals, but the orcas simply got used to them. \"it became a dinner bell, \" said clampitt. John mchenry, owner of the f/v seymour, described orca pods near alaska's aleutian islands as being like a \"motorcycle gang. \" \"you'd see two of them show up, and that's the end of the trip. Pretty soon all 40 of them would be around you, \" he said. A report this week in the alaska dispatch news outlined instances of aggressive orcas harassing boats relentlessly — even refusing to leave after a desperate skipper cut the engine and drifted silently for 18 hours. \"it's gotten completely out of control, \" alaska fisherman jay hebert told the"

        "summary": "A group known for fighting for the separation of church and state has won a victory against brewster county, texas, reaching a settlement that has county cops agreeing to remove decals with crosses on them from police cars, reuters reports. In response to a suit filed this year by the freedom from religion foundation, brewster officials now say they won't allow the stickers — depicting foot-high blue latin crosses, per the austin american-statesman — on the vehicles, citing a recently approved county policy that bans \" political, religious, commercial or personal \" symbols or messages from appearing on any county property. Also per the settlement, the county will fork over $ 22,000 and change in legal and court fees to the ffrf. The high-profile hubbub started late in 2015 when the office for brewster county sheriff ronny dodson requested the ok for the cross decals in the rear windows of his deputies ' patrol vehicles, noting the stickers would provide \" god's protection. \" but the ffrf said such an action would be unconstitutional, violating the first amendment's prohibition against government favoring one religion over another. One person who had stood behind brewster's men and women in blue: texas gov. Greg abbott, who wrote before the complaint was filed that \" in addition to its religious significance, the cross has a long history in america and elsewhere as a symbol of service and sacrifice. \" reuters didn't have a comment yet from abbott, but the co-president of the ffrf says the whole deal \" was totally avoidable. This was such an egregious and obvious violation. \" also profiting from the settlement: two brewster county atheists who had joined the lawsuit. They each received $ 1.

Morin set aside $ 100,000 specifically for the library, to fund scholarships for work-study students, support staff, and renovate one of the library's multimedia rooms.

Depending on whom you ask, though, the story ended up being too good to last. Upon his death in 2015, new hampshire cataloger robert morin donated his $ 4 million estate to the university from which he graduated in 1963 and where he worked for nearly 50 years. News outlets across the country published glowing accounts of his donation. But to hear some tell it, the glow has faded. That '",

Morin read in chronological order every book published in the united states between 1930 and 1938, excepting only textbooks, children's books and cookbooks. Such habits were part of the librarian's thrifty lifestyle. He spent little on food or clothes. When he passed, at"

            "In more than 120 minutes of football the past two-plus months, alabama and louisiana state produced one touchdown, countless violent collisions and enough field goals to fill up a lengthy how-to video. In two games, each school won in the other's home state. But it was alabama claiming this season's bowl championship series national title with its convincing 21-0 victory monday before a divided, deafening crowd at the superdome. \"a lot of people did not think we belonged in this game. But we showed everybody with offense, defense and special teams, \" alabama linebacker dont ' a hightower said. While monday served as a rematch of lsu's 9-6 overtime victory in tuscaloosa, ala., on nov. 5, it certainly was not a rerun of the tigers ' narrow victory. Alabama place kickers cade foster and jeremy shelley combined to miss four field goals in that game. Shelley made five field goals monday ( 23, 34, 41, 35 and 44 yards ), a record for the bcs title game. The victory by alabama ( 12-1 ) represented the sixth straight bcs national title for the southeastern conference and the third overall for coach nick saban, who also won in 2003 with lsu and 2009 with alabama. Saban, the only coach to win bcs crowns at different schools, also became the first",

        "summary": "The 11th circuit court of appeals issued an injunction today blocking two key provisions of alabama's controversial immigration law: the one requiring immigrants to carry special alien registration cards, and another forcing schools to check the immigration status of enrolling students. The court said the legal challenges against those provisions from the obama administration and civil liberties groups were likely to succeed, and that the provisions would be harmful in the meantime, the montgomery advertiser reports. But the justices left the law's other provisions in place, including one forcing police to check the immigration status of suspects if they have a \"reasonable suspicion \" they're illegal aliens, one voiding all contracts signed by illegals, and another making it a felony for an illegal to conduct any \"business transaction. \" alabama's house speaker declared victory over that. \"alabama will not be a sanctuary state for illegal aliens, and this ruling reinforces that, \" he said. The court also expedited oral arguments in the case, saying it would hear them in december, cnn reports.",

The injunction issued friday from the 11th u.s. Circuit court of appeals in atlanta came after the u.s. Justice department -- supported by a coalition of immigrant rights groups -- requested the legislation, known as hb 56, be put on hold until the larger constitutional questions can be addressed, a process that could take some months at least.

Alabama's law, passed by the legislature this summer, would allow state and local officials to check the immigration status of public school students and to detain suspected undocumented immigrants without bond.

The attack in iraq's restive western province of anbar is likely to significantly raise concerns that iraq could be drawn into the syrian civil war. Iraqi officials said the syrians had sought refuge through the rabiya border crossing in northern iraq during recent clashes with rebels and were being escorted back to syria through a different border crossing farther south when the ambush occurred. The gunmen struck near the area of akashat, not far from the syrian border, although the identity of the attackers was not known. A senior military intelligence official said the attackers appeared to have been tipped off about the soldiers ' movements and prepared a well-coordinated attack involving roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades.

        "summary": "A missouri highway patrol trooper has been charged with involuntary manslaughter more than 18 months after a man in his custody drowned with his hands cuffed behind his back. A special prosecutor says he decided to charge trooper anthony piercy with \" recklessly causing the death \" of 20-year-old brandon ellingson after reviewing \" boxes and boxes \" of evidence, reports the kansas city star. Witnesses said that after ellingson's may 31, 2014 arrest for boating while intoxicated on the lake of the ozarks, piercy handcuffed him and placed a life vest over his torso, the des moines register reports. Ellingson drowned after the life vest came off when he somehow went into the water as the trooper tried to transport him to shore in a speedboat traveling at around 40mph. Piercy, 44, eventually went into the water but couldn't save ellingson, whose body was recovered the next day. Recently retired patrol sergeant randy henry, who spoke to piercy that night, has been speaking out about the case, saying he believes there has been a cover-up of mistakes in the case to shield officials from criticism over the merger of the highway patrol and the state's water patrol. He believe a lack of training, and piercy's delay in jumping into the water after ellingson, contributed to the death. \" i think his failure to jump in immediately was cowardice, \" henry tells the star. \" if i threw somebody out and he was handcuffed and i see the life vest come off, you jump in now. You go in immediately. \"",

The sixth victim was identified only as a 17-year-old female, though relatives have said she was niebles'daughter, priscilla perez. Vargas was a tenant of the hialeah apartment complex where the shooting took place. It was previously reported that the killings began when the pisciottis, the building's managers, came to question the gunman over a tenant dispute. But the police say it was more than that: vargas had lit his fourth-floor apartment on fire, and they went to investigate the smoke coming out of it. When the couple came to the door, police say, vargas shot them. As firefighters arrived on scene, vargas fired at them from his balcony, but instead hit gavilanes, who was walking across the street with his son, reports the miami herald. Vargas then went into a third-floor apartment, where the bodies of simono, niebles, and the 17-year-old were later found. A neighbor says their lock was shot off, and the teen girl had been hiding in the bathroom. \" seven people have lost their lives in this incident, six innocent victims and the one shooter, \" says a police spokesman. \" now starts the investigation, how and why this happened. \"",

        "summary": "Cambodia thought it had a handle on its scarcity of iodine, an element critical for humans ( and one not made naturally by the body ) to make thyroid hormone. The country had long struggled with the lack of iodine in its soil, which at one point in the late 1990s resulted in goiters in 17 % of its population, per unicef. The solution: iodizing table salt, a cheap way to boost citizens ' iodine intake. But as the new york times reports, national efforts to iodize table salt started disintegrating in 2010, and in 2011 a major event happened more than 2,600 miles away that had unexpected consequences for the country's iodine deficiency dilemma: the japanese earthquake and tsunami, which caused once-affordable iodine to spike in price globally and decimate specifically cambodia's salt industry. The iodizing initiative had already started to erode before 2011, as the government and salt producers let things fall through the cracks. After the tsunami, things worsened: there was already a dearth of iodine due to the 2008 recession, and the natural disaster in japan, which produces about a third of the world's iodine, exacerbated it. Add cheaper, non-iodized vietnamese salt in, as well as the fact that iodine was being scooped up by higher-paying parties such as pharmaceutical firms, and iodized salt in cambodia fell by the wayside. Now suffering the effects: the country's kids, 2,300 of whom, when tested in 2014, showed a 30 % drop of iodine levels in urine compared to 2011. Iodine global network director jonathan gorstein tells the times efforts must be taken anew to halt the deficiency and the \" pattern in which success leads to backsliding. \" ( iodine deficiency in pregnancy can lower a baby's iq. )",

According to the alleged victim, one of dmx's buddies showed him a gun and demanded money, and when the man took $ 3,200 out of his pocket, dmx allegedly grabbed the cash. The entire group then got into their four black cadillac escalades and fled, the man says, though he followed them and got one license plate number. He also hopes surveillance video will corroborate his story.

The move came amid uproar about the case, including protesters at the hotel demanding \" justice for kenneka, \" the chicago tribune reports. Jenkins ' mother continues to insist her daughter could not have gotten into the freezer alone, and the murky nature of the case, combined with puzzling details like a facebook live video that surfaced from someone else attending the same hotel party from which kenneka disappeared, has caused amateur detectives to take up the mystery. Rosemont's mayor says the guesswork surrounding the case is \" convoluting the investigation. \" police say they've spoken to eight people who were at the hotel when kenneka disappeared, as well as four others \" who were involved in some way, \" and they're looking for four others there that night. They say they're analyzing surveillance video from 47 cameras at the hotel and will share the video with kenneka's mother thursday — though it won't be made public until the investigation is complete. They're also looking at other videos posted to social media, and forensic technicians are analyzing some of the video involved. Beyond that, official details are hard to come by, but the tribune rounds up some of the theories from those diy sleuths, many of whom insist it must have been foul play.

In response, a missouri activist has posted videos condemning what he considers to be a slipshod response from authorities. A virginia college student has launched a petition urging criminal charges against jenkins ' friends. And an audio engineer from the southwest has posted an analysis of a facebook video that he says suggests jenkins met with foul play. The online buzz has mounted as authorities have kept quiet about the case, releasing few officially confirmed facts.

And an audio engineer from the southwest has posted an analysis of a facebook video that he says suggests jenkins met with foul play.

We all knew about the mental health benefits of a good buy, but now researchers have discovered that shopping might actually extend one's lifespan. Men and women who shop daily live longer than those who shopped less frequently, found a study of people over the age of 65 in taiwan. Researchers speculate that shopping likely improves exercise, social interactions, and diet, which could all contribute to a longer life, reports the bbc. \" shopping is often for pleasure with the potential to increase psychological well being, \" the researchers conclude in the journal of epidemiology and community health. \" compared to other types of leisure-time physical activity, like formal exercise, which usually requires motivation and sometimes professional instruction, shopping activity is easier to undertake and maintain. \"",

Still, a top counterterror official told congress earlier this year that he considered \" al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula, with awlaki as a leader within that organization, probably the most significant risk to the us homeland. \" the new mexico-born son of yemeni parents grew up in yemen and studied at universities around the us, notes the ap.

            "Peter thiel and hulk hogan won and nick denton lost, so denton has to sell off gawker media via a bankruptcy auction next month. But denton and his employees haven't folded up shop. In fact, denton says, the company is doing better than it was last year: readership has bounced back after falling off earlier in the year, and the company is generating more money than it did in 2015, via advertising and e-commerce affiliate links. Denton says that gawker media's overall revenue is running about 7 percent to 8 percent above last year's level, and that the company, which lost money last year, has a \"small operating profit in the first half \" of 2016. Gawker media's sites are now attracting 62.2 million visitors monthly from the u.s., denton said, citing traffic-counter quantcast. That's back to where it was in january. Denton didn't disclose an overall revenue number. But documents filed as part of gawker's bankruptcy proceedings today show that gawker media llc, the company's u.s. Subsidiary, generated $ 17.8 million in revenue through the first five months of this year, and recorded revenue of $ 48.7 million in 2015 and $ 43.8 million in 2014. Denton says that those numbers don't include all of gawker's revenue, and",
            "Gawker founder nick denton filed for personal bankruptcy monday, listing $ 10 million to $ 50 million in assets and $ 100 million to $ 500 million in debts. The filing comes after denton exhausted appeals to prevent hulk hogan from collecting on a $ 140 million invasion of privacy award handed down by a florida jury in march. Denton had asked for repeated reprieves because he is appealing the verdict. Denton's largest creditor is hulk hogan. The internet entrepreneur owes the wwe champ $ 125 million on a $ 140 million jury award for posting a tape of the wrestler having sex with his best friend's wife. The remaining $ 15 million is owed by gawker. \"on this bitter day for me, i am consoled by the fact that my colleagues will soon be freed from this tech billionaire's vendetta, \" denton tweeted monday. Denton was referring to paypal founder peter thiel, who secretly funded hogan's lawsuit against gawker. Thiel had a personal vendetta against denton after gawker outed him as gay in 2007. The personal bankruptcy, filed in manhattan federal court monday, also lists a potential $ 145 million in more payouts on pending lawsuits against denton. The suits include a $ 100 million defamation claim by chicago lawyer meanith huon, another $ 35 million defamation suit by actress fran drescher's husband"

The film follows three logan siblings from west virginia as they attempt to rob north carolina's charlotte motor speedway. Here's what critics are saying: marking the return of \" retired \" director steven soderbergh, logan lucky is \" essentially a red-state ocean's eleven. \" and while it's not quite up to par with soderbergh's earlier heist film, it's \" very funny \" and \" a hell of a lot of fun, \" writes chris nashawaty at entertainment weekly. He picked up a \" whiff of condescension in the film's twangy hee haw-stereotype characters, \" but found it \" more enjoyable the less you try to dissect it. \" it's not \" deep or particularly original \" but it has \" the no-fuss confidence of soderbergh's best entertainments, staging comedic banter and suspense sequences with equal assurance, \" writes matt zoller seitz at rogerebert.com. \" there's no wasted motion. Everything happens as it does for a reason. \" when all is said and done, you ' ll see the film for what it is: \" a winner, \" zoller seitz writes. Logan lucky is a \" hick caper comedy \" with an \" amiable spirit \" and it's mostly \" delightful, \" writes david edelstein at vulture. \" the whole movie is a trick, reversing our expectations at nearly every turn and casting actors in roles that they were not exactly born to play, but do so with relish. \" craig delivers \" the showstopper turn, \" edelstein adds. \" he's sui generis. He's sui genius. \" \" it's like we're seeing him for the first time, \" adam graham says of craig, who's \" having so much fun that he casually makes off with the movie. \" seth macfarlane, however, gives \" what may be the year's worst performance, \" graham writes at detroit news. Even so, logan lucky is \" a slick, smarter-than-your-average-bear heist comedy that moves and grooves with all the hallmarks of a soderbergh caper. He's back, baby. \"",

But oliver promised pence supporters he'd say at least one nice thing about pence before the segment was over, and that he did: \" i kind of like his rabbit. I really, genuinely do. \" the pences have a pet rabbit named marlon bundo, and that rabbit \" is the most likable thing about an otherwise unlikable man, \" oliver said. \" like how george w. Bush is a perfectly fine painter. Or how bill cosby raised americans ' awareness of pudding. Or how roger ailes is dead. Sometimes you can't deny that there's one thing you like about someone. \" but oliver quickly turned that one thing on its head. It seems marlon bundo has a new book released monday, marlon bundo's a day in the life of the vice president ( actually written by pence's daughter and illustrated by his wife ). And in \" a complete coincidence, \" last week tonight has published a competing book about the bunny, a day in the life of marlon bundo. Not only was the book released a day before pence's book, but it features marlon bundo falling in love with another boy rabbit, and all proceeds from sales of the book will go to aids united and the trevor project, which provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lgbt youth.

After struggling to get into the car, where the backseat was submerged underwater, finally the infant is brought forth — but limp. \" this baby is gonna die if we don't start cpr fast, \" tom mitchell, who was the one shooting the video, recalls to khou. He put his phone, still recording audio, in his pocket as he started trying to resuscitate the baby, and a woman nearby can be heard praying over and over: \" dear jesus, please let this baby breathe. \" the infant was revived, and first responders helped to rescue and revive the toddler, fox 4 reports. The family posted updates on social media reporting that the baby boy is doing well and his older sister is now awake and breathing on her own. On tuesday, they came forward to give khou an on-camera update: phillip and emily ocheltree said they were trying to get to a tornado shelter when the accident occurred, and while they had air in the front seat, they knew their children were underwater and begged rescuers to help them first. Their 4-month-old son marshal is already out of the hospital and their 18-month-old daughter addison is in stable condition and is expected to be ok; phillip ocheltree posted a video of addy awake and eating on tuesday.",

        "summary": "People who suffer from back pain have been dealt a lousy hand by evolution and might be more comfortable walking on their knuckles like our closest relatives, chimpanzees, according to canadian, scottish, and icelandic researchers. Their study found that lower back pain sufferers have a lesion called a \" schmorl's node \" in the disc between the bones of the spine, and their spines are closer in shape to those of chimpanzees than of fellow humans who don't suffer disc problems, the bbc reports. The researchers, whose study is published in the journal bmc evolutionary biology, used the skeletons of orangutans, chimpanzees, and ancient humans for comparison. The spines of our ancestors changed as we started to walk on two legs, but \" evolution is not perfect and some vertebral characteristics, such as the ones we identified as being similar to chimpanzees, may have remained within the human ' blueprint ' and result in some people having vertebrae that are less able to withstand the pressures of bipedal walking, \" one of the researchers explains in a university of aberdeen press release. \" in short, our study suggests that the pathological vertebrae of some people may be less well adapted for walking upright. \" the researchers say their findings could help the study of diseases like arthritis and identify people at future risk of back problems.

        "summary": "President trump is asking for $ 18 billion to fund a portion of his promised border wall in exchange for allowing hundreds of thousands of dreamers — young immigrants brought to the us illegally — to stay in the country, the wall street journal reports. According to the new york times, the wall funding is part of a $ 33 billion list of demands released by the department of homeland security on friday that also includes 10,000 new immigration officers, 10 years of border security improvements, and policy changes affecting immigration. The $ 18 billion would expand the physical barrier on the us-mexico border from its current 654 miles to nearly 1,000 miles — about half of the total border. At one point during his campaign, trump estimated it would cost $ 10 billion for the entire 2,000-mile border, nbc news reports. Democrat and republican senators have been negotiating for months on a deal to protect dreamers while increasing border security. Some say this list of demands from the white house could derail those negotiations. Democratic sen. Dick durbin accuses the trump administration of holding dreamers hostage to get its \" entire wish-list of hard-line anti-immigrant bills \" passed. The list released friday includes banning sanctuary cities from receiving federal grants and restrictions on people sponsoring relatives for immigration. \" president trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall, \" durbin says. \" with this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. \" house minority leader nancy pelosi calls the list \" alarming, \" and a senate democratic aide says it's \" obviously not a serious proposal. \"",

Ryan zinke, a 55-year-old former navy seal team 6 commander, was first elected to congress in 2014 and sits on the house natural resources committee. The journal reports that if the senate confirms zinke, he's expected to roll back president obama's environmental policies and open up more federal lands and waters to oil and gas development, though unlike many republicans, he shares trump's view that federal lands should remain federally owned instead of being turned over to the states. Earlier this week, transition team spokesman jason miller praised zinke as \" a strong advocate for american energy independence. \" \" i ' m very pleased to see that it's a westerner and even more pleased to see that it's a montanan, \" us sen.

Her childhood playground visits with her sister helped inspire disneyland, but she may have left her biggest mark with her key role in the construction of los angeles ' walt disney concert hall, home to the la philharmonic, the times notes. In 1987, her mother, lillian disney, put $ 50 million toward the building, which was designed by architect frank gehry and opened in 2003. During the building process, those in charge wanted to hire a firm other than gehry's for the key job of composing the building's working drawings, due to a perceived lack of experience. Miller stepped in in 1997 to ensure he handled the drawings, and directed a portion of her mother's gift to hiring his firm for the task. \" she's'st. Diane, ' i think, \" gehry later told the times. Miller also founded the walt disney family museum in san francisco, aimed at showing her father as a man, not just a corporate persona, the ap notes. \" she will be remembered for her grace and generosity and tireless work to preserve her father's legacy, \" says walt disney co. President robert iger. But in 1997 she had this to say of the celebrity that went with it: \" my dad loved his celebrity — well, he'd earned it. I don't like living in the wake of his celebrity.

( associated press ) file - this dec. 28, 2015, file photo, released by mexico's jalisco state prosecutor's office shows who authorities identify as ethan couch, after he was taken into custody in puerto vallarta, mexico.... ( associated press ) mexico city ( ap ) — the mexican lawyer for a texas teenager who used an \" affluenza \" defense in a fatal drunken-driving accident says his client has dropped an appeal against deportation and will return to texas to face charges in the coming days. Attorney fernando benitez said tuesday that ethan couch formally ratified his decision to drop the appeal on monday. \" i gave him several options, but he decided to go to texas to face whatever charges he faces, \" benitez. The appeal had led to a court injunction against mexico's original decision to deport couch. Since then, he has been held at an immigration detention center on the outskirts of mexico city. Benitez expects a judge to close the case tuesday, noting that would clear the way for couch to return to texas in one or two days. \" i have people at the courthouse... Waiting for notification that the appeal has formally been dropped, \" benitez said. \" once the injunction is removed, they will deport ethan in 24 or 48 hours. He said couch had decided not to continue with the constitutional appeal after \" he reviewed the basis of the appeal in mexico, \" and because \" it was in his interest \" to do so. Couch and his mother, tonya couch, were detained in the resort of puerto vallarta in december. His mother was quickly sent back to the u.s. She was released after posting bail. Her arrest affidavit alleges that she and her 18-year-old son fled the state in december as texas prosecutors investigated whether he had violated his probation in the case of a 2013 wreck that killed four people. Mother and son were taken into custody later that month in puerto vallarta, after a call for pizza delivery tipped off authorities to their whereabouts. Tonya couch is charged with hindering the apprehension of a felon and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. During ethan couch's trial, a"

Tutu cites advances in assisted deaths made in places such as canada and california, but he adds there's lots of work to be done on this front elsewhere around the globe. And he notes he wasn't always on this side of the fence, especially for himself — he hedged a bit in a 2014 guardian editorial, saying he \" wouldn't mind \" having someone help him die. He now says he's all in, noting how he's overcome his \" lifelong opposition \" to the process and that he's \" made it clear that i do not wish to be kept alive at all costs. \" and even if someone can't take that final step themselves, tutu doesn't believe one should deny others that alternative. \" dying people should have the right to choose how and when they leave mother earth, \" he says.

The launch marked the first of at least two demonstration flights spacex must perform to show it is capable of fulfilling its $ 1.6 billion contract for 12 resupply flights to the space station once the shuttles retire next year. Wednesday, the cargo is modest; it consists of thousands of mission patches commemorating the milestone, says gwynne shotwell, president of spacex, which is based in el segundo, calif. The shift to commercial carriers for space-station-related missions represents a cornerstone of president obama's attempt to put nasa on what the administration argues is a financially sustainable course – one that would allow the agency to afford to send humans to explore destinations beyond low-earth orbit.

Trump foundation after trump gave a 20-minute speech by video to a conference in kiev. The payment is \" curious because it comes during a campaign and is from a foreigner and looks like an effort to buy influence, \" the former head of an irs division that oversees tax-exempt organizations tells the newspaper. Plus, he adds, that's a lot of money for a 20-minute speech. The speech was set up by political consultant doug schoen, who works with pinchuk and is a regular guest on fox news, but it was trump attorney michael cohen who solicited the payment after the speech was arranged. Business insider describes pinchuk as a \" pro-russian oligarch, \" and news of mueller's interest in the payment comes after the special counsel questioned three russian oligarchs on whether they illegally funneled money into trump's campaign or to his inauguration, per the hill. Pinchuk's own foundation says there is nothing suspicious about the payment, in part because back in september 2015, it was not at all clear that trump would end up being the gop nominee.",

We are having less nightmares, \" a hebdo cartoonist tells the daily mail. \" we are trying to put a magazine together and find some calm and inspiration. It's not easy. \" meanwhile, malka appeared on french radio to further explain hebdo's point of view: \" we will not give in otherwise all this won't have meant anything, \" he says. \" we have never criticised a jew because he's a jew, a muslim because he's a muslim, or a christian because he's a christian.

Researchers in budapest who analyzed 400 people say they found a direct connection between the subjects'temperament and the season in which they were born, the telegraph reports. To wit: people whose mood swung quickly and frequently from upbeat to sad ( a \" cyclothymic \" temperament ) were more likely born in summer. Those with a positive disposition ( known as \" hyperthymic \" ) were more often spring or summer babies. Those born in fall have less chance of becoming depressive, while those born in winter are usually less irritable. Lead researcher xenia gonda of semmelweis university tells cnet that environmental and genetic factors could be at play here. For example, she says, the season of birth may affect \" what foods and nutrients are available [ and ] how much physical activity the mother had. \" the environment could also alter genetic factors, just as \" seasonal affective disorder... Has been linked say to a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene. \" cnet, however, took a quick look at the birth dates of people considered temperamental — like christian bale and ann coulter — and found them to be winter babies. \" should we conclude that all these people were or are, in fact, not moody at all? \" cnet asks.",

Clark county sheriff joe lombardo, who previously said the arrival of security guard jesus campos may have caused paddock to stop firing on the festival audience, now says campos was investigating a report of an open door on the 32nd floor when he heard drilling sounds coming from paddock's room, the ap reports. The sheriff says paddock had installed hidden cameras and started firing into the hallway when he saw campos approaching. Campos was hit in the leg but was still able to alert security officials to paddock's location, lombardo says. He says that paddock started firing on the crowd about six minutes after shooting the guard and never completed his drilling, which may have been to install more cameras or create a hole to shoot through. The sheriff didn't explain why such a big change was made to the timeline or say how it could affect the investigation, the las vegas review-journal reports. \" in your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds, some things are going to change, \" he said.
