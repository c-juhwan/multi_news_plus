        "summary": "Police are investigating a bizarre case involving the possible death of a 2-year-old and an alleged attempted resurrection in texas. Authorities received an anonymous tip last thursday that a toddler had died four days earlier at a balch springs home that doubles as a church where \" a large number of young children \" live, according to an affidavit. The caller said the child's family and church members performed a \" rising ceremony \" shortly thereafter in an \" attempt to resurrect [ the ] victim from the dead, \" the affidavit states, per the fort worth star-telegram. The tipster added the toddler was then taken \" back to mexico \" to be buried. Two people at the home told police that a child was found dead there, but police haven't been able to contact the parents or the caller and aren't certain that any death occurred. The parents \" are the only ones who can tell us for sure what happened, \" lt. Mark maret tells the dallas morning news. \" best-case scenario presents us with the child who's alive and healthy and just a normal 2-year-old. \" he adds balch springs police are working with state and federal agencies because \" this is all new. \" as to what the \" rising ceremony \" might have involved, maret tells cbs 11, \" we don't know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child... [ or ] to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses. \" police seized bedding, clothing, computer equipment, and a camcorder from the home, which neighbors tell nbc dfw housed the congregacional pueblo de dios. ( a family lived with a corpse for six months, hoping for a resurrection. )",

        "summary": "Donald trump berated cnn and buzzfeed at his news conference last week, just the latest of his hostile encounters with journalists. Now there's even talk of moving the white house press corps to less prestigious digs. With advisers such as newt gingrich advocating that he \" close down the elite press, \" some are predicting bleak landscapes for journalism under president trump. Media writer jack shafer, however, predicts just the opposite in politico magazine. Reporters should think of trump's inauguration as \" liberation day, \" he advises, because the old rules about covering the white house no longer apply. Reporters won't have the official access they've become accustomed to, and that's ok. Instead, \" they will infest the departments and agencies around town that the president has peeved. \" the list is plentiful: the cia, the state department, the pentagon, and the fbi, should provide plenty of willing sources, and don't forget disgruntled employees of agencies such as the epa who might be asked to work on policies they hate. Trump also, of course, has endless business connections to investigate in regard to conflicts of interest, and newspapers such as the washington post are dedicating staff solely to that purpose. Remember that the president-elect \" remains unpopular with at least half of the nation, and they constitute an eager audience for critical reporting, \" writes shafer. \" it's not winter that's coming with the inauguration of trump, \" he concludes. \" it's journalistic spring. \" click for his full column. )",

Her relatives fled the scene, and after minutes in the water maqsood regained consciousness and managed to struggle to the bank, where two passers-by helped her. \" she is a brave girl. She came out of the canal and approached a nearby fuel station from where a rescue team rushed her to hospital, \" he said. Many conservative pakistani families believe it is dishonorable for a woman to fall in love and choose her own husband. In parts of pakistan, a muslim nation of 180 million people, women are expected to agree to arranged marriages and refusal can lead to an \" honor killing \".

However, the villagers fished out her when she made hue and cry. She has been shifted to the dhq hospital with serious wounds on her face and hands. Saba maqsood of iftikhar colony had married her cousin qasir against the wishes of her parents. Her father maqsood ahmad, brother faisal, uncle ashfaq ahmad and aunty sajida took her to hafizabad and opened fire at her near the jhang branch canal. When the accused felt that she had died, they threw her into the canal and fled away. After some time, she regained consciousness and started making hue and cry. As a result, some villagers fished her out and shifted to the dhq hospital where she is fighting for life. The saddar police have registered a case against her father and four others."

The letters, including one written tuesday by sen. Elizabeth warren, request details on us involvement in the conflict that has pitted shiite houthi rebels against a saudi-led coalition that's in support of the yemeni government. In her letter, warren pressed gen. Joseph votel, the chief of us central command, on whether the us has been lending a hand in any airstrikes that have resulted in civilian deaths. A second letter by 30 house democrats has also demanded a briefing of the war from defense secretary jim mattis, secretary of state mike pompeo, and dni chief dan coats, while a third letter by rep. Ted lieu wonders whether the us has violated any us or international laws. New data cited by the guardian says there have been more than 50 strikes against civilian vehicles in yemen so far in 2018. The new york times calls the latest airstrike that resulted in \" 44 small graves \" \" particularly shocking, \" and frames us military leaders as \" exasperated \" by the civilian toll and insistent that \" the united states is not a party to the war \"; critics counter that the us has sold the coalition weapons and given it intel. The times notes that both mattis and pompeo took action to press saudi officials on the attack, including a call from mattis to crown prince mohammed bin salman.",

She utterly dominated the night, winning eight awards, including best video for \" formation, \" and left the crowd in awe with what the ap calls an \" epic 16-minute concert \" that featured five songs from lemonade. Four things to know from the night: before the show, beyonce posed with guests lezley mcspadden, gwen carr, wanda johnson, and sybrina fulton, who are the mothers of michael brown, trayvon martin, oscar grant, and eric garner, rolling stone reports. Beyonce has said she is inspired by the women, whose sons'deaths at the hands of police — or, in trayvon's case, george zimmerman — inspired protests. Britney spears had what vox calls the \" impossible task of following beyonce \" and while her lip-synced performance of new single \" make me \" is getting mixed reviews, critics agree it was a world away from her disastrous 2007 performance, which was her last time on the vma stage. Rihanna performed several hits over the course of the show and was presented with the video vanguard award by former boyfriend drake. \" she's someone i've been in love with since i was 22 years old, \" said drake, who didn't collect his best hip hop video award earlier in the night, cnn reports. Presenter sean combs said he was \" stuck in traffic. \" kanye west took the stage for four minutes in what the los angeles times describes as a \" freewheeling, remarkably self-indulgent stream-of-conscious rant \" that served as a heartfelt tribute to himself. Among other things, he discussed his explicit video for \" famous, \" taylor swift controversies old and new, and chicago gun violence.",

Ian read has been on the horn with dc lawmakers and obama administration officials, making his case that because pfizer's move would significantly cut its tax rate, it would free up cash for the company to invest back in the us and add more jobs, the new york times reports. Pfizer grumbles that it paid a 26 % tax rate in 2014, as opposed to the 5 % that allergan's predecessor company paid, per the times; with this merger, pfizer hopes to cut its rate to about 17 % or 18 %, the wall street journal notes. Read and allergan ceo brenton saunders also say the merger would give pfizer access to innovative treatments in eye care and dermatology, the times notes. Not everyone agrees with read's sunny outlook. Pfizer failed in 2014 to merge with the uk-based astrazeneca in a move met with similar \" public uproar, \" per the times. And politicians aren't shy about their thoughts on this deal: hillary clinton said in a statement that \" we cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base, \" while donald trump said \" our politicians should be ashamed \" at such a \" disgusting \" deal, per reuters. The two companies hope neither congress nor the treasury will scramble to revamp the tax code or create other rules before the merger closes in 2016, per the times. The would-be pharma giant is already looking ahead to its next challenge: possibly splitting the mega-company into two down the line, with one focused on new meds and the other responsible for drugs that have lost or will lose patent protection, the journal reports.

        "summary": "A \" veteran \" oscars stage manager has given his behind-the-scenes perspective on the best picture snafu, and he comes off as none-too-impressed with the \" frozen \" pricewaterhousecoopers accountants involved. In a lengthy interview with the wrap, gary natoli says brian cullinan and martha ruiz were supposed to have memorized the list of winners, and protocol dictated that if a winner was announced who didn't sync with that memorized list, they'd leap into action. But when la la land was named, ruiz — who was steps away from natoli and host jimmy kimmel at the time — didn't make a peep. Natoli says he and kimmel then left to set up a sketch, and about a minute later heard over a radio that cullinan thought the wrong winner had been announced. Natoli radioed back asking ruiz to open her extra best picture envelope. Once it was confirmed moonlight was the winner another stage manager tried to get the accountants to go onstage — to no avail. \" [ brian ] wouldn't go, and martha wouldn't go, \" natoli says. \" we had to push them on stage, which was just shocking to me. \" ( his full interview is here. ) meanwhile, two sources tell variety that cullinan had pitched a sketch to oscars producers that would have involved him and ruiz onstage with kimmel. Pwc, however, says cullinan was simply concerned after last year's academy awards, during which host chris rock brought three asian-american children onstage and joked they were the pwc accountants. A pwc rep says cullinan did discuss possible onstage appearances, but not a sketch; he just wanted to avoid being cast in \" a defamatory way \" again.",

They would treat abortion clinics as if they are hospitals if the clinics provide five or more first-trimester abortions a month and would enforce architectural design standards that will be almost impossible for most clinics to meet. For instance, a clinic must have 5-foot-wide hallways, 8-foot-wide areas outside of procedure rooms, specific numbers of toilets and types of sinks and all of the latest requirements for air circulation flow and electrical wiring. Each clinic must also have a parking spot for every bed, despite the fact that first-trimester abortions don't require an overnight stay. Further, department of health employees will be allowed to enter an abortion facility at any time without notice or identification. Virginia board of health member jim edmundson tried to"

He had previously said she disappeared after he put her outside as punishment for not drinking her milk. He waited hours to call police."

Martin o ' malley is polling at 3 %. But results get a little more volatile on the republican side, where onetime frontrunner donald trump is now the current frontrunner, and by no small margin: trump has surged past ted cruz, and now leads by 28 % of likely caucus-goers to cruz's 23 %. Marco rubio sits at 15 %, while ben carson has 10 %. But it's not all over for cruz, notes the register: \" the drill-down shows, if anything, stronger alignment with cruz than trump, except for the horse race, \" says pollster j. Ann selzer, who correctly predicted barack obama's win over clinton in 2008, as well as rick santorum's surge in 2012. Back on the democratic side, there's a key to what could boost sanders over the top on monday: \" turnout is everything, \" david axelrod tells the register. \" if turnout is within a normal range, hillary likely wins. If it goes higher, approaching 200,000, it will be a good night for bernie. \" sanders himself is playing up that angle, notes the ap: \" people are really enthusiastic and if people come out to vote, i think you're going to look at one of the biggest political upsets in the modern history of our country, \" sanders told cnn sunday.",

Dubbed a film unfinished, the piece, from israeli director yael hersonski, revolves around a never-completed german propaganda film called \"das ghetto. \" shot in 1942, the silent film contrasted jews living in luxury in the warsaw ghetto, with the poor ones in the street. For years, it was seen as flawed but authentic — until new footage uncovered in 1998 revealed that all the scenes showing privileged jews were staged. Hersonski's film examines \"das ghetto \" reel-by-reel. She interviews one cameraman, and reads from diaries of the ghetto's residents. In one scene, she shows the film to survivors of the ghetto, and films their horrified reactions. Critics are predictably wild about the project. It's \"remarkable as much for its speculative restraint as for its philosophical reach, \" marvels jeannette catsoulis of the new york times, while lisa schwarzbaum of ew applauds hersonski for her exacting research, which \" is its own tribute to those no longer able to testify. \"",

Shot over 30 days in may 1942 — just two months before deportations to the treblinka extermination camp would begin — this hourlong silent film juxtaposed random scenes of jews enjoying various luxuries with images of profound suffering. Like the flickering shadows in plato's cave, these images were subjected to a radical rereading with the appearance of another reel in 1998: 30 minutes of outtakes showing the extent to which scenes had been deliberately staged. Over and over, in multiple takes, we see well-dressed jews enter a butcher's shop, ignoring the children begging outside. In a similar scenario, prosperous-looking passersby are directed to disregard the corpses abandoned on the sidewalk. The propagandists ' manipulation of their half-million prisoners was now clear, even as its eventual purpose — perhaps more than just to manufacture scenes showing callousness on the part of wealthy jews toward their less fortunate brethren — remained as murky as ever.

        "summary": "Spending time on the moon just got a little more complicated. A new study has found that lunar soil is extremely toxic and that even small amounts of lunar dirt could be damaging to lungs, reports popular mechanics. Astronauts on the apollo missions first noticed problems with space dust when it clung to their spacesuits and was difficult to brush off after moonwalks. They also suffered watery eyes, sore throats, and sneezing — a condition that apollo 17 astronaut harrison schmitt described as \" lunar hay fever, \" per the smithsonian. Their reaction was consistent with a large body of research that shows breathing dust from coal mines and volcano eruptions can cause long-term lung damage and increase risk of cancer. To test the risk of moon dust, researchers at stony brook university school of medicine in new york grew a batch of human lung cells and mouse brain cells, then exposed the cells to various types of earth dust that closely resemble lunar dust. They found that exposure to moon-like particles killed up to 90 % of all the cells and virtually destroyed dna. One reason lunar dirt is so toxic is that unlike earth soil, it is constantly exposed to \" charged particles from the upper layers of the sun, \" per popular mechanics. The study didn't use real lunar dust, gizmodo notes, but moon visitors still have reason to worry: \" if there are trips back to the moon that involve stays of weeks, months, or even longer it probably won't be possible to eliminate that risk completely, \" lead study author bruce demple says in a statement.

The results show breathing toxic dust, even in minute quantities, could pose a health hazard to future astronauts traveling to the moon, mars or other airless planetary bodies. Space agencies know exposure to the space environment and zero gravity can be harmful to human health, but planetary dust poses an additional risk that has been mostly overlooked, according to the researchers. \"there are risks to extraterrestrial exploration, both lunar and beyond, more than just the immediate risks of space itself, \" said rachel caston, a geneticist at stony brook university school of medicine in stony brook, new york and lead author of the new study published in geohealth, a journal of the american geophysical union.

        "summary": "The families of nine sandy hook victims, along with a wounded teacher who survived, have for years been going after the maker of adam lanza's \" weapon of choice \" — the bushmaster ar-15-style rifle. This week, they ' ll see if their lawsuit has teeth. Filed in 2014, the suit was dismissed last october by a connecticut state superior judge who ruled the federal protection of lawful commerce in arms act — which offers immunity to gunmakers when one of their products is used in a crime and establishes an extremely high bar for litigation against them — did indeed shield bushmaster-maker remington from such a claim. Now it's up to the state supreme court to decide whether the case should move forward. The new york times explains the crux of the suit: that the very idea of putting a military weapon into the hands of untrained civilians qualifies as \" negligent entrustment. \" it further argues the gun's makers promoted the weapon to unstable males by pushing it within their realm — think product placement in video games. The hartford courant explains they ' ll try to bolster their claim by citing a 1977 lawsuit involving a slingshot. The michigan case, which involved 12-year-old who suffered an eye injury while using the device, was green-lit for jury trial after the judge found the company should have anticipated such accidents because it \" entrusted \" the device to kids. The times notes that if the case is oked for trial, then the internal communications that gun makers have kept a tight clench on would be handed to prosecutors, \" a potentially revealing and damaging glimpse into the industry and how it operates. \" but the wall street journal notes that since the 2005 arms act was passed, suits like these have largely failed. ( the fbi last month revealed many more details about lanza. )",

Surprised? so were some scientists, who expected the administration to try to block the release of the report or change its scientific findings, as happened to an early assessment released under george w. Bush. Instead, the report's coordinating lead author says there was no meddling from lawmakers, and the white house office of science and technology even signed off on it, according to usa today. The findings of the 2,000-page report directly contradict statements made by president trump, energy secretary rick perry, and epa head scott pruitt, who removed similar findings from the epa website earlier this year. The report warns of a potential 8-foot rise in sea level by 2100 and increases in floods, large wildfires, extreme heat, and rainfall in the us. Coastal property damage could hit $ 120 billion annually by 2090, the same year annual deaths from extreme temperatures could reach 9,300. And the report states it could be underselling things because of climate \" surprises \" when unexpected tipping points are reached. The peer-reviewed assessment — which was produced by hundreds of scientists and 1,500 reports and studies — states the only solution is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide.",

It also happens to be incredibly pornographic. David tod roy, an 80-year-old emeritus professor of chinese lit at the university of chicago, has spent some 30 years translating the anonymously written 16th-century the plum in the golden vase ( or chin p ' ing mei ) into english. The final volume was published in september, reports the la review of books, which calls it \" one of the world's greatest novels. \" it tells the tale of corrupt merchant ximen qing — and his six wives and many concubines. Under mao, it was actually recommended to high-ranking officials as a case study in imperial corruption; the rest of the population was permitted only censored versions. ( roy explains to tableau, \" you would sometimes read along in chinese and then all of a sudden it would say,'the next 560 characters are deleted. ' \" ) roy discovered an unexpurgated copy in a used bookstore as a missionary kid in china in 1950 and officially began translating it in 1982, issuing volume 1 in 1993. A professor of chinese lit at ohio state university describes its contents: \" s-and-m, the use of unusual objects as sex toys, excessive use of aphrodisiacs, sex under all kinds of nefarious circumstances — you name it, it's all there. \" ( the times points out that chapter 27 is particularly \" infamous. \" ) but in terms of the \" all, \" there's more than the sex: it uniquely focused on ordinary people, rather than the \" mythical heroes or military adventures \" long chinese narrative always followed. To wit, in his interview with tableau, roy notes that the book's \" descriptions of sexual activity... Were no more detailed than its descriptions of eating, costumes, political corruption, funerals, and so on. \" tableau's descriptions of his incredible translation efforts are worth a read. A sample: \" in chapter 29 the fortune-teller immortal wu tells the fortunes of each major member of the household. That took me over two years to translate, by reading traditional chinese fortune-telling manuals and trying to master the system. \"",

Some of the standouts in that category: ( or click here to see a roundup of negative reviews. ) republican rep. Brian babin of texas enthuses at the hill that \" we're off to a great start \" under trump, who he says has issued and enacted dozens of executive orders and bills, created 500,000 jobs, and put neil gorsuch on the supreme court. \" we are moving in a strikingly different direction than the malaise days of the obama era, \" he says. With this trump presidency we've experienced a \" sea change, \" hugh hewitt writes for the washington post, adding that conservatives should break out the bubbly. Hewitt concedes there were initial \" fumbles, \" \" stumbles, \" and \" a jumble of ups and downs, \" but he says trump has since found his footing, especially after gorsuch, the strike on syria, and dropping the \" mother of all bombs \" on afghanistan. \" just imagine what the next three and two-thirds years can bring, \" hewitt writes. \" a rousing success \" is how justin haskins and h. Sterling burnett describe the first 100 days for trump in the sun-sentinel. They tout reforms trump has jump-started to \" reignite the american economic engine, \" as well as the sharp decline in illegal immigrants coming into the us since he took office — a \" wildly successful \" presidency so far. On the americans for tax reform site, justin sykes praises trump's first months as a \" boon for us energy, \" listing the 10 executive orders trump has already signed that \" will boost us energy independence and growth. \" fortune lists the seven economic promises it says the president has kept, including pulling out of the trans-pacific partnership trade deal and getting rid of obstacles to the keystone xl pipeline. Eli lake writes that trump has disproved the \" russian stooge \" and \" fascist \" labels that have been hurled his way, noting at bloomberg view that the president has begrudgingly adhered to court decisions ( even if he has insulted them ) and that \" us-russian relations are cratering. \" \" slowly but surely, he has begun to resemble something less menacing and more normal than his foes predicted, \" he writes. Sarah palin wouldn't give a letter grade to trump during a breitbart interview thursday, but she did offer he's doing \" very well. \" she also told conservatives who may still have their doubts to \" keep doing your abcs",

        "summary": "Prosecutors have released a graphic video of the fatal shooting of an arkansas police officer during a traffic stop last year. Police say they want to learn from the 20-minute video, which shows jerry lard shooting police officer jonathan schmidt. Lard, who was a passenger in the back seat of a vehicle schmidt pulled over, shot the officer after he handcuffed the driver. He bolted from the car and continued firing at schmidt and another officer. Schmidt, a 30-year-old father of three, can be heard pleading, \" please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me again, \" ap reports. Later in the video — some of which has been aired by katv — the other officer can be heard talking to schmidt as they waited for help to arrive. \" we've got help coming, buddy, \" the officer can be heard saying. Lard was found guilty of the murder last month, and sentenced to death. The local police chief says the video will be used to increase training for nighttime traffic stops. \" he ' ll be our greatest teacher and our trainer, \" he said at a news conference. \" he's pushing us forward, so with that we ' ll be better for it. \"",

Per the lawsuit, the academy informed distinctive assets last year that it \" is critical that no one be confused into believing that your gift bags are associated with or have any connection with the academy, \" and distinctive assets ultimately agreed to \" not purposefully make an association between its gift bags and ampas going forward. \" but distinctive assets continues to imply the gift bags are sponsored or endorsed in some way by the oscars, leading to this year's suit.

        "summary": "Remember last year's exciting finding that just a few minutes of high-intensity interval training can reap similar health benefits as 45 minutes of moderate exercise? well, there's a chance that just sitting on a vibrating platform might also reap similar benefits, especially for those with type 2 diabetes — though the study is small, and on mice, and still needs to be replicated on a far larger human population, reports voa news. \" these results are encouraging, \" one researcher says, but stresses that they need to be replicated in humans, and cautions against using vibrating beds — which cause muscles to contract and relax quickly — to control diabetes just yet. Still, the study \" is the first to show that whole-body vibration may be just as effective as exercise at combating some of the negative consequences of obesity and diabetes, \" she says, per a press release. Researchers tested \" whole-body vibration \" by placing both normal and diabetic mice on a gently vibrating platform for 20 minutes a day for 12 weeks, while a similar group ran on a treadmill for 45 minutes a day over those three months. For comparison, a third group just sort of hung out, sedentary, the whole time. Researchers report in the journal endocrinology that the gently vibrated mice saw benefits quite similar to the cohort putting all that effort into the treadmill ( including improved insulin sensitivity, more muscle fiber, and less fat in the liver ), and the vibrating may have even improved bone strength in the diabetics. Next up? study the mechanisms at play in whole-body vibration, including possible negative side effects like tissue inflammation. ( some people are actually allergic to vibrations. )",

            "Researchers have found that a less strenuous form of exercise known as whole-body vibration may work just as well as regular exercise in helping to control diabetes. Wbv, as it's called, could also benefit people who find it difficult to exercise. Scientists say wbv transmits energy through the body when someone is standing, sitting or lying on a gently vibrating device, causing muscles to contract and relax many times each second. The effect may be to strengthen and increase muscle mass, improving blood sugar control along with other problems seen in diabetes. At least, that's what studies in mice suggest. Bearing in mind that exercise is good for everyone, including people with diabetes, researchers at augusta university in augusta, georgia, studied five-week-old male rodents, comparing the effects of whole-body vibration to that of running on a treadmill. Vibrating platform a cage containing both normal and specially bred obese, diabetic mice was placed on a gently vibrating platform for 20 minutes per day for 12 weeks. Another group of rodents — both diabetic and healthy mice — was trained to run on a treadmill for 45 minutes a day for the same period of time. A third group of diabetic and healthy mice remained sedentary and were used for comparison. Investigators saw similar health benefits in the diabetic mice that ran on the treadmill and those exposed to whole-body vibration. Meghan mcgee-lawrence, an assistant professor in the department of cellular biology and anatomy at the medical college",
            "Whole-body vibration has gained attention as a potential exercise mimetic, but direct comparisons with the metabolic effects of exercise are scarce. To determine whether whole-body vibration recapitulates the metabolic and osteogenic effects of physical activity, we exposed male wildtype ( wt ) and leptin receptor deficient ( db/db ) mice to daily treadmill exercise or whole-body vibration for three months. Body weights were analyzed and compared with wt and db/db mice that remained sedentary. Glucose and insulin tolerance testing revealed comparable attenuation of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in db/db mice following treadmill exercise or whole-body vibration. Both interventions reduced body weight in db/db mice and normalized muscle fiber diameter. Treadmill exercise and whole-body vibration also attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy in visceral adipose tissue and reduced hepatic lipid content in db/db mice. Although the effects of leptin receptor deficiency on cortical bone structure were not eliminated by either intervention, exercise and whole-body vibration increased circulating levels of osteocalcin in db/db mice. In the context of increased serum osteocalcin, the modest effects of te and wbv on bone geometry, mineralization, and biomechanics may reflect subtle increases in osteoblast activity in multiple areas of the skeleton. Taken together, these observations indicate that whole-body vibration recapitulates the effects of exercise on metabolism in type 2 diabetes."

        "summary": "Global warming in the arctic means earlier and more plentiful mosquitoes in greenland, and that's bad news for the country's already shrinking caribou population, alaska dispatch news reports. A new study found that for every degree celsius the temperature rises in greenland, mosquitoes take 10 % less time to reach full, biting adulthood. And less time spent as larva means more mosquitoes survive into adulthood. The study found that a 5-degree celsius jump raised mosquito survival rates by 160 %. In 2011, mosquitoes hatched around june 15; in 2012 it was june 1. That shift could mean trouble for caribou and the communities that depend on them. \" if the mosquitoes are coming out right around that time, it's when the herd is the most vulnerable, \" researcher lauren culler tells adn. Motherboard reports caribou birthing season is now beginning to coincide with peak mosquito season, and aggressive arctic mosquitoes desperate for a meal have been known to kill calves. The only way for caribou to escape the swarms is to run to windy areas or glaciers. \" every moment that a caribou spends avoiding insects is another minute that they're not doing what caribou need to do so that they feed so that they can successfully raise calves, \" culler tells motherboard. But if warming trends continue, it's possible to imagine a future where mosquitoes hatch so early they die off before caribou calves are born. \" it's not all like a gloom and doom story for the caribou, \" culler tells adn.

            "If you catch a greenlandic mosquito in your fist, do not relax your fingers. Unless you've clasped your grip so tightly that you fear you've broken skin and then squeezed a bit more, you haven't killed it. When you loosen your grip, the mosquito will simply fly away faster than you can react, a bit battered perhaps, but still able to take a bite out of you. \"they're aggressive because they're desperate, \" says lauren culler an ecologist with dartmouth's institute of arctic studies who researches greenland's mosquitoes. \"my research here, \" says culler, \"has found that only 12-15 percent of mosquitoes ever get a blood meal. \" female mosquitoes ( only female mosquitoes bite ) require a blood meal to lay eggs, and here in greenland blood meals are limited primarily to caribou ( also known as greenlandic reindeer ), musk ox, and sweet blooded visitors from new york city. They're aggressive enough that they can kill caribou calves. Although we typically associate mosquitoes with warmer climates, the arctic, except for iceland which is a bit of an ecological mystery, has fierce, fat, and abundant mosquitoes. Culler and i are in kangerlussuaq, a dusty inland town of roughly 500 people in western greenland, to check out her mosquito ponds, the shallow pools of water where mosquitoes spend three quarter of their lives.

            "If you catch a greenlandic mosquito in your fist, do not relax your fingers. Unless you've clasped your grip so tightly that you fear you've broken skin and then squeezed a bit more, you haven't killed it. When you loosen your grip, the mosquito will simply fly away faster than you can react, a bit battered perhaps, but still able to take a bite out of you. \"they're aggressive because they're desperate, \" says lauren culler an ecologist with dartmouth's institute of arctic studies who researches greenland's mosquitoes. \"my research here, \" says culler, \"has found that only 12-15 percent of mosquitoes ever get a blood meal. \" female mosquitoes ( only female mosquitoes bite ) require a blood meal to lay eggs, and here in greenland blood meals are limited primarily to caribou ( also known as greenlandic reindeer ), musk ox, and sweet blooded visitors from new york city. They're aggressive enough that they can kill caribou calves. Although we typically associate mosquitoes with warmer climates, the arctic, except for iceland which is a bit of an ecological mystery, has fierce, fat, and abundant mosquitoes. Culler and i are in kangerlussuaq, a dusty inland town of roughly 500 people in western greenland, to check out her mosquito ponds, the shallow pools of water where mosquitoes spend three quarter of their lives. Mosquitoes are laid in ponds as eggs, hatch as larva, and pupate or transform from wriggling larva into flying mosquito, at the ponds'drying margins.

Researchers studying more than 1,400 brains found it impossible to categorize them as either male or female, the los angeles times reports. \" brains with features that are consistently at one end of the ' maleness-femaleness ' continuum are rare, \" researchers write in their study published monday. \" rather, most brains are comprised of unique ' mosaics ' of features. \" while different regions of the brain show male or female characteristics, brains with all-male or all-female characteristics were extremely rare — between 0 % and 8 %, science reports. Most brains had a combination of male and female features. \" our results demonstrate that … human brains cannot be categorized into two distinct classes, \" the study states. The times reports researchers took the study even further — looking at the prevalence of all-male or all-female thoughts and behaviors — and came to the same conclusion. For example, a survey of college students regarding 10 \" highly gender-stereotyped activities \" found only 1.2 % of students had exclusively male or exclusively female interests. \"there is no sense in talking about male nature and female nature, \" lead researcher daphna joel tells science. \"there is no one person that has all the male characteristics and another person that has all the female characteristics.

When he leaves the senate and starts running the conservative heritage foundation, his \" power won't wane at all — and, in fact, might even grow, \" kornacki writes. Demint hasn't had any big legislative projects in the works for a while; his main concern has been building a reputation as an \" ideological purist \" and influencing republican primary races, backing many a tea party favorite. He can still do that, because he's made himself \" a huge player in the insular republican universe, \" kornacki writes. Nowadays, \" republican members of congress, by and large, take their cues from conservative media, rather than shaping it. \" fox news will still be happy to have him on, and his endorsement will still be just as important for \" fellow true believers. \" on slate, david weigel agrees. \" demint-ism was never about legislating, \" he writes. \" it was about blocking legislation and unwinding current laws. Demint figured out, correctly, that he could do more good playing the outside game as his acolytes in the senate played the inside game. \" none of the 35 bills demint introduced became law; \" he was a marketer, a recruiter — not a legislator. He never pretended otherwise. \" and now \" the tea party, as represented by demint, has taken over a tea-and-cookies conservative institution and readied it for guerrilla warfare. \" read weigel's full column here, or kornacki's here.",

        "summary": "Bernie sanders has doggedly remained in the race for the democratic nomination, and tuesday's primary in west virginia seems likely to offer him some validation. Writing at fivethirtyeight, harry enten argues that the vermont senator is \" likely to win \" against hillary clinton in the mountain state, citing two west virginia polls that show sanders with a \" modest edge \" — a clinton defeat that would be a stunning reversal of her 2-1 win there in 2008 over barack obama, abc news notes. Fivethirtyeight's polls-only stats ( from west virginia only ) give sanders a 7 percentage point win, while its \" polls-plus \" version ( which includes state and national polls, as well as endorsements ) gives him a 3-point lead. And enten points out his boss, nate silver, worked up a model late last month that gave sanders a 15-point win there, which would be his largest win in a primary other than his home state and nearby new hampshire. What enten says are the main factors driving a potential sanders win: the state's primary is semi-closed, meaning those who aren't registered as dem or gop can still vote in either primary, and the homogeneity of the state's population, which is 93 % white ( sanders tends to do best in states with a similar demographic ). Clinton also hasn't endeared herself to the coal community, based on her past plans to \" put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, \" per the ap, while sanders has used his \" firebrand tone \" to appeal to the region's poorest, abc notes. But enten points out that even if sanders were to nail that 15-point win, he'd still only narrow the divide between himself and clinton by four delegates — not much of a dent in her nearly 300-delegate lead. Meanwhile, nebraska is holding its own primary tuesday, a vote set against a backdrop of nervous republicans trying to \" grapple with [ a ] new trump reality, \" per the lincoln journal star.

Keith calls mick, famed for his on-stage strut, \" your majesty \" and says he hasn't set foot in jagger's dressing room in 20 years. Richards also claims that the man who sang, \" let's spend the night together \" has a size issue in the manhood department. Richards reveals that jagger had a brief affair with his partner, the italian-born fashion model anita pallenberg. Sounds like it might just be a cheap shot, belated revenge for the betrayal. Jagger's ex, the texan runway goddess jerry hall, sprung to his defense on bbc radio. \" mick is very well endowed and i should know because i was with him 23 years, \" she told the bbc dj graham norton. \" keith is just jealous you know. \" richards reveals other celebrity encounters elsewhere in his sprawling biography, richards writes"

After a yearlong project of gathering data about the admittedly sensitive subject, facebook has announced three options people can choose upon their demise, the washington post reports: do nothing, in which case your page will be frozen forever once someone tells site administrators you're kaput; instruct facebook that you want your account wiped out upon death; or appoint a \" legacy contact \" to serve as permanent guardian of your new online memorial. Choose well if you pick door no. 3 — you only get to appoint one person, and that person can't pick someone else when he or she dies. The legacy contact doesn't have quite the same free reign as if you just gave a trusted person your password ( which still isn't technically permissible under facebook's terms of service ). The legacy contact can change the deceased's profile or cover pic, accept new friend requests, craft a post to pin at the top of the erstwhile user's page, and download previous photos and posts. What the digital caretaker can't do: snoop through old messages, make changes to previous posts, or delete the account, the wall street journal reports. Facebook will add \" remembering \" in front of your name so that people don't freak out when \" you \" accept their friend request. Living users also won't get notifications every time the legacy contact makes an update, and they won't ( for now ) get any macabre prompts asking for their own death designee.

        "summary": "Jack reacher is back in never go back, the second installment in the tom cruise-led action series based on lee child's books. Though audiences seem generally pleased, per rotten tomatoes, critics seem to hate it almost as much as they hate the movie's title. Here's what they're saying: starting with a chase scene during a halloween parade — essentially \" one elongated sequence of very bad badness \" — \" the whole thing is just so sloppy and dumb and overflowing with cliches, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. As for cruise, \" it's apropos he's often wielding a cellular device in this movie, because this is the very definition of phoning it in. \" jack reacher: never go back is \" the sequel no one asked for to the movie that no one quite remembers, \" or as chris nashawaty at entertainment weekly prefers to call it, \" an unremarkable placeholder until the next mission: impossible flick comes along. \" cruise doesn't \" half-ass \" the acting, but that hardly saves the film, he says. Without a decent villain and any real twists, \" this is as blandly formulaic as sequels come. \" kenneth turan is more receptive. Despite the film's flaws — like unfortunate changes to the plot of the book — \" the strength of the character and the briskness of the action make it acceptable if you are in the mood, \" he writes at the los angeles times. Cruise is \" completely suitable \" as reacher and cobie smulders holds her own as the female action hero, he adds. Chris klimek at npr, however, doesn't have much to praise besides the \" bright spot \" that is smulders. \" never go back is deeply mediocre, as rote and indistinct as most of the action flicks that've marked liam neeson's late-career lull, \" he writes. While he liked the first installment, here \" the offbeat jokes are gone, as is the coterie of interesting character actors and the clean, precise stunt work. \"",

Then he appeared at cpac, where he fueled the fire of conservatives calling for him to run for president in 2016: \" let's just say if you magically put me in the white house... \" he said, to cheers. Carson, whose fame has exploded as his prayer breakfast speech went viral on youtube, has no political background but quite a compelling story: he rose from poverty in detroit to become director of pediatric neurosurgery at johns hopkins, he has several books to his name, and cuba gooding jr. Once played him in a movie. His latest book, america the beautiful: rediscovering what made this nation great, has sold 46,000 copies since the speech. Appearances on fox news have bolstered his popularity. But carson won't identify himself as a republican, though his views have turned decidedly conservative since his \" flaming liberal \" days in college, he tells the new york times. He's religious and supports a flat tax, in which someone who makes $ 10 billion pays $ 1 billion and someone who makes $ 10 pays $ 1. But not all carson's views are popular with the gop: the daily caller, which calls him \" a conservative star on the rise, \" reports that he did not support the invasions of either iraq or afghanistan.",

He also bought a harley-davidson motorcycle and a 1960 buick electra 225 and completed a culinary program. \" he was really happy to be free, and he never talked about his time in prison, \" said nash's mother, yvette martin. \" he wanted to just get past it and be happy.

Oh, and they prefer white underwear, either y fronts or briefs, a former shopkeeper tells the bbc. The young man in his 20s says he fled miranshah, north waziristan — a taliban-controlled part of pakistan — after an army offensive displaced 800,000 people and ruined his customer base. As for the taliban, \" they didn't like pakistani products, \" he says. \" they used to prefer foreign or branded perfumes and imported body sprays. They liked the ones with a strong scent. \" for their women, he says, taliban fighters bought perfumes like blue lady by rasasi and secret love; for shampoos, it was clear or head and shoulders; for soap, they bought dove. Another miranshah seller, a tailor, confirms that the taliban were his best customers and spent 2,000 to 3,000 rupees per sale ( the equivalent of about two weeks'salary ). Other afghan shopkeepers have another grievance these days, saying the nation's presidential-election crisis has ground sales nearly to a halt, the bbc reports. And in a sad report yesterday, officials said that eight civilians driving to kandahar to go shopping and see a doctor died when a roadside bomb went off, reuters reports.

The latest: first responders at the scene have been dying, with symptoms similar to the victims they were tending to, usa today reports. Any us action would be designed not to end syria's civil war, but simply to punish assad, officials tell the journal. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has publicly warned of the risks of prolonged military intervention in syria. Meanwhile, in another sign of how bad things have gotten for syria, un officials have announced that the conflict has now produced a million child refugees, the bbc reports.",
