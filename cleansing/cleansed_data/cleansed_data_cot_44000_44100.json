The team's complete analysis of the mitochondrial dna of 10 neanderthals doubles the existing genetic data on a species that died out around 30,000 years ago and confirms previous research suggesting that, due to the low genetic variation, late european neanderthals were closely related. The guardian, which calls the latest finding of intentional butchery \" grisly, \" notes that neanderthal cannibalism has also been suspected in findings in spain and france, while four bones have suggested that neanderthals at the very least used the remains of deceased brethren as tools.

In what the ap says was a \" largely expected \" move, toshiba noted in a statement wednesday that its westinghouse nuclear unit has submitted a chapter 11 petition to the us bankruptcy court of new york. This announcement leaves up in the air what's going to happen to four still-to-be-finished nuclear reactors in south carolina and georgia, which were plagued with surpassed budgets and missed deadlines, per the wall street journal. Reuters reports that toshiba — which ventured into nuclear waters when it purchased westinghouse for $ 5.4 billion in 2006 — is expecting to take a $ 9 billion loss for the year ending march 31. The new york times details some of the company's challenges in the nuclear industry, including more affordable forms of other alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, as well as safety fears spurred by the 2011 fukushima disaster. A westinghouse statement says that while the firm attempts to reorganize under chapter 11 parameters, it will be kept afloat by special $ 800 million financing. Reuters notes the bankruptcy will allow westinghouse to figure out whether it's worth it to keep plugging ahead on the nuclear reactor projects, some of which are only about a third completed. Some say toshiba's unique situation can be applied more broadly to the nuclear industry in general. \" this … illustrates that there is no bright future for nuclear anymore, \" a consultant tells the journal, which notes that westinghouse boldly proclaims \" we are nuclear energy \" on its site.",

Just how big? well, the kermadec ocean sanctuary will stretch for 240,000 square miles — an area twice the size of new zealand's landmass — if government legislation to establish the fully-protected reserve passes next year, key told a united nations summit monday. Given its massive size — the reserve will be one of the largest in the world and cover 15 % of the country's exclusive economic zone — it's no surprise it ' ll be home to some 35 species of whales and dolphins who breed there, 150 kinds of fish, and three species of sea turtle, reports the guardian. But the sanctuary in the south pacific will also house the world's longest chain of underwater volcanoes and an ocean trench so deep that it could hide mount everest. As a fully-protected sanctuary, there will be no fishing, mining, or oil, gas, and mineral prospecting allowed. \" the mining resources are potentially very, very large there because there are unknown quantities of silver and other resources, \" key says, per cnn. But it's more important \" to protect what is, from a geological perspective, a very important and significant part of the world. \" reactions online have been mostly positive, though the executive director of greenpeace new zealand suspects the announcement is to distract from the country's plan to cut carbon emissions by 11 % from 1990 levels by 2030; other countries are pledging cuts of 30 % to 40 %. \" on the one hand, they're establishing this wonderful area and on the one hand, they're completely undermining it, \" she says.

In a phenomenon known as a bloom, the now-named pelagia benovici showed up in such force in september that it interfered with fishing; citizen jellyfish trackers who were unable to identify it as a local variety contacted scientists, the guardian reports. Italian researchers who studied the \" beautiful yellow-ochre \" jellyfish ( stunning image here ) speculate in the journal zootaxa that the species came to the north adriatic sea in a ship's ballast water ( carried in tanks to help the ship maintain stability ) from its native habitat, where it has yet to be recorded. That sea is \" one of the most investigated [ marine ] areas of the world, \" writes stefano piraino, one of the zoologists involved in the study, in the conversation, meaning there's no way the jellyfish hails from there and somehow went unnoticed. And as of march, the creature has vanished from the venice lagoon, but they can \" suddenly come back, \" piraino writes. Among the other details scientists shared: pelagia benovici joins what is currently \" the only valid species \" in the genus pelagia, a mauve variety that obliterated a $ 2 million salmon farm in northern ireland in a \" spectacular attack, \" the ap reported in 2007.

Now archaeologists studying an ancient cave in israel say they've figured out when humans managed the feat: about 350,000 years ago, reports science. Researchers discovered that burned flints began showing up regularly around that time in tabun cave near haifa. Humans were using the cave as long as 500,000 years ago, and they apparently had the occasional fire way back then, but they didn't learn to control it and start campfires at will for a while. ' while the earliest evidence of fire associated with hominin activities is much older, the data presented here indicate that fire became a regular and constant part of hominin behavioral adaptations in eurasia only after 350,000 years ago, \" says ron shimelmitz of the university of haifa, as quoted in the daily mail. Both stories says the study in the journal of human evolution won't end the debate: other prominent archaeologists say that controlled fire must have come along much earlier and played a role in the evolution of our bigger brains and smaller guts.

He was allegedly beaten into a confession, subjected to a trial his parents couldn't attend, and executed by gunshot without their knowledge seven months later. Now, 21 years after that, china's supreme court has declared nie shubin, just 20 years old at the time of his death, innocent. Cnn calls it \" a landmark case that exposed deep flaws in china's criminal justice system, \" where 99.93 % of cases ended with a conviction in 2013. In their ruling, the judges noted that nie was made a suspect \" without a shred of evidence \" and that the time and cause of death and murder weapon couldn't be verified, reports the ap. And, then, there was the other confession. A man named wang shujin admitted to the crimes in 2005; it took nine years for a legal review of the case to commence — beijing legal expert xu xin tells the new york times the police and prosecutors who worked on the case drove the hold-up — and the court in june of this year decided the case should be retried. On friday, xinhua reports the supreme people's court, among other things, ruled the \" truth and legitimacy of nie's confession \" were in doubt. Nie's mother, burdened by both the loss of her son and her husband's attempted suicide in the wake of nie's death, broke down sobbing at the news. She tells cnn, \" i wanted to tell my son: you're a good person, you're innocent. \" xinhua reports wang was sentenced to death for unrelated rape and murder cases.

And she's also one of the newest cheerleaders for the new orleans saints. Her diagnosis inspired lewis to make the most of every day, because \" i know my time is limited, \" she says. So, with her doctor's permission, she set a goal: try out for the saintsations. \" honestly, i really did not think i was going to make \" the cut, she tells the ap. But, the squad's director tells the sun-herald, \" it was a unanimous decision to put her on the team.... When she needed to blend with the others, she did, and when she needed to stand out, she did. \" she was the oldest person ever to audition for the team, and her competition was made up mostly of women ages 18 to 28. Because the applications weren't processed before the dance auditions started, \" the judges didn't even know kriste was 40 until she had made it through three rounds of cuts and revealed her age in the interview round, \" the director says. Lewis, who was a high school cheerleader and is currently a dance instructor, is one of just two nfl cheerleaders in her 40s; the other, laura vikmanis, is 45 and has been dancing with the cincinnati bengals ben-gals since age 40. Lewis ' first time performing with the 36-member squad will be aug. 15 at an exhibition game. \" it's a family, \" lewis says. \" it's like i have 35 little sisters. \" ( in less heartwarming news, click to see why one columnist thinks nfl cheerleaders really do have it bad. )",

        "summary": "The unlikely use of a compound in powdered booze could ultimately help save millions of people from heart disease — and it was the mother of twin girls with a rare genetic disorder who first pitched the idea to scientists. The compound is called beta-cyclodextrin, which is already approved by the fda and is widely used in medications and foods ( including powdered alcohol ), reports ars technica. It's long been seen as more of a \" carrier \" — it delivers other drugs and makes them more effective — but now it seems cyclodextrin itself is plenty potent, reports the wall street journal. Writing in the journal science translational medicine, researchers say it dissolved cholesterol crystals and plaque building up around the hearts of mice. \"this is a potentially promising therapeutic approach, \" says a michigan state university cardiologist not involved with the study. An unusual twist is that one of the co-authors listed is chris hempel, an american mom without formal medical training who suggested the heart disease study. She is the mother of twin daughters with a rare genetic disease called niemann-pick type c, or npc, often referred to as childhood alzheimer's. Cyclodextrin has shown promise in treating npc — it is currently being tested in clinical trials, thanks in large part to the advocacy of hempel and her husband, hugh — and chris hempel suggested to heart researchers that it might help on that front, too. The initial findings suggest her hunch was correct. More research is needed, but if further studies back up the results, cyclodextrin would be an improvement over the statins that don't always work on patients with clogged arteries, reports popular science.

        "summary": "Last month, doyle lee hamm walked out of an alabama execution chamber alive. On tuesday, the inmate's legal team said a private settlement had been reached to ensure the state won't try to execute hamm again. Hamm, sentenced to death for killing a motel clerk during a 1987 robbery, was scheduled for execution feb. 22; his death warrant expired at midnight. Alabama department of corrections officials said they called off the lethal injection execution because they didn't have enough time to prepare before the warrant expired, but hamm's legal team say officials actually did make multiple attempts to get an iv in him and ultimately failed. One of hamm's lawyers called it a \" gory, botched, \" and very bloody attempt to put the inmate to death, and his team says it left him in extreme pain and psychological distress and possibly suffering from an infection. The settlement puts an end to hamm's resulting lawsuit against the state. \" in a private, confidential settlement agreement that i signed with the attorneys from the alabama attorney general's office, we resolved all of our differences and have jointly dismissed all the state and federal litigation in doyle hamm's cases, \" hamm's attorney bernard harcourt said in a statement tuesday, according to the montgomery advertiser. Hamm's team argued in court that attempting to put him to death a second time would violate the fifth amendment's double jeopardy clause as well as the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The attorney general's office has not yet commented, but the advertiser notes that court documents show hamm's claim for monetary damages was dismissed. \" i will say that doyle, his family, and his legal team are extremely relieved, \" reads harcourt's statement, per the ap.",

        "summary": "The ability of earth's forests to stand up to droughts may be worse than previously believed. The washington post reports that many current scientific models assume trees recover immediately following a drought. But princeton's william anderegg demonstrated droughts actually have \" legacy effects \" on trees in a study published earlier this year. According to live science, anderegg explained the problem monday at the annual american geophysical union meeting. Trees have to work harder to suck up water during a drought; that creates air bubbles in the tree's vascular system that can lead to water- and nutrient-blocking embolisms. Anderegg's team found that droughts can continue to affect trees for up to four years after normal conditions return. During the years following a drought, trees are prevented from growing at their normal rates, possibly hurting the amount of carbon dioxide they pull out of the atmosphere, the post reports. Even worse, dead trees dump greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere, creating a feedback loop of more droughts and dead trees. While climate models suggest droughts will become more frequent and severe in the coming years, anderegg tells live science it's not too late to prevent the worst of it by reducing carbon emissions. \" the future of a lot of these forests really rests in our hands, \" he tells the post. \"the sooner and the more effectively we address climate change, the less risks forests will face. \" ( listen closely, and you can hear california's drought. )",

The un's preservation list now consists of 1,052 sites notable for their \" outstanding universal value, \" a prestigious list unesco has been adding to since 1978. Formerly known as the ahwar of southern iraq, the marshlands of mesopotamia actually comprise seven sub-sites — four wetland marsh areas and three archaeological sites that date back to the 3rd and 4th millennium bc. In spite of the unforgivingly hot and arid climate, the marshlands boast one of the largest inland delta systems in the world, reports the bbc, and are home to bird species that include the ibis as well as spawning grounds for many gulf fisheries. Reuters reports that after saddam hussein accused the region's marsh arabs of treachery during the war with iran in the 1980s, he intentionally dammed and drained the region, shrinking it from 3,500 square miles to just less than 300 square miles by 2002. Great conservation efforts have helped re-establish the area, but it is still considered to be on the brink as well as plagued by drug and weapons smuggling.

He said the system is designed to compensate for \" tragic human errors, \" like the one that caused the new york-miami train to slam into csx freight trains near cayce, sc, after it ended up on the wrong track early sunday. Congress required ptc to be installed on railroad mainlines by the end of 2015, but later changed the deadline to the end of this year, the federal railroad administration says.

The sources say four men walked into bulger's cell, where he was sitting in a wheelchair, and used a lock in a sock to beat him and a shiv to attempt the aforementioned two gruesome tasks. There was reportedly \" a lot of blood \" in bulger's mouth but it's unclear whether they succeeded. As relatives of bulger victims celebrated his death, questions were also raised about why he was transferred in the first place and why he was placed in the general population. Bulger, says his attorney, \" was sentenced to life in prison, but as a result of decisions by the federal bureau of prisons, that sentence has been changed to the death penalty. \" ( in a \" surreal \" case, a mob victim's body was found 23 years later. )",

It's true: the \" intelligent parking chair \" has motors and wheels in its circular base that sync with cameras placed in a room. When somebody claps, the chair navigates its way back to the proper location, reports jalopnik. ( watch the video here. ) it's also more of a publicity stunt than a new product: nissan is looking to generate publicity for its soon-to-be-unveiled technology for self-parking cars, notes engadget. At least 10 models will have some iteration of the tech by 2020. As a publicity stunt, however, it seems to be succeeding, because auto and tech blogs are picking up on the story. Carscoops, for instance, is intrigued: \" considering how seamlessly the chairs seem to work, we wouldn't be surprised to see a technology company try and make them a production reality. \" nissan teamed with an actual chair company, okamura, to create the seats, so that might not be too far-fetched.

The justice department later confirmed all seven plaintiffs who successfully argued president trump violated their right to free speech by blocking them on twitter had been unblocked following their court win two weeks ago, reports reuters. Still, it's apparently too soon for them to celebrate. Trump and white house social media director dan scavino are appealing the ruling that determined the blocking of people who addressed the presidential account was a constitutional violation, politico reports, citing notices filed by three doj officials on monday. Though the basis for the appeal wasn't made clear, doj attorney michael baer previously said \" it would send the first amendment deep into uncharted waters to hold that a president's choices about whom to follow, and whom to block, on twitter — a privately run website that, as a central feature of its social-media platform, enables all users to block particular individuals from viewing posts — violate the constitution, \" per politico. A lawyer representing the seven plaintiffs says she's \" disappointed that the government intends to appeal the district court's thoughtful and well-supported ruling, \" though she adds she's \" pleased \" to see blocked users regain their right to free speech. Among them: texas police officer brandon neely. \" i am back!!! \" he wrote to trump on monday.",

The teenagers, whose names were withheld to protect their privacy, were giving testimony at the trial of 15 crew members, who face charges ranging from homicide to negligence for abandoning the sinking ship. \" we were waiting and, when the water started coming in, the class rep told everyone to put on the life vests... The door was above our heads, so she said we ' ll float and go through the door and that's how we came out, \" one of the teenagers said. \" other kids who got out before us pulled us out. \" the ferry sewol sank on april 16, killing 304 people, as many as 250 of them school children on a field trip. Twelve of their teachers were also killed. The ferry was on a routine trip from the port of incheon south to jeju island, carrying students and teachers from",
            "Student survivors of south korea's ferry disaster testified at the murder trial of the captain and crew on monday how they were left to fend for themselves in the sinking vessel. One recalled orders for her and her classmates to stay put being relayed \" over and over, \" until the ferry had listed so far that the door to their cabin was above their heads. Another described watching a wave sweep her classmates back inside the sinking boat. The actual trial is taking place in the southern city of gwangju, but the judges and lawyers decamped to a court in ansan city, south of seoul, for a special two-day session with the 17 students who agreed to testify. Police cordons blocked public access to the district court as the students -- all from ansan's dawon high school -- arrived in a red mini-bus and were escorted into the building by a tight phalanx of police officers. Although they were offered the option of testifying by video from a nearby room, five of the six female students involved in monday's morning session chose to give their testimony in the courtroom.

That's because he makes much of the 23-mile journey on foot, resulting in a 21-mile round-trip walk every day, the detroit free press reports. His car broke down about a decade ago and he's been walking ever since, combining the slog with bus rides in the few areas where buses are available. Once he's worked from 2pm to 10pm, he heads home again in the dark, normally arriving around 4am. With some buses shut down for the day by that point, he walks a total of 13 miles, the free press notes. Faith and determination keep him going, he says. He was mugged once, his boss says, though robertson himself only mentions that he walks through some dangerous areas. But the many miles have their benefits: he loves his co-workers, and his boss's wife cooks him dinner every night. \" she takes care of james.

After nearly a year of debate between mark zuckerberg, internet activists, and software developers, india's telecom regulator ruled that no data service provider can offer a different price — even a price of zero. The ruling jibes with critics who say free basics violates the principle of \" net neutrality \" and provides a \" walled garden \" of internet access for the nation's poor. Indeed, free basics combines limited versions of services like facebook, job listings, weather reports, the bbc, and wikipedia, wired reports. But zuckerberg argues that free basics, used by millions worldwide, is about bringing more people online. \" we know that when people have access to the internet they also get access to jobs, education, healthcare, communication, \" he wrote in a times of india op-ed in december. \" we know that for every 10 people connected to the internet, roughly one is lifted out of poverty. \" he also says facebook doesn't profit because it places no ads in free basics. But vijay shekhar sharma, a software developer and fierce free basics critic, calls the service \" poor internet for poor people \" and compares it to british colonialism. \" india, do u buy into this baby internet? \" he tweeted in december. \" the east india company came with similar ' charity'to indians a few years back! \" facebook says it plans to continue its effort to bring millions more people in india online.",

As a result, \" there's no pacing … it's all sensation and no pulse, \" she writes at time. \" the movie's climax scratches at something close to melancholic grandeur, \" she continues. \" but it's way too little too late. \" todd mccarthy disagrees. \" the climax is startling in its gravity \" and an after-credits teaser \" amplifies the ending by serving up even more questions, \" he writes at the hollywood reporter. He was also impressed with josh brolin's performance in this \" densely packed superhero orgy. \" he gives villain thanos \" an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain. \"",

It's a worthwhile watch, though it doesn't quite achieve its goals: with \" elements of scorsese's grime and tarantino's wit, \" the film is \" nothing new, but it's smartly done, \" writes peter howell in the toronto star. It's \" a deeply cynical movie, with not much to say but a lot to feel. Everything sinks into your bones. \" the film offers an \" agreeably scuzzy, small-time feeling, \" notes ao scott in the new york times. But it's \" sapped of vitality by its own self-conscious, curatorial fastidiousness. It takes place entirely in a universe of tropes and archetypes, which is a polite way of saying clichés and pretensions. \" at salon, andrew o ' hehir didn't exactly \" enjoy \" the movie, but then, it's \" a deliberately chilly and nerve-wracking experience, and one of the bleakest portraits of american society seen on-screen in the last several decades, \" he writes. Indeed, it \" suffers from a nearly terminal case of undergraduate nihilist philosophy... Reaching for grand existential meaning and not quite getting there. \" at usa today, claudia puig is less equivocal, calling the film \" a stylish thriller worth seeing — despite its relentless violence — for its sharp dialogue, mesmerizing photography, and gritty performances. \"",

        "summary": "The un's global strategy for plant conservation program has set a 2020 deadline for conserving 75 % of the world's threatened plant species outside of their natural habitat. But, based on the results of a new study, the prospects of meeting that target aren't very good. According to a paper published earlier this month in nature plants, 36 % of \"critically endangered \" species produce recalcitrant seeds, meaning that they can't survive being dried out. And that means that they aren't candidates for the traditional seed banking process, phys.org reports. The study, performed by scientists affiliated with the royal botanic gardens, kew, also found that 35 % of \"vulnerable \" species and 27 % of \"endangered \" species generate seeds that cannot be banked using the common method of freezing them at about -4 degrees fahrenheit. Among them are trees such as oak, avocado, cacao, and mango. \"as successful as seed banking is for some species, it is not suitable for all seed plants and we need to invest in other ways to safeguard recalcitrant seeds, \" says study co-author john dickie, per earth.com. One of those other ways to preserve recalcitrant seeds may be cryopreservation, which involves removing the embryo from a seed and freezing it at about -320 degrees fahrenheit using liquid nitrogen. Per phys.org, kew has been using cryopreservation at its millennium seed bank for years and is planning to develop a protocol to \"kick-start large-scale use \" of the method. ( animal species aren't doing so well, either. )",

Cnbc reports that bill gates is on pace to become the planet's first trillionaire within the next quarter-century. This prediction is based on the latest oxfam report, \" an economy for the 99 %, \" which took gates ' current worth ( $ 84 billion or so, per forbes ) and number-crunched it using the average rate growth for the super-rich, which has been around 11 % a year for the past eight years. Using that formula, the 61-year-old microsoft co-founder would top the trillion mark right around his 86th birthday. \" in such an environment, if you are already rich, you have to try hard not to keep getting a lot richer, \" oxfam says. Gates has accumulated nearly $ 35 billion since he said goodbye to microsoft in 2006, and that's even with him doing whatever he can to dump his stash, both through his own foundation and via his participation in the giving pledge, an elite gathering of the richest folks in the world promising to dump the bulk of their wealth into philanthropic efforts. Other billionaires oxfam looked at could also join the trillionaires club going by that same rate, though it will take awhile longer: facebook's mark zuckerberg, now 32, could hit that benchmark when he's 59, for example. Warren buffett could get there in 25 years, but he's already 86 and would have to live to 111, per money. ( we call bill gates as our secret santa when he hits the big time. )",

There had been rumors in recent years of bobcat sightings, but the only previous evidence of their presence on the island was a photograph from the early 1900s showing bobcat pelts hanging in the island gamekeeper's cabin. \" they're such secretive animals, it could be this one and others have been out here for some time, \" the island's conservation director says. But while it's possible that the elusive animals could have been hiding out on the island for many years, the bobcat in the photos may be a young male looking for territory who swam to the island or walked up the 5-mile causeway, researchers wrote at jekyll island after the sightings this fall. Follow-up research that involved checking animal tracks around bait failed to produce any more evidence of bobcats, so researchers believe their numbers are very small and hope there's at least one breeding pair.

American and spanish researchers who studied the hands of chimps, orangutans, humans, as well as those of human ancestors and ancient apes, say a chimp's hands have evolved significantly since humans and chimps diverged on the evolutionary path some 7 million years ago. Initially displaying a long thumb and shorter fingers, chimp and orangutan fingers elongated to allow them to swing among the trees, reports afp. But human hands — with a long thumb for grasping objects — have changed little over millions of years, a nature study finds. When early humans \" started producing flaked stone tools in a systematic fashion, probably as early as 3.3 million years ago, their hands were — in terms of overall proportions — pretty much like ours today, \" explains study author and george washington university scientist sergio almécija. Almécija suggests the hands of early humans as far back as 6 million years ago may have been similar as well, science reports. The whole idea challenges the long-held view that our earliest ancestors had chimplike hands that evolved over time. \" the findings suggest that the structure of the modern human hand is largely primitive in nature, rather than, as some believe, the result of more recent changes necessary for stone tool-making, \" a university rep tells discovery news. Almécija adds the human changes that allowed for toolmaking likely occurred in the brain. So why were our ancestors capable of precision grasping if not to snatch up tools? almécija suggests the adaptation made them better at gathering foods. Humans apparently weren't the only ones to have that skill. The study suggests capuchins, baboons, and gorillas, developed a strong grip at the same time.

Accordingly, we queried our anthropoid sample ( see details of our sample in supplementary table 1 ) to see whether our ihp measure ( as revealed by the thumb-to-fourth ray ratio; fig. 1b ) was consistent with previous observations that humans can easily be distinguished from modern apes by a long thumb relative to the other digits4, 5, 14.

Many scientists have assumed that our hands evolved their distinctive proportions over millions of years of recent evolution. But a new study suggests a radically different conclusion: some aspects of the human hand are actually anatomically primitive — more so even than that of many other apes, including our evolutionary cousin the chimpanzee. The findings have important implications for the origins of human toolmaking, as well as for what the ancestor of both humans and chimps might have looked like. Humans",

The study, published in the latest issue of the journal nature communications, determined that while human hand proportions have changed little from those of the last common ancestor of chimps and humans, the hands of chimps and orangutans have evolved quite a bit. Prehistoric moms had their hands full: photos \"the findings suggest that the structure of the modern human hand is largely primitive in nature, rather than, as some believe, the result of",

Accordingly, we queried our anthropoid sample ( see details of our sample in supplementary table 1 ) to see whether our ihp measure ( as revealed by the thumb-to-fourth ray ratio; fig. 1b ) was consistent with previous observations that humans can easily be distinguished from modern apes by a long thumb relative to the other digits4, 5, 14.

Many scientists have assumed that our hands evolved their distinctive proportions over millions of years of recent evolution. But a new study suggests a radically different conclusion: some aspects of the human hand are actually anatomically primitive — more so even than that of many other apes, including our evolutionary cousin the chimpanzee. The findings have important implications for the origins of human toolmaking, as well as for what the ancestor of both humans and chimps might have looked like. Humans",

Jeremy made headlines back in may, when scientists at the university of nottingham put out a call for other left-curling snails who could act as potential mates for him. The trait is very rare, and jeremy's \" unusually-situated \" genitalia made it impossible for the lefty to match up with a typical right-curling snail's sex organs, npr reports. Two other lefties were found, but they ended up mating with each other instead. Fortunately, shortly before jeremy was found dead wednesday, he did end up procreating with one of the two. The pair mated three times and produced offspring, the scientists say, \" ensuring that [ jeremy's ] legacy will live on through continuing genetic studies into his rare mutation. \" however, none of jeremy's baby snails are left-coiling. \" the fact that the babies developed right-coiling shells may be because the mother carries both the dominant and recessive versions of the genes that determine shell-coiling direction, \" the scientists say, explaining that in snails, \" body asymmetry \" is determined by only the mother's genes. \" it is far more likely that left-coiling babies will be produced in the next generation or even the generation after that. \" research will continue; scientists have since located four more left-curling snails in spain. \" ultimately, we would like to know why these snails are so rare, but also how the left and right sides of the body are signalled at the molecular level, and whether a similar process is taking place during human development, \" one of the scientists says in a press release.

Published in law and human behavior, the study had 210 \" jury-eligible undergraduates \" learn about the real-life trial of a man who allegedly murdered his wife. Each then gave a preliminary verdict and swapped messages about it with others. But the messages were really scripted in advance, with four imaginary jurors agreeing and one holding out. That holdout — the only one whose gender was revealed — became angry or fearful and sometimes wrote in all caps.

Scott walker — who fought hard for the law — vowed to appeal and branded the judge a \" liberal activist, \" reports the ap. Walker accused colas of wanting \" to go backwards and take away the lawmaking responsibilities of the legislature and the governor. \" but lester pines, an attorney for wisconsin teachers, said the ruling forces cities, towns, and school districts in the state to once again bargain with public union employees. He said the supreme court will likely cast the final ruling, and \" what's going to happen in the interim is unknown. \" the law sparked a fiercely debated recall of gov. Walker, who not only held office but became america's first governor to win a recall election.",
