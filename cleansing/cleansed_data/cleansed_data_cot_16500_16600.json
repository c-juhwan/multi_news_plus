        "summary": "Looks like applephiles will soon have one more gadget to add to their collection of must-have gear. Two insiders tell bloomberg that a \" mini \" ipad is in the works, and should arrive by the end of this year. The planned tablet — intended to help battle competition from google, amazon, and microsoft — shrinks the screen from 9.7 inches diagonally to 7 or 8 inches, and will lack the top-notch display of its bigger cousin, according to those insiders. But it ' ll be cheaper and, likely, \" competitors ' worst nightmare, \" says an analyst. Another analyst tells cnet — which goes ahead and calls the tablet the ipad mini — that plans are firmly underway: \" there's a business plan for it, there's a mass production target for it, and we know that it's for apple. \" the smaller tablet would likely be priced somewhere near $ 199 to compete with google's nexus 7 and amazon's kindle fire. But consumers would likely be willing to pay a small premium for the apple version. \" fifty or a hundred bucks wouldn't be enough to make someone switch, \" the analyst adds. The plan does, however, seem to violate steve jobs ' vision: he believed the current ipad's size was the smallest that could satisfy users, notes bloomberg.",

        "summary": "Michigan has a bizarre political sex scandal on its hands. It seems that two conservative state lawmakers, todd courser and cindy gamrat, were having an affair, and they were worried it was about to go public, reports the detroit news. Simple enough. And then the bizarre part: in recordings obtained by the newspaper, courser asks one of his aides to anonymously distribute a fake email alleging that courser had been caught having sex with a man behind a nightclub, along with a slew of other false allegations. The idea, he said, was to create a \" controlled burn \" of lies so that when allegations of his extramarital affair went public, they wouldn't seem so bad — and people might not believe them. \" it will make anything else that comes out after that — that isn't a video — mundane, tame by comparison, \" courser is heard telling the aide. The email did indeed go out, but the aide, who made the secret recording, balked at sending it. He was fired soon after, as was one of gamrat's aides, for unspecified reasons. The two freshman lawmakers — who have loudly championed \" traditional marriage and traditional morality, \" notes the daily beast — are now under investigation by the state house to see whether they used their taxpayer-funded offices to try to conceal their relationship, reports the detroit free press.",

        "summary": "Parks and recreation put its last show in the books last night, and while we ' ll try to limit the big spoilers, anyone planning to catch up with leslie knope later should stop reading now. Generally speaking, critics were left feeling warm and fuzzy by the finale from amy poehler and crew, and the show's legacy in general: the office comparison: it's great parks went out after seven seasons, \" pretty close to the top of its game, \" writes margaret lyons at vulture. If only the office ( remember that parks began as a kind of clone of that show ) had done the same. Poehler's sitcom avoided the lows to which the office sometimes sank. \" parks might have had some narrative flabbiness in there over its run, but this last arc has been strong and, maybe more important, incredibly true to the show's best essential natures: smart and silly and gleeful. \" ' audacious ': \" almost aggressively devoid of broad humor, the super-sweet finale may have been the most audacious creative direction a series could've taken, \" writes kevin fallon at the daily beast. \" there were no ' events ' — a long-built-up-to wedding, for example — or wild, long-teased revelations — like how a guy met his kids ' mother.... Instead, we got an hour that simply let us know, with excessive positivity, that everyone was going to be ok. \" as for poehler and her memorable character: \" genius. \" but: parks \" isn't such a sweet show because it lives in a vacuum where nastiness, selfishness, and stupidity don't exist, as they more or less didn't in the finale, \" writes willa paskin at slate. \" it's such a sweet show because it exists exactly in the midst of such things and its characters try to rise above the muck and their own natures anyway, even when they don't succeed. The finale had no hint of that muck. Luckily, there are 123 other episodes of this great series to balance it out. \" never again: sadly, we won't see a show like parks again because its model — low-rated but critically acclaimed — is \" essentially extinct, \" writes emily yahr at the washington post. Networks wouldn't let a show like that survive today, even though it proves the point that \" sometimes, the non-hit tv shows are the ones that resonate the most. \"",

        "summary": "Two south korean soldiers maimed near the border with north korea last tuesday were victims of a north korean attack, officials say. The south korean defense ministry claims north korean soldiers crept across the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone to plant mines outside the south's guard post near paju, reports the new york times. A soldier lost both legs in an explosion involving two mines when he opened the gate of a barbed-wire fence, investigators say. A colleague triggered a second blast and lost a leg when he tried to help, reports cnn. Investigators say the land mines, which used wood boxes, were typical of those from the north and targeted the south's troops. Military officials tell reuters this is a \" cowardly act, which would be unthinkable for a normal military, \" and \" swear a severe retaliation. \" investigators believe the mines were planted between july 22 — when the gate was last used — and the day of the attack, the first of its kind in 48 years, south korean officials say. They find it especially concerning that the infiltrators went undetected, despite closed-circuit and heat-detecting cameras around posts; leafy forests may have shielded them from view. Though hundreds of thousands of land mines were planted around the demilitarized zone during and following the korean war, investigators confirm the ones that caused the recent blasts were newly planted. The south has now resumed broadcasting government messages up to 15 miles into the north via loudspeakers along the border; it had ended the practice a decade ago in an attempt to improve relations.",

Jerry brown goes along — a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, reports the los angeles times. Lawmakers narrowly approved the measure yesterday in the name of reducing litter on streets and beaches. It would apply to supermarkets next july and to convenience and liquor stories the following year. Customers would be able to pay a dime or so for a reusable plastic bag or a paper bag. Brown hasn't taken a position on the ban, which is generally opposed by republicans as a big-government move that would amount to a tax on shoppers, reports the wall street journal. And while brown has a long history of supporting green initiatives, this one is no slam dunk given that it's an election year, reports the sacramento bee. Some of california's biggest localities, including los angeles county and san francisco, already have such bans in place.",

        "summary": "The us forest service thinks it knows what caused the boulder-filled mudslide that surged down northern california's mt. Shasta on saturday: the golden state's extreme drought conditions. According to the la times, scientists think water gushed down from the konwakiton glacier, causing a mudslide that picked up increasing amounts of sediment and rocks before coming to a halt in shasta-trinity national forest early sunday morning. One resident who lives at the base of mt. Shasta tells the sacramento bee, \" i'd describe it as looking like chocolate pudding. It was just thick mud and boulders. \" this type of phenomenon, known as an outburst flood, can happen during hot, dry weather, when snow that usually buffers a glacier from the sun melts away. That leaves the glacier vulnerable to the sun's heat, a retired uc davis geologist tells the times. Water pools up under or on top of the glacier until it spews out all at once, \" almost like a cork in a bottle popping out suddenly, \" explains a forest service hydrologist. This type of glacial-melt flooding has occurred on mt. Shasta before: a 1924 mudslide smothered a swath of land 5 miles long, a mile wide, and 10 feet deep. No injuries or severe damage were reported in this weekend's event — but how do locals who live close to the seven glaciers on mt. Shasta feel about future possible outbursts? \" you just have to accept whatever's going to be; it's just that simple, \" one resident tells the record searchlight.

According to folklore, a family's seventh son in a row turns into a werewolf-like creature called a \" lobizon \" on his 13th birthday and feasts on the flesh of unbaptized babies and the recently dead every full moon. In the days when seventh sons were a lot more common, some were abandoned or even killed out of fear of the lobizon, and president cristina fernandez adopted yair tawil under a law that was brought in early last century to combat the superstition by having all seventh sons officially adopted by the president, according to the independent. Under the law, sons — and, since 1974, daughters — not only have the president as an official godparent, but receive a gold medal and a full scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday the law used to only apply to catholic children, and yair is the first jewish male adopted after a change to the law in 2009, reports the jewish telegraphic agency. The guardian, however, says the law and the tradition are unconnected to the lobizon legend, citing a local historian who says it began in 1907 with the son of volga german immigrants who wanted to maintain \" a custom from czarist russia, where the czar was said to become godfather to seventh sons. \" but there may have been some mixing of european and argentinian werewolf legends: according to records from the state where the 1907 adoption took place, the couple \" brought the belief that the seventh son becomes a werewolf at the full moon. \" ( scientists say the full moon does actually take a toll on us. )",

It's so common and hard to avoid that the fda sets allowable levels, notes the american council on science and health. It's no surprise, then, that stink bugs, which have a fondness for grapes, can end up in wine. The problem, however, is that the bugs release an odor when under stress — like when they're about to be smushed by a wine press — and that can result in stink-bug-flavored vino. Think cilantro. Now for the first time, researchers are zeroing in on exactly how many stink bugs it takes to taint a batch, per the journal of agricultural and food chemistry. Their conclusion: three stink bugs per grape cluster remain largely undetected in the final product, notes a post at eureka alert. One quirky finding: white wine is unaffected, but red wine, especially pinot noir, is vulnerable to the bugs ' offending compound, called trans-2-decenal ( t2d ). Another factor is that some of the tasters in the study actually liked wine with a hint of t2d, while others found it just awful. The acsh post notes that t2d is in cilantro, and cilantro has the same kind of love/hate following. The bugs, more formally called brown marmorated stink bugs, aren't native to the us and are believed to have hitched a ride to north america from asia. ( some suggest vacuuming stink bugs up. )",

            "To wine makers, stink bugs are more than a nuisance. These tiny pests can hitch rides on grapes going through the wine making process, releasing stress compounds that can foul the smell and taste of the finished product. Now, in a study published in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry, scientists report the threshold of stink bugs per grape cluster that will impact the integrity of the wine. In vineyards, brown marmorated stink bugs feed on grapes, reducing their yield and quality. And because they are small and blend in, the insects hitchhike on the grapes and wind up in the winery, giving off stress compounds that sometimes affecting the quality of the wine and juice. Pesticides used in the vineyard are not completely effective, so attention is being focused on ways to reduce the presence of the insects in wineries post-harvest.

            "To wine makers, stink bugs are more than a nuisance. These tiny pests can hitch rides on grapes going through the wine making process, releasing stress compounds that can foul the smell and taste of the finished product. Now, in a study published in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry, scientists report the threshold of stink bugs per grape cluster that will impact the integrity of the wine. In vineyards, brown marmorated stink bugs feed on grapes, reducing their yield and quality. And because they are small and blend in, the insects hitchhike on the grapes and wind up in the winery, giving off stress compounds that sometimes affecting the quality of the wine and juice. Pesticides used in the vineyard are not completely effective, so attention is being focused on ways to reduce the presence of the insects in wineries post-harvest.

Researchers who analyzed coast guard data going back to 1900 found that 1912 had a relatively large but by no means exceptional number of icebergs drifting south across the 48th parallel, the bbc reports — and as greenland warms up, recent years have seen more icebergs than 1912. Some 1,038 icebergs crossed the parallel in 1912, but there were at least four other years between 1901 and 1920 when 700 or more moved south — and 1909 actually saw a higher number of icebergs, 1,041. \" this really refutes the arguments that have been around about things like high tides or sunspots generating excessive numbers of icebergs in that year, \" the lead researcher tells livescience. Using computer models, the researchers also determined that the iceberg that sank the titanic probably broke off from southern greenland in the late summer of 1911, starting out 1,640 feet wide and 985 feet tall and shrinking to around 325 feet wide by the time it hit the \" unsinkable \" ship in april the next year.

        "summary": "The eastern cougar no longer needs to be on a list of protected animals because it was killed off more than 70 years ago, the us fish and wildlife service says. The agency now proposes shifting the subspecies from the endangered list to the extinct list, livescience reports. The fws, which consulted experts in 21 states and several eastern canadian provinces and pored over more than 100 reports dating to 1900, says the proposal to change the cougar's status will be available for public comment until august 17. The last eastern cougar on record was killed in maine in 1938, and while there have definitely been cougars spotted in the east since then, the fws determined they were either florida panthers or western cougars that escaped from zoos or wandered east — like one that was shot in kentucky last fall. A spokesman for the center for biological diversity tells the ap that the extinction of the eastern cougar should be a \" somber moment to think about what the land under our feet used to be like, and what roamed here. \" what happened between then and now? the fws explains that the bulk of the population is thought to have been killed off in the 19th century, as immigrants cleared large forests and killed the animal out of fears it would attack growing livestock populations; at the same time, the cougar's chief prey, the white-tailed deer, was largely wiped out. Of course, the ap notes that some researchers believe the eastern cougars may not have been a distinct subspecies at all.

            "Seattle ( cnn ) an unruly passenger who authorities say was trying to open an exit door on a delta air lines flight to beijing fought with the cabin crew and a passenger and was conked over the head by a flight attendant with two wine bottles, a criminal complaint alleges. Joseph daniel hudek iv, a 23-year-old passenger from florida, was arrested after the plane returned to seattle-tacoma international airport, fbi spokeswoman ayn dietrich-williams said. The suspect made an initial appearance in federal court friday in seattle, hearing the criminal complaint of one count of interfering with a flight crew. That carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $ 250,000. A delta air lines flight from seattle to beijing turned back after takeoff thursday evening after a passenger assaulted a flight-crew member -- an incident that left both people and another passenger injured -- fbi and airport representatives said. The battle in the galley near the cockpit of delta flight 129, which was headed to beijing with 210 passengers and 11 crew aboard, began as the airliner cruised near canada's western coast about an hour into the flight. According to a criminal complaint released friday, hudek -- who was traveling in first class on a dependent travel pass, a perk afforded to family members employed by the airline -- attempted to open the forward exit door on the right side of the airliner. Two flight attendants tried to subdue hudek but were pushed away, and he continued his attempt to open the door. According to the complaint, hudek was able to move the door handle mechanism and push the emergency release lever halfway. Aircraft cabin doors cannot be opened at high altitudes because of the differing pressures inside and outside the jet's cabin, and the delta plane was cruising at high altitude, at 32,000 feet, when the incident happened. However, at a lower altitude, according to the complaint, it was possible the door might open. The flight attendants then signaled to passengers they needed help. During the altercation, hudek punched a flight attendant twice in the face and hit another assisting passenger with a bottle of wine. Hudek then attempted again to open the exit door. As the struggle continued, another flight attendant grabbed two wine bottles and struck hudek in the head, breaking one. \" hudek did not seem impacted by the breaking of a full-liter red wine bottle over his head, and instead, shouted'do you know who i am? \" or something to that extent, \" according to the complaint.

The idea may date back to psychologist william james, who wrote in 1907 that we use \" only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources, \" and a foreword to dale carnegie's how to win friends and influence people that loosely quoted james as saying that \" the average person develops only 10 % of his latent mental ability. \" now, products exist to \" unlock the other 90 % \" and a new thriller, lucy, shows scarlett johansson taking drugs that enable her to use all 100 % of her brain. But, as the atlantic reports, scientists point out that the brain is an organ packed with living neurons that are always up to something. Brain scans that show only a small active portion of gray matter \" lighting up \" may confuse people, one neuroscience professor points out, because they show only the brain's major activities, not all of them. Yet \" those kinds of ideas self-perpetuate, \" he says. One possible basis for the 10 % notion: the brain has almost 100 billion neurons, which are outnumbered roughly 10: 1 by \" glial \" cells that keep the brain working. \" in other words, \" the conversation notes, \" neurons are only 10 % of our entire brain. \" ( see how lack of sleep can fry brain cells. )",

Its creator, novartis, is one of numerous companies that have been researching gene therapies for years. The firm is working on similar treatments for other kinds of cancer.

One woman tells the huff post that in 2007, during franken's first senate campaign, he grabbed her buttocks during a photo-op after she sang with a feminist choir at a women's political caucus event in minneapolis that franken attended with his wife. She says her story is \" eerily similar \" to that of lindsay menz, who says franken groped her in 2010. Her best friend says the woman told her about the incident at the time and decided to come forward now because franken is \" a serial groper. \" \" people are saying that this is a right-wing conspiracy, \" she says. \" it's not. I ' m a liberal person. \" another woman tells the huff post that she was disgusted and disappointed after franken put his arm around her waist and \" cupped her butt \" during a democratic fundraiser in minneapolis in 2008. She says she excused herself to go to the bathroom, and franken suggested he go with her. \" it's difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and i don't remember those campaign events, \" franken said in a statement wednesday, per the minneapolis star tribune. He added: \" i can categorically say that i did not proposition anyone to join me in any bathroom. \" in a politico poll taken when leanne tweeden was the only woman to come forward, 49 % of democrats and 56 % of republicans said they thought franken should resign.

            "Winter is coming … back. Walt disney animation studios is returning to the world of frozen by featuring anna, elsa, kristoff, and the warmth-craving snowman olaf in a new short film. Frozen fever, due in spring 2015, will take place on anna's birthday as kristoff the reindeer-preferring ice-gatherer and the mystical, chill-inducing elsa try to stage a royal celebration. Although elsa's icy powers are no longer a secret in the kingdom, her control of them is still a bit iffy. ( let's just hope they decided to go with an ice cream cake. ) the short will reunite the key forces from the original film: directors chris buck and jennifer lee, as well as producer peter del vecho, and oscar-winning \"let it go \" songwriters robert lopez and kristen anderson-lopez. The film, which also won the academy award for animated feature last year, has been a staggering success — earning $ 1.27 billion worldwide to rank as the most successful animated film of all time.

The charred flight-data recorder was found embedded 8 inches in the ground by an officer who was digging by hand in an already-searched ravine. Experts at the french air accident investigation agency say the recorder reveals co-pilot andreas lubitz sped up the plane's descent, reports cnn. \" a first reading shows that this pilot in the cockpit used the autopilot to engage the aircraft down to an altitude of 100 feet, and on several occasions during the descent, the pilot changed the driver setting automatically to increase the speed of the plane descending, \" the agency says. Experts will continue examining the black box, which is said to hold 500 flight records on things like air speed and altitude, the los angeles times reports. French investigators have also discovered and examined 2,854 body parts and say they belong to all 150 people on the flight, the ap reports. But investigators caution matching the parts to dna samples will take some time. Meanwhile, a flight magazine column written by emirates pilot jan cocheret two months before the crash is getting a lot of attention as it touches on the same security issues seemingly exploited by lubitz, the daily express reports. Cocheret described how a pilot could easily lock a colleague out of the cockpit and how medical assessors can't always determine a person's mental fitness. \" i seriously sometimes wonder who's sitting next to me in the cockpit, \" he wrote. \" i hope i never discover what i would be faced with after visiting the toilet and finding a cockpit door that never opened. \" ( lubitz's browser search history reveals he researched cockpit door security. )",

As irma was closing in on tuesday, virgin group ceo richard branson declared he would hunker down on his private island, the telegraph reports. \" i will be on necker alongside our team, as i have been on the three times we have had hurricanes over the past 30 years, \" branson writes on his blog. The thrill-seeking exec notes, per the mirror, that while past hurricanes have skirted the british virgin islands, \" this one is coming straight for us, with the eye of the storm heading straight for necker. \" but other \" lovely guests \" staying on the island west of puerto rico weren't so bold, he says, bailing before the category 5 storm hit. Another group postponed their visit to the balinese-style resort, where several houses sleeping up to 34 people rent for $ 80,000 a night, per the telegraph. Necker's \" really strong \" buildings with hurricane blinds \" should be able to handle extreme weather pretty well, \" branson writes, while urging less well-off islanders to prepare ahead of 185mph winds and not shrug off emergency shelters. Noting the devastating toll wrought by harvey, branson calls climate change \" a key factor in the increasing intensity \" of the latest storms. \" if irma is any indication, we must brace ourselves for more of these catastrophic weather events. \" he adds, \" how much cheaper and smarter to support the paris agreement and move to clean energy? \" ( irma is so strong that earthquake detectors are going off. )",

Had the acid worked, the study would have been written off due to population size, the beagle freedom project maintains. At its completion, the animals were killed and their eyes removed and filed; the dog advocates say the animals should have been turned over for adoption. A rep for the university says in a statement, \" since dogs share similar eye characteristics with people, they are ideal candidates for corneal studies...

            "Six puppies were blinded for a university of missouri-columbia study, and then killed after the results were inconclusive. In a study published on april 7, four researchers at the university were looking to find the effects of topical hyaluronic acid to heal eye damage in dogs for its pilot study. After the six beagles — all less than a year old — were purposely blinded in their left eyes, the researchers split them up into two different groups, one that received the acid for treatment, and one that didn't. Neither group of the puppies in the experiment recovered from the severe damage to their eye.

The university has defended its study, telling the daily news that animal research was necessary to find answers to \"some of the most important medical questions. \" \"since dogs share similar eye characteristics with people, they are ideal candidates for corneal studies, \" mary jo banken, a spokeswoman with the school, said in a statement.

        "summary": "Federal reserve chairman jerome powell cast a bright picture of the us economy wednesday and appeared to suggest that the fed might consider a pause in its interest rate hikes next year to assess the impact of its credit tightening. Powell's comments ignited a rally on wall street, with the dow surging more than 200 points after his remarks were released; it's up nearly 500 points as of this writing. Referring to the fed's gradual increases in its benchmark rate, powell said, \" there is no preset policy path. \" rather, he said, the fed will assess the most recent economic and financial data in deciding whether or how fast to keep raising rates. The fed has raised its benchmark short-term rate, now in a range of 2 % to 2.25 %, three times this year and is expected to do so again next month, reports the ap. The chairman also suggested that interest rates appear to be just below the level the fed calls \" neutral, \" where they are thought to neither stimulate growth nor impede it. That contrasted with a remark powell made in october that the fed's policy rate was still well below neutral. That remark had unsettled investors who feared it signaled that the fed would continue raising rates well into the coming months. Speaking to the economic club of new york, the fed chairman also said that while some corporate debt loads have reached riskier levels, \" we do not see dangerous excesses in the stock market. \" he added that the fed regards no major asset class as significantly inflated, \" as some did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom. \" ( trump wasn't too pleased with powell yesterday, though. )",

Even he thought it seemed a \" bit high \" for the 489-pound fish — about $ 3,600 a pound — now destined for sushi and sashimi plates. The auction helps kick off the new year, and the high prices are more publicity stunt than an indication of quality fish, explains the ap. Meanwhile, the pew environmental group is coming out with numbers on monday that will show a continued sharp decline in bluefin stocks. \" everything we're hearing is that there's no good news for the pacific bluefin, \" says a group member. \" we're seeing a very high-value fish continue to be overfished. \"",

        "summary": "One of the largest for-profit college chains in the us was shuttered in 1994 after federal investigations revealed it had defrauded thousands of students by falsely certifying them for federal loans. Ever since, the us government has been collecting on federal student loan debt left behind by students of wilfred american educational corporation. For evelyn rivera, who recalls seeing her $ 2,000 investment vanish when her wilfred school closed in the 1990s, that's meant watching her debt balloon to $ 45,000, reports the new york times. But finally, students like rivera are getting relief. A settlement reached tuesday means the government will allow 60,000 former wilfred students to petition to cancel debt from federal loans taken out between 1986 and 1994. Students will also be eligible to receive refunds for previous payments under the settlement, which resolves a 2014 class-action lawsuit from former wilfred students that accused the government of collecting on loans it knew should've been forgiven under a 1992 federal law. That law applies in cases in which schools falsely certified students as eligible for loans. While rivera previously filed for loan forgiveness, she was one of only 100 wilfred students to do so. Most others likely weren't aware loan forgiveness was available, reports the times. Under the settlement, which bloomberg previously reported was in the works, the department of education is now required to notify former students of assistance and suspend loan collection while the proper applications are filed.",

Though thousands of students who took out federal loans from 1986 to 1994 to attend wilfred are eligible for loan forgiveness, only about 100 applied through the new york legal assistance group. Evelyn rivera, 48, was one of them.

Sage, 12, who lost her sight to glaucoma, was mistakenly left outside on the night of feb. 24 and wandered into woods frequented by mountain lions. Owner beth cole says family and friends searched the rough terrain day and night for a week; not even a professional dog tracker could find her, reports kpix. On the eighth day, hopelessness was setting in. Then her boulder creek, calif., neighbor dan estrada went on a walk with a friend and saw what looked to be a trash bag in a stream — and realized it was sage. \" i was overwhelmed with sadness because i knew at that point that it would be a body recovery, \" says the firefighter/paramedic. But estrada tells the santa cruz sentinel he noted some movement in response to the noise of his own two dogs, and when he jumped in the water and embraced sage, she lifted her head. He carried her over his shoulders out of the canyon and to his car, and perhaps not a moment too soon: after a dry week, rain was coming, and estrada says he found sage with her chin just above the water. Once the rains hit, he doesn't think she would have had the energy to lift her head out of the higher waters. Cole isn't the only one who's joyful: \" since she's returned home people have been bringing by snacks for her; one neighbor cooked her a steak, \" she tells the sentinel. Estrada refused the $ 1,000 reward for himself, instead asking that it go to an animal group, reports ksbw. ( this might be the biggest dog sanctuary in the world. )",

After he was contacted by the doe network, a volunteer group that investigates cold missing-person cases, indiana state police detective sergeant scott jarvis managed to find lula ann gillespie-miller in a small town in south texas, kwqc reports. In 1974, gillespie-miller, then 28, disappeared soon after giving birth to her third child. She told her family she was too young to be a mother, signed the children over to her parents, and wasn't heard from again, apart from a letter in 1975. Jarvis, with the help of the 1975 letter, was able to follow gillespie-miller's trail from indiana to tennessee to texas. He contacted texas rangers, who went to her home and confirmed that the 69-year-old is the woman who disappeared decades ago, nbc reports. Police say she didn't explain why she left her family behind in indiana, but she agreed to have her contact information passed to her daughter, tammy. Thanks to jarvis ' hard work, \" this easter weekend, tammy miller hopes to make contact with the mother she has never known, \" police said in a statement.

Keith jean fled into the sewer system in newark, nj, two weeks ago after swimming across the passaic river to get away from police, and there's been no sign of him since either inside or outside the sewer system, nj advance media reports. The chances of the 31-year-old having created a penguin-style crime lair down there are slim: officials say the outflow pipe he entered leads to a network of cramped chambers where he would find potentially deadly gases, and to a main tunnel where there's a constant flow of human waste from newark and 47 other northern new jersey communities. Robots have searched the tunnels, and cadaver dogs have sniffed sewer grates, but they haven't found traces of jean, alive or dead. Cops say he was a passenger in a car stopped for suspicious activity near a parking lot where there had been reports of car break-ins, the jersey journal reports. After he fled, they discovered there were warrants out for his arrest in two new jersey counties. Manholes were staked out after he fled into the sewer, but police believe he may still have been able to slip away. \" with any luck, he just got out, \" says the executive director of the passaic valley sewerage commission, though he notes that a dead body probably wouldn't disrupt the flow of sewage.",

            "Columbus, ohio ( ap ) — the state can try again to put to death a condemned killer whose 2009 botched execution was called off after two hours, the ohio supreme court said wednesday. The court by a 4-3 vote rejected arguments by death row inmate romell broom, whose attorneys said giving the state prisons agency a second chance would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy. Prosecutors had argued double jeopardy doesn't apply because lethal drugs never entered broom's veins while executioners unsuccessfully tried to hook up an iv. They also said a previously unsuccessful execution attempt doesn't affect the constitutionality of his death sentence. Justice judith ann lanzinger sided with the state, saying the execution never began because the drugs were never administered. \" because broom's life was never at risk since the drugs were not introduced, and because the state is committed to carrying out executions in a constitutional manner, we do not believe that it would shock the public's conscience to allow the state to carry out broom's execution, \" lanzinger wrote. The majority opinion said it was unclear why broom's veins couldn't be accessed, a fact that brings the rejection of his appeal into question, justice judi french wrote in a dissent. \" if the state cannot explain why the broom execution went wrong, then the state cannot guarantee that the outcome will be different next time, \" french wrote. Broom was sentenced to die for raping and killing 14-year-old tryna middleton after abducting her in cleveland in 1984 as she walked home from a friday night football game with two friends. His 2009 execution was stopped by then-gov. Ted strickland after an execution team tried for two hours to find a suitable vein. Broom has said he was stuck with needles at least 18 times, with pain so intense he cried and screamed.

        "summary": "Authorities hunting the suspected mole who brought down the cia's spy network in china lured him back to america by creating a job for the former cia officer, officials say. Federal officials tell nbc that when jerry chun shing lee returned to the us from hong kong with his family in 2012 to take up the job in the washington, dc, area, fbi agents secretly searched his hotel rooms and found evidence including a notebook with the real names of covert cia informants in china and details of meetings with undercover agents — information he was supposed to have surrendered when he left the agency in 2007. Lee was interviewed by agents repeatedly over the next few months but was allowed to return to hong kong in 2013. He is blamed for the killing or capture of around 20 agents. Lee was not immediately a suspect when cia agents in china began disappearing in 2010, but a task force eventually identified him as somebody who knew the identities of many of the agents who had been killed or jailed, the new york times reports. Some investigators, however, thought china had cracked the cia's code, or that agents had been too sloppy. Officials say the disappearances ended in 2012, meaning the decision to let him leave the us in 2013 did not cost more lives. Lee kept a low profile in hong kong, where he worked providing security for christie's auction house, the south china morning post reports. He was arrested after arriving at new york's jfk airport on monday. Officials say prosecutors moved quickly to file charges after he surprised them by booking a trip to the us.",

Christie's has suspended lee. He had kept a low profile while in hong kong. Lee was known to few people in the city and had virtually no digital footprint. However, a hong kong website named \"the value \" posted photographs of him online. The images showed him standing in a salesroom wearing a blue suit and an earpiece with the company's name in the background. The post independently verified the identity of the man in the photos. A security source confirmed it was lee. He was described on the website as \"strongly built \", \"nice \" and someone who would respond politely even when dealing with awkward people.

The committee will vote on the bill at 2: 15pm, reports politico, and it's expected to have no trouble passing. The compromise bill whittles down the congressional review period: instead of 60 days, there would be a 30-day initial review, plus up to another 22 days, which the times reports would be divided as follows: 12 days for obama to decide whether to veto \" a resolution of disapproval \" should that occur, and 10 days for congress to decide whether to override his veto. Final agreement on an iran deal is slated to come by june 30, but if the deal is submitted to congress after july 9, then the review period would balloon to 60 days.",

Here's how it went down, according to tmz and several other sources: on friday, dad michael showed up at her house with a few other people in an attempt to stage an intervention, partially because she's apparently been missing work lately. After someone claiming to be lilo's boyfriend made michael and his cohorts leave, someone called the police to report trespassing and they showed up at lohan's house. Tmz has a series of emails that, the gossip site says, prove lindsay's entire team was on board with the intervention — including her lawyers and her manager. In the emails, michael accuses lindsay of \" drinking between a bottle and a bottle and a half of vodka per day, \" including during work, and of using pills and cocaine. Now lilo wants an order of protection against her dad to keep him away from her. But michael appears to be undaunted — he plans to try getting lindsay placed under a conservatorship a la britney spears, tmz reports. One difference: daddy dearest doesn't actually want to act as conservator. He ' ll let a judge decide who it is, as long as it's not mom dina. Speaking of dina, she's predictably unhappy with all this. \" this sole act by my ex was not an intervention, nor was this extreme antic sanctioned by any member of lindsay's family or her professional team of handlers, \" she tells tmz. \" it's all about her father obsessed with making a name for himself in the news once again. \" lindsay's siblings michael jr., ali, and cody also talked to tmz, calling their father a liar.

It's actually quite easy for a professional musician to spot lip-syncing, he explains. There are a number of clues ( mouths lagging behind words, a too-perfect-sounding vocal ) that give it away. Similarly, there was a bunch of evidence during beyoncé's performance that she was singing live. There were the \" barely audible \" first few words, some distortion on the mic, and yes, even that moment when she took out her earpiece. There are any number of reasons she might have done that, but none of them proves she was lip-syncing, doughty writes. But perhaps the most telling piece of evidence that beyoncé was singing live was \" the hell yes smile on joe biden's face, \" doughty concludes. \" now, that is, clearly, a dude standing two feet from an electrifying lady singing like a motherfucker. \" click for all the technical reasons behind doughty's argument. As for the official word on the matter, there are still many conflicting reports.",

But sources say portuguese police have searched the area before, and locals don't seem convinced the new investigation will do much good: graffiti reading \" polícia inglesa estupidos, \" or \" stupid english police, \" was written on a wall across from the site, and one local handyman says all the investigators will find are \" bones from buried horses and donkeys. \" in the meantime, several suspects are due to be questioned.",

A fellow monk bringing food to walke witnessed the attack and ran for help, but returned with others to find the monk dead. The bbc describes the meditation spot as \"quite far away \" from the temple, which is surrounded by solar fencing to deter predators like tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and hyenas.

            "× william jackson dr. William jackson began his career as a family doctor and anesthesiologist in the beautiful ojai, california valley. Many years later, he was voted utah doctor of the year. Always one to put the needs of others before his own, dr. Jackson, along with his wife audrey, willingly accepted a call to serve the people of the philippines on a humanitarian mission in 1986. While there, the plight of a young filipino girl would forever alter the trajectory of dr. Jackson's life. The girl had a small growth on her tongue that, with time, had grown so large she struggled to eat. Knowing she would die if someone did not intervene, dr. Jackson arranged for a simple, yet life-saving procedure. This one charitable act prompting the jacksons'desire to bring basic medical care to children in need, later spiraled into trying to eliminate unnecessary blindness throughout the world. Often accompanied by their six children, the jacksons have traveled the world. Dr. Jackson loves to immerse himself in the local culture, especially the cuisine. A crossword puzzle enthusiast, ardent family man, and eternal optimist, dr. Jackson is best described as sunny, not saccharine. His can-do spirit transformed a dream into the reality of charity vision.",

        "summary": "President trump's new tough-on-canada stance is causing headaches for industries on both sides of the border and could end up hurting american homebuyers, analysts say. The president slapped new tariffs of up to 24 % on canadian lumber imports this week and while this will give american producers a boost, the national association of home builders estimates it will add more than $ 1,200 to the price of new homes as builders pass higher costs on to buyers, cnbc reports. Lumber costs have already gone up more than 20 % this year, partly in anticipation of trump taking a hardline stance on trade with canada. The lumber tariff follows trump's complaint about \" unfair \" canadian dairy farmers last week. Prime minister justin trudeau warned tuesday that you \" cannot thicken this border without hurting people on both sides of it, \" while trump said \" canada's been very rough on the united states, \" the ap reports. \" i love canada, \" trump said. \" but they've outsmarted our politicians for many years. \" the white house says trump had an \" amicable \" conversation with trudeau later in the day. Canada has vowed to fight the \" unfair \" lumber tariff, and former us ambassador to canada bruce heyman tells bloomberg that the public nature of trump's comments is not helping the situation. \" it's just a huge mistake, to take your best friend and next door neighbor and start poking at them really hard, \" he says.",

Deadline reports the film studio nabbed the rights to maysh's story over warner bros., universal, and netflix, and two big names are tied to the project: ben affleck in the director's chair and matt damon in a starring role. Deadpool writers paul wernick and rhett reese are set to put together the screenplay. Maysh's article details the eventually uncovered scandal of how a former cop stole game pieces in the well-known mcdonald's contest and, with the help of a laundry list of seedy accomplices, swindled $ 24 million. The hollywood reporter notes the last film under affleck's directorial domain was the crime drama live by night in 2016.

Reaction online includes a lot of eye-rolling, including one commenter who calls the church's pokémon appropriation \" desperate. \" at least one person, meanwhile, wants to settle the unpleasantness in a commonsense way: a pokémon battle.

        "summary": "Scientists have long puzzled over how the ancient egyptians built the great pyramid of giza ( aka the pyramid of khufu ) with such \" extreme precision, \" per live science. This wonder of the world is lined up with the compass points \" with an accuracy of better than four minutes of arc, or 1/15th of one degree, \" archaeologist glen dash writes in the journal of ancient egyptian architecture — an accuracy sciencealert says one \" wouldn't expect to see from an era without drones, blueprints, and computers. \" however, dash notes a \" straightforward \" method that's been \" largely ignored, \" theorizing the egyptians may have used the equinoctial solar gnomon technique, which involves placing a vertical rod called a gnomon into the ground and using it as a sundial of sorts. Dash speculates the builders tracked the rod's shadows on the fall equinox, when the lengths of night and day are as close to equal as they get, to achieve nearly perfect north-south-east-west alignment. After erecting a wooden platform complete with gnomon in his own connecticut yard on sept. 22, 2016, dash found that the tip of the shadow cast by the rod fell in an almost perfect east-west line, with just a tiny counterclockwise adjustment. That matches up to the error not only of the great pyramid, but also of the nearby khafre pyramid and dahshur's red pyramid, suggesting they were all built using the same method. Dash can't say for certain this is how the ancient egyptians set the structures up — no records exist to confirm any building processes, and other theories have been suggested that use the stars or sun for alignment — but he says it's possible if they just had the equipment and a \" clear, sunny day. \" \" it is hard to imagine a method that could be simpler, either conceptually or in practice, \" he notes.
